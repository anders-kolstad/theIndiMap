AB  - Antioxidant defences are the primary mechanisms by which organisms compensate oxidative damage caused by contact with several types of substances prone to establish oxidative cycles. Biomarkers are one of the most useful tools to assess effects consequent to environmental exposure to a large number of xenobiotics. However, the use of biomarkers requires previous standardization of enzymatic protocols in order to guarantee accuracy and relevance of obtained results. This article describes standardized conditions for the use of several enzymatic biomarkers (oxidative stress: glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase; respiration: lactate dehydrogenase) for the evaluation of responses of specimens of Eisenia andrei, Pelophylax perezi (formerly Rana perezi) and Apodemus sylvaticus. Furthermore, we also present the normal values of activity for the given markers, for non-exposed organisms, that can serve as comparative indexes for subsequent studies. We conclude that these species are thus a suitable target to serve as sentinels in studies of environmental contamination by chemicals, which can lead to oxidative and physiological modifications.

AB  - We propose a rapid sampling method to assess the functional composition of herbaceous plant communities without prior knowledge of the floristic composition. To determine the community-level value of traits ('aggregated trait values') for a plant community, a standardized population-centred method exists, but requires substantial manpower and reliable botanical knowledge. We tested an alternative method, the trait transect, using four subalpine pastures in the Beaufortain region (Northern French Alps) selected along a fertility gradient. We applied both methods to measure five commonly used 'soft traits' known to be responsive to soil nutrient availability: plant vegetative and reproductive height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter and nitrogen contents. We tested whether the variation of these traits along the gradient detected with the population-centred method was also detected with the trait transect. Both methods detected expected trends in the traits in response to the fertility gradient. The trait transect method was as efficient as the population-centred method and is recommended as an appropriate tool for monitoring ecosystem changes in response to environmental conditions and management, especially in species-rich communities.

AB  - We used microfossils preserved in salt-marsh peat to understand the landscape processes (both natural and anthropogenic) that have influenced the environment. Variations in the abundance of fossil pollen of native species suggest that the vegetation of this small, exposed island has been dominated by low, shrubby vegetation since before the arrival of Europeans in the early 1600s. Increases in non-native species since that time may reflect disturbance of the soil associated with grazing and other activities. Sorrel (Rumex) pollen, which indicates local grazing, declines by the late 19(th) century, whereas Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae pollen, an indicator of disturbed soil, is most abundant since 1900. Charcoal abundance shows that fires, probably ignited by humans both before and after 1600 A.D., have burned on the island throughout the last 1000 years. In addition, increases in soot and opaque spherules in sediments reflect increased air pollution during the last 100 years. Our analyses provide benchmarks for modern management by documenting pre-European conditions as well as the extent to which the modern environment differs from that prior to the settlement of Massachusetts Bay by Europeans.

AB  - DNA transformation of forest tree species is now a striking reality and offers the possibility to generate transgenic trees with useful new characteristics. However, it is important to make the proper environmental assessment of these transgenic trees when established in field trials. For instance, the DNA released into the soil by decaying leaves and roots from the transgenic trees may become available for incorporation by soil microbes. The objective of this study was to investigate the persistence of recombinant plant marker genes in decomposing transgenic poplar leaf material. We studied the stability of the DNA encoding the neomycin phosphotransferase II resistance marker used in tree genetic engineering. DNA persistence in the environment was determined by placing transgenic poplar leaves in permeable bags that were located on weeds, on the soil, and below the soil and left under natural conditions on the site of a field trial for up to 12 months. This work is the first quantitative analysis of tree DNA stability in a natural forest environment. Our data indicate that fragments of the genetically modified DNA are not detectable in the field for more than 4 months.

AB  - The porphyrin content and composition in the extractable organic matter has been analysed in 13 Kimmeridge clay source rocks, spread from the north to the south of the Norwegian continental shelf. The samples are predominantly immature/early mature. The distribution of nickel and vanadyl porphyrins within the samples is markedly different. Effects of the thermal maturity on the composition of porphyrins is evaluated and compared with biomarker parameters based on sterane and hopane ratios. Maturity is modelled using partial least-squares (PLS) multivariate analysis with T-max as a maturity indicator. Porphyrin parameters based on the total carbon number distribution of DPEP and ETIO series from the mass spectral data of the nickel and vanadyl porphyrin fractions effectively describe the T-max of the samples with a better correlation than aliphatic biomarker ratios. Selected porphyrin and biomarker ratios were used for principal component analysis (PCA) modelling, and found to describe two types of variation that may be indicative of the prevailing depositional redox conditions.

AB  - In forest management policy, deadwood is regarded as an indicator of sustainable forest management. Dead trees are a key habitat feature for a wide range of organisms. In this study, data from a regular network of nearly 30,000 sample plots (the National Forest Inventory) distributed throughout Poland were used to determine relationships between deadwood volume and thirteen selected natural and human-related factors: forest ownership, protection type, inclusion in the Natura 2000 network, terrain, slope gradient, site fertility, site moisture (water abundance), dominant species, age of the dominant species, stand volume, tree and shrub density, sapling and shrub cover, and stand damage. Analysis of data on deadwood volume was carried out in two steps: univariate analysis was used to determine present-day differences among forests, while a logistic regression model was applied to identify the factors that had the greatest impact on deadwood volume variability on the studied plots. Despite interference from numerous random effects that are difficult to capture and quantify, being often associated with disturbances and differences between the silvicultural approaches of individual forest managers, many of the analyzed factors were found to exert a significant influence. Strong relationships were identified mostly in managed forests (private, municipality-owned, and those managed by the State Forests National Forest Holding). In national parks and nature reserves, the identified effects were less pronounced due to the fact that the examined plots differed in terms of protection type and duration and may have been impacted by different natural disturbances. Indeed, deadwood volume was significantly affected by protection type, with much more deadwood found in strictly protected areas as compared to forests under active protection. Inclusion in Natura 2000 had only a slight effect. On the other hand, a major role was played by difficult terrain accessibility, which impeded silvicultural treatments. More deadwood occurred in the mountains, with increasing slope gradient positively affecting deadwood volume, but only up to a certain point. On the steepest slopes deadwood volume decreased due to the soil and wood sliding to a lower level. Deadwood volume was significantly greater on more fertile and moist sites. In managed forests, both stand age and growing stock volume were positively associated with deadwood accumulation. The species composition of stands, mostly attributable to habitat conditions, was also relevant. The present work identified some significant differences in deadwood volume between stands, and the findings may be useful in developing future management practices with a view to supporting biodiversity.

AB  - This paper describes two groundwater models simulating a well capture zone in a heterogeneous aquifer located near an infiltrating river. A deterministic, large-scaled groundwater model (1.8 x 1.2 km) is used to simulate the average behavior of groundwater flow and advective transport. It is also used to assign the boundary conditions for a small-scaled groundwater model (550 x 400 m) which relies on stochastically generated aquifer properties based on site-specific drill core and georadar data. The small-scaled groundwater model is used to include the large subsurface heterogeneity at the location of interest. The stochastic approach in the small-scaled groundwater model does not lead to a clearly defined well capture zone, but to a plane representation of the probability of a certain surface location belonging to the well capture zone. The models were applied to a study site, which is located in an area of artificial groundwater recharge and production, in Lange Erlen near Basel, Northwestern Switzerland. The groundwater at this site contributes to the city's drinking water supply, and the site serves as a recreational area to the population of Basel. The river is channelized, but there are initiatives to restore the riverbank to more natural conditions. However, they conflict with the requirements of groundwater protection, especially during flood events. Therefore, a river section of 600 m in the vicinity of an unused and disconnected drinking water well was restored to study changes in the groundwater flow regime depending on hydrologic variations, water supply operation data, progress of river restoration, and subsurface heterogeneity. The results of the groundwater models are compared with data from two tracer experiments using Uranine and the natural Radon isotope Rn-222, and with physical, chemical, and microbiological data sampled in monitoring wells between the river and the drinking water well. The groundwater models document significant variations regarding the dimension of the well capture zone depending on changing boundary conditions and the variability of the hydraulic aquifer properties. The knowledge of the subsurface heterogeneity is important to evaluate transport times and distances of microorganisms from the infiltrating river or the riverbank to the drinking water well. The data from the monitoring wells show that chemical and microbiological processes predominantly occur in the hyporheic interstitial zone and the riverbank within a range of a few meters up to a few 10s of meters from the river. The methods presented here can be used to define and evaluate groundwater protection zones in heterogeneous aquifers associated with infiltration from rivers under changing boundary conditions, and under the uncertainty of subsurface heterogeneity. Furthermore, they allow one to study the site-specific operational alternatives associated with river restoration.

AB  - Eurytemora lacustris (Poppe, 1887) is a stenothermic glacial relict whose narrow environmental requirements make it an indicator species for good ecological conditions. The primary threats to this species are eutrophication and global warming. Many authors have described E. lacustris in taxonomic keys; however, its morphological description is unsatisfactory. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to review morphological characteristics of E. lacustris that were previously undescribed in the literature and to provide the molecular characteristics based on the two conservative mitochondrial genes: cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (cytb). The new record of E. lacustris indicates that it is a more widespread species than previously hypothesized. Width-to-length ratio of the last female endopod segment of legs indicates variation among the widely distributed species of the genus in Europe (i.e., E. lacustris, E. velox (Lilljeborg, 1853), and E. affinis (Poppe, 1880)). We also found variability of number of setae on the second segment of male endopod. Furthermore, our analysis confirms the occurrence of species in different than exclusively freshwater habitats.

AB  - In composting system, the composition of microbial communities is determined by the constant change in the physicochemical parameters. This study explored the dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities during cow manure and corn straw composting using high throughput sequencing technology. The relationships between physicochemical parameters and microbial community composition and abundance were also evaluated. The sequencing results revealed the major phyla included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) illustrated that Actinomycetales and Sordariomycetes were the indicators of bacteria and fungi in the maturation phase, respectively. Mantel test showed that NO3--N, NH4+-N, TN, C/N, temperature and moisture content significantly influenced bacterial community composition while only TN and moisture content had a significant effect on fungal community structure. Structural equation model (SEM) indicated that TN, NH4+-N, NO3--N and pH had a significant effect on fungal abundance while TN and temperature significantly affected bacterial abundance. Our finding increases the understanding of microbial community succession in cow manure and corn straw composting under natural conditions.

AB  - The soil has thousands of organisms responsible for many functions and processes in the ecosystems. Due to presenting a great sensitivity to environmental modifications, the soil fauna is considered a good soil quality bio-indicator. However, inadequate sampling may not permit its use in environmental impact studies. Therefore, studies are required to indicate the sample sufficiency for evaluating the soil fauna. This study aimed to calculate the sample sufficiency for the number of groups of individuals that composes the epiedaphic fauna in different soil use conditions. Evaluations of the epiedaphic fauna were carried out in native forest, native pasture and ryegrass/soybean farming, in the winter and the summer. The sample sufficiency was evaluated for the Provid method through analytical methods, with many levels of reliability, and of the non-parametric methods of Chao 1 and Chao 2. It was concluded the use of the minimum number of 14 samples by the Provid method (n = 14) for the study of epiedaphic fauna is sufficient to ensure, at any time of the year and type of use of the soil, a precision of 10% for field survey studies.

AB  - Recreational fishing has become an important part of the Norwegian tourist industry. The coastal municipality of Risor, southern Norway, is considering further development of its marine fishing tourism to increase local economic benefits, but they also want to limit negative effects on the local ecosystem and for the inhabitants. We developed an integrated model with ecosystem and socioeconomic components to evaluate these trade-offs. We chose the status of the local cod (Gadus morhua) stock as an indicator of the marine ecosystem condition. Cod is a highly valued species in tourist and recreational fisheries throughout Norway, and also supports an important commercial fishery. Five management scenarios are presented and compared to the status quo. Our research illustrates how an ecosystem model can assist local authorities in making rational coastal zone management decisions. Our study also revealed a lack of management instruments for local authorities to develop natural resource-based tourism in Norway, and thus the need for the municipality to cooperate and coordinate with other management units and levels.

AB  - We have found that species within high-rank taxa, with the exception of Actinommidae and Eucyrtidiidae, covary across environments in the Nordic Seas. One possible explanation is converging ecological requirements within taxonomic groups. Over the last decade, relative abundance data of species-level taxa have been successfully used to reconstruct environmental conditions in the Nordic Seas via the application of a suite of statistical techniques, including Imbrie-Kipp Factor Analysis. In this study, we test whether the same statistical approach, but based on high-rank groupings of the same dataset, yields similar results to using species-level data. We applied this technique both to modern samples and to Upper Pleistocene/Holocene cores. The results of this study are encouraging, as the statistical analyses for species and high-rank taxa give very similar results. The success of the method is due both to the ecological covariation within some high-rank taxa, and the dominance of one species in other taxa. Future paleotemperature studies in the Nordic Seas may reliably apply a high-rank approach, and thus substantially reduce noise due to misidentification and rare taxa.

AB  - The hazard indicators persistence (P) and long-range transport potential (LRTP) are used in chemicals assessment to characterize chemicals with regard to the temporal and spatial extent of their environmental exposure. They are often calculated based on the results of multimedia fate models. The environmental and substance-specific input parameters of such models are subject to a range of methodological uncertainties and also influenced by natural variability. We employed probabilistic uncertainty analysis to quantify variance in P and LRTP predictions for chemicals with different partitioning and transport behavior. Variance found in the results is so large that it prevents a clear distinction between chemicals. Additionally, only small improvements are observed when evaluating the results relative to a benchmark chemical. This can be explained by the dominance of substance-specific parameters and the only small direct influence of environmental parameters on P and LRTP as model outcomes. The findings underline the importance of learning how environmental conditions cause variability in substance behavior for improved substance ranking and classification. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Visual water clarity is a primary regulator of biological and ecological functions in both benthic and aquatic systems. We present a large data set, collected under variable field conditions, to compare measurements of visual water clarity between the horizontal black disc, a horizontal Secchi disc, and 2 more traditional techniques: a vertical Secchi disc and an electronic nephelometer. Distance readings between the 2 horizontal discs were nearly equivalent (r = 0.98). The horizontal discs provided a measure of visibility that was strongly correlated with that of the vertical Secchi disc (r = 0.96, 0.93). Correlation between measurements made with visual discs and with the electronic nephelometer was high (-0.86 < r < -0.85) but not as high as among measurements made using the 3 types of visual disc. The coefficient of variation, a relative indicator of precision, was similar for the 3 visual methods but higher for the electronic nephelometer. Analyses indicated that there was variation in horizontal disc distance readings among observers. We recommend the use of horizontal visual discs by trained observers as an inexpensive, practical, and precise tool for measuring visual water clarity.

AB  - We determined the effect of environmental stressors on the physiological condition of Brachionus rotundiformis. For two morphologically distinct B. rotundiformis strains: Hawaii (average lorica length = 222 mum) and Langkawi strains (average lorica length 180 mum), neonates hatched from resting eggs were exposed to different levels of unionized ammonia (0.7-9.8 mg l(-1)), viscosity (relative viscosity against natural seawater = 1-1.17) and Euplotes sp. (protozoan) contamination (1-40 cells ml(-1)). Increasing stress decreased fecundity and lifespan of both rotifer strains. Glucosidase and phospholipase activities were correlated with reproductive responses of both the strains exposed to unionized ammonia. When culture water viscosity was changed, the activity of esterase and phospholipase was correlated with reproductive responses of the Hawaiian strain, and glucosidase activity was correlated with those of Langkawi strain. With the protozoan contamination, esterase and glucosidase activities were correlated only with reproductive responses of the Hawaiian strain, while activity of all three enzymes was correlated to those of the Langkawi strain. Glucosidase activity proved to be a reliable indicator of stress for cultured B. rotundiformis.

AB  - Relationships between molecular and biochemical effects of contaminant exposure and organism-level effects are difficult to establish primarily because. (1) the large differences in time-scales of the responses; (2) the complexity of mechanisms involved in such relationships; and (3) the influence of ecological factors on the expression of higher-level responses to stress. In this study we investigated the relationship between mixed function oxidase (MFO) induction and growth in fish as influenced by principal ecological factors in the environment, such as habitat quality, competition and food availability. Because of the complexity and non-linearity of interactions among these factors, we applied a back-propagation neural network approach to investigate this relationship. Inputs into the network included an indicator of contaminant exposure (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD) and several ecological variables, while growth rate served as the single output variable. Under. the field conditions and contaminant exposure regimes observed in this study, EROD in the model simulation contributed minimal marginal ability to predict growth. Indirect effects of contaminants on growth could occur, however, through influences on food chain processes or behavioral dynamics of fish populations. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Energy is required for socioeconomic development, and the world's energy needs have significantly increased in the last decades. The lack of energy can have severe impacts on a person's well-being; therefore, energy access should be ensured for everyone in the world. Energy poverty usually refers to a situation where a household cannot be kept adequately warm, but it is a complex issue with many more aspects. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the energy poverty problem, particularly presenting various definitions given in the literature that capture the multi-dimensional nature of the problem and analyzing the different ways of measuring energy poverty (expenditure approach and consensual approach). In addition, the impacts of the problem are identified, including health, socioeconomic, and environmental impacts, as well as the drivers that can worsen energy poverty conditions, such as several household characteristics and various socioeconomic and environmental factors. The situation occurring currently in the world is also presented, including studies that focus on different world regions, and the different solutions that can help address the problem are discussed, including changes to the living environments and the use of new technologies.

AB  - Air pollution can be studied by appropriate bio-indicators, such as pine needles due to their waxy surface. Metal uptake and accumulation is determined on growing area, but also on the respective species. Scope of the study was to analyse needles of Pinus densiflora Siebold et Zucc., Pinus nigra Arnold, Pinus sylvestris L., and Pinus thunbergiana Franco for metals and metalloids, namely aluminium, arsenic, boron, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, chromium, iron, potassium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, nickel, lead, selenium, strontium, and zinc. Quantitation of the analytes was performed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry after acidic microwave-assisted digestion. The obtained data were checked for statistically significant differences. The metal levels differ between the various species, but no general tendency was found for all metals. Since the environmental conditions were the same for all sampled trees, the differences in metal accumulation are supposed to be linked to species of pine tree. The diverse accumulation behaviour can be used for treating polluted soil.

AB  - The processes leading to the formation of toxic beryllium-containing aerosol particles at the stages of beryllium hydroxide production using a new innovative technology of ore processing at the Ermakovskoe deposit are considered. In order to create a conceptual structure of experimental samples of the units for control emissions and discharges of pollutants in the production of beryllium hydroxide, the processes of aerosol formation at various technological stages of beryllium production have been studied. A diffusion model is proposed for droplet evaporation during the leaching and hydrolysis of beryllium concentrates, which makes it possible to determine the rate of evaporation, temperature, size, and lifetime of a droplet depending on the environmental conditions. The results of model calculations (for the diffusion model) of the dispersed composition of beryllium-containing aerosol particles are presented. The most hazardous stages of emissions and discharges of beryllium-containing aerosols in the production of beryllium hydroxide according to a new technology have been identified; the ecological risks arising during emissions of aerosol particles into the atmosphere are assessed.

AB  - A post-release study was performed to assess the impact of Torymus sinensis (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), the biological control agent of Dryocosmus kuriphilus (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), on native cynipid gall inducers in Italy. In total, 14,512 nontarget galls were collected, corresponding to seven genera: Andricus, Aphelonyx, Biorhiza, Cynips, Diplolepis, Neuroterus, and Synophrus, and 8708 chalcid parasitoids were recorded. The Torymidae family accounted for about 30%, and Bootanomyia (= Megastigmus) dorsalis, Torymus affinis and T. flavipes were the most represented species. A total of 116 T. sinensis emerged from 15 different oak galls, mainly Andricus curvator and A. inflator. In controlled conditions, oviposition was recorded on A. cydoniae, A. grossulariae and A. lucidus, while no mating with native congeneric species occurred. This paper confirms the realised host-range expansion by T. sinensis. Even if it were extremely difficult to evaluate its magnitude, the impact appears minimal, and an occasional feeding with no changes in the distribution or abundance of non-target hosts is expected.

AB  - Due to their sensitivity to environmental change, penguins in Antarctica are widely used as bio-indicators in paleoclimatic research. On the basis of bio-element assemblages identified in four ornithogenic sediment profiles, we reconstructed the historical penguin population change at Cape Bird, Ross Island, for the past 1600 years. Clear succession of penguin population peaks were observed in different profiles at about 1400 AD, which suggested a high probability of migration within this region. The succession was most obviously marked by a sand layer lasting from 1400 to 1900 AD in one of the analyzed profiles. Multiple physical/chemical parameters indicated this sand layer was not formed in a lacustrine environment, but was marine-derived. Both isostatic subsidence and frequent storms under the colder climatic condition of the Little Ice Age were presumed to have caused the abandonment of the colonies, and we believe the penguins migrated from the coastal area of mid Cape Bird northward and to higher ground as recorded in the other sediment profiles. This migration was an ecological response to global climate change and possible subsequent geological effects in Antarctica.

AB  - Headwater streams are critical repositories of biodiversity and are important sources of water, nutrients, and energy to downstream rivers. I investigated relationships between stream geomorphology and habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish assemblages between headwater and network streams (n = 18) of mountain drainages in northern Idaho, United States. I found that a stream geomorphic condition assessment (rapid geomorphic assessment, RGA) designed to evaluate channel adjustment explained more variation in habitat assessment scores in headwater (R2 = 0.79) than in larger streams (R2 = 0.51). Results from redundancy analysis indicated that geomorphic-biotic relationships were stronger in headwater than in network streams. For aquatic macroinvertebrates, relationships in headwaters were largely related to sediment size and slope. Fish-geomorphic associations in both headwater and network streams were quite variable, although the RGA was correlated with fish diversity in both systems. Large wood was related to macroinvertebrate and fish descriptors in both headwater and network streams, but in distinct ways. This work supports an ecogeomorphic approach to the conservation of headwater streams including the use of tailored stream geomorphic assessment protocols.

AB  - During the recent few years, microRNAs emerged as key molecules in the regulation of mammalian cell functions. It was also shown that their altered expression can promote pathologic conditions, such as cancer and other common diseases. Because environmental exposure to biological, chemical or physical agents may be responsible for human diseases, including cancer, uncovering relationships between exposure to environmental carcinogens and expression of microRNAs may help to disclose early mechanisms of disease and it may potentially lead to the development of useful indicators of toxic exposure or novel biomarkers for carcinogenicity testing. The unique expression profile of microRNAs in different types and at different stages of cancer coupled to their remarkable stability in tissues and in serum/plasma suggests that these little molecules may find application as sensitive biomarkers. This review will concentrate on the alterations in microRNA expression in response to environmental factors in relation to the risk of developing liver cancer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The results of a 3 years monitoring program to assess the effects associated with recurrent dredged spoil disposal activity in a naturally stressed subtidal coastal area subjected to estuarine inputs are described. Changes observed through time in environmental and anthropogenic variables have been analyzed using cumulated sums and compared to macrobenthic community structure. Results revealed a scarce impact of the recurrent dumping activities, with faunal assemblages derived from the main "Tellina-venus community". The magnitude of estuarine influence appeared indeed greater on the soft-bottom community than the putative changes due to anthropogenic activities. Through a combination of high energetic conditions, structural changes were observed and ascribed to a flushing action of the highly channeled estuary. Finally, an exceptional flood was recorded over the monitoring period, resulting in a short-term spatial homogenization of the benthic community with an abundance burst of A. alba. Origins of this main new species are discussed.

AB  - Potential time lags between human-mediated disturbances and the subsequent responses of ecosystems are critical for planning and implementing conservation and restoration actions. In this context, decoupling between the temporal trajectories of ecosystems structure and functions is particularly critical. Here, we stand out the need to differentiate the temporal trajectories of ecosystem structure and functions to be considered in ecological restoration programs. In cases when ecosystem functions persist after the degradation of the ecosystem structure, and when functions do not recover at the same rate as structure, some kind of ecosystem functioning credits or debts can occur. In other situations, an ongoing loss of the ecosystem function can occur even in the absence of further disturbance. Ecosystem restoration outcomes could be optimized in regions with ecosystem functioning credit, since mitigating the decline in functioning will be more efficient than recovering functions in highly degraded conditions. Ecological restoration programs should not only focus on structure-derived indicators but they should also consider the dynamics of ecosystem functions to guide land-planning decision-making.

AB  - Data on the species diversity of the genus Micrasterias C. Agardh ex Ralfs representatives from water bodies of West Siberia and their occurrence in zones and subzones are generalized. Twenty-three specific and intraspecific taxa from the order Desmidiales are now known. The representatives of the family occur in mosaic order in the entire area of West Siberia. The highest number of taxa (15) was revealed in the middle taiga; significantly fewer were determined in southern and northern taiga, 9 and 8 taxa, respectively; and 3'5 taxa were in other zones. No such species were discovered in the steppe zone. Thirteen species (18 taxa) of the genus were found in lakes of different types, 5 species (7 taxa) in watercourses, 4 (5 taxa) were found in swamps, and 4 species were detected in temporal water bodies. The analysis performed on the adaptation of the species to environmental conditions demonstrated that representatives of this genus might serve as indicators of acid and brackish water. In relation to mineralization, halophobes are predominant (11 taxa) and acidophilus plants (15 taxa) predominate as pH indicators.

AB  - This paper provides an introduction to the ecological features that characterise the wetlands of the Kakadu region in northern Australia and places these in a wider context for other papers in a special issue that expands on these features. The special issue aims to (1) synthesise knowledge of the ecosystem process that underpins the management of the rivers and floodplains and (2) undertake an integrated assessment so as to evaluate alternative management responses in the face of an uncertain future. These aims are addressed in individual papers. The managerial and physical settings of the region are introduced before some of the previous wetland research is summarised and gaps in information considered. The gaps included an understanding of the relationship between the provision of ecosystem services and outcomes for water quality and biodiversity, and ecosystem and population dynamics of wetland biodiversity. In a conclusion, the occurrence and acceptance or management of invasive species is considered in terms of the emergence of novel ecosystems as a consequence of global change, in particular sea-level rise and anticipated transition of freshwater wetlands to saline conditions.

AB  - A method previously used to measure thickness of the surface mucus layer (SML) of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract has been applied to the SML of reef corals. It involves manual measurement of mucus thickness using a micromanipulator and fine glass needle (micropipette) and is non-destructive to the coral, meaning that repeated measurements can be taken. A measurable mucus layer was recorded in all cases in the study, which comprised 450 individual thickness measurements from four coral species. Mucus thickness ranged from 145 to 700 mu m. Thus, whatever dynamic processes control mucus synthesis, secretion to the tissue surface and subsequent release into the water column, a continuous mucosal barrier is maintained. A change in SML thickness was recorded as a response to aerial exposure during the natural tidal cycle and to solar exposure-induced bleaching, although the response due to bleaching varied between two studied species. The technique is rapid, cost-effective and a simple means of assessing coral SML thickness, a variable that shows significant variation in relation to environmental conditions and is likely to be an important health indicator in these organisms.

AB  - Biodiversity studies allow ecosystem assessment and monitoring of environmental changes and impacts. Parasite diversity could reflect the host/ parasite coevolutionary process and the environment changes that permit the loss, gain or maintenance of species. This survey used species/morphotypes of helminths eggs found in feces from seven wild mammal species (the groups Dasypodidae and Large Cats, and Tamandua tetradactyla, Cebus apella, Alouatta caraya, Cerdocyon thous, Pecari tajacu) and from two domestic species (Canis familiaris and Sus scrofa), which occur within the Serra da Capivara National Park (PNSC) and surrounding areas in order to analise the diversity of mammal intestinal helminths. This work used the helminthological fauna findings of wild and domestic mammals, to consider a possible helminth flux between these two host groups using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) of the hosts based on helminthological fauna composition. The results indicate that the region of the PNSC still maintains environmental conditions that still keep wild mammal helminthological fauna composition different from the one found for domestic mammals.

AB  - With the aim of quantitatively evaluating the usefulness of phyllostomid bats as ecological indicators, we compared intra-family levels and feeding guilds between tropical old-growth forest and patches of secondary vegetation growing where the land had been used for shifting agriculture. There were significant differences between vegetation types in bat species composition, with the frugivore guild most abundant in secondary vegetation and the animalivore guild most abundant in the old-growth forest. These results are congruent with the findings for other Neotropical zones and appear to be associated with the type of soil management that allows secondary vegetation to grow. Using the Indicator Value method, two subfamilies, five genera and five species were found to have a significant indicator value. However, these numbers only represent a small proportion of the five subfamilies, 20 genera and 28 species recorded, indicating that under the disturbance conditions that characterize the study area, phyllostomid bats were poor ecological indicators. Even so, some species and subfamilies are useful as disturbance detectors.

KW  - RIVER
AB  - A first approach towards an integrated, macroinvertebrate based, river type specific system for the assessment and classification of the ecological quality in Greek rivers affected by nutrient enrichment is presented. This system, which was developed within the framework of the AQEM project application in Greece, is regionally adapted and integrated, since it contains a multitude of biotic and abiotic factors affecting taxa presences and abundances. The methodology applied is very promising for the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in Greece. According to the AQEM project, a seasonal 'multi habitat sampling' procedure, at 45 sampling sites, scattered over three river types, was applied. In addition, a large set of hydrological, morphological, geological, biological, hydrochemical parameters and anthropogenic factors were considered. The system is based on a new, river type specific biotic metric, adapted for Greek conditions (BMG) and a new nutrient pollution metric. The developed metrics showed high correlations with each other. Hence, BMG seems to be suitable for the ecological quality assessment of Greek running waters affected by nutrients. Moreover, by applying BMG, a final classification of the rivers into five quality classes, according to the demands of the WFD, was achieved.

AB  - Mature at least 100-year-old Norway spruce trees located in 5 sites with different levels of damage in the Giant Mts (Krkonose, the Czech Republic) were investigated to get deeper insight in the current physiological status of the forest ecosystem under long-term global environmental impact in 2000 and 2001. The proportion of individual bud development types is proposed as a new macroscopic marker of the current tree health status enabling classification of each tree to the one of the five following categories: increased or decreased growth activity, declining, improved or stabilized status. The most defoliated trees reveal the highest proportion of regular buds, i.e. the most intensive growth rate and the lowest proportion of aborted buds. Negative correlation between production of cones and both production of new shoots and growth intensity during the same year was found. Strong generative year is discussed to be responsible for increased growth activity and compensatory response to insufficient foliage in the following year.

AB  - Exposure to agrochemicals in the aquatic environment often occurs as time-varying or repeated pulses. Time-varying exposures may occur due to runoff events and spray drift associated with precipitation and application events. Hydrologic dilution, dispersion, and degradation also produce pulsed exposures. Standard laboratory toxicity tests using constant exposure concentrations typically do not investigate the toxicity of time-varying or repeated exposures. Detoxification, elimination, and recovery may occur within organisms or populations during the periods between exposures. The difficulty of estimating effects of realistic time-varying exposures from measurements made under constant exposure conditions is often an important source of uncertainty in ecological risk assessment of pesticides. This article discusses the criteria and tools for deciding whether time-varying exposures are relevant in a particular risk assessment, approaches for laboratory toxicity testing with time-varying exposure, modeling approaches for addressing effects of time-varying exposure, deterministic and probabilistic ecological risk characterization of time-varying exposures and toxicity, and uncertainty analysis.

AB  - During three years of research on epiphytic lichen communities as indicators of environmental change in northern Thailand plots were set up in a range of forest types between 400 and 1600 m in 1991/2 and revisited in 1993. Other areas were visited in 1993 and collections made in a wider range of geographical, altitudinal and vegetation conditions in Thailand. From this data factors influencing the distribution of lichens in a monsoon climate are outlined and characteristic components of the lichen flora given at family, generic and where possible specific level. Dominant taxa of the montane forests include hygrophilous macrolichens of the 'Lobarion' that are also a characteristic component of old growth fagaceous forests in Europe, whereas the evergreen forests are dominated by moisture-dependent crustose taxa with a trentepohlioid photobiont, and the deciduous dipterocarp forests by often brightly coloured xerophytic lichens with a trebouxioid photobiont. Taxa are proposed as indicators of forest type including those that are indicators of old-growth forests and of disturbance. Quantitative recording of selected taxa at genus and species level is suggested to estimate rates of change in monsoon forests in southeast Asia.

AB  - Ecological sustainability, the ability of life-support systems to maintain the quality of the environment, is a necessary condition for longterm agricultural sustainability at the field, farm, or national level. Research is needed at the watershed/landscape level to address the effects of changes in inputs, land use, or management practices on the ecological sustainability of modern agriculture. This research should address the impact of perturbations on the responses of watersheds relative to objective indicators of sustainability, Ideally this research would be done within a set of managed landscapes that could be perturbed to change the watershed or landscape response. The perturbations could be to the inputs of materials, energy, and management; the structure of the landscape; or the desired production outputs. An existing set of watershed improvement projects, funded by Federal, State, local, and private sources, could provide the landscapes for this research. Projects funded through Clean Water Act Section 319 grants, USDA Water Quality Demonstration projects, and USDA Hydrologic Unit Area projects provide landscapes throughout the United States that are valuable resources for research on ecological sustainability. These landscapes should be used in research to determine ways to enhance the longterm sustainability of agriculture.

AB  - Sheep grazing is known to influence soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and dynamics in rangelands. However, very little is known of grazing impacts on measurable SOC pools associated with primary particles, particulate organic matter (POM) and carbohydrates in the heavily grazed rangelands of Zagros Mountains, Iran. Bulk SOC, total nitrogen (N), POM and hot-water extractable carbohydrates (HWC) as well as different SOC and N fractions in particle-size separates were studied in natural mountainous rangelands of arid (Boroujen with 255 mm annual rainfall) and semi-arid (Sabzkouh with 860 mm annual rainfall) sites, Central Zagros. Two sheep grazing regimes including grazed and ungrazed (for 20-25 years) rangelands with four replicates were identified as the grazing treatments at each site. Soil samples (0-15 cm) were taken and analyzed for bulk SOC, total N, POM, HWC, and SOC and N associated with physical fractions. Bulk SOC contents were similar for both ungrazed and grazed regimes, while total N contents significantly decreased under grazed conditions. Bulk soil POM and HWC contents decreased considerably and clearly by sheep grazing, indicating that these fractions of total soil organic matter (SOM) pool may be suitable indicators for detecting the grazing effects on bulk SOC changes and storage in these arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Semi-arid rangeland sites contained more bulk SOC, total N and POM contents than arid rangeland sites. These differences were primarily due to the large differences in vegetation composition, annual rainfall and soil conditions between the two rangelands. After 20-25 years of grazing over 10-33 % of SOC and total N losses occurred in the sand- and clay-size fractions with 10 % increases in the silt fraction. This means sheep grazing increases the contribution of the silt fraction to bulk soil N. We found evidence that sheep grazing decreases soil POM and HWC pools, and the sand fraction C, suggesting a lower recent annual input of decomposable organic C in heavily grazed rangelands. Sheep grazing had no influence on the potential C mineralization of the bulk soil at the semi-arid site (Sabzkouh), but reduced C mineralization at the arid-site (Boroujen), indicating that sheep grazing may affect SOC dynamics by changes in substrate quality at the former, but by substrate quantity at the later. In brief, long-term sheep grazing can potentially lead to losses of both labile and no-labile SOM in these arid and semi-arid rangelands.

AB  - Faecal coliform (FC) microorganisms are one of the most important indicators in water quality management, since their presence reveals the possibility of existence of other dangerous microorganisms, leading to higher health risks. An accurate estimate of the concentration of this indicator helps better evaluation of the water pollution in riverine basins; thus, it is essential for future developments. The FC mortality rate depends on the physical, chemical, and biological processes in rivers. These processes are generally affected by environmental conditions. In this study, the decay coefficient (K) or mortality rate are related to the environmental parameters such as temperature, turbidity, pH, and salinity by an empirical equation. The results showed that turbidity and temperature are the most effective parameters. Moreover, an empirical equation was developed utilizing numerical model calibration, which describes the relationship of the mortality rate (K) with water temperature and turbidity. This equation was then added to the water quality module of the FASTER numerical model. Comparison of the measured FC concentrations with the predicted values obtained from the numerical model showed that the model accuracy significantly improved for the dynamic and variable decay coefficient.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a key role in many biogeochemical processes, but the drivers controlling the diversity of chemical composition and properties of DOM molecules (chemodiversity) in soils are poorly understood. It has also been debated whether environmental conditions or intrinsic molecular properties control the accumulation and persistence of DOM due to the complexity of both molecular composition of DOM and interactions between DOM and surrounding environments. In this study, soil DOM samples were extracted from 33 soils collected from different regions of China, and we investigated the effects of climate and soil properties on the chemodiversity of DOM across different regions of China, employing a combination of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, and statistical analyses. Our results indicated that, despite the heterogeneity of soil samples and complex influencing factors, aridity and clay can account for the majority of the variations of DOM chemical composition. The finding implied that DOM chemodiversity is an ecosystem property closely related to the environment, and can be used in developing large-scale soil biogeochemistry models for predicting C cycling in soils.

AB  - Two saltmarsh mosquitoes dominate the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV, Togoviridae: Alphavirus), one of Australia's most prominent mosquito-borne diseases. Ecologically, saltmarshes vary in their structure, including habitat types, hydrological regimes, and diversity of aquatic fauna, all of which drive mosquito oviposition behavior. Understanding the distribution of vector mosquitoes within saltmarshes can inform early warning systems, surveillance, and management of vector populations. The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of Ae. camptorhynchus, a known vector for RRV, across a saltmarsh and investigate the influence that other invertebrate assemblage might have on Ae. camptorhynchus egg dispersal. We demonstrate that vegetation is a strong indicator for Ae. camptorhynchus egg distribution, and this was not correlated with elevation or other invertebrates located at this saltmarsh. Also, habitats within this marsh are less frequently inundated, resulting in dryer conditions. We conclude that this information can be applied in vector surveillance and monitoring of temperate saltmarsh environments and also provides a baseline for future investigations into understanding mosquito vector habitat requirements.

AB  - The assessment of natural and stabilized soils behaviour, using binders with ecological benefits like lime, is based on modelling of the performance characteristics related to the bearing increase of infrastructure works by developing parametric correlations. The value of CBR index represents one of the most used parameters in design, execution and quality control of road structures. Taking into consideration the necessity of a large number of tests and specimens and the long period associated to their execution, a widely used an alternative method based on correlations of CBR value and soil characteristics due to time saving, as well as independent verification and quality control of results, is used. A significant increase of CBR values due to lime stabilization in both natural and soaked conditions has been noticed. The influence of the compaction characteristics on CBR value depending on the index obtained during tests and the derived index expressed by correlation coefficients, has been reflected by good correlations of the analyzed statistical variables. The calibration modelling of data for a simple linear regression has been put into evidence by using comparative analyzes of experimental and predictable parameters.

AB  - Joint prevention and control of air pollution (JPCAP) is an inevitable choice for controlling air pollution in the future. The existing air pollution prevention and control methods pay less attention to environmental justice, which results in poor treatment effects; hence, a more reasonable method is imperative. The innovation of this work is to construct a new method for dividing the scope and priorities of JPCAP by introducing environmental justice. First, we analyze the distribution and injustice of air pollution, and then divide JPCAP regions based on environmental justice using a clustering method. Finally, by selecting indicators from the characteristics of air pollution, natural conditions, and trade, the Entropy-TOPSIS method is employed to define the priorities of the JPCAP regions. Accordingly, we divided Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and its surrounding areas in China into four JPCAP regions. We also discovered key regions of air pollution control by determining the priorities of the four regions. The new method provides a practical guidance and a theoretical basis for regional joint control of air pollution.

AB  - The climate system is driven by internal and external forcings. Among the prime external forcings is the solar radiation, while the human activity is included among the principal intrinsic forcings. This means that basic components of nature and society are substantial parameters of the evolution of the climate system. Therefore, the consideration of the nature and society as a separate system, the nature-society system, will provide a new tool for the investigation of the climate system variability.
   This paper is focused on the modelling of the evolution of the nature-society system, when considering a series of major natural and anthropogenic processes including several solar-terrestrial coupling mechanisms, biogeochemical cycles, physical processes operating in the terrestrial atmosphere, global climate change, global hydrologic balance and photosynthesis in ocean ecosystems. Among the main goals of this model is to estimate the survivability of the nature-society system under the conditions of limited energy resources. A series of simulation experiments are presented herein demonstrating the ability of the model to operate satisfactorily and reliably under various anthropogenic scenarios.

AB  - Cadmium concentrations were determined in the tissues of muscle and liver of Carcharhinus falciforrnis (silky shark) sampled in Todos Santos, Baja California South, Mexico. This is one of the main shark species for human consumption in Mexico. Results indicate that accumulation of Cd varied in both sexes, based on its metabolism, sex, maturity and other biological characteristics. High Cd values were observed in the liver of adults of male (529.61 mu g g(-1)) and female (457.43 mu g g(-1)), whereas, in muscular tissues it was low (0.37 mu g g(-1)) than the prescribed permissible limits for seafood (0.5 mu g g(-1)). Substantial correlations were observed between body length and Cd values in adults except young male due to faster growth rate and its metabolism. The study indicated the impact of environmental conditions in the accumulation of Cd and its risk to the food web structure in the marine environment and health hazard for humans.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test young-of-the-year (YOY) assemblage applicability for the ecological quality assessment on the basis of samples from 55 sites scattered across the entire Czech Republic. European Fish Index (EFI) values estimated with YOY and adults were positively correlated, indicating that YOY and adult sampling is comparable. YOY bias the EFI toward significantly lower values, however, adults also lead to underestimated EFI values on some occasions. Relative differences between EFI YOY and EFI adults show almost normal distributions and indicate that there is no detectable systematic bias caused by environmental conditions or intensity of sampling. As shown in the Elbe River example, the reason for lower EFI YOY values could be found in a longer period of detection of evident changes in adult fish assemblages, reflecting longevity of adult fishes or regular stocking. YOY sampling was suggested as a useful method for assessing river ecological quality, with the ability to provide a sensitive response to the habitat structure regardless of the effect of stocking or river size.

AB  - The assessment of sustainable development is often based on the three pillars of sustainability model using social, economic and environmental indicators. It is thought that by measuring the performance of each system, information can be gained about the sustainability of the whole system. However it seems there has been no attempt to evaluate if such an assumption is true. During the development of a sustainability assessment framework for south west Victoria, Australia, it has become evident that this approach to sustainability assessment does not provide an accurate assessment of system sustainability. The project found that environmental indicators were considered the most important for assessing regional sustainability. As a consequence, the assessment produced shows that in south west Victoria, sustainability is largely determined by the condition of the environment. This finding highlights the current disconnection between the theory and reality of sustainability. Here, we describe a framework for sustainability assessment that attempts to re-connect theory to practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A behavioral syndrome is a suite of behaviors correlated across multiple social contexts. In this study, boldness in the face of predation risk was assessed twice in fish across two different sensory modalities in both the field and lab to ascertain the biological relevance and complexity of this attribute. Individual fathead minnows were captured from a natural field population using traps that either contained chemical alarm cues (conspecific skin extract) or control (well water) and their responses to the presence of predator behind a glass partition assessed in the laboratory. Although fewer fish were captured in alarm cue-labeled traps, these bold fish performed longer predator inspections than shy fish captured in control traps. Thus, a shy/bold behavioral syndrome was expressed consistently across field and lab settings in response to both chemical and visual indicators of danger. Shy and bold individuals did not differ in sex, body length, secondary sexual characteristics, or parasite load but were of more robust physical condition.

AB  - A persistent controversy has concerned the identification of the factors that influence the quantitative variation in the physiological characters of species, an example of which is the basal rate of metabolism of endotherms. The most important factor accounting for its variation is body mass as long as the range in mass is appreciable. But mass never accounts for all of the variation and none if species have the same mass. Most of the residual variation around the mass curve is associated with behavioral characters, ecological factors, and phylogeny, i.e., history. These agents influence energy expenditure by different means and at different stages in the life history of species. Phylogeny describes the historic origin, evolution, and distribution of character states in contemporary species. However, the level of energy expenditure is quantitatively determined by the collective of realized states in combination with conditions in the environment. Therefore, two stages determine energy expenditure: (1) the evolution of character states and (2) their impact in conjunction with conditions on the environment. Behavioral characters and ecological factors, when coupled with log(10) mass, usually account for > 94 % of the variation in the log(10) basal rates of birds and mammals, a capacity not found in phylogenetic analyses. The difficulty of determining a direct impact of phylogeny on physiological characters results from its correlation with behavioral characters. When appropriate, the passerine/non-passerine dichotomy in birds and the sub/infraclass dichotomy in mammals combine with behavioral characters, ecological factors, and log(10) mass to increase r (2) to account for 96-99 % of the variation in log(10) basal rate. This occurs because dichotomies incorporate factors other than those already in the analyses. The clearest demonstration of the direct impact of character states is the equality of energy expenditure in species convergent with species from other clades without any evidence of the clade to which the species belong. A multifactorial approach depends on the inclusion of life history characteristics of species, but this analysis applies only to continuous, quantitative relationships, which are often modified by discontinuous agents. Distinctive character states distinguish species and therefore must be included in any attempt to account for differences in their level of energy expenditure. No analysis that ignores life history characteristics can account for the quantitative variation in energy expenditure beyond that associated with body mass.

AB  - The dynamics of organic matter (OM) in prairie soils play an important role in long-term soil productivity and in the global carbon cycle. Temporal fluctuations in OM occur primarily in the readily-decomposable, labile fractions. We analyzed soils from a long-term study on a Brown Chernozem (Aridic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan to determine the effect of cropping practices on OM content and composition under arid conditions. Soils (0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers) from various rotations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), winter wheat, flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) and fallow were analyzed for organic C, total N and selected indicators of labile OM [light fraction(LF)-C, LF-N, mineralizable-C, mineralizable-N, microbial biomass(MB)-C and MB-N]. The indicators of labile OM were all more sensitive than total OM to agronomic variables. Treatment effects on air characteristics were usually similar in the 0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers, but effects in the surface layer were often more highly significant. Frequency of fallow in the rotation was the dominant factor influencing labile OM. For example, LF-C in the 0-7.5 cm layer of well-fertilized continuously-cropped spring wheat, bare fallow-wheat-wheat and bare fallow-wheat was 3.15, 1.55 and 1.17 mg C kg(-1) soil, respectively. The corresponding values for CO2-C mineralized at 21 degrees C in 30 days were 371, 184 and 158 mg C kg(-1) soil and those for cumulative net N mineralized in 16 weeks at 35 degrees C were 126, 96 and 80 mg N kg(-1) soil. MB-C and MB-N exhibited similar trends (e.g. MB-C was 368, 256 and 257 mg C kg(-1) soil for the three treatments, respectively). Application of N fertilizer and substitution of winter wheat (with chemical fallow) for spring wheat (with tilled bare fallow) tended to increase labile OM, while substitution of flax or lentil for spring wheat had little effect or reduced labile OM. Differences in labile OM appeared to be related, not only to residue inputs, but also to moisture and temperature conditions. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to manipulate the timing of residue inputs and moisture through cropping practices and thereby maintain adequate labile OM concentrations and improve the synchrony of mineralization with crop requirements. Our results also imply that LF and mineralizable fractions may be useful as early indicators of OM change.

AB  - The ecosystem service (ES) framework is gaining traction in ecosystem management as a means to recognize the multiple benefits that ecosystems provide. In forested ecosystems, many structural attributes (trees, understory plants and woody debris) create heterogeneous ecosystems that provide numerous ecosystem services, including many that are culturally important. However, application of the ES framework to forest management is challenged by difficulties measuring and comparing multiple ES across diverse and heterogeneous forest conditions. Indicators can help bring the ES approach to forest management by providing a means for accurate ES inventory and mapping. We measured 10 forest ES in contrasting forest types to investigate the effects of past forest harvesting in coastal temperate rainforest of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Our objectives were to build a systematic set of ES indicators for coastal temperate forests based on forest structural features, including trees, coarse woody debris, and under story plants. To achieve this, we 1) analyzed field data to compare the effects of forest age (old-growth vs. second-growth) and ecological site conditions (riparian vs. upland forest) on the bundle of ES provided by different forest types; and 2) worked with a local indigenous wood carver to identify attributes of cedar trees (Thuja plicata) essential for traditional uses, including canoe carving. Forest age and forest type had significant and major effects on bundles of ES. Old-growth forests provided three times higher carbon storage, nine times higher wood volume, and eighteen times higher canopy habitat services than recovering forests. Within old-growth forests, the proportion of trees suitable for traditional indigenous wood carving was significantly higher in riparian stands. Yet of 456 trees measured, only 17 were cedar with potential traditional uses. Of those, trees for canoe carving were the least frequent (n =3), which we identified as large (>110 cm DBH) trees of exceptional quality. In general, old-growth riparian forests were a hotspot of ES, providing for example nearly three times as much carbon storage as old-growth forests on upland sites and 12 times the amount of carbon storage as found in second-growth forests on upland sites. These results indicate that typical inventories of forest ES, which usually generalize across heterogeneity, may oversimplify dramatic variations in ES bundles in forested landscapes. Our novel set of stand-level ES indicators can improve the accuracy of ES assessments, incorporate important cultural ES, and help address the role of landscape heterogeneity in influencing ES.

AB  - The Oolithe ferrugineuse de Bayeux Formation is located at the historical Bajocian stratotype of Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, north of Bayeux, Normandy. The condensed formation ranges from the base of the Humphriesianum Zone to the Parkinsoni Zone and is divided into four beds of decimetric scale.
   Three main microfacies are present. (1) oncoid rudstones, (2) ooid bioclastic packstones and (3) silty burrowed wackestones/packstones. Sedimentation took place in a very quiet environment, below the photic zone and below or near the storm wave base. The general setting is a distal carbonate ramp, its lower part characterized by hemipelagic sedimentation indicated by the presence of planktonic foraminifers. The inferred depth is around 100 m. Free oxygen concentration was low. Dysaerobic conditions are indicated by a scarcity of benthic macrofauna.
   Ferruginous structures are numerous in the first two microfacies, and absent in the last. Hematite staining is not uniform and follows many sedimentary patterns. Among the more widespread Fe structures are perforation infillings with endolithic microorganisms, microstromatolites, oncoids, ooids, blisters, coatings and hardgrounds. These structures can be associated and none are mutually exclusive. Hematite-coated filaments of different sizes and shapes are observed in the micrite matrix: the walls of various organisms; the calcite crystals associated with the Fe cortical laminations; the perforations and burrow; the hard-grounds; and microstromatolites. Petrographical and SEM examinations suggest that the laminated crusts (oncoids and hard-grounds) are formed by microbial iron mars dominated by filamentous bacteria and fungi. Seven types of microbes are recognized: filaments (five morphotypes), spheroidal bodies and stalked bodies. Filamentous microfossils of type 1 to 4 resemble the present-day filamentous bacteria (Beggiatoales and Cytophagaceae). Because of their large diameter and their branching nature, filaments of type 5 are possibly filamentous fungi. Another argument in favor of fungi is the presence of stalked and spheroidal bodies that resemble zoosporangia and oogonia of some Oomycota.
   In deep, calm and dysaerobic waters, many interfaces (e.g. between aerobic and dysaerobic waters) are present in the sediments. The stability of the soluble reduced state of iron (Fe2+) is higher at such interfaces, and many ferric iron-encrusted microbial fossils are observed. iron could thus serve as an electron donor for microbial iron-oxidation processes. Other microbial iron deposition pathways are also possible.
   It appears that, regardless of geological age (Paleozoic, Mesozoic) and geographical location, the same microbiological mechanisms an probably responsible for the red color in calcareous stratified or unstratified bodies. The presence of fossilized iron-encrusted bacteria and fungi at interfaces may therefore serve as an indicator of anoxic to dysaerobic conditions in various paleo(micro)environments.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Our study determined if and when an avoidance or attraction behavioural response would be displayed by Ilyanassa obsoleta when presented with a choice between harbour and reference sediments. Our goal was to develop a non-lethal approach that could be used in future assessments of the environmental quality of field sediments.
   Materials and Methods. Twenty snails were exposed in 7 L tanks to different amounts of Halifax Harbour sediments mixed with reference sediment placed in one half of a tank and reference sediments in the other. Sediments were covered with seawater, while the top half of the tank was exposed to air. One level of exposure was placed in triplicate tanks where the positioning of the snails was of 20:0, 0:20 and 10:10, in half:half of a tank. Details regarding the investigation of the set up conditions and results of exposures to specific chemicals or sediment extracts are outlined in Part 1.
   Results. The distinct avoidance of contaminated sediments and the preference for reference sediments were observed between 24 and 72 hrs of exposure, which was more pronounced with increasing percentage of harbour sediments mixed in reference sediments.
   Discussion. A decrease in avoidance was associated with a slight increase in temperature and longer exposure time and is interpreted as potential conditions favouring the degradation of contaminants and an increase in food. Part 1 of our study demonstrated the important role associated with the availability of food in reference sediments and a general lack of attraction to three biologically derived compounds known to be present in sewage discharges, i.e. a fatty acid methyl ester, cholesterol and coprostanol. The repelling properties of solvent extracts of a harbour sediment demonstrated that non polar chemicals were implicated in the avoidance response and would likely be reflecting the role of lipophilic contaminants in the avoidance response.
   Conclusions. It is proposed that the behaviour towards harbour sediments represents a balance between the avoidance of contaminants and the attraction of food. The present study provides a robust green assessment tool that is easy to set up to assess the quality of sediments.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The interpretation of field observations regarding the abundance of animals during environmental assessments must consider both nutritional and toxicological causes. Additional laboratory exposures are needed to determine the cause of the movement of snails away from harbour sediments, i.e. which specific chemicals play a role in the behavioural response and at which level of exposure. The degradation of contaminants should also be pursued to better understand the fate of organic compounds in this habitat.

AB  - 1. Chemical effects on organisms are typically assessed using individual-level endpoints or sometimes population growth rate (PGR), but such measurements are generally made at low population densities. In contrast most natural populations are subject to density dependence and fluctuate around the environmental carrying capacity as a result of individual competition for resources. As ecotoxicology aims to make reliable population projections of chemical impacts in the field, an understanding of how high-density or resource-limited populations respond to environmental chemicals is essential.
   2. Our objective was to determine the joint effects of population density and chemical stress on the life history and PGR of an important ecotoxicological indicator species, Chironomus riparius, under controlled laboratory conditions. Populations were fed the same ration but initiated at different densities and exposed to a solvent control and three concentrations of C-14-cypermethrin in a sediment-water test system for 67 days at 20 +/- 1 degreesC.
   3. Density had a negative effect on all the measured life-history traits, and PGR declined with increasing density in the controls. Exposure to C-14-cypermethrin had a direct negative effect on juvenile survival, presumably within the first 24 h because the chemical rapidly dissipated from the water column. Reductions in the initial larval densities resulted in an increase in the available resources for the survivors. Subsequently, exposed populations emerged sooner and started producing offspring earlier than the controls. C-14-cypermethrin had no effect on estimated fecundity and adult body weight but interacted with density to reduce the time to first emergence and first reproduction. As a result, PGR increased with cypermethrin concentration when populations were initiated at high densities.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results showed that the effects of C-14-cypermethrin were buffered at high density, so that the joint effects of density and chemical stress on PGR were less than additive. Low levels of chemical stressors may increase carrying capacity by reducing juvenile competition for resources. More and perhaps fitter adults may be produced, similar to the effects of predators and culling; however, toxicant exposure may result in survivors that are less tolerant to changing conditions. If less than additive effects are typical in the field, standard regulatory tests carried out at low density may overestimate the effects of environmental chemicals. Further studies over a wide range of chemical stressors and organisms with contrasting life histories are needed to make general recommendations.

AB  - Agricultural land consolidations help solve structural problems caused by land fragmentation. The FAO classifies the impacts of land consolidation at three levels: firstly, there is the micro-level, where land consolidation aims at changing the farm structure. Secondly, there is the meso-level where land consolidation has broader aims of changing rural communities by improving the infrastructure, the natural environment, and the management of natural resources, landscape and, consequently, the spatial distribution of economic activities. Finally, there is the macro-level where the focus is on changes which can positively affect the whole country by reducing the disparities between rural and urban areas. Therefore, one of the advantages arising from the implementation of consolidations should be positive socio-economic changes in rural areas, resulting from the implementation of agricultural land consolidations. In this study, the Authors took on an assessment of the effects of consolidations at the meso-level. Another aim of the study was to identify the effects of consolidations on changes in socioeconomic development of rural areas. A question was raised as to whether there is a correlation between the rate of changes in socio-economic development of rural areas and the implementation of agricultural land consolidations in this area.
   The level of socio-economic development was assessed based on an indicator of the rate of changes, calculated as the difference between the levels of commune development indicator for the years 2004 and 2016. In order to determine the synthetic indicator, one of the taxonomic methods, namely Hellwig's synthetic measure of development, was applied. The study concerned communes of Lubelskie and Malopolskie Voivodeships in which both traditional and infrastructural consolidations had been implemented over an area of at least 15% of the commune's area.
   The study indicates an increase in the level of socio-economic development of the communes in which traditional consolidations were implemented. The study results indicate that the implementation of traditional consolidations of agricultural land is one of the factors contributing to an increase in the level of socio-economic development of rural areas.
   At the same time, it was found that infrastructural consolidations understood as a corrective tool, implemented at the time of the construction of linear infrastructure projects, do not always serve their function of an improvement in the land layout in rural areas. The conducted study indicates that in the communes in which infrastructural land consolidations have been implemented, no improvement in the conditions of socio-economic development has taken place.

AB  - The literature indicates that the presence and activity of microbial biomass could be potential indicators of other changes in mineral soils, making it useful for monitoring and assessing the relationships between plants and soil and their effects on the health and quality of the soil. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine whether if there were any changes in the C and N content or the basal respiration of microbial biomass in soils under black locust trees (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) between 2013 and 2014.
   Samples of topsoil (0-6.5 cm) under the black locust were collected randomly from 12 different locations in 2013, and 12 samples were taken from the same locations in 2014. The C and N contents of the microbial biomass were determined by the chloroform fumigation extraction method. Basal respiration was determined by the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) trap method.
   The results demonstrated that the average C content of microbial biomass (C-mic) increased by about 55 % in soils under black locust and that the average N content (N-mic) of microbial biomass N increased by about 59 %. Both the C-mic and N-mic values were significantly affected by the temporal variation (P < 0.05). The average basal respiration was lower in 2013 than in 2014, i.e., 0.303 and 0.526 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1), respectively; this difference from 2013 to 2014 was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Related to substrate (glucose, protein, carbohydrate, etc.) quality, the average C-mic/C-org (%) of the soils was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in 2013 (5.18 %) than in 2014 (6.86 %). Similarly, the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), on average, also was lower in 2013 (0.96 mg CO2-C g(-1) C-mic h(-1)) than in 2014 (1.10 mg CO2-C g(-1) C-mic h(-1)); however, the difference in the values for the two years was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
   Thus, it was concluded that the effect of black locust on the C and N content and basal respiration of the microbial biomass was due to the combined result of changing microclimatic conditions and soil characteristics, including the temperature, moisture content, pH, organic C, and total N in the soil. Therefore, this tree is an appropriate and valuable species where poor ecological conditions exist because of its rapid growth rate and its positive effect on the health and quality of soil.

AB  - Purpose Alluvial gold mining leaves a vast amount of dredged sediment that covers the natural soil, destroys riparian ecosystems, and impacts riverbeds and valleys. In Colombia, more than 80,000 ha are covered by dredged sediment. Technosols developed from such deposits undergo strong transformations during the early stages of formation due to the diverse nature of the constituents. The aims of this study are (i) to investigate changes in soil morphological and physicochemical properties at early stages of pedogenesis, (ii) to estimate the variability of size structure distribution of the new plant cover as affected by the time period since establishment and deposit type, and (iii) to determine which soil parameters correlate best with the size structure distribution of vegetation. Materials and methods Soil characterization through morphological and physicochemical analysis was conducted on Technosols developed from gravel and sandy deposits of different ages (0-12 years). A vegetation survey was conducted to measure tree dimensions and identify the most common species. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests to avoid the loss of information due to data smoothing. Results and discussion The studied Technosols are subject to processes similar to those occurring in natural parent materials such as mineral transformations, changes in redox conditions, organic matter accumulation in the topsoil, and a rapid differentiation of horizons. However, the Technosols in our study sites show an unusually fast development not often observed in natural soils, with drastic changes observed at very early stages of formation. Gravel deposits offer more favorable conditions for plant growth, and marked changes in pedogenic processes can be observed compared with sandy deposits, which are reflected in changes of chemical properties. Conclusions Factors such as the technology used for mining and the continuous deposition of dredged sediments in a cumulative way during the exploitation period, as well as the disturbances after deposition, result in a high diversity of constituents and high heterogeneity of dredged sediment deposits. Gravel and sand deposits, originated from the same sections of the river and after similar separation processes for ore extraction, undergo divergent pedogenic processes at different rates, which could be explained by a remarkable effect of particle size distribution. For vegetation establishment, the selection of tree species should be based on their capacity for nutrient pumping through deep rooting to sequester carbon and to adapt morphologically to heterogeneity in nutrient availability by growing roots in nutrient-rich zones.

AB  - The objective of the presented paper was the analysis of the technical effectiveness of municipal wastewater treatment plants shown on the example of three selected objects (A, B and C) localized in Wielkopolska and differentiated regarding the technological aspect.
   The wastewater treatment effectiveness was estimated on the basis of the reduction achieved in three basic wastewater treatment parameters, i.e. in general suspension, requirement for chemical oxygen (RCHO) and requirement for biological oxygen (RBO).
   The parameter values were measured both in the raw wastewater and in the purified ones. The difference of these values was divided by the value of the raw wastewater. The received basic indicators were supplemented with two eutrophic properties, i.e. with the reduced values of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. A series of 73 pairs of measurements (in the raw and the purified sewages) were carried out (10 pairs in plant A; 33 pairs in plant B and 29 pairs in plant C). Eutrophic results obtained in plant A included 8 measurements and 7 measurements in plant C.
   The presented work was done basing on the available elaborated designs, on the valid legal regulations and on results of laboratory studies made available by institutions using such objects. Sampling and preparation of samples, as well as chemical determinations were done according to the corresponding regulations valid in the period of the above studies.
   The investigations have shown that municipal wastewater supplied to municipal treatment plants are significantly differentiated regarding the basic quality properties. The maximal value of total suspension ranged between 4.9 and 11,0; In case of chemical oxygen requirements, the values were 4.1-11.1 and in reference to biological oxygen requirements, the range was 2.4-11.5.
   Among the analyzed communes, the worst quality was found in the wastewater supplied to the treatment plants (in 92%) in waste removal carriages. The actual mechanical and biological conditions of the municipal treatment plants permits to obtain a satisfactory effectiveness of their work. The basic parameters of the purified wastewater, in the majority of cases, were contained within the limits of the required standards and according to the legal permissions obtained by the wastewater treatment plants.
   Studies carried out in conditions of Wielopolska did not confirm the conclusions drawn by other authors regarding the technical effectiveness of the "Lemna" type treatment plants. There, in about 50% of measurements, the basic parameters of the purified wastewater did not meet the required standards.
   Since in the balanced environment development, the economic aspect is also very important, therefore, in the analysis referring to the effectiveness of the functioning of municipal wastewater treatment plants, the economic aspect must be also taken into consideration.

AB  - Disturbances are an integral part of forest ecosystems and drive successional change. The boreal forest is adapted to stand-replacing fires, which have different ecological impacts than less severe disturbances, such as insect attacks. In recent years, mountain pine beetle (MPB), a bark beetle native to western North America, has undergone an unprecedented range expansion into lodgepole pine forests in west-central Alberta, Canada. MPB influences understory microclimatic conditions and aboveand below-ground resources, but does not have the direct impacts on ground vegetation and the forest floor that normally accompany wildfire. The objective of this study was to quantify vegetation responses to MPB in forests for which this is a novel disturbance. Our replicated field experiment included an untreated control, medium and high tree mortality (simulated MPB-attack through stem injection of herbicide), and harvesting to simulate salvage logging. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to examine responses of understory vegetation to these treatments from preto seven years posttreatment. The severity of disturbance determined the magnitude of vegetation changes. Only the simulated salvage logging resulted in immediate changes post-treatment. Seven years post-treatment, vascular plant richness increased along the gradient of treatment severity. Total vegetation cover declined in the short term after salvage logging but then returned to pre-treatment levels. Notably, graminoid cover increased with the high-mortality MPB and salvage logging treatment, and remained higher in these two treatments, seven years post-treatment. Changes in species composition were most dramatic for salvage logging followed by the high mortality and then the medium mortality treatments; by seven years post-treatment there were indications that communities were beginning to recover to their pre-treatment composition. Feathermosses were indicative of the untreated control, shade-tolerant species increased their relative abundance in the medium mortality treatment, both shade-tolerant and intolerant species increased their relative abundance in the high mortality treatment, and disturbance-adapted, shade-intolerant species (including lodgepole pine) were indicators of salvage logging. We conclude that stands experiencing medium levels (-50%) of MPB-caused mortality will demonstrate resistance (change less or more slowly) and/or resilience (recover to the pre-disturbance condition more quickly) as compared to those experiencing high levels (-100%) of mortality, which show changes in understory composition that might influence stand successional trajectories. Effects of salvage logging will be much more dramatic than those of the MPB attack. Our results can help inform decisions on management or rehabilitation of stands post-MPB attack.

AB  - "Spatial contraindication" is what exactly landslide susceptibility models have been seeking. They are designed for depicting perilous land activities, be it natural or anthropological. To find this pattern, three well-known machine learning models namely maximum entropy (MaxEnt), support vector machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used accompanied by their ensembles (i.e. ANN-SVM, ANN-MaxEnt, ANN-MaxEnt-SVM, and SVM-MaxEnt) in Wanyuan area, China. The models were designed by eleven conditioning factors such as elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, profile and plan curvatures, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to rivers, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use/land cover (LU/LC), and lithology along with two sets of training (213#) and testing (91#) landslide data. A statistical index (SI) model was implemented to examine the mutual relationship between classes of each factor and the landslide occurrences. Concerning the areal differentiation, the chi-square test was used where SVM and MaxEnt gained the highest and the lowest values, respectively. Afterward, the practicality-as an indicator of producing a focused susceptibility map and addressing highly susceptible classes (IV and V) in a compendious manner with a reduced spatial area-was calculated for models. Accordingly, SVM and MaxEnt were found to be the most and the least practical models having the highest and the lowest spatial area in highly susceptible classes, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to examine generalization and prediction accuracy of the models. As a result, in the case of validating models separately, ANN gained the highest area under the curve (AUC) with a value of 0.824, followed by SVM (0.819), and MaxEnt (0.75). In the case of validating ensemble models, the ANN-SVM had the highest AUG of all (0.826), followed by ANN-MaxEnt (0.803), SVM-MaxEnt (0.792), and ANN-MaxEnt-SVM (0.811). With regard to the premier model results, three factors namely distance from roads, elevation, and distance from rivers had the highest effect on landslide occurrence. The results of the SI values showed that the spatial combination of the main drivers namely farmlands, - 0.06-0.2 range in NDVI, rocks with inter-bedded limestone and other susceptible classes therein can make at least a prone area of about 30% to landsliding. Such spatial combination of environmental condition and human-made activities can be considered as a contraindication for the residents of the study area, especially at highly susceptible locations. This also addresses areas that further mitigation plans should be taken into account with urgency.

AB  - Interaction uncertainties between tidal energy devices and marine animals have the potential to impede the tidal energy industry as it moves closer towards commercial-scale array installations. Developing standardised environmental impact assessment (EIA) practices would allow for potential impact concerns to the marine environment to be identified and mitigated early during project development. In an effort to help formulate a standardised EIA framework that addresses knowledge gaps in fish-current interactions at tidal energy candidate sites, Scherelis et al. [1] presented a case study for investigating changes in fish aggregations in response to changing environmental conditions including tidal currents at a tidal energy candidate site in Australia prior to turbine installation. Here, we present the dataset utilised for this study titled "Investigating biophysical linkages at tidal energy candidate sites: a case study for combining environmental assessment and resource characterisation" [1] . The dataset includes tidal current information from an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), volume backscattering measurements from a four-frequency biological echosounder (Acoustic Zooplankton and Fish Profiler - AZFP) as an indica tor for fish biomass, and fish aggregation metrics calculated from volume backscatter in post-processing. ADCP and AZFP were installed on a bottom-mounted mooring and engaged in a concurrent sampling plan for-2.5 months from Decem-ber 2018 to February 2019. The mooring was deployed in the Banks Strait, a tidal energy candidate site located in the northeast of Tasmania, Australia, at a location favourable for tidal turbine installations considering current speed, depth, substrate, sediment type and proximity to shore. The ADCP dataset includes current velocity and direction measurements at 1 m vertical and 1-min time intervals. The raw AZFP dataset includes volume backscattering strength collected in 4-s time intervals with a vertical resolution of 0.072 m in raw, and 0.1 m in pre-processed form. Several post-processing steps were implemented to mitigate changes in background noise due to current speed and wind stress, and to isolate acoustic fish returns from remaining scattering sources. Once isolated, volume backscatter containing fish targets under-went post-processing to determine fish aggregation metrics including density, abundance, centre of mass, dispersion,% water column occupied, evenness, and index for aggrega-tion. Each aggregation metric was then binned by minute matched with corresponding environmental conditions for current speed, shear, temperature, diel stage, and tidal stage. Raw and processed datasets for the AZFP and ADCP are pro-vided. Post-processed data includes the derived fish aggrega-tion metrics along with corresponding environmental condi-tions. The described datasets are freely available on the Aus-tralian Ocean Data Network (AODN). (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The paleohydrological and sedimentological characteristics of a playa lake in northern Kuwait (Arabian Gulf) are reconstructed using sedimentological, geochemical, and isotopic techniques. The sequence consists of up to 8 cycles of S-poor, alluvial sediments capped by a thin organic soil interbedded with gravity-fall calcrete sediments. The succession is locally derived from mainly Quaternary sediments and is regressive with upsection filling of the subsiding basin by cycles of sheetwash flow in response to climatic change. There is no natural, open-water lake water as indicated by low total organic carbon (TOC) data, but the presence of incised calcrete yardangs suggests that more extensive open-water conditions were operative in the past. Stable isotope (delta O-18 parts per thousand and delta C-13 parts per thousand) values of the authigenic carbonates indicate the following three distinct processes: evaporation, meteoric fluid infiltration, and rapid per-descensum flow (rapid downward movement of water and playa sediment through pipes) through a porous, clastic sequence. Because evaporites are scarce, other factors besides evaporation action control chemical and isotopic compositions of the per-decensum lake fluids. Consequently, the isotopic composition cannot be interpreted exclusively as an indicator of salinity or evaporation ratio. The degassing of CO2 during groundwater discharge may explain the enriched carbon isotope values for the authigenic carbonates precipitated in the sediments. Hydrologically closed lake water bodies tend to show low negative carbonate oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures. Isotopically negative delta C-13 values imply a strong input of soil-zone carbon to the groundwater of the top 60 cm of the sediment. Lakes that are hydrologically closed and evaporate or equilibrate with atmospheric CO2 will tend to have low negative delta O-18 and delta C-13 values in the carbonates as reported by Talbot (Chem Geol: Isotope Geosci Sect 80(4): 261-279, 1990). Biologically active lakes will tend toward lower delta C-13 of dissolved carbon due to the photosynthetic effects of C-12 withdrawal as reported by Dunagan and Driese (J Sed Res 69: 772-783, 1999). Increased biological activity during sedimentation may account for low carbon isotope values where plants were abundant, but in shrinkage-dominated systems (those of clay-rich soil subjecting to wet-dry conditions), carbon isotopes will be largely inherited from the calcretic limestones in the land extending landward of the coast and not influenced by coastal processes (known as hinterland), such as Umm Ar-Rimam depression. This basin does not fit the classic shallow playa-type basins of the Arabian Peninsula but rather the recharge playas of the southwestern USA.

AB  - Chinese loess sequences are interpreted as a reliable record of the past variation of the East Asian monsoon regime through the alternation of loess and paleosols units, dominated by the winter and summer monsoon, respectively. Different proxies have been used to describe this system, mostly geophysical, geochemical or sedimentological. Terrestrial mollusks are also a reliable proxy of past environmental conditions and are often preserved in large numbers in loess deposits. The analysis of the mollusk remains in the Luochuan sequence, comprising L5 loess to S0 soil, i.e. the last 500 ka, shows that for almost all identified species, the abundance is higher at the base of the interval (L5 to L4) than in the younger deposits. Using the present ecological requirements of the identified mollusk species in the Luochuan sequence allows the definition of two main mollusk groups varying during the last 500 kyr. The cold-aridiphilous individuals indicate the so-called Asian winter monsoon regime and predominantly occur during glacials, when dust is deposited. The thermal-humidiphilous mollusks are prevalent during interglacial or interstadial conditions of the Asian summer monsoon, when soil formation takes place. In the sequence, three events with exceptionally high abundance of the Asian summer monsoon indicators are recorded during the L5, L4 and L2 glacial intervals, i.e., at about 470, 360 and 170 kyr, respectively. The L5 and L4 events appear to be the strongest (high counts). Similar variations have also been identified in the Xifeng sequence, distant enough from Luochuan, but also in Lake Baikal further North, to suggest that this phenomenon is regional rather than local. The indicators of the summer monsoon within the glacial intervals imply a strengthened East-Asian monsoon interpreted as corresponding to marine isotope stages 12, 10 and 6, respectively. The L5 and L2 summer monsoons are coeval with Mediterranean sapropels S12 and S6, which characterize a strong African summer monsoon with relatively low surface water salinity in the Indian Ocean. Changes in the precipitation regime could correspond to a response to a particular astronomical configuration (low obliquity, low precession, summer solstice at perihelion) leading to an increased summer insolation gradient between the tropics and the high latitudes and resulting in enhanced atmospheric water transport from the tropics to the African and Asian continents. However, other climate drivers such as reorganization of marine and atmospheric circulations, tectonic, and the extent of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet are also discussed.

AB  - Alnus maritima (seaside alder) is a rare and threatened woody species that occurs naturally as three disjunct subspecies. While its limited numbers and distribution have prompted investigations into the cause of its rarity, the aesthetic appeal and apparent flood resistance of A. maritima have led to a strong interest in its horticultural potential. The occurrence of all three subspecies of A. maritima exclusively in waterlogged soils in nature suggests that water availability may limit both the success of plants in the wild and the potential for their use in landscapes. We conducted three experiments to assess how A. maritima would respond to a wide range of root-zone moisture contents. First, we examined foliar gas exchange and growth of one clone during drought and flooding. Plants survived, grew, and avoided damage to and abscission of leaves during seven treatments that ranged from complete root-zone inundation to severe drought. Partial flooding and slight drought maximized plant dry weight, while total flooding and mild, moderate, and severe drought limited growth. High rates of photosynthesis were sustained except during severe drought. Next, we examined genotypic variation in drought resistance among the subspecies of A. maritima and compared the resistance of A. maritima to that of four other species of Alnus. Only subtle differences were detected among subspecies in how deficit irrigation influenced the physiology and development of plants. Of the five species evaluated, A. maritima and Alnus nepalensis most strongly expressed indicators of drought resistance. Lastly, a field trial with 270 seedlings of subspecies oklahomensis confirmed that A. maritima can be grown on soils with moisture contents ranging from dry (approximate to 10% water by volume) to saturated. We conclude that, even though A. maritima thrives when a portion of its root zone is constantly inundated, it is more drought tolerant than some other species indigenous to well drained soils. The drought resistance of A. maritima can be attributed in part to its continued high rate of photosynthesis, fine control of stomatal conductance, increased specific leaf weight, and increased root:shoot ratio under conditions of drought. Considering the natural habitat to which A. maritima is restricted, our data illustrate that the niche a species occupies in nature does not necessarily represent how adapted the species may be to dissimilar environmental conditions. We also conclude that A. maritima and A. nepalensis show promise for increased use as ornamentals resistant to disparate soil water contents. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lake Manzala remains the largest of the Nile Delta lakes and has undergone substantial recent changes particularly over the last 30 years due to regulation of freshwater inflows, land reclamation and increasing loads of BOD and nutrients. The latter are particularly associated with polluted drains flowing into the lake. An increasing fraction of the N load may also come from the expanding fish farming industry within and around the lake. Over the past 20-25 years, the N load from the drains has increased three times whilst the P load has remained approximately constant. This is despite a 40% reduction in freshwater inflows due to diversion of water towards the Sinai for land development. As a result of these changes, the concentration of total N in the drains has increased 4.5 times while the total P concentration has increased by 50% over the same period. Increases in nutrient concentrations can be attributed to increase in the use of fertilizer combined with an expanding population served by sewers, improved living standards and increased industrial production. Nutrient enrichment has resulted in declining water quality and eutrophication, especially in the southern parts of Lake Manzala. A combined hydrodynamic-ecological model has been set up for the lake and is used to analyse the development of water quality as a function of the load of organic material and nutrients. Model results show that 86% of the N load and 59% of the P load are retained within the lake. Despite the efficient treatment of wastewater by the lake ecosystem, approximately 6,000 tonnes of N and 1,300 tonnes of P are exported to the Mediterranean through the two main lake-sea connections. This nutrient export has important implications for coastal fisheries production. The present investigation suggests that the current anthropogenic nutrient load to the coastal zone exceeds that of pre-Aswan High Dam conditions despite large reductions in the annual pulse of water and nutrients brought about by the dam. A series of model simulations with reduced nutrient load are investigated in order to identify the conditions required to enable the propagation of vegetation throughout the lake. Submerged rooted vegetation is used as an indicator for water quality as it needs light for growth and in polluted, eutrophicated waters turbidity increases hampering vegetation growth. Simulation results indicate that the nutrient load has to be reduced to approximately 25% of the present loads if submerged rooted vegetation is to become re-established in the more polluted south eastern parts of the lake.

AB  - One approach to assessing the competitiveness of invasive species is a comparative analysis of the morphological, physiological, and reproductive traits of this species with native species of the same genus. The invasive species Bidens frondosa L. from the Asteraceae family, included in the list of the 50 most common and most aggressive invasive species in Europe, occupies the same ecological niche as the native species B. tripartita L., and displaces it from natural habitats. There is an obvious and growing interest in the sustainability of B. tripartita and B. frondosa in extreme conditions of existence, one of which is the action of heavy metals. Our research was performed in laboratory conditions with seedlings that developed from seeds collected from populations of the Upper and Middle Volga region. The seeds were germinated in Ni2+ and Cu2+ solutions at various concentrations. At the end of the experiment, morphometric parameters were measured and the index of tolerance was determined. Seedlings from different populations under the influence of nickel ions developed at concentrations of 1-50 mg/l, under the influence of copper ions - at 1-100 mg/l. The nickel and copper ions had the greatest toxic effect on the growth and development of the root system - at 25 mg/l and above, the main root was completely necrotic, while the action of copper ions simultaneously increased the number of adventitious roots. The tolerance index ("root test") under the action of nickel ions was higher among the seedlings from the population of the Middle Volga region, while under the action of copper ions there were no significant differences among the seedlings from different populations. However, it decreased with the action of both heavy metals at a concentration of 10 mg/l. High concentrations of both metals significantly reduced the length of the hypocotyl, cotyledon, and the true leaf. It was also found that copper ions are more toxic for the root system (main root and adventitious roots), nickel ions - for above-ground organs (hypocotyl, cotyledons, and true leaves). We noted differences between the populations to the action of nickel and copper. From the population of the Upper Volga region, the seedlings of B. frondosa were more stable. For seedlings from the population of the Middle Volga, a smaller toxic effect was confirmed for B. tripartita. It can be assumed that the resistance of B. frondosa to the action of heavy metals as a stress factor in the Upper Volga region is one of the reasons for the suppression of B. tripartita by the invasive species.

AB  - The system of industrial agriculture (IA), often implemented on a large scale and with high dependence on the supplies use, is reducing the soil organic matter (SOM) and increasing the glyphosate presence in the environment. An alternative approach to IA is agroecologywhich takes greater advantage of natural processes and beneficial on-farm interactions in order to reduce off-farm input use and to improve the efficiency of farming systems. In this study, a transition agroecological system (AT) is the alternative of the IA. Our objectives were: (i) to compare the agronomic productivity between AT and IA systems, (ii) to determine the effect of management practices on soil quality indicators such as soil organic matter content (SOM), soil bulk density, change in the weighted mean diameter (CMWD) and glyphosate and aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) concentration and (iii) to compare the economic results through a multi-temporal economic analysis between AT and IA systems. The soil sampling was carried out per soil-specific zones, delimited from apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and elevation. Samples were taken at 0 to 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30 and 30 to 40 cm of depth to determine the SOM content, the glyphosate concentration and main glyphosate metabolite, AMPA. Besides, the bulk density (delta(a)) and CWMD were determined. The delta(a) was lower in AT with respect to IA, both under no tillage (NT). No significant differences were found for CWMD between AT and IA systems, although a tendency to a lower value in AT system was observed. If we consider the percentage of organic matter as carbon matter per hectare, this means that in 6.5 years increase 540 kg ha(-1) at 0 to 40 cm depth. The SOM content increased from 4,9 to 5,6% in AT with respect to IA. The content of glyphosate + AMPA at the first 40 cm was 0.06 kg ha(-1) in the AT and 0.84 kg ha(-1) in the IA system. In the AT system, the gross margin accumulated during 6.5 years, increased 244% with respect to IA. These results suggest that the AT system proposed could be applicable in extensive productions with temperate climates without interfering with the livelihood of the agricultural producers and it allows an improvement in soil conditions. It is important to carry out further studies in order to confirm the benefits of the AT system in other edaphic-climatic conditions, integrating productive, economic and environmental aspects.

AB  - This study discusses the concept of natural and managerial disposability from their economic and methodological implications on social sustainability development. Then, it explores their analytical linkages to a concept on "congestion." The concept is classified into Undesirable Congestion (UC) under natural disposability and Desirable Congestion (DC) under managerial disposability. Considering the two disposability concepts, this study compares between Returns to Damage (RTD) under UC and Damages to Return (DTR) under DC Conceptually, UC and DC are conceptually different from RTD and DTR although they are closely related to each other group. An occurrence of the former measures is identified by a single negative multiplier (i.e. dual variable). In contrast, the latter measures are associated with multiple negative multipliers and an intercept of a supporting hyperplane on a production and pollution possibility set. Thus, an occurrence of UC and DC is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition on RTD and DTR, respectively, in terms of the number of negative multipliers on production factors. To document the practicality of the proposed, approach, this study applies it to Chinese economic and environmental assessment for its economic and energy planning for social sustainability development. This study identifies four important findings: First, the Chinese government has historically paid attention to the economic prosperity, but not paying serious attention on the environmental pollution (e.g., air pollution). Second, there was an increasing trend in improving the two components (Le., economic and environmental performance measures) regarding social sustainability. Third, China's economic and energy policy concerns have been focused upon well-developed municipalities (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai) and large provinces. Therefore, it is an important strategy for the government to allocate economic and energy resources to other provinces so that China can reduce the industrial and regional imbalances. As a result, China can enhance the level of social sustainability. Finally, the municipalities need strict regulation on traffic control in these metropolitan areas and a fuel mix shift from coal combustion to natural gas and renewable energies (e.g., solar, water, and nuclear generations). The fuel mix strategy, along with the structure change (e.g., from manufacturing to service and from public to private energy firms), will be a major industrial policy issue for China in near future.

AB  - There are usually three major steps in the study of the possible impact of environmental factors on health: 1) to demonstrate tl-lat there is an association between exposure to the factor and the disease under study; 2) to demonstrate th:lt this association is causal; 3) to evaluate the health benefit that could be obtained by removing the source of exposure. Statistical methods are commonly assumed to provide an objective way of achieving these three steps. This paper reviews some of the conditions that have to be met to allow proper interpretations and to avoid some of the controversies that are often found in health-environment studies. First, it should be remembered that the so-called P value which is used to qualify 'statistically significant' associations between risk factors and diseases does not give any indication of the probability that this association is actual, while far too often it is believed that it does. The probability that atl association between an environmental factor and a disease is real could, however, bu estimated by using Bayesian methods. These methods require that the a priori probabilities be stated, which is difficult to do in practice. Some directions to overcome this difficulty are presented. Second, the analysis of causality cannot be carried out on statistical grounds alone and the so-called 'causality criteria' are of limited practical interest. Definition of what is a cause, and upon which conditions a candidate factor of a disease can be considered as a cause, deserves much research effort, and careful consideration of the huge literature (mostly outside of the epidemiological field, for example in logic) which is devoted to this subject. Finally, the: measurement of the role of 3 factor in a disease is very often assessed through the use of 'attributable fraction' or 'attributable mortality'. This should be done only a hen it is demonstrated that the considered factor is causal. Moreover, the interpretation of attributable fractions to 3 specific factor may be difficult in the (general) case where there are multiple causal factors implied in the development of the disease. Demographic measures of 'potential years (or days, etc.) of life lose' should in general be used, rather than 'numbers of deaths' to quantify the possible impact of environmental factors. Also, as the personal factors are generally extremely important in the determinism of the causes of death associated to environmental factors, and as they cannot be controlled through ecological studies, epidemiological designs where these cofactors can be evaluated individually on cases and controls should be preferred.

AB  - 1. In rivers affected by drought, flow regulation can further reduce flow and intensify its effects. We measured ecological responses to environmental flows, during a prolonged drought in a regulated river (Cotter River), compared with a drought affected, unregulated river (Goodradigbee River) in south-eastern Australia.
   2. Environmental flows in the regulated Cotter River were reduced from a monthly average base flow of 15 MLd(-1) to only 5 MLd(-1), which was implemented as two test flow regimes. Initially, flows were delivered in cycles of 14 days at 3 MLd(-1) followed by 3 days at 14 MLd(-1) and then another 14 days at 3 MLd(-1) to make up the monthly average of 5 MLd(-1). This flow regime continued for 6 months, after which a preliminary ecological assessment indicated deterioration in river condition. Consequently, the flow regime was altered to a cycle of 2 MLd(-1) for 28 days followed by 20 MLd(-1) for either 3 or 4 days. This new flow regime continued for another 5 months.
   3. The ecological outcomes of the test flow regimes were assessed in terms of (i) the provision of available habitat (wetted channel) for aquatic biota; (ii) the accumulation of periphyton; and (iii) the structure and richness of macroinvertebrate assemblages.
   4. Flow of 20 MLd(-1) covered most of the streambed in the Cotter River, thus providing more wetted area and connectivity between habitats than flows of 2, 3 or 14 MLd(-1). Depth and velocity were always less in the Cotter River than in the unregulated Goodradigbee River. Periphyton decreased in the Cotter River during the 2/20 MLd(-1) flow regime, which combined the lowest and greatest test flow volumes, while periphyton did not change significantly in the unregulated river.
   5. The reduced flow in the Cotter River resulted in fewer macroinvertebrates than expected (13) compared with unregulated Goodradigbee sites (19), although the magnitude of the differences did not depend on the test flow releases. Macroinvertebrates in the Cotter River became numerically dominated by Diptera and Oligochaeta, while Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera decreased in abundance.
   6. In the Cotter River, the monthly average flow of 5 MLd(-1) (exceeded 97% of the time preregulation) was insufficient to maintain the macroinvertebrate assemblages in reference condition, regardless of release patterns. However, short-term ecological objectives were achieved, such as reduced periphyton accumulation and increased habitat availability, and the environmental flows maintained the river's ability to recover (resilience) when higher flows returned.

AB  - To reduce chemical inputs while maintaining crop yield, disturbed ecosystem functions must be restored, for example by cover-crops. In these cropping systems, because of competition between species, soil resources must be carefully managed. Dedicated tools and models are needed that account for the adverse effects of the cover-crop on the cash crop in terms of resource availability. Besides classical agronomic calculations of stress indices, which are difficult to generalize and require numerous parameters, recent work in ecology has related plant traits, like the biomass accumulated, to the resource availability during the whole plant cycle. Following such a simple approach, the objectives of this study were (i) to determine the effects of water and nitrogen limitations on banana growth and development and to test whether simple integrated traits can highlight the effects of these stresses on banana growth, (ii) to parameterize a simple generic module of soil water and nitrogen availability linked to SIMBA GROW, the growth module of the banana crop model SIMBA, (iii) to assess the ability of the model to simulate banana growth and development in the environmental conditions of a banana/cover-crop system, with particular attention on the effects of changes in plot temperature on model outputs. Three experiments were conducted on whole production cycles to investigate the effects of different water regimes, different nitrogen fertilization levels, and the cover-crop Neonotonia wightii on banana growth, nutritional status, and date of flowering. Results showed low nitrogen availability affected banana growth only weakly but decreased leaf nitrogen content and delayed flowering. Low water availability delayed flowering and decreased banana growth. In both cases, the delayed flowering allowed longer banana growth, which balanced the negative effect of low availability on the growth rate. The cover-crop modified both the rooting depth of the banana, and thus the amount of resources accessible to the banana roots, and the plot microclimate, especially air temperature. The model correctly reproduced the differences of date of flowering and leaf area index at flowering for a first cycle of production between a bare-soil and a cover-crop system, provided air temperature was reduced by 2-3% due to the cover-crop. To conclude, this study showed that in fairly constant environmental conditions (temperature, radiation and rainfall) a simplified model using resource availability over the growing period and integrated plant traits satisfactorily simulates banana growth in an intercropped system.

AB  - A major part of the ME consumed by ruminants ( MEI) is dissipated as heat. This fraction, called heat production or energy expenditure ( EE), is assayed largely by measuring O-2 consumption ( VO2). Conventional measurement of EE in controlled conditions in chambers does not reflect the complexity of natural, environmental, and social conditions of free-ranging animals. In mammals, most of the measured VO2 is transferred to the tissues through the heart; therefore, regression of heart rate ( HR) against VO2 can be used to estimate the EE of free-ranging animals. The present article reviews the current knowledge on the use of HR for estimating EE. Energy expenditure can be determined from HR measurements, recorded daily over the course of several days, multiplied by the VO2 per beat. When an animal does not perform significant exercise, a constant value of VO2 per beat [ O-2 pulse ( O2P)] measured over a short period ( 10 to 15 min) is used; during exercise, O2P increases, and the regression equation of VO2 against HR is used. Under extreme heat load, HR increases to improve heat dissipation, and O2P decreases; therefore, the effect of heat load on O2P needs to be taken into account. Cold stress that doubles heat production does not affect O2P. Heart rate and EE are highly correlated with MEI, but there is significant individual variation in the relationship; therefore, the daily change in the HR of individual animals can be used as an indicator of changes in the individual energy status of a ruminant, and the average HR of the group can serve in the estimation of the energy status of the group. When O2P is measured, the average group EE is an indication of the energy balance of the whole group. Because the MEI of nondraft animals is the sum of EE and retained energy ( RE), the MEI of free-ranging ruminants can be determined by measurement of EE by the HR method and adding the RE. Similarly, the RE can be determined without slaughtering the animals from measurements of EE and MEI. Soon when devices for automatic HR monitoring of domestic ruminants become available at a reasonable price, continuous monitoring of HR might provide producers with a sensitive tool for identifying changes in the energy status of their animals. This will also significantly help to shorten the time needed to identify health problems of individual animals.

AB  - Simple Summary Cows are sentient beings whose welfare depends on their physical health and how they perceive their living conditions. One scientific approach to this emotional realm is the method of qualitative behavior assessment (QBA) which relies on the animals' body language expressing their affective state. In the present study we were interested whether important health impairments of dairy cows-udder infections and metabolic imbalances-and external aspects including housing, management, and human-animal contact might be associated with the qualitative behavior of the herds. For this purpose, QBA was carried out on 25 dairy farms. Farm data were recorded via interviews and observations, and health data retrieved from official milk recording reports. We found no associations between the included herd health indicators and QBA. However, herds on farms with deep bedded cubicles or straw yards expressed a more positive emotional state compared to farms with raised cubicles. Additionally, on farms with more voluntary stockperson-cow contacts and restraint of cows during main feeding times, possibly reducing competition, more positive QBA scores were found. These results underline that improved housing conditions and more intensive animal care are related to the emotional aspect of animal welfare. The affective state is an integrated aspect of farm animal welfare, which is understood as the animals' perception of their living environment and of their internal biological functioning. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore animal-internal and external factors potentially influencing dairy cows' affective state. For this purpose, qualitative behavior assessments (QBA) describing the animals' body language were applied at herd level on 25 dairy farms. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), scores of PC1 (QBAscores) were determined for further analyses. From monthly milk recordings (MR) one year retrospectively, prevalences of udder and metabolic health impairments were calculated. Factors of housing, management, and human-animal contact were recorded via interviews and observations. A multivariable regression was calculated following a univariable preselection of factors. No associations were found between MR indicators and QBAscores. However, more positive QBAscores were associated with bedded cubicles or straw yards compared to raised cubicles, increased voluntary stockperson contact with the cows, and fixation of cows during main feeding times, the latter contributing to the explanatory model, but not being significant. These results underline the importance of lying comfort, positive human-animal relationship and reduction of competition during feeding for the well-being of dairy cows.

AB  - The Valle di Manche (VdM) section (Calabria, Southern Italy) offers the opportunity to investigate the ostracod turnover along a continuous shelf succession straddling the Early-Middle Pleistocene boundary, and compare it against other paleoenvironmental (i.e., mollusks) and paleoclimatic (Uvigerina peregrina delta O-18) records. High resolution (ca. 1 sample/m) ostracod fauna quantitative data, coupled with gradient analysis (Detrended Correspondence Analysis and non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling), document a strong relationship between changes in faunal composition and lithofacies vertical stacking patterns. The comparison between the mollusk and ostracod-derived ordination data demonstrates that the meio- and macro-faunal turnover is guided by a common complex gradient: bathymetry. The integrated ostracod-mollusk gradient analysis also provides a trend in water depths along the section, highlighting to what extent such multivariate approach can improve the paleoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic interpretation of ancient shallow marine successions. When plotted stratigraphically, ordination major axis sample scores reveal two increasing-decreasing patterns in water depth that fit well with the T-R cycles previously identified. Paleobathymetric estimates combined with the vertical distribution of key ostracod groups (i.e., epiphytic taxa on sandy substrates vs. deep-sea mud related taxa) allow refining depositional trends, stratal stacking patterns and position of previously not well resolved sequence stratigraphic surfaces within each T-R cycle (e.g., Transgressive Surface-TS). Indeed, two rapid increases in water depth values mark the TSs that separate shallowing-upward, progradational (RST) from deepening upward, retrogradational (TST) stratal stacking patterns of shelf deposits. The TSs, which underline fine-grained successions dominated by deep-sea mud-lover taxa, are invariably constrained to the inception of interglacials Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 21 and 19, identified within the VdM section by benthic foraminifera delta O-18 values. Within both the VdM T-R cycles, the deepest conditions (ca. 140 m of water depth) are invariably identified within the Neopycnodonte unit, slightly above the lightest delta O-18 intervals. The overlying decreasing bathymetric trend, coupled with shifts in ostracod ecological groups, allows to identify in the bryozoans lithofacies the stillstand + falling of the relative sea-level, also tracked by a progressively heavier delta O-18 record. More stable paleobathymetric conditions (around 40-45 m of water depth) characterize the overlying silt-sand deposits dominated by epiphytic species and showing the heaviest delta O-18 values.

AB  - An important consideration in forest management to mitigate climate change is the balance between forest carbon (C) storage and ecological sustainability. We explore the effects of management strategies on tradeoffs between forest C stocks and ecological sustainability under five scenarios, three of which included management and two scenarios which provide baselines emulating the natural forest. Managed forest scenarios were: (a) Protection (PROT), i.e., management by suppression of natural disturbance and harvest exclusion; (b) Harvest at a higher rate removing all sustainably available wood (HHARV); (c) Harvest at the lower historical average rate of harvest, AHARV. Both harvest scenarios reflected current forest management practices in the study area, including suppression of natural disturbance and a large (>20% of total) forest area reserved from harvest. Scenarios (d) and (e) simulated "natural" forest with unsuppressed fire at higher (NDH) or lower (NDL) levels and no harvest. Ecological sustainability was evaluated using a coarse filter approach where forest age class and tree species composition were indicators of condition. The study area encompassed 3.4 million hectares of forest in northeastern Ontario at the interface between the temperate hardwood and boreal forest zones. Future forest condition for each scenario was modeled using a timber supply model (SFMM), and C stored in forests and wood products were estimated using the FORCARB-ON model. Forest protection (PROT) resulted in greatest forest C stocks, especially in the near term, but was within 95% of its maximum, becoming saturated within 30 years. Harvesting (HHARV and AHARV) resulted in less forest C stock compared to PROT, however, after 100 years of adding C in wood products to that in regenerating forests total C storage was equivalent or greater than forest C with PROT. In contrast, removing management (NDH and NDL) decreased C relative to any of the management regimes, though in NDL the decrease was delayed for 30 years compared to HHARV. Forest sustainability measured by similarity to natural forest age class was superior with HHARV and AHARV compared to PROT, although no management regime produced a fully natural result. PROT in particular largely lacked younger age classes. All management regimes produced species composition that was near or within the range of natural variation. This analysis provides an example of the types of tradeoffs that can be considered in evaluating the contribution of forests to climate change mitigation, either in a commercial forestry context or in an approach based on protected areas.

AB  - 1. The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that all European waterbodies are assigned to one of five ecological classes, based primarily on biological indicators, and that minimum good ecological quality is obtained by 2015. However, the directive provides only general guidance regarding indicator definitions and determination of boundaries between classes.
   2. We used chemical and biological data from 709 Danish lakes to investigate whether and how lake types respond differently to eutrophication. In the absence of well-defined reference conditions, lakes were grouped according to alkalinity and water depth, and the responses to eutrophication were ordered along a total phosphorus (TP) gradient to test the applicability of pre-defined boundaries.
   3. As a preliminary classification we suggest a TP-based classification into high, good, moderate, bad and poor ecological quality using 0-25, 25-50, 50-100, 100-200 and > 200 mu g P L-1 boundaries for shallow lakes, and 0-12.5, 12.5-25, 25-50, 50-100 and > 100 mu g P L-1 boundaries for deep lakes. Within each TP category, median values are used to define preliminary boundaries for the biological indicators.
   4. Most indicators responded strongly to increasing TP, but there were only minor differences between low and high alkalinity lakes and modest variations between deep and shallow lakes. The variability of indicators within a given TP range was, however, high, and for most indicators there was a considerable overlap between adjacent TP categories. Cyanophyte biomass, submerged macrophyte coverage, fish numbers and chlorophyll a were among the 'best' indicators, but their ability to separate different TP classes varied with TP.
   5. When using multiple indicators the risk that one or more indicators will indicate different ecological classes is high because of a high variability of all indicators within a specific TP class, and the 'one out - all out' principle in relation to indicators does not seem feasible. Alternatively a certain compliance level or a 'mean value' of the indicators can be used to define ecological classes. A precise ecological quality ratio (EQR) using values between 0 and 1 can be calculated based on the extent to which the total number of indicators meets the boundary conditions, as demonstrated from three Danish lakes.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The analysis of Danish lakes has identified a number of useful indicators for lake quality and has suggested a method for calculating an ecological quality ratio. However, it also demonstrates that the implementation of the Water Framework Directive faces several challenges: gradual rather than stepwise changes for all indicators, large variability of indicators within lake classes, and problems using the one out - all out principle for lake classification.

AB  - Saemangeum Reservoir in South Korea is an estuarine system enclosed by a dyke construction, where seawater inflow and retained water outflow are managed by the opening/closing of sluice gates installed in the southern part of the dyke. An exchange of the reservoir water can cause spatiotemporal fluctuations in the salinity and trophic state, which are major drivers determining variation in the composition of biological communities in estuarine systems. Here, we investigated the seasonal and spatial variability in the copepod community and environmental conditions (water temperature, salinity, transparency, chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and Carlson's trophic state index) based on seasonally conducted field monitoring in the Saemangeum Reservoir from July 2013 to January 2018. In addition to the role of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration in structuring the copepod community and diversity, the biological indices of copepods with respect to salinity range and trophic state, were evaluated. The spatiotemporal variability in the salinity and trophic state variables showed contrasting patterns, and chlorophyll a concentration was negatively affected by salinity, indicating that the reservoir water was being highly exchanged with opening of the sluice gates. The mean trophic state index values, however, were constant in the eutrophic state (50-70). Dominant copepods were Acartia (A. hudsonica, A. sinjiensis, Acartia spp.) and Oithona (O. devisee and Oithona spp.), which are common species in eutrophic neritic water. Variation in the copepod community was mainly associated with the seasonal succession of the dominant species rather than a spatial gradient (from around the estuary to the sluice gates); however, site-specific differences in frequencies of several non-dominant species could be detected around the estuary (Sinocalanus tenellus) and the sluice gates (Centropages spp., Tigriopus spp. and Labidocera rotunda). The copepod diversity increased with species-richness from around the estuary to the sluice gates, which could result from variation in the site-specific location of non-dominant species. The frequency of particular species was also able to discriminate in terms of the salinity range (oligohaline: A. pacifica, S. tenellus and A. sinjiensis; mesohaline: Pseudo-diaptomus inopinus; and polyhaline: C. abdominalis and Centropages spp.) and the trophic state (mesotrophic: C. abdominalis, Calanus sinicus and Centropagesspp.; and hypereutrophic: S. tenellus, P. inopinus and Sinocalanus spp.). The findings from this study not only identify the factors determining spatiotemporal variation in the copepod community in the Saemangeum Reservoir, but also expand the applicability of copepods as biological indicators of conditions associated with salinity range and trophic state in other enclosed estuarine systems.

AB  - Several international institutions have defined background or baseline levels to assess heavy metal concentrations on marine sediments in order to use these values as a reference for sediment quality indices. This criterion for marine sediment quality is applied to evaluate the potential risk of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems. However, those values were established using samples collected in large areas which present specific geochemical conditions. Then there may be a lack of accuracy in the results when using these parameters in other areas. In this context, 15 sediment cores (8 cm diameter; 2 m length) were recovered along the 400 km Asturian coastline, which is an area with representative lithological conditions for the Bay of Biscay, to determine more precise baseline levels for marine sediments from the Bay of Biscay. An evaluation of statistical and empirical methods was done to determine which method delivers the best results. Statistical methods such as mean +/- 2SD and median +/- 2* Median Absolut Deviation (MAD) are strongly influenced by outliers and data distributions which make these approaches less robust. Graphic techniques such as Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) avoid the problems that asymmetrical data distributions may cause but introduce a certain level of subjectivity in the results due to the baseline values obtained depending on the researcher's experience. Finally, the Probability Curve (CP) method solves issues which may occur when using other techniques and allows one to establish baseline levels based on different percentiles. Regarding the features of the data analysed in this study, the baselines obtained via the CP method with the 95th percentile appear to be the most accurate for the Bay of Biscay. A wide variation has been found between the new baseline values and other international and national levels. Disparity between those levels and the baselines obtained in this study can be generated by granulometric and geological factors. The notable increase in Hg baseline values with respect to OSPAR Background Concentration values (BCs) (0.05 mu g g(-1) and 0.6 mu g g(-1) respectively) and the huge different with CEDEX levels and new threshold levels (0.35 mu g g(-1) and 1.2 mu g g(-1) respectively) emphasised the relevance of defining specific baselines and threshold levels, as the ones obtained in this study, not only to obtain more precise criteria for marine sediment quality to be used in environmental assessments, but also to propose new threshold levels for the evaluation of dredged material before dumping into ocean sites.

AB  - There is little information on exposure of marine mammals to genotoxic environmental contaminants. The P-32-postlabeling assay has been successfully used to assess exposure to genotoxic polycyclic aromatic compounds in fish and humans. In the present study, a preliminary investigation showed that polycyclic aromatic compound-like DNA adducts were present in hepatic tissues of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi) exposed to petroleum following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. However, for marine mammals, effects from changes in tissue condition on DNA recovery and quality is of concern, because tissue samples are often collected from animals that have been dead for unknown periods of time. To assess the effects of postmortem thermal history on DNA recovery from tissue and on DNA adduct quantitation, samples of harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) hepatic tissue were incubated for up to 10 d at 4 and 30 degrees C. Only traces (<4 mu g) of hepatic DNA were recovered from 200 mg of tissue after incubation at 30 degrees C for 36 h. At 4 degrees C, DNA (50-130 mu g) was recovered from tissue incubated for up to 6 d; whereas DNA recovery at 10 d was minimal. Chromatograms of P-32-labeled DNA digests of liver tissue held at 4 and 30 degrees C and salmon sperm DNA held at 30 degrees C for 2 d had comparable profiles, suggesting that alteration of DNA bases had occurred during incubation of porpoise liver tissue. Moreover, the chromatograms of DNA extracted from liver tissues of harbor porpoises caught incidentally in a northwest Atlantic fishery, packed in ice and sampled several days later also exhibited similar altered DNA structures. Although, altered DNA structures that can interfere with the DNA adduct quantitation were present in autolyzed tissue, changes in the P-32-postlabeling chromatography conditions can decrease the interference. Moreover, in a study with tissues taken from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) immediately postmortem and stored at -80 degrees C until processing, DNA structures associated with tissue breakdown were not observed. The DNA from sea lions, however, had putative age-dependent hepatic DNA modifications, which have a distinctive profile, and must be considered when evaluating exposure of marine mammals to polycyclic aromatic compounds. Overall, the findings showed that with attention to the postmortem thermal history of the tissue samples hepatic DNA adducts, as measured by P-32-postlabeling, have the potential to serve as a biological indicator of exposure of marine mammals to environmental genotoxic compounds.

AB  - The purpose of the research. The research subject purpose is theoretical and practical aspects of the statistical assessment of the green economy potential in the sustainable development context. The methods. The article is based on the categories of theoretical (hypothesis, concept, theory, problem) and empirical (facts, empirical summarizations, empirical dependences) level of the issue, distinctive features of which are: objectivity; categorical character; rationality; testability; high level of generalization; universality and use of special tools and methods of cognition. General scientific and special methods of research are used to achieve the article's purpose and solve its problems, namely: methods of analysis, abstraction and synthesis, induction and deduction, and system structuring method; hypothetico-deductive method; method of historical and logical integrity; method of idealization; methods of classification and system generalization; statistical methods. Considering that further"greening"of socio-economic indicators constitutes a vital problem remaining on the agenda of global and national institutes of development, the article's objective is to develop an integral approach to the revision of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) built by the UN approach, through comparing existing approaches to the statistical assessment of the green economy state and the green growth potential, taking into account the proposed energy indices and indicators. Results. It is demonstrated that because none of the integral indicators of green economy" development has been widely adopted by now, national and international statistics have no grounds for separating green goods and services as a specific sector of the national economy. Practical implications. The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) has been adopted as a basic tool for the assessment of indicators reflecting the causal links between the economy and the environment. It is substantiated that most part of the data for measuring green growth processes has to be possibly collected by SEEA. Value/originality. The importance of the assessment of the dynamics of national economy greening is demonstrated, because this type of analysis enables one to assess the change in the environmental impact of the new economic model by analyzing the factors and identifying most effective methods for decreasing environmental pressures of economic activities. The advantage of such assessment is that it can be made on the basis of the available statistical data. Considering that energy indices and indicators are widely used in many international reporting systems to assess the state of green economy and the potential of green growth in the sustainable development context, we made an attempt to systematize all the indicators by the two main groups: direct and indirect. It is revealed that international organizations (OECP, UNEP and the World Bank) attempt to unify the existing approaches in constructing their own algorithms for the assessment of green growth", in particular with the indicators of Sustainable Development Goals. At the same time, national statistical agencies attempt to build a set of statistical indicators for the assessment of green economy development as indicators of demand for green products.
   It is demonstrated that harmonized definitions of economic activities concerned with the green industry and green jobs and comparable key indicators, if used internationally, will enable for the statistical assessment of the green economic development in space and time.

AB  - Linkages between geology and fish assemblages have been inferred in many regions throughout the world, but no studies have yet investigated whether fish assemblages differ across geologies in Mesoamerica. The goals of our study were to: 1) compare physicochemical conditions and fish-assemblage structure across 2 geologic types in headwaters of the Monkey River Basin, Belize, and 2) describe basin-scale patterns in fish community composition and structure for the benefit of conservation efforts. We censused headwater-pool fishes by direct observation, and assessed habitat size, structure, and water chemistry to compare habitat and fish richness, diversity, evenness, and density between streams in the variably metamorphosed sedimentary geologic type typical of 80% of Belize's Maya Mountains (the Santa Rosa Group), and an anomalous extrusive geologic formation in the same area (the Bladen Volcanic Member). We also collected species-presence data from 20 sites throughout the basin for analyses of compositional patterns from the headwaters to the top of the estuary. Thirty-nine fish species in 21 families were observed. Poeciliids were numerically dominant, making up 39% of individuals captured, followed by characins (25%), and cichlids (20%). Cichlidae was the most species-rich family (7 spp.), followed by Poeciliidae (6 spp.). Habitat size and water chemistry differed strongly between geologic types, but habitat diversity did not. Major fish-assemblage differences also were not obvious between geologies, despite a marked difference in the presence of the aquatic macrophyte, Marathrum oxycarpum (Podostemaceae), which covered 37% of the stream bottom in high-nutrient streams draining the Santa Rosa Group, and did not occur in the low-P streams draining the Bladen Volcanic Member. Correlation analyses suggested that distance from the sea and amount of cover within pools are important to fish-assemblage structure, but that differing abiotic factors may influence assemblage structure within each geologic type. The fauna showed weak compositional zonation into 3 groups (headwaters, coastal plain, and nearshore). Nearly 20% of the fish species collected have migratory life cycles (including Joturus pichardi, Agonostomus monticola, and Gobiomorus dormitor) that use freshwater and marine habitats. Some of these species probably rely on a natural flow regime and longitudinal connectivity for reproduction and dispersal of young, and natural flow regime and longitudinal connectivity are important factors for maintenance of functional linkages between the uplands and the coast in the ridge-to-reef corridor where the Monkey River is located. Therefore, we suggest that the viability of migratory fish populations may be a good biological indicator of upland-to-estuary connectivity important both to fishes and coastal ecosystem function. We recommend follow-up studies to substantiate the relative strengths of relationships between community structure and abiotic factors in contrasting geologies and to examine potential bottom-up responses of stream biota to the higher nutrient levels that were observed in stream waters draining the Santa Rosa Group geologic type.

AB  - Environmental dispersion and transformation of mercury discharged from gold mining operations has been investigated in field and laboratory studies in order to provide better understanding of the degree of mercury (Hg) pollution and bioavailability in the Lake Victoria goldfields (LVGF) ecosystems. This paper reviews results already published elsewhere and presents additional data on Hg dynamics in the LVGF. Studies conducted at the Mugusu and Rwamagaza artisanal mines indicated different degrees of Hg contamination and dispersion in environmental matrices. Mercury concentration in contaminated river sediments near the Mugusu mine varied from 6.0 to 0.5mg/kg on a dry weight basis. The highest Hg contamination levels (165-232mg/kg) were associated with mine tailings at the Rwamagaza mine. Mercury concentrations in fish representing different dietary habits on the southwestern shore of Lake Victoria at the Nungwe Bay were very low (2-35 mu g/kg) and thought to represent background levels. These and other results suggested that the use of Hg in gold extraction in the LVGF has not caused high Hg levels in lake fish. The study of Hg in lichens showed Parmelia lichen to be an effective bioindicator for atmospheric Hg contamination due to Hg emissions from gold-amalgam firing and purification operations. The Hg levels in the lichens around the Mugusu mine ranged from 3.1 to 0.1 mu g/g; the highest levels were recorded in the lichens sampled close to gold-amalgam processing sites. The regional background level in the Parmelia lichen was 0.05-0. 10 mu g/g, with a mean level of 0.07 mu g/g.
   which indicated that oxidation and methylation of metallic Hg in the tailings occurred at significant levels under tropical conditions. Re-equilibration of the tailings with freshwater (FW) indicated the MeHg was firmly bound in the tailings and therefore very little MeHg was released to the water column (0.2-1.5 ng/L). The methylation of Hg in tropical loamy clay soil contaminated with HgCl2 (5 mg Hg/kg) yielded MeHg concentrations of 11 and 14 ng/g when inundated with seawater and FW, respectively, for 4 weeks. Little MeHg was transferred from the soil to the equilibrated water (<= 0.4 ng/L). Atmospheric exposure of the soil pre-inundated with FW resulted in net degradation of MeHg during the 1 st week of exposure, followed by net production and accumulation of MeHg in the soil (up to 15.5 ng/g) during atmospheric desiccation. Mercury uptake by fish from the Hg-0-contaminated aquatic sediment tailings system in the aquarium experiment was found to be low, suggesting the low availability of MeHg for bioaccumulation in the system. These and other results provide useful insights into Hg transformation, mobility and bioavailability in tropical aquatic systems affected by Hg pollution from gold mining operations.

AB  - This overview of relationships between biodiversity and management focuses on Central European Fagus forests. Present management and conservation activities are embedded in the geographic and historic background of Central European forest flora, including endangered, protected, and plant species for which Germany has taken special responsibility to ensure their future survival. Managed and unmanaged forests are compared with respect to plants and other organisms. Based on the floristic background, management for climate change and consequences of conservation on a global ecological footprint will be discussed.
   The Central European tree flora contains only about 7% of the tree diversity of East Asia. Only a few genera re-migrated to Central Europe after the Pleistocene, while others were lost during the Pleistocene, e.g. the genus Pseudotsuga.
   In this study the forest flora is characterized by specialized plant species that only grow in forests. These forest specialists contribute only 10% of the plant species of the total German flora. This fraction is even less (4-5%) for Romania which is generally regarded as a region with close to "natural" forest conditions. Also, the forest flora of Germany and Romania contains fewer apomictic and hybrid plant species than the non-forest flora. No forest plant species have gone extinct in Germany in the past 250 years, which is the time since the first floristic documentation of a plant species that was lost in Thuringia, despite intense forest use including changes in dominant tree species.
   With respect to the Natura 2000 goals of maintaining species diversity of Europe, the deciduous forest, as managed by rotation forestry, contain more protected and endangered species, and species for which Germany has taken responsibility than protected forest. Forests managed with permanent forest cover (so-called "management close-to-nature") contain fewer plant species than age-class (rotation) forestry. The abundance of dead wood-fungi and of soil bacteria is higher in rotation forest than in protected forests. For the initial phase of decay, a dead wood experiment identified two important tree species, Carpinus betulus and Picea abies, as the most preferred tree species for xylobionts. Carpinus has the most diverse fungal flora among all wood types and is a typical species for managed forests.
   The Natura 2000 habitat types were defined by plant species, but the assessment of ecosystem health is based on bird species in Central Europe. A time series extending from 1927 until 2015 indicates that most non-migratory forest bird species show an increasing abundance since 1970. Adding migrating and rare bird species populations resulted in constant average abundances since 1970. There is no evidence that sustainable forest management has led to decreased biodiversity in Central Europe. In view of climate change and increasing presence of tree diseases, Europe should avoid enlarging its ecological footprint by taking Central European forests out of management.

AB  - This article deals with the interrelation of ecological and economic aspects through the use of indicators. Two aspects are painted out: the first being the measurement of the economic value of ecological services, and the second being the integration of economic aspects into comprehensive indicator systems.
   The measurement of the economic value provides a means of determining consumer-orientated values of landscapes and bio-diversity issues. This measurement, however, is viewed critically by some, especially in nature conservancy circles. For them the intrinsic values of a landscape, which cannot be measured in economic terms, play the central role in the assessment of landscapes [Oekonomische Bewertungsgrundlagen und die Grenzen einer 'Monetarisierung' der Natur. In: Theobald, W. (Ed.), Integrative Umweltbewertung. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp.95-117]. On the other hand, Braeuers [Money as an indicator: to make use of economic evaluation for biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosys. Environ.], whose article presents an overview of current economic assessment methods, provides an alternate point of view. Braeuer [Money as an indicator: to make use of economic evaluation for biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] argues that through the inclusion of monetary values into the assessment process the whole issue can remain on a factual level. The article by Gerowitt et al. [Rewards for ecological goods-requirements and perspectives for agricultural land use. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] even goes further and suggests that a market oriented system be implemented for environmental goods.
   In contrast to the subjective measurement of economic value, land use models are based on "objective" expertise. Aim of the articles in this sector is to analyse the enhancement of scientific models by economic aspects. These models would then be used to verify the feasibility of ecological motivated land use claims. The results would form the basis for political decision making by a society. The model of Meyer-Aurich and Zander [Consideration of biotic environmental quality targets in agricultural land use-a case study from the biosphere reserve Schorfheide-Chorin. In: Buechs, W (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] reviews land use decision making on the operational level, while the model of Herrmann et al. [Threshold values for nature protection areas as indicators for bio-diversity-a regional evaluation of economic and ecological consequences. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] reviews decision making at a regional level. The concluding article by Kantelhardt et al. [Is there a reliable correlation between hedgerow density and agricultural site conditions? In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] attempts to correlate selected different economic and ecological indicators. The key issue here being how farmers can be compensated for the conservation and preservation of landscapes.

AB  - There is a growing concern that land use intensification is having negative effects on semi-natural grasslands and that it leads to a general loss of biodiversity among all types of formerly extensively managed grasslands of poor to medium nutrient richness. Since the 1950s, many Central European uplands have been subject to an increase in grassland cover as a result of changes in land use practices. Using such a landscape in Lower Saxony, Germany, as a model region, we assessed environmental factors that control grassland diversity, including plant community composition, species richness and pollination trait composition. In 2007, 189 vegetation sampling sites were randomly distributed among grasslands covering some 394 ha within a 2500 ha study area. Plant communities were classified using TWINSPAN and the effects of environmental factors (soil, topography, current management and habitat continuity) were analysed by canonical correspondence analysis and regression analysis reducing for the effects of spatial autocorrelation by using principal coordinates of neighbour matrices.
   We found a wide range of six species-poor (<15 plant spp.) to extremely species-rich (>27 spp.) grassland types under mesic to dry site conditions, including sown, Cynosurion,Arrhenatherion and semi-natural grasslands. Grassland community composition was best explained by soil factors and species richness and pollination type composition by combined effects of current management and habitat continuity. During the 1950/60s, the extent of grassland area within the studied landscape rapidly increased to more than double its previous extent, and in 2007, grasslands comprised 16%. Natura 2000 grassland types comprised 1% of the surveyed site and medium-rich, high-nature-value grasslands a further 5%. While the number of wind-pollinated plant species was equal among all grassland types, there was a parallel decline in insect-pollinated plants and overall median species richness in the grassland communities along a gradient of increasing land use intensity (mowing, nutrient supply). Moreover, insect-pollinated plants occurring in intensively managed grasslands were found to additionally have the ability for self-pollination. Species-rich grasslands - including semi-natural grasslands and a semi-improved, species-rich Arrhenatherion community - occurred exclusively on old sites (with >100 years of habitat continuity) that had been used for traditional sheep grazing (environmental contracting). Medium-rich Arrhenatherion grasslands were established primarily on less productive, formerly arable fields (<30 years). We conclude that conservation efforts should focus on extant species-rich grassland types and should aim to implement traditional land use practices such as sheep grazing. Additional restoration efforts should focus on establishing new grasslands on less productive sites in the proximate surroundings of species-rich grasslands to facilitate seed dispersal, but nitrogen deposition should be buffered where appropriate. These measures would enhance the interaction between nature reserves and agricultural grasslands and thus improve the ecological quality of grasslands at the landscape scale. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Predicting consequences of ocean deoxygenation and ocean acidification for nearshore marine ecosystems requires baseline dissolved oxygen (DO) and carbonate chemistry data that are both high-frequency and high-quality. Such data allow accurate assessment of environmental variability and present-day organism exposure regimes. In this study, scales of DO and pH variability were characterized over one year in a nearshore kelp forest ecosystem in the Southern California Bight. DO and pH were strongly, positively correlated, revealing that organisms on this upwelling shelf are not only exposed to low pH but also to low DO. The dominant scale of temporal DO and pH variability occurred on semi-diurnal, diurnal and event (days-weeks) time scales. Daily ranges in DO and pH at 7 m water depth (13 mab) could be as large as 220 mu mol kg(-1) and 0.36 units, respectively. Sources of pH and DO variation include photosynthesis within the kelp forest ecosystem, which can elevate DO and pH by up to 60 mu mol kg(-1) and 0.1 units over one week following the intrusion of high-density, nutrient-rich water. Accordingly, highly productive macrophyte-based ecosystems could serve as deoxygenation and acidification refugia by acting to elevate DO and pH relative to surrounding waters. DO and pH exhibited greater spatial variation over a 10 m increase in water depth (from 7 to 17 m) than along a 5 km stretch of shelf in a cross-shore or alongshore direction. Over a three-month time period, mean DO and pH at 17 m water depth were 168 mu mol kg(-1) and 7.87, respectively. These values represent a 35% decrease in mean DO and 37% increase in [H+] relative to near-surface waters. High-frequency variation was also reduced at depth. The mean daily range in DO and pH was 39% and 37% less, respectively, at 17m water depth relative to 7 m. As a consequence, the exposure history of an organism is largely a function of its depth of occurrence within the kelp forest. With knowledge of local alkalinity conditions and high-frequency temperature, salinity, and pH data, we estimated pCO(2) and calcium carbonate saturation states with respect to calcite and aragonite (Omega(calc) and Omega(arag)) for the La Jolla kelp forest at 7 m and 17 m water depth. pCO(2) ranged from 246 to 1016 mu atm, Omega(calc) was always supersaturated, and Omega(arag) was undersaturated at the beginning of March for five days when pH was less than 7.75 and DO was less than 115 mu mol kg(-1). These findings raise the possibility that the benthic communities along eastern boundary current systems are currently acclimatized and adapted to natural, variable, and low DO and pH. Still, future exposure of coastal California populations to even lower DO and pH may increase as upwelling intensifies and hypoxic boundaries shoal, compressing habitats and challenging the physiological capacity of intolerant species.

AB  - We intended to choose an indicator group to better represent the biodiversity in man-made tropical ponds. For these propose we tested the congruence pattern among several aquatic communities. Two explanations have been previously proposed for the congruence among different taxa: (i) that different taxa have the same responses to environmental gradients (Padial et al., 2012a); or (ii) that congruence occurs because of ecological interactions among different groups, for instance, the relationships between predators and prey (Larsen et al., 2012). We hypothesized that the communities that depend directly on both water and land are likely more congruent with each other (e.g., amphibians, Odonata (in part), and macrophytes) than those that live in only one of these habitats (e.g., phytoplankton, aquatic insects, and birds). Although the congruency found for them was weak, amphibians were able to partially represent patterns in the abundance of Coleoptera, Heteroptera, and macrophytes. In terms of richness, macrophytes were able to partially represent patterns in Odonata, Coleoptera and birds. In this way, at least for abundance, our results partially supported the hypothesis that the biotic communities that depend directly on both water and land (e.g., amphibians and macrophytes) are more congruent with each other than those living only in one of these environments.Ultimately, we do not recommend the use of a single surrogate taxon to measure biodiversity: weak overall congruence between taxa; limited biological knowledge about tropical artificial ponds; and numerous taxa whose diversity patterns could not be represented by any surrogate group (phytoplankton, Heteroptera, and birds) illustrate the unsuitability of this approach.
   The use of biodiversity surrogates is often suggested to increase the cost-effectiveness of biomonitoring programs, as this demands less time and taxonomic expertise. In addition, the detection of multi-taxon associations is a first step toward a better understanding of how organisms interact with each other. Such a multi-taxon association is termed a congruence, and can be detected through measuring the similarity in the distributional patterns shown by different biological groups. To assess the ability of different taxa to serve as surrogates for others, we carried out a Procrustes analysis on the beta diversity patterns of seven biological groups (aquatic birds, Amphibians, Macrophytes, Coleoptera, Odonata, Heteroptera and phytoplankton) in 35 ponds of the Cerrado biome. We found that: (i) the values of congruence in the studied ponds were weak; (ii) among all the biological groups compared, the highest congruence was found between amphibians and macrophytes; (iii) amphibians were congruent with the Coleoptera, Heteroptera, and macrophytes; (iv) the different taxa studied had different responses to environmental conditions; and (v) although they showed relatively weak congruence with the other taxa in each pond environment, amphibian communities were the most strongly influenced by environment variables. Almost all the communities observed in these systems showed unique pattern and thus should be studied and monitored in their entirety.

AB  - Evaluations of the ecological consequences of environmental accidents can benefit from a long-term perspective. To assess the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on habitat use and occupancy during midsummer by marine-oriented birds over a 12-yr period following the spill in 1989, we conducted surveys in 10 study bays in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. These bays varied from completely unoiled to some of the most heavily oiled locations in the spill zone. We used oiling as a quantitative variable with and without habitat measures as covariates to assess spill effects and their changes over time. We also used oiling as a categorical variable ("oiled" vs. "unoiled" bays) to conduct between-year, repeated-measures analyses that used 1984 data as a baseline and to plot abundance trends by oiling category. We combined the results of these analyses in a "weight-of-evidence" approach to determine overall impacts and recovery for each species. To assess changes in habitat condition following the oil spill, we also measured several habitat features in 1991, 1998, and 2001.
   There were significant increases in the proportion of shoreline covered by rockweed (Fucus) and mussels in oiled bays between 1991 and 1998-2001, suggesting recovery of oiled habitats. Of the 25 bird species whose status we evaluated, 12 (48%) exhibited no evidence of any spill impacts, 10 (40%) exhibited negative impacts that subsequently disappeared, and three (12%) exhibited positive relationships with oiling that later disappeared. No species provided clear evidence of any delayed impacts. In comparison with our earlier analysis of a more extensive data set collected from these same study bays during 1989-1991, we detected slightly more initial spill impacts in the present study but also found that several species whose habitat occupancy had not recovered by the end of our earlier study had now recovered. Our conclusions differ from those of some other studies of the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on birds, perhaps because of differences in study design, in the criteria used to assess impact and recovery, and in the definition of "recovery." These differences illustrate the difficulties of evaluating the consequences of environmental accidents, even in such a dramatic and well-studied situation as the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   Long-term studies of environmental accidents create a paradox: the long-term perspective is needed to see how impact and recovery dynamics are played out, yet background natural variation can make it increasingly difficult to detect clear patterns. With the passage of time after an environmental accident, more things happen, making it more difficult to attribute observed patterns to the event alone. Consequently, long-term assessments of ecological impacts may be restricted to documenting only large effects; the use of a levels greater than the traditional 0.05 can facilitate such analyses and reduce the likelihood of committing type II errors.

AB  - [1] Predictions of global circulation models (GCMs) that account for increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere show that warming in the Arctic will be amplified in response to the melting of sea ice and snow cover. There is now conclusive evidence that much of the Arctic has warmed in recent decades. Northern Alaska is one region where significant warming has occurred, especially during winter and spring. We investigate how the changing climate of northern Alaska has influenced the annual cycle of snow cover there and in turn, how changes in snow cover perturb the region's surface radiation budget and temperature regime. The focus is on Barrow, Alaska, for which comprehensive data sets exist. A review of earlier studies that documented a trend toward an earlier disappearance of snow in spring is given. Detection and monitoring activities at Barrow are described, and records of snow disappearance from other sites in the Alaskan Arctic are compared. Correlated variations and trends in the date of final snowmelt (melt date) are found by examining several independent time series. Since the mid-1960s the melt date in northern Alaska has advanced by 8 days. The advance appears to be a consequence of decreased snowfall in winter, followed by warmer spring conditions. These changes in snowfall and temperature are attributed to variations in regional circulation patterns. In recent decades, there has been a higher frequency of northerly airflow during winter that tends to diminish snowfall over northern Alaska. During spring, however, intrusions of warm moist air from the North Pacific have become more common, and these tend to accelerate the ablation of snow on the North Slope of Alaska. One result of an earlier melt date is an increase in the net surface radiation budget. At Barrow, net radiative forcing can exceed 150 W m(-2) on a daily basis immediately following the last day of snowmelt, and as a result of an 8-day advance in this event, we estimate an increase of similar to2 W m(-2) on an annual basis. Our results are in general agreement with earlier analyses suggesting that reductions in snow cover over a large portion of the Arctic on an annual basis have contributed to a warming of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). In addition, the terrestrial ecosystems of the region are very sensitive to snow cover variations. There is growing concern that these perturbations are anthropogenically forced and adapting to these environmental changes will have significant social and economic consequences. While observed decreases in NH snow cover are in broad agreement with GCM simulations, our analyses suggest that internal (or natural) shifts in circulation patterns underlie the observed variations. Continued monitoring and further study is needed to determine whether the earlier disappearance of snow cover in spring in northern Alaska is an indicator of greenhouse-forced global warming or is a manifestation of a more natural, long-term cycle of climate change.

AB  - Although karst systems comprise approximately 5%-20% of the Earth's ice-free land surface, only 10% of them have so far been explored. Karst caves are important components of karst systems and represent one of the most unique and poorly understood ecosystems on Earth. They are extreme environments in terms of nutrition deficiency, permanent darkness, and isolation from other ecosystems, and serve as a natural laboratory to study the deep biosphere. Caves are also ideal places to discover microbial dark matter such as microbial biodiversity and novel metabolic pathways and metabolites. Microorganisms in caves have been demonstrated to be involved in the dissolution and formation of minerals, biogeochemical cycles. and degradation of organic matter and thus have a fundamental role in sustaining the cave ecosystems. However, knowledge about microbial distribution, diversity, potential functions, and interactions in subsurface caves has remained limited to date particularly in different niches, which limits the utilization of microbial resources and hampers our understanding of biogeochemical processes in the deep biosphere. To address these issues. bacterial communities from seven different niches including cave wall, weathered crust_ loose sediments, biofilms from the wet surface of stalagmite, biofilms from the dry surface of stalagmite, microbial mat on rock surface, and overlying soils in the Xincuntun Cave. Southwest China_ were investigated via high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics. Alpha diversities of bacterial communities significantly differed from one niche to the other. Specifically, bacterial diversity was the highest in the overlying soil, followed by those in weathering crust, sediments, wet surface of stalagmite, cave wall, dry surface of stalagmite, and microbial mat. Bacterial communities were dominated by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and showed high specificity for their niches as indicated by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and bacterial indicator groups identified by the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Nitrospira and Polycyclovoran were indicator genera on the dry surface of stalagmite. Candidatus Udaeobacter, Vicinamibacter, Bacillus, and Longimicrobium were indicator genera in overlying soils, microbial mat, sediments, and weathering crust, respectively. Redundancy analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between environmental factors and bacterial communities. Results showed that pH, TOC, and Mg/Si (chemical weathering index) were of significance to construct bacterial communities. The pH had significantly positive association with Gammaproteobacteria. Rokubacteria, and Nitrospirae, whereas it was negatively related with Actinobacteria. TOC had a significantly positive correlation with Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Planctomycetes and negative correlation with Acidobacteria. Bacterial interactions among different groups were analyzed via co-occurrence networks. The results indicated a high-modularity network with Gammaproteobacleria, Candidatus Udacobacter, and Thermoleophilia, being the top-duce keystone members, which may contribute to the stability of microbial network. The high proportion of positive links between nodes inferred fundamental cooperation among different microbial groups surviving under the extreme conditions in karst caves.
   Our results revealed habitat specificity of bacterial communities, microbial interactions, and environmental driving forces for bacterial communities in the Xincuntun Cave, enhancing our understanding of the deep terrestrial biosphere.

AB  - Aim: (a) To determine the spatial distributions and levels of major and minor elements, as well as heavy metals, in water, sediment, and biota (plant and fish) in Al-Hammar Marsh, southern Iraq, and ultimately to supply more comprehensive information for policy-makers to manage the contaminants input into the marsh so that their concentrations do not reach toxic levels. (b) to characterize the seasonal changes in the marsh surface water quality. (c) to address the potential environmental risk of these elements by comparison with the historical levels and global quality guidelines (i.e., World Health Organization (WHO) standard limits). (d) to define the sources of these elements (i.e., natural and/or anthropogenic) using combined multivariate statistical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (AHCA) along with pollution analysis (i.e., enrichment factor analysis)
   Methods: Water, sediment, plant, and fish samples were collected from the marsh, and analyzed for major and minor ions, as well as heavy metals, and then compared to historical levels and global quality guidelines (WHO guidelines). Then, multivariate statistical techniques, such as PCA and AHCA, were used to determine the element sourcing.
   Results: Water analyses revealed unacceptable values for almost all physiochemical and biological properties, according to WHO standard limits for drinking water. Almost all major ions and heavy metal concentrations in water showed a distinct decreasing trend at the marsh outlet station compared to other stations. In general, major and minor ions, as well as heavy metals exhibit higher concentrations in winter than in summer. Sediment analyses using multivariate statistical techniques revealed that Mg, Fe, S, P, V, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Br, Cd, Ca, N, Mn, Cr, and Pb were derived from anthropogenic sources, while Al, Si, Ti, K, and Zr were primarily derived from natural sources. Enrichment factor analysis gave results compatible with multivariate statistical techniques findings. Analysis of heavy metals in plant samples revealed that there is no pollution in plants in Al-Hammar Marsh. However, the concentrations of heavy metals in fish samples showed that all samples were contaminated by Pb, Mn, and Ni, while some samples were contaminated by Pb, Mn, and Ni.
   Discussion and conclusions: Decreasing of Tigris and Euphrates discharges during the past decades due to drought conditions and upstream damming, as well as the increasing stress of wastewater effluents from anthropogenic activities, led to degradation of the downstream Al-Hammar Marsh water quality in terms of physical, chemical, and biological properties. As such properties were found to consistently exceed the historical and global quality objectives. However, element concentration decreasing trend at the marsh outlet station compared to other stations indicate that the marsh plays an important role as a natural filtration and bioremediation system. Higher element concentrations in winter were due to runoff from the washing of the surrounding Sabkha during flooding by winter rainstorms. Finally, the high concentrations of heavy metals in fish samples can be attributed to bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes.

AB  - The ghost crab Ocypode quadrata is a relevant species in the Western Atlantic beaches, and has been proposed as an indicator of human impact in these ecosystems. Eventhough some studies have covered various aspects of its natural history, no evaluations on the effects of human disturbance on its population dynamics have been made. This work compared the abundance, growth, and mortality of O. quadrata in two disturbed beaches (Aventuras and Majahual) and two preserved beaches (Xcacel and Puerto Angel) from the Mexican Caribbean. For this, nine samplings were made on each beach (every two to three months) between March 2013 and November 2014. Crabs were collected manually by three people, during the night first hours and for one hour, and a total area of 9 000 m(2) per beach. The crabs were measured, weighed, and separated into three groups: juvenile, male and female; while abundance was estimated by the number of collected crabs, and growth parameters were estimated using length frequencies. A total of 1 047 crabs were sampled in the four beaches; a higher crab abundance was found in the preserved beaches, but significant differences were only found between Puerto Angel and Majahual (Tukey, p<0.05). The adult juvenile ratio was 1:1 in Xcacel and Aventuras, while in Majahual, more juveniles than adults were collected; and Puerto Angel had more adults than the juveniles. The size structure at Xcacel ranged from 4-32 mm, but in the rest of the beaches the minimum size was 5 mm. The maximum size at Aventuras, Majahual and Puerto Angel were 27 mm, 25 mm and 30 mm, respectively. The modal progression analysis of length's pooled data, revealed the presence of at least two groups of ages in all beaches. For all beaches, individuals smaller than 10 mm length were collected in almost all sampling months, indicating a continuous recruitment throughout the year. The length-weight relationship of the ghost crab was found isometric in the two preserved beaches, and negative allometric at the two impacted beaches. Crabs from Puerto Angel showed the highest body condition (Tukey, p<0.05). K-values ranged from 0.6-0.97/year and Lao from 29.0 mm to 33.6 mm with higher values for the two preserved beaches. The highest mortality values were found in Xcacel and Aventuras. In the disturbed beaches, the destruction of the dunes, the mechanical cleaning and the removal of organic matter, seem to be the main causes that lead to a low abundance of crabs, their slower growth and higher mortalities. However, in the best preserved beaches, biological interactions appear to be the most important aspects in regulating the population dynamics of this species. These results supported the information that the ghost crab is a good indicator of human disturbance, and its population changes were clearly measurable and comparable among protected and impacted beaches; these results are also relevant for the management of sandy beaches in the Mexican Caribbean.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Land use by agriculture, forestry, mining, house-building or industry leads to substantial impacts, particularly on biodiversity and on soil quality as a supplier of life support functions. Unfortunately there is no widely accepted assessment method so far for land use impacts. This paper presents an attempt, within the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, to provide a framework for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of land use.
   Main Features. This framework builds from previous documents, particularly the SETAC book on LCIA (Lindeijer et al. 2002), developing essential issues such as the reference for occupation impacts; the impact pathways to be included in the analysis; the units of measure in the impact mechanism (land use interventions to impacts); the ways to deal with impacts in the future; and bio-geographical differentiation.
   Results. The paper describes the selected impact pathways, linking the land use elementary flows (occupation; transformation) and parameters (intensity) registered in the inventory (LCI) to the midpoint impact indicators and to the relevant damage categories (natural environment and natural resources). An impact occurs when the land properties are modified (transformation) and also when the current man-made properties are maintained (occupation). Discussion. The size of impact is the difference between the effect on land quality from the studied case of land use and a suitable reference land use on the same area (dynamic reference situation). The impact depends not only on the type of land use (including coverage and intensity) but is also heavily influenced by the bio-geographical conditions of the area. The time lag between the land use intervention and the impact may be large; thus land use impacts should be calculated over a reasonable time period after the actual land use finishes, at least until a new steady state in land quality is reached.
   Conclusion. Guidance is provided on the definition of the dynamic reference situation and on methods and time frame to assess the impacts occurring after the actual land use. Including the occupation impacts acknowledges that humans are not the sole users of land.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The main damages affected by land use that should be considered by any method to assess land use impacts in LCIA are: biodiversity (existence value); biotic production potential (including soil fertility and use value of biodiversity); ecological soil quality (including life support functions of soil other than biotic production potential). Biogeographical differentiation is required for land use impacts, because the same intervention may have different consequences depending on the sensitivity and inherent land quality of the environment where it occurs. For the moment, an indication of how such task could be done and likely bio-geographical parameters to be considered are suggested. The recommendation of indicators for the suggested impact categories is a matter of future research.

AB  - Seagrasses are submerged marine macrophytes, they form highly productive ecosystems that play a critical role in climate change mitigation. Seagrass meadows are known to stabilise coastal sediments, recycle nutrients, and provide nursery grounds and food sources for fishes and megafauna. However. nearly 30% of seagrass habitats have been lost worldwide because of global climate change and sustained negative pressure from coastal developments. as well as eutrophication and dredging. This global decline and ongoing threat from climate change have weakened their capacity to support coastal productivity. This alarming decline highlights a global urgency for the implementation of effective seagrass management strategies to prevent their decline.
   Until now. the physiological indicators used to monitor seagrass health, including seagrass species composition_ above ground biomass, and spatial coverage, have failed to provide any insights into the intensity of environmental stress at the physiological and/or molecular level, which has led to their decline. Therefore. seagrass restoration efforts require highly accurate and novel tools for monitoring seagrass health and effective management strategies. In the era of systems biology, omics (transcriptomics, proteomics. and metabolomics) and their integration have shown promise in the identification of biomarkers of phenotypic plasticity of an organism under specific environmental conditions. Recently, with the influx of genomic information regarding seagrasses, omics have emerged as a new frontier in seagrass research and have deepened our understanding of their adaptation and underlying tolerance mechanisms to environmental stresses.
   This review article provides a state-of-art on seagrass' omics and discusses their potential to discover stress biomarkers, and thereby aid in developing robust diagnostic tools for monitoring seagrass' health and their management for protection and conservation. We discuss how omics platforms are advancing in technology, such as whole-genome shotgun, RNA-seq, 2-DE, and multidimensional GC- and MS-based platforms, which helps in developing high-throughput protocols for possible implementation in seagrass research This article further discusses how such innovations can provide knowledge on: (1) Molecular adaptation and acclimatisation mechanisms in seagrass responses to light, salinity, thermal, carbon dioxide, eutrophication, and heavy metal concentration, (2) their genetic diversity and evolution, and (3) seagrass reproduction and development. Moreover, we discuss the organelle, such as the chloroplast, based omics frontier to explore its potential in seagrass research to better understand the biological processes at the organelle level and how it may help determine the role of different organelles in providing tolerance against various environmental stresses. Lastly. we discuss the do's and don'ts of the experimental designs, methodological procedures, and analytical tools learned from higher plant studies to facilitate multi-omics studies and data integration in seagrass research. Creating an online user friendly database sourced from multi-omics studies and a suite of tools for analysis will attract seagrass molecular biologists and ecologists working on seagrass ecology, restoration. development, and evolution, and will improve the molecular horizons of seagrass research.

AB  - The Grain for Green Program (GGP), which combats and reverses the landscape-scale habitat degradation by converting agricultural lands to forests and grasslands, was launched in 1999 in western China. An assessment of the extent to which the GGP has altered the vegetation cover and ecological functions in these regions is much needed. The present study initially analyzed land use and cover change of forests and grasslands over western China between 2000 and 2015. A variety of satellite-based ecological indicators, including net primary productivity, normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, carbon use efficiency, and water use efficiency, were used to reflect the biophysical consequences of the GGP in western China. Results indicated that the spatial extent of forests and grasslands increased by 13.97 x 10(3) and 11.13 x 10(3) km(2), respectively, which were mainly converted from deserts and croplands. The ecosystem functions of forests and grasslands showed an asymmetric response in northwestern and southwestern China. The normalized difference vegetation index and water use efficiency of forests, as well as the net primary productivity and water use efficiency of grasslands, increased significantly over this period. The GGP also has led to an increase in leaf area index and carbon use efficiency of forests and grasslands. The Loess Plateau and the Three Rivers Source area represent the most effectively recovered regions in western China. Rising precipitation rates have contributed to vegetation recovery to some extent, especially in northwestern China, whereas the GGP was the prominent reason for the improvement of ecosystem functions across the entire region of western China.
   Plain Language Summary Land degradation has caused severe environmental problems in many areas worldwide and severely restrains the sustainable development of numerous local economies. Land degradation also undermines the livelihoods and food security of people, especially in the economically underprivileged regions. Western China has experienced land degradation because of both its geological location and climatic conditions. To combat and mitigate this situation, the Chinese government implemented a series of national-scale ecological policies and programs during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nearly 20 years have passed since the implementation of these projects. Therefore, it is appropriate to comprehensively assess the biophysical consequences of these programs. The present study aims to evaluate the extent to which the vegetation of western China recovered during the 2000-2015 period based on a variety of remotely sensed data streams. Results indicated that the spatial extent of forests and grasslands have expanded. The ecosystem functions of forests and grasslands showed an asymmetric response in the southwest and northwest regions of western China. These findings may provide guidelines for government agencies and policy makers involved in initiating adaptation strategies designed to adapt to climate change and to manage vegetation production.

AB  - The ecological, physiological, agrochemical, balance methods of investigation, characteristics of soil and climatic conditions of habitats and the results of model experiments carried out by the authors, are used to obtain quantitative data on the operation of the leaf apparatus, root system and indicators of biological productivity and carbon deposition by plants of Siberian larch in ontogeny. Tabular data of the root, needle, trunk and branches mass given per one hectare for the stands of Ia-V yield classes of the Arkhangelsk region are converted to an average (by weight) plant by age. Biological productivity is determined by a relative increase in the dry weight of a plant in the comparison periods, net productivity of photosynthesis according to the formula given by A.A. Nichiporovich (1955), and mineral productivity by the method of V.M. Lebedev (1998). The nature of the plant reaction on the depletion of soil resources with age, affecting physiological, functional and morphological processes and biological productivity of plant sis established. In the forest stands of all yield classes from 25 to 300 years, we observe a decrease in the net and biological productivity of photosynthesis and carbon deposition, depending on the yield class, by 4.1-8.1, 15.7-19.9, 5.6-10.7 times, respectively, and the absorption of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium by 20.4-42.2, 24.3-53.1, and 24.0-50.2 times, respectively. The indicators change dramatically to the age of 75-80 years, and then they relatively stabilize, remaining at a low level. The ratio of the root potential to the photosynthetic potential during ontogeny in creases by 4.5-5.4 times. The supply of plants with nutrients to maintain photosynthesis has increased, the biological productivity has not decreased as sharply as the net productivity of photosynthesis and mineral productivity. The presented data significantly supplement our knowledge of biology of woody plants, contribute to the expansion of research in the field of ecology and physiology of woody plants and serve as a theoretical basis for the development of agricultural methods for managing the production process. The proposed complex physiological analysis of tables of plant phytomass allows us to obtain quantitative data on the operation of the leaf apparatus and the root system of woody plants at the level of the organism in ontogeny, and to establish the nature of their interconnection. In the forest stands of all yield classes a nonspecific adaptive reaction is activated in response to a decrease in the absorption of mineral elements. This leads to the growth of the active part of the root system relative to the surface of needles to increase the supply of elements to the aerial part of the plant in order to maintain photosynthesis at the vital level and stabilize biological productivity.

AB  - Constructing a scientific and quantitative quality-assessment model for farmland is important for understanding farmland quality, and can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for formulating rational and effective management policies and realizing the sustainable use of farmland resources. To more accurately reflect the systematic, complex, and differential characteristics of farmland quality, this study aimed to explore an intelligent farmland quality-assessment method that avoids the subjectivity of determining indicator weights while improving assessment accuracy. Taking Xiangzhou in Hubei Province, China, as the study area, 14 indicators were selected from four dimensions-terrain, soil conditions, socioeconomics, and ecological environment-to build a comprehensive assessment index system for farmland quality applicable to the region. A total of 1590 representative samples in Xiangzhou were selected, of which 1110 were used as training samples, 320 as test samples, and 160 as validation samples. Three models of entropy weight (EW), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) were selected for training, and the assessment results of farmland quality were output through simulations to compare their assessment accuracy and analyze the distribution pattern of farmland quality grades in Xiangzhou in 2018. The results showed the following: (1) The RF model for farmland quality assessment required fewer parameters, and could simulate the complex relationships between indicators more accurately and analyze each indicator's contribution to farmland quality scientifically. (2) In terms of the average quality index of farmland, RF > BPNN > EW. The spatial patterns of the quality index from RF and BPNN were similar, and both were significantly different from EW. (3) In terms of the assessment results and precision characterization indicators, the assessment results of RF were more in line with realities of natural and socioeconomic development, with higher applicability and reliability. (4) Compared to BPNN and EW, RF had a higher data mining ability and training accuracy, and its assessment result was the best. The coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.8145, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.009, and the mean squared error (MSE) was 0.012. (5) The overall quality of farmland in Xiangzhou was higher, with a larger area of second- and third-grade farmland, accounting for 54.63%, and the grade basically conformed to the trend of positive distribution, showing an obvious pattern of geographical distribution, with overall high performance in the north-central part and low in the south. The distribution of farmland quality grades also varied widely among regions. This showed that RF was more suitable for the quality assessment of farmland with complex nonlinear characteristics. This study enriches and improves the index system and methodological research of farmland quality assessment at the county scale, and provides a basis for achieving a threefold production pattern of farmland quantity, quality, and ecology in Xiangzhou, while also serving as a reference for similar regions and countries.

AB  - The paper evaluates the variability of water quality in Lublin's inner-city river taking into account natural and anthropogenic factors that are likely to determine its pollution level. The study period was 2009-2016. The sampling points (SP) were situated in places with different degrees of investment in and use of adjacent grounds. The physical and chemical properties of waters were analysed on a seasonal basis. The values determined for the samples included temperature, conductivity, pH, suspended solids, O-2, BOD5, COD, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, PO4-, SO4-, Fe+, K+ and Cl-. Chemical composition was determined by means of a photometric method. The statistical Wilcoxon test was used for comparing water quality indicators for both SP s and in the cold and warm season. In 2013-2016 water levels and flow intensity (indirect, sectional method) were also measured at the mouth of the river. Most of the analysed indicators were characterised by the coefficient of variation exceeding 50%. The values were relatively highly differentiated for NH4+, suspended solids, PO4-, BOD5 and NO3- (73.8-282.1%). On the other hand, low variability was observed for pH, O-2, SO4- and Fe+ (3.2-41.9%). The indicators that considerably deteriorated the quality of water in the river were NO2-, PO4- and Fe+ (risk of eutrophication). Considering the mean concentrations of pollutants and flow intensity (0.34 m(3).s(-1)), the annual discharge of NO2- and PO4- from the catchment could reach 1.39 and 5.15 Mg respectively. Worse water quality was recorded at the mouth of the river where the adjacent grounds were highly urbanised. This phenomenon can testify to a growing number of pollution sources down the river. Detailed observations confirmed that many considerably neglected and polluted areas existed within the examined section of the river valley (old buildings, road network, wasteland, illegal dump sites). Discharging untreated rainwater directly into the river bed is a huge problem (increased values for conductivity, suspended solids, COD and some nutrients). In the cold season 60% of the analysed indicators (mainly temperature, conductivity, NH4+ and Cl-) were more varied than in the warm season. Statistically significant differences were found for temperature, conductivity, O-2, PO4-, NO3- and Cl-. In the winter months the values of conductivity and Cl- levels increased, which is connected with an influx of strongly polluted snowmelt into the river. The concentrations of PO4- and NO3- were higher in the warm season. It is likely that the supply of nutrients at that time was higher than required by the autotrophs. Due to a considerable variation of seasonal factors, they must be taken into account in developing the water resources management strategy for a catchment basin. Only a comprehensive approach to the problem of river water quality protection can generate positive effects. The necessary measures include detecting and eliminating all sources of pollution and reducing migration of the existing pollutants.

AB  - Geothermal vegetation - influenced by surface expressions of heat from the Earth's interior - is naturally rare both in New Zealand and internationally. The varied nature of geothermal manifestations, due to varying combinations of temperature, chemistry, hydrology, and localised protection from frosts, results in rare and unusual habitats for plants. These naturally uncommon ecosystems are classed as threatened and critically endangered, and include habitats for species occurring outside 'normal' latitudinal and altitudinal ranges. The varied nature of geothermal vegetation, one of the most threatened ecosystems in New Zealand, has important implications for management, including retention of existing areas and the maintenance and enhancement of ecological values. Most geothermal vegetation in New Zealand occurs in the central North Island in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, with c.74% of the total extent of New Zealand's geothermal vegetation located within the Waikato Region, and the remaining 26% located within the Bay of Plenty Region. Inventories of geothermal vegetation and identifications of management priorities have been undertaken regularly in the Waikato Region since 2000, with the latest having been undertaken in 2014, covering over 863 ha of geothermal habitat within 15 geothermal systems. Energy production (thermal and hydro-electricity, heating, and industrial uses) and land use changes such as mining, farming, forestry, urban development, tourism, fire, and herbicide and/or fertilizer drift have resulted in the loss of significant geothermal areas in the past, and such activities continue to threaten geothermal vegetation. Invasion of pest plants, particularly introduced conifers and other woody plant species, continues to be a major threat at many sites. Threats at each site, vulnerability to those threats, actions required to address threats, and the benefits and priorities of ecological management have been identified. Active restoration management is being undertaken by the Department of Conservation, tangata whenua, regional and local government, private landowners, and forestry companies. There are considerable opportunities for further restoration initiatives, at sites where work has already been undertaken and at all other sites. New threats have also been recognised, showing the importance of regular monitoring and inventory assessments. Continued monitoring and appropriate planning is a key requirement to improve management of this nationally rare ecosystem. Monitoring, protection, and restoration, where possible, are essential requirements to halt the decline of these fragile and unique ecosystems. To assist with management, a set of ecological indicators for geothermal systems was developed and applied across geothermal habitat within the Waikato Region. These indicators provide a measurable benchmark against which loss can be measured. Scores can be used to assess site condition and overall change within and across sites. In addition, new technology for undertaking monitoring was explored at one geothermal site as a case study. A drone was used to capture a range of imagery, as drones may be an ideal solution for geothermal site monitoring given the hazards to field surveys in geothermal areas.

AB  - Benthic microbial communities can play an important role in the induction of larval metamorphosis in marine invertebrates. The role of biofilms in recognizing the parental habitat is unknown for the ecologically and economically important mangrove crab Ucides cordatus, a species suffering from environmental pressures such as habitat degradation and disease. In the laboratdry, we experimentally tested the influence of biofilms grown in offshore and estuarine waters on the moulting rates and developmental time to metamorphosis (TIN) of the last larval stage (megalopa) of U. cordatus. Here, we specifically studied whether: (i) megalopae of this larval-exporting species respond differently to marine (MB) and estuarine biofilms (EB), (ii) biofilms previously immersed (24 h) in adult crab-conditioned seawater (ACSW; i.e. conspecific chemical cues) exhibit a greater effectiveness (i.e. by inducing higher moulting rates and shorter TTM) on larval metamorphosis than non-immersed ones and (iii) biofilms pre-immersed (24 h) in ACSW decrease their effectiveness when incubated (24 h) in pure filtered seawater (FSW) before offering them to megalopae. U. cordatus megalopae metamorphosed to the first juvenile crab stage (Jl) in response to both MB and EB, however the moulting rates were significantly higher and development TTM shorter in the presence of EB compared to MB. The metamorphosis-inducing effects were significantly enhanced when both types of biofilms were pre-immersed in ACSW, suggesting that conspecific cues can be absorbed and stored by microbial matrix. The higher inductiveness of EB compared to MB persisted after previous contact with ACSW. Furthermore, EB exhibited a significantly greater biomass production (measured as dry weight) than MB, and when immersed in ACSW, both groups of biofilms significantly increased in biomass (maintaining the hierarchy EB > MB), suggesting that water-soluble chemical substances emitted by the adult crabs may have been absorbed and metabolized by the biofilms. The metamorphic inductiveness and biomass production decreased when both groups of biofilms that were previously kept (24 h) in ACSW were thereafter immersed (24 h) in FSW. All megalopae successfully moulted toil after accelerated TTM when reared in ACSW, regardless of presence or absence of biofilms, corroborating that conspecific stimuli are the most effective metamorphosis-stimulating cues tested so far in U. cordatus. The fact that EB improved the moulting rates and shortened the development TTM indicates that megalopae can recognize and respond to microbial assemblages typical for specific environments. This should be ecologically important during larval recruitment by facilitating settlement in appropriate habitats for the post-metamorphic development of early benthic recruits. In addition, the influence of EB could encourage colonization of new estuarine areas and aid natural recovery of U. cordatus in mangrove habitats where crab populations have suffered significant reduction due to deforestation, fishing pressure or diseases.

AB  - Climate-driven variation in the distribution, abundance and phenology of low trophic-level organisms can have cascading effects within marine food webs, and understanding these complex ecosystem dynamics is of vital importance in an age of dramatic environmental change. We tested the hypothesis that marine conditions associated with the state of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) exert primary influence on the biogeographic affinities of the zooplankton community, and thus the composition of nestling diets and reproduction of a zooplanktivorous seabird, Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). The 22-year study (1996-2017) took place on Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, located at the northern extreme of the California Current System (NCCS) and site of the world's largest breeding colony. Based on annual zooplankton tows in the vicinity of Triangle Island, the biomass of 'Subarctic' zooplankton species (copepods) was elevated in years in which the PDO was in its negative (cold-water) state. The biomass of 'Subarctic' zooplankton was unrelated to both the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) indices. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed that in those PDO-negative years, diets fed to nestling auklets included more copepod biomass and less euphausiid biomass. Virtually all (> 99%) of the copepod biomass consisted of just one species, Neocalanus cristatus, one of the North Pacific Ocean's diagnostic 'Subarctic' copepods. PCA also identified a secondary effect of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on diets, in that auklet parents delivered more larval fish and less copepods-plus-euphausiids to nestlings in years in which ENSO was in a strongly positive state (i.e., El Nino). The growth rates of nestling auldets, indexed by their mean mass at 25 days of age, was higher in years in which they received more copepods-plus-euphausiids rather than larval fish, and in years in which they received more copepods rather than euphausiids. A previous study in the Central California Current System found that ENSO (to the mid-1990s) and then the NPGO (since the mid-1990s) exerted primary influence on productivity in Cassin's Auklets. In combination, the two studies illustrate how basin-scale climatic processes can non-homogeneously influence productivity in a single species across oceanic domains. For Cassin's Auklet, the contrast can be attributed to latitudinal differences in the prey base (more copepod-based in the north, more euphausiid-based in the south), and linked to ocean transport, temperature, and phenology. This correlational study provides mechanistic insight into ecological functioning in the offshore waters of the NCCS, with application to marine systems elsewhere. We highlight the particular importance of the 'Subarctic' copepods to a zooplanktivorous predator in the NCCS, and the value of seabirds as indicators in this rich marine ecosystem.

AB  - 1. Disturbances and resource availability are key factors affecting plant diversity in managed forests. As disturbance regimes vary among silvicultural systems and may simultaneously affect different types of resources, effects on biodiversity can be unpredictable.
   2. We compared the effects of two silvicultural systems on understorey plant diversity, including species composition, structural attributes and functional organization. One hundred and thirty-five phytosociological releves were sampled from 27 forest stands managed under either a traditional coppice-with-standards (CWS, n = 12) or a 'close-to-nature' selective cutting system (SC, n = 15), over similar edaphic conditions. Important environmental factors affecting vegetation were deduced using Ellenberg indicator values. Structural diversity was described using traditional indices of alpha and beta diversity. Guilds were defined within the local pool of species using a set of 14 traits and their relationship with silviculture was assessed using correspondence analysis.
   3. Post-logged CWS stands share some compositional and structural characteristics with selectively cut stands, including high species richness and a dominance of early successional species. However the species pool for all coppicing areas was higher than for selectively cut areas, suggesting that the high disturbance frequency occurring in the latter may progressively eliminate the most sensitive species.
   4. Functional diversity strongly differs between the two systems. Although it is conserved through the silvicultural cycle in the coppice-with-standards system, some guilds were lacking in selectively cut stands. The most negatively impacted guilds were tree and shrub saplings, prostrated ruderals, shade-tolerant perennials and vernal geophytes. The latter two comprise 'true forest species' which may also be considered as 'coppicing-maintained species'. To reach the same values of guild richness (i.e. number of guilds) or redundancy (i.e. proportion of the maximal species richness within each guild), larger areas were required in SC compared with CWS systems.
   5. In the SC system, the high proportion of light reaching the forest floor induced a spectacular spread of blackberries Rubus fruticosus agg., which decreased species richness. It also caused shifts in guild composition: graminoids and ferns grew strongly to the detriment of true forest species.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest long-term negative effects of selective cutting on both structural and functional plant diversity, compared with coppice-with-standards. Cutting intervals are shorter than recovery times, so that early successional species-dominated communities are maintained. Vernal geophytes and shade-tolerant perennials seem to be limited by the frequency of disturbance rather than by the severity of disturbance. We conclude that, from a biodiversity point of view, this 'close-to-nature' system does not cope with the objective of sustainable forest management. The rotations currently in use do not match natural disturbances very closely and are applied to a managed system rather than a natural forest. Retaining remnants of old coppice woods and extending rotations to at least 50 years are recommended where biodiversity conservation is a goal of forest management.

AB  - Total body fat is frequently used as an indicator of an animal's physical condition, but its determination requires post-mortem analysis. A field index of total body fat useful on live cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) was developed. I collected a small sample of cottontails in April 1984 to determine total body fat. Carcasses were homogenized and assayed for ether extraction of crude fat. A significant regression equation predicting the natural log of crude fat expressed as a percentage of dry mass from the natural log of the mass/head-length was developed.

AB  - A growing urban development pattern can have both positive and negative impacts. One of them is the thermal discomfort in the form of heat stress. Heat stress is the maximum condition of the human body to receive the heat exposure to various activities. This study analyzed the thermal comfort in Yogyakarta City based on the Discomfort Index (DI) method. The DI method is commonly used in tropical climates using the parameters that include average air temperature and humidity. The data consists of secondary data obtained from Geophysics Station Gamping in 2004-2020 and Climatology Station Mlati in 2017-2020. The result of DI indicated that the highest value occurred in the wet moon climate type in April, with 25.63 degrees C. Therefore, the conditions showed that more than 50% of people in the city of Yogyakarta fall into an uncomfortable category with an average index of 24.97 degrees C, which can lead to heat stress. Environmental engineering can be employed to decrease the heat stress potential and improve the thermal comfort for Yogyakarta's urban community, which is public and private open space, plant road shade vegetation, implement a green facade (vertical garden), as well as improve people's living behavior and use appropriate clothing.

AB  - This study uses multi-criteria analysis to assess water services performance provided to rural communities. The approach is based on five indicators (water availability, water quality, accessibility, affordability, and reliability) and allows the assessment of service levels. The indicators used provided a solid baseline for water services to identify a strategy for the improvement and achievement of universal access to water. We empirically applied the approach to rural water services in Cameroon and particularly in Mvangan and Mandjou Councils. A total of 77 water services has been investigated through technical inspection (water point inspection, flow measurement, and water quality analysis), semi-structured interviews with the technical services of these councils and surveys with water point committees, including 25 in Mandjou Council and 52 in Mvangan Council. The main results show that 43.40% of villages have enhanced services in Mvangan Council while only 4.76% of services are enhanced in Mandjou Council. Results also suggests that monitoring rural water services can improve the levels of services provided to populations and, hence, universal access to water. These assessments represent only a current snapshot of potable water delivery system conditions and should be conducted at regular intervals to track changes in overall and local conditions.

AB  - Whether Arctic and alpine ecosystems will act as a future net sink or source of carbon remains uncertain. The present study investigates ways in which ecosystem (soil and vegetation) and geomorphological (cryogenic disturbance) factors may control or affect the future release of carbon in an alpine permafrost landscape. Rates of ecosystem respiration (R-e) were examined using a portable gas analyzer across an altitudinal transect ranging from mid- to high-alpine vegetation zones underlain by discontinuous to continuous permafrost on Galdhopiggen (Norway). Measurements were made of R(e)during the peak growing season on active and relict sorted circles exhibiting varying levels of frost disturbance and shrub encroachment. R(e)was found to be controlled more strongly by soil microclimate and plant growth forms than by geomorphic indicators of cryoturbation in thawing permafrost or by atmospheric conditions. The results indicate that increasing shrub cover leads to elevated R-e, while an increase in surface disturbance has the potential to lower R-e. We conclude that vegetation is likely to colonize frost-disturbed surfaces at progressively higher altitudes as freeze-thaw processes slow down or cease, and this will result in increased R-e.

AB  - Although several short-term assays are available for cosmetic photosafety assessment, cell models are usually highly sensitive to UV radiation, tending to overestimate both phototoxic and photomutagenic risks. In addition, these assays are performed with UV doses/fluences that do not correspond to actual environmental conditions. In this sense, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has already proved to be an interesting tool to predict photomutagenic potential of several compounds, including sunscreens. Yeast can support environmental UVB doses compatible with human daily sunlight exposure, allowing the use of irradiation sources to faithfully mimic the external conditions of ambient sunlight. Herein, we used a set of S. cerevisiae mutant strains sensitive to UVA, UVB and Solar Simulated Light sources in order to evaluate their potential as bioindicators for sunscreen development. The bioindicator potential of the strains was tested with the widely-used titanium dioxide inorganic sunscreen. The AWP001 (yno1) and LPW002 (ogg1yno1) strains obtained in this study stood out as promising experimental tools for the validation of this assay. Overall, our results evidenced a set of S. cerevisiae strains particularly useful for evaluating both photoprotective (efficacy) and photo/antiphotomutagenic (safety) potential of UV filters, meeting the industries and regulatory agencies demand for robust and efficient in vitro screening tests.

AB  - Migration of nanomaterials from food containers into food is a matter of concern because of the potential risk for exposed consumers. The aims of this study were to evaluate silver migration from a commercially available food packaging containing silver nanoparticles into a real food matrix (chicken meat) under plausible domestic storage conditions and to test the contribution of such packaging to limit food spoilage bacteria proliferation. Chemical analysis revealed the absence of silver in chicken meatballs under the experimental conditions in compliance with current European Union legislation, which establishes a maximum level of 0.010 mg kg(-1) for the migration of non-authorised substances through a functional barrier (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011). On the other hand, microbiological tests (total microbial count, Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae) showed no relevant difference in the tested bacteria levels between meatballs stored in silver-nanoparticle plastic bags or control bags. This study shows the importance of testing food packaging not only to verify potential silver migration as an indicator of potential nanoparticle migration, but also to evaluate the benefits in terms of food preservation so as to avoid unjustified usage of silver nanoparticles and possible negative impacts on the environment.

AB  - Changes in richness, diversity, evenness and abundance of phytoplankton in relation to environmental variables and tributary entrances were studied along 30 km of the Parana River downstream Itaipu Reservoir. A high number of taxa was found, 315. The Parana River differed from the tributaries Iguacu River and Monday River. The phytoplankton and limnological characteristics of the Parana River changed after the entrance of these tributaries. Higher values of richness and alpha diversity of phytoplankton were found in the two tributary rivers, which also produced an increase in the corresponding mean values in the Parana River. Higher values of total abundance and lower values of evenness were found at the dam site with typical lentic conditions. The assemblages of the two tributary rivers were homogeneous. Bellow dam the phytoplankton exhibited a decrease in abundance and an increase in evenness. Water transparency, water flow, nutrients and turbidity were the main indicators of the system spatial heterogeneity. Several species were correlated with silicate, redox potential and/or water temperature. Reservoir conditions promote conspicuous differences in the phytoplankton of the Parana River. The downstream reorganization of the community, with a sharp decrease in abundance, is positively influenced by tributary rivers in terms of richness and diversity.

AB  - Urban landscape and land-use structure, particularly that of built space, were found to have a significant impact on environmental exposures, e.g., on the level and spatial distribution of particle and noise exposure in cities. Climate change will increase the frequency, duration and intensity of heat waves. Hence, the question arises: how do urban structures affect the shape and intensity of urban temperature conditions? To answer this question, multiple urban structures have been quantified in terms of their structural patterns and configuration using the landscape metric (BM) approach. The results of a linear regression analysis showed that both the edge density and patch size ratio are significantly correlated with the spread and intensity of temperatures across all urban built structures. The analysis shows that the higher the proportion and structural complexity of the built area, the higher are the morning and evening surface temperatures. LSMs were found to be very well suited as analysis models of the site-specific temperature impact beyond the aggregate city level. Hence, they may serve as a planning tool for urban adaptation measures to climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The salinity of groundwater increases with depth in the Canadian Shield (up to 1.3 kg/L of density). The existence of brine can be critically important for the safe geologic disposal of radioactive wastes, as dense brine can significantly retard the upward migration of radionuclides released from repositories. Static and flushing conditions of the deep brine are analyzed using a U-tube analogy model. Velocity reduction due to the presence of dense brine is derived under flushing conditions. A set of illustrative numerical simulations in a two-dimensional cross section is presented to demonstrate that dense brine can significantly influence regional groundwater flow patterns in a shield environment. It is implied from the results that (1) the existence of Shield brine can be an indicator of a hydrogeologically stable environment, (2) activities near ground surface may not perturb the stable groundwater environment in the deep brine region, and thus, (3) the deep brine region can be considered as a candidate geologic site for the safe disposal of waste. In addition to brine, other issues associated with long-term waste disposal, such as geological, glacial and seismic events, may need to be considered for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel in a shield environment.

AB  - The volcanic ash-derived soils in central Oregon have been shown to compact readily and remain compacted for long periods of time, leading to significant reductions in ponderoso pine (Pinus ponderosa, Laws) tree growth. Concerns over the potential for long-term reduction in forest site productivity on private forestlands in the region led to the development of a soil monitoring process for precisely quantifying changes to the soil environment caused by mechanical harvesting in second-growth ponderosa pine stands. For this study, soil strength was used as an indicator for soil compaction. A recording penetrometer was used to measure soil strength to a depth of 2 ft at intervals of 5 ft along tronsects established across harvest units. At each sampling point, the number of machine passes was estimated as no disturbance, 1-2 machine passes, 3-5 machine passes, or main skid trails. The penetrometer data were then summarized for each of the four categories. The results show a rapid rise in soil strength with increasing machine activity and 40-70% of the harvest units compacted in a single harvest cycle. The process proved to be an unbiased and practical system for quantifying the extent and intensity of soil strength conditions resulting from mechanical harvesting.

AB  - Reduction of microbial populations on carcasses has been achieved and reported by some authors by spraying solutions of organic acids, mainly lactic acid, on the meat surface. However, in practice, lactic acid is very expensive. Production of lactic acid in situ by a controlled lactic fermentation seemed to be a feasible answer. The objective of the present study was to explore the viability of this concept at semitropical conditions, i.e. temperatures around 25 degrees C. In a first experiment, seven starters were tested for their ability to produce lactic acid and reducing the growth rate of pseudomonads, taking these microorganisms as indicators of contamination by spoilage microorganisms. The lactic acid bacteria strains were isolated from native Mexican maize-based beverages, and inoculated on the meat surface. Addition of sucrose and wrapping the samples in PVC film in order to induce a microaerophilic environment encouraged the overgrowth of L. bulgaricus and P. pentosaceous over pseudomonads. A second experiment was designed to test a mixture of these two strains and a commercial starter with respect to lactic acid production, overgrowth of lactic acid bacteria over pseudomonads, decolouration and oxidation of the meat samples. It was concluded that a commercial starter (L. plantarum + M. kristinae-varians) resulted in a reduction of pseudomonas growth rate, without notably affecting meat colour and degree of oxidation.

AB  - Many have argued that the human sciences feature a unique form of understanding (Verstehen) that is absent from the natural sciences. However, in the last decade or so, epistemologists and philosophers of natural science have been proffering analyses of a kind of natural-scientific understanding. Using examples from educational psychology and anthropology, I argue that there are prima facie reasons to think these recent accounts of natural-scientific understanding impose necessary conditions on Verstehen. This suggests that any claim about Verstehen's distinctiveness faces hitherto-unappreciated burdens of proof.

AB  - The impulse transfer or amount of movement is important in phenomena of separating semi-solid food materials by the occurrence of movement phenomena inside it. This paper proposes application of operation of physical separation and gravity on a semi-solid lipid model food, fluid, imposed conditions (homogenization, duration, temperature) in physical and mechanical forces. These forces act differentially on components in a fluid/solid mixture of densities and different particle sizes at which the flow is present.

AB  - In natural water bodies, images taken under water are mostly characterized by poor visibility conditions. To evaluate the content of such images visually, an image restoration is essential. In this contribution, a concept for the automated restoration of images taken under water is presented. The concept is based on a distance estimation using turbidity indicators, a subsequent color restoration, a model-based deconvolution approach and a concluding image fusion. The restoration is fully based on physical foundations and thus complies with the requirement of an objective enhancement of the image content.

AB  - We present results from a palaeoecological analysis conducted on deposits accumulated in an oxbow lake of the Prosna River (Poland), next to the Grodzisko fortified settlement. Palaeobotanical and geochemical analyses-supported by radiocarbon dating-were performed to (i) reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions of the oxbow lake and its surrounding area; (ii) determine the beginning of the human activity in the fortified settlement vicinity; and (iii) assess the impact of human pressure on the environment. The Grodzisko fortified settlement was originally located on a river island, encircled by a wetland, improving its defensive value. Increases in the water level (1800-1300 BC and 700-200 BC) created a small lake/moat around the fortified settlement. Indicators for human activity from pollen records suggest the presence of human populations from the late Neolithic, ca. 2800 BC, with a clear intensification ca. 1700 BC. From ca. 1600 BC, a decrease in some decidous trees suggests forest clearance. Low levels of human activity indicator pollen ca. 2000 BC suggest a reduction of human pressure (possible depopulation). The regular presence of macrocharcoal pieces and an increase in human activity indicator pollen from ca. 1300 to 200 BC provide evidence for renewed human habitation around the sampling site.

AB  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have proven to be a powerful tool for solving a wide variety of real-life problems. The possibility of using them for forecasting phenomena occurring in nature, especially weather indicators, has been widely discussed. However, the various areas of the world differ in terms of their difficulty and ability in preparing accurate weather forecasts. Poland lies in a zone with a moderate transition climate, which is characterized by seasonality and the inflow of many types of air masses from different directions, which, combined with the compound terrain, causes climate variability and makes it difficult to accurately predict the weather. For this reason, it is necessary to adapt the model to the prediction of weather conditions and verify its effectiveness on real data. The principal aim of this study is to present the use of a regressive model based on a unidirectional multilayer neural network, also called a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to predict selected weather indicators for the city of Szczecin in Poland. The forecast of the model we implemented was effective in determining the daily parameters at 96% compliance with the actual measurements for the prediction of the minimum and maximum temperature for the next day and 83.27% for the prediction of atmospheric pressure.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prosocial behavior on physical activity, as an indicator of resilience, in a low-income neighborhood with adverse built environment and social conditions. Resilience is an important factor that promotes the ability for individuals to overcome hardships, and understanding resilience as it relates to health behavior is important in the efforts to improve the health and wellbeing of vulnerable communities. There are many constructs of resilience, and we selected physical activity as an indicator of resilience because of the role of physical activity in health promotion. A community based participatory research approach was utilized to conduct a door knock survey in a sample of 2,457 households in a low-income, historically African-American neighborhood. Fifty-seven percent of residents completed the survey. Physical activity was the dependent variable and we controlled for key demographics, resident health, primary mode of transportation and neighborhood safety. Prosocial behavior was the primary independent variable. We conducted descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses and found prosocial behavior was significantly correlated with moderate physical activity, despite adverse conditions. Our results indicate that prosocial behavior plays an important role in an individual's ability to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as physical activity, despite challenges.

AB  - Sulfate related water quality and trophic status are crucial to operation of water diversion. Though the sulfur geochemistry in the lake sediment have been well studied, the effective indicator of surrounding environment conditions related to sulfur in river-lake systems are still unknown. In this study, Dongping Lake (DPH), Weishan Lake (WSH), and Hanzhuang trunk canal (HZQ) were selected as the typical river-lake systems in the eastern of China. Different spatial variations in sedimentary sulfate, total sulfur, and elemental composition of sediments were investigated in these areas. The relatively high sulfate in surface water and sediments appeared in portions of WSH. The biodiversity of HZQ and WSH surface sediments was much higher than that of DPH. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Thiobacillus were the dominant genera of the river-lake systems. Among the different genera in distribution, genera such as Malikia, Sulfurovum and Lysinibacillus were significantly negatively correlated with sulfur related environmental factors. While the genera such as Pseudomonas, Vogesella and Acinetobacter were significantly positively correlated with these factors. Compared with connectivity in the largest interaction network, bacteria such as Proteus, Acidobacter and Chlorobacteria were identified as indicatory taxa to infer sulfate related conditions in the river-lake systems.

AB  - We evaluated the recent ecological history of Lake Erie from diatoms and geochemistry in sediment cores. Two major transition points in the ecology of the western basin (WB; 1985 and 2008) and central basin (CB; 1935 and 1982) were defined. Changes in abundance of diatom eutrophic indicators and geochemical markers were interpreted as a degradation in water quality after 1935 due to the effects of increased population, agriculture, and industrialization until abatement measures were enacted in the 1970s and 1980s. Diatom indicators suggested modest recovery from eutrophic conditions in Lake Erie, however diatom-inferred total phosphorus suggested that despite abatement efforts total phosphorus was not reduced below pre-impact levels. The effects on diatoms of increased temperature and dissolved silica also became apparent in the 1980s, and in the WB recent shifts were likely caused by increased pollution and recent climatic warming. Based on stratigraphic changes since 1985, the diatom trajectory suggests the phytoplankton of Lake Erie will likely remain in a state of flux for the near future due to a variety of countervailing impacts including unknown effects of mitigation efforts, legacy pollution, climate change, and changing upstream conditions.

AB  - Freshwater mussels (order: Unionidae) are among the most endangered aquatic organisms in North America. Conservationists and resource managers within the United States are increasingly advocating restoration of these animals to preserve biodiversity and boost ecosystem services in the nation's waterways. Historically, restoration methods have yielded less than optimal survival rates due in part to an inability to identify suitable habitat for these organisms. Through the use of caged mussels as bioindicators, a method was developed to test prospective restoration sites for their ability to support mussel fitness before beginning restoration so that investments are strategic. Mussels (Elliptio complanata) from a healthy population were caged and deployed to candidate streams. Their survivorship, condition, and proximate biochemical composition (protein, carbohydrate, lipid) was then monitored for 1year. Streams that supported mussel fitness as well as or better than their source stream were considered to be suitable for restoration. Four of five candidate streams were found to support mussel fitness. In addition, reciprocal transfers between two source populations showed that the seasonal patterns of tissue biochemical composition responded to ambient stream conditions, indicating that this species is diagnostic as a bioindicator of stream quality and habitat suitability.

KW  - LANDSCAPE
KW  - USA
AB  - Chile's Central Zone has been permanently affected by forest fires on the native vegetation, whose damage and effects have not been sufficiently studied at the regional scale, despite the very serious consequences of this problem for the country. Fires during 35 years (1976-2010) were analyzed with the aim of obtaining useful data for future projects of environmental recovery in areas that have been affected by fire. The analysis included fires on more than 2000ha, localized between 32 and 38 S, and where the biggest damage was concentrated in 1984 and 1999, mainly attributable to the environmental conditions that favored the spread of fires in those years. However, these results do not correspond necessarily to recurrence patterns, mainly due to the absence of trustful data prior to 1976. With respect to field analysis, the abundance-dominance indicators of Braun-Blanquet and Westhoff-Maarel, and landscape measures, show that the structure and composition of the vegetation has not changed radically in the period of study, the same species being present but with a higher state of degradation than those of forests at the beginning of last century. Simulation analysis showed high levels of caloric liberation in the fire behavior, presumably due to the high availability of vegetal material in the analyzed areas and to the environmental and topographic conditions, which favor its rapid propagation.

AB  - Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) from Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, is a slow growing long-lived species. A wide range of diet items were present in the stomachs of the shorthorn sculpins sampled but 2-3 diet items (amphipod species) comprised 99.5% of total food consumed, These amphipods were present in the stomachs in similar proportions among all age classes of shorthorn sculpin. Several new host records for parasites were reported and mean numbers of parasite species increased with shorthorn sculpin age. The increased diversity of parasite species and higher delta N-15 values in older/larger individuals suggest that their diets were more diverse and the prey items consumed had higher delta N-15 values. By contrast, the value of delta C-13 in dominant diet items masked the delta C-13 values of minor diet items. We conclude that parasites and stable isotope values provide complementary data on feeding patterns of the shorthorn sculpin. The ubiquitous marine acanthocephalan, Echinorhynchus gadi, was found at high prevalences (87-100%) and mean intensities (28-35), and were localized in the midgut. In contrast to other studies on acanthocephalans, E. gadi did not influence fish condition as measured by condition factor, liver somatic and gonado-somatic indices.

AB  - The paper examines the application of the ecological thresholds concept to fire management issues concerning fire-sensitive vegetation types associated with the remote, biodiversity-rich, sandstone Arnhem Plateau, in western Arnhem Land, monsoonal northern Australia. In the absence of detailed assessments of fire regime impacts on component biota such as exist for adjoining Nitmiluk and World Heritage Kakadu National Parks, the paper builds on validated 16-year fire history and vegetation structural mapping products derived principally from Landsat-scale imagery, to apply critical ecological thresholds criteria as defined by fire regime parameters for assessing the status of fire-sensitive habitat and species elements. Assembled data indicate that the 24 000 km(2) study region today experiences fire regimes characterised generally by high annual frequencies (mean = 36.6%) of large (> 10 km(2)) fires that occur mostly in the late dry season under severe fire-weather conditions. Collectively, such conditions substantially exceed defined ecological thresholds for significant proportions of fire-sensitive indicator rain forest and heath vegetation types, and the long-lived obligate seeder conifer tree species, Callitris intratropica. Thresholds criteria are recognised as an effective tool for informing ecological fire management in a variety of geographic settings.

AB  - Aims: To determine the fate of the enteric indicator organism, Escherichia coli, in sewage sludge (biosolids)-amended agricultural soil in relation to soil type and moisture status under controlled conditions.
   Methods and Results: We enumerated Escherichia coli in soil by membrane filtration and most probable number techniques. The background concentration of E. coli was higher in sandy loam than in silty clay soil. E. coli numbers increased in soil following addition of dewatered, mesophilic anaerobically digested sludge. Escherichia coli declined to a small extent with time in both moist and air-dried unamended control soils, although decay was only highly significant (P < 0.001) in moist sandy loam (T-90 = 100 days). Removal rates were high in sludge-treated moist soil (T-90 = 20 days), but were significantly reduced in amended air-dried soil.
   Conclusion: Slow removal of E. coli in air-dried soil as against their rapid decay in moist soil after sludge application indicated that the soil biota are involved in pathogen reduction processes in sludge-amended soil.
   Significance and the Impact of the Study: Soil ecological mechanisms are implicated as having a critical role in the fate of enteric organisms introduced into temperate agricultural soil in sewage sludge.

AB  - The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) has developed, constructed, and employed a trailer-housed mobile aerosol sampling system (MASS) for the physical characterization of particles extracted from the exhaust flows of gas turbine engines. The MASS has been designed for a range of sampling conditions typically encountered at exit planes of combustors, angular sector rigs, flame tubes, and actual engines. To date measurements have been conducted in test cells, altitude chambers, on the wing (on the ground), and in flight. Reaching beyond the historically used but limited concept of smoke number, the MASS relies on differential mobility analysis, laser particle sizing, transmission electron microscopy, and molecular absorption spectroscopy to measure directly particle number concentration and size distribution (0.01 to < 25 mu m), water mixing ratio, particle morphology, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Combined with key combustor/engine operating conditions and fuel properties the MASS provides a series of derived parameters including mean particle diameter and number-, surface-, and mass-based emission indices, which are important parameters for the performance characterization and environmental assessment of gas turbine engines. In this article we describe the technical details of the UMR MASS, discuss data reduction and experimental uncertainties, and show some example data sets.

AB  - The microbiological quality of water, sediments and seafood products of three Sicilian marine fish farms (Castellammare Gulf, Capo d'Orlando and Porto Palo) was investigated in order to draw a complete picture of the health conditions from the start (environment) to the end (seafood product) of the productive cycle. Before the beginning of fish farming, low concentrations of faecal contamination indicators (faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci) were found in the water of each examined area. Due to the enhanced organic load released from cages, the set-up of fish farming significantly altered the distribution of faecal indicators and sometimes that of halophilic vibrios in the pelagic compartment. Significant differences in the density of heterotrophic bacteria were sometimes recorded at the sediment level. Despite this increase in microbial abundance, the microbiological conditions remained acceptable for the productive process. Pathogens (Salmonella spp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus) were mostly absent in seafood products. The study underlines that the achievement of good quality levels in aquaculture strongly depends on the conformity of the rearing environment to qualitative microbiological standards, highlighting the importance of sanitary controls along the different steps of the productive cycle.

AB  - Long-term and short-term changes in ambient temperature can cause stress in birds, leading to changes in the level of hematological parameters. The H:L ratio (heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) is a hematological index that allows for the assessment of the stress induced by environmental changes, including weather conditions. In this paper, we examined the influence of temperatures and the sum of precipitation on the health of nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by using the H:L ratio reflecting the body's response to stress. All examined temperature indicators influenced the H:L ratio, yet the average value of daily minimum temperature during the first 12 days of nestling life had the strongest influence, maximum temperature had the weakest effect, while precipitation had no significant influence. Our research indicates that even a small increase in temperature caused a stress reaction in nestling pied flycatchers, which was reflected by an increase in the H:L ratio. The increase in the stress index (H:L ratio) was probably a result of poor weather conditions (precipitation, low temperature), which prevented the adult birds from actively foraging and properly feeding the nestlings.

AB  - The static var compensator (SVC) is one of the devices that has been widely used for reactive compensation to improve the capacity and flexibility of power transfer in the electrical power system. However, the SVC changes the voltages and currents of the power network to which it is connected. Consequently, the measured impedance can be changed and affect protection relays operation based on this characteristic. Several papers have been published about the SVC effects on distance protection applied in transmission lines (TL). However, it is not widely known the impact of SVC on the transient behavior of generators, such as protection against loss of excitation (LOE) in synchronous machines connected to TL with SVC. In this sense, based on the modeling of a test electrical power system in the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation environment, the assessment of the effects of SVC on the behavior of the ANSI 40 protection function for the conditions of the total LOE and partial LOE since these events can cause the synchronous machine to operate in conditions above the rated ones. In addition, this paper presents a testbed that allows performing secondary tests in physical relays when simulated signals are applied to perform protection studies in the presence of SVC in power systems.

AB  - Bioethanol as fuel oxygenator is currently being introduced in Mexico with an estimated yearly demand of 3 billion liters expected to be produced mainly from sugarcane. This paper studies how to employ some of the expertise acquired by Brazil during its transition from typical mills into advanced biorefineries to retrofit the Mexican sucroalcohol industry. A typical Mexican sugarcane factory design is retrofitted to three biorefinery designs commonly found in Brazil, which are an autonomous distillery, a biorefinery with 50:50 feedstock ratio for ethanol and sugar production and a molasses distillery. The results of a techno-economic analysis considering these four designs under Mexican conditions are presented, followed by an economic comparison of the autonomous distillery design operating under Mexican and Brazilian conditions. Sustainability analysis is then carried out to identify the advantages and drawbacks of each design. The analysis compares an environment-driven scenario promoting bioethanol production and use for phasing out fossil fuels, against a commercially focused framework considering only environmental and economic issues affecting stakeholders' profit. Results show in monetary terms the impact of each indicator of a retrofitting path from currently profitable biorefineries coproducing sugar and alcohol to sustainable distilleries using molasses and juice as feedstock to produce bioethanol.

AB  - The biodegradability and ecological safety assessment of the previously isolated DDT-degrading bacterial strain Stenotrophomonas sp. DDT-1 were investigated in the DDT-contaminated soil under laboratory and field conditions. Under laboratory conditions, the degradation rates of fresh p,p'-DDT in soil were enhanced by 2.0-3.0-fold with the introduction of the strain DDT-1 compared to those of the control treatments. A similar enhancement in the dissipation of DDTs (p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and o,p'-DDT) in the aged DDT-contaminated field plot soils resulted from the inoculation with this strain. Meanwhile, the degradation rates of DDTs increased by 2.9-5.5- and 2.8-7.6-fold in the inoculated greenhouse and open field soils, respectively, after field demonstration application of strain DDT-1 preparation. Moreover, no significant differences in the soil enzyme activity, microbial functional diversity, and bacterial community structure were observed between the inoculated and uninoculated field soils, but several soil microbial genera exhibited some fluctuations in abundance. It is concluded that strain DDT-1 could accelerate the removal of DDTs residues in field soils, and furthermore, its inoculation was ecologically safe.

AB  - The objective of this study was to make a comparative analysis of the fatty acid composition of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792) with consumption size of 250-300 g, from two different aquaculture facilities - coldwater fishponds (fishpond A and fishpond B) in Macedonia, at different ambient conditions in the aquatic environment, and with the use of pelleted food from different manufacturers.
   Considering the results of the fatty acid composition of the rainbow trout from the fishpond A and the fishpond B, it can be concluded that the content of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) is higher in the fishpond B (20.303%) compared to the fishpond A (16.155%), while the content of the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is greater in the fishpond A (MUFA -53.364%; PUFA -30.435%) compared to the fishpond B (MUFA -52.359%; PUFA -27.268%).
   Overall, by a comparative analysis of the qualitative properties of the rainbow trout from the both aquaculture facilities, the ambient conditions prevailing in the aquatic environment, and the used forage mixtures for feeding fish, it can be concluded that the both aquaculture facilities are producing fish with high nutritional quality in terms of the fatty acid composition.

AB  - To assess health conditions of rotating machinery efficiently, multiple accelerometers are mounted on different locations to acquire a variety of possible faults signals. The statistical features are extracted from these signals to identify the running status of a machine. However, the acquired vibration signals are different due to sensor's arrangement and environmental interference, which may lead to different diagnostic results. In order to improve the fault diagnosis reliability, a new multisensor data fusion technique is proposed. First, time-domain and frequency-domain features are extracted from the different sensor signals, and then these features are input into multiple two-layer sparse autoencoder (SAE) neural networks for feature fusion. Finally, fused feature vectors can be regarded as the machine health indicators, and be used to train deep belief network (DBN) for further classification. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SAE-DBN scheme, the bearing fault experiments were conducted on a bearing test platform, and the vibration data sets under different running speeds were collected for algorithm validation. For comparison, different feature fusion methods were also applied to multisensor fusion in the experiments. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively identify the machine running conditions and significantly outperform other fusion methods.

AB  - System availability is a key performance measure in the process industry. It ensures continuous operation of facilities to meet production targets, personnel safety and environmental sustainability. Process machinery condition assessment, early fault detection and its management are vital elements to ensure overall system availability. These elements can be explored and managed effectively by extracting hidden knowledge from machinery vibration information to improve plant availability and safe operations. This article describes a decision tree-based computational intelligence model using machinery vibration data to detect machinery faults, their severity, and suggests appropriate action to avoid unscheduled failures. Vibration data for this work were collected using a machinery simulator and real-world machine to show the applicability of the proposed model. Later, the data were analyzed to detect faults using decision tree-based model that was developed in MATLAB. Fault detection classification accuracies of 98% during training and 93% during testing showed excellent performance of the proposed model. The model also revealed that the proposed formulation has capability of detecting faults correctly in the range of 98%-99%. The results showed that the proposed decision tree-based model is effective in evaluating the condition of process machinery and predicting unscheduled equipment breakdowns with better accuracy and with reduced human effort.

AB  - Play remains a mystery and adult play even more so. More typical of young stages in healthy individuals, it occurs rarely at adult stages but then more often in captive/domestic animals, which can imply spatial, social and/or feeding deprivations or restrictions that are challenging to welfare, than in animals living in natural conditions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adult play may reflect altered welfare states and chronic stress in horses, in which, as in several species, play rarely occurs at adult stages in natural conditions. We observed the behaviour (in particular, social play) of riding school horses during occasional outings in a paddock and measured several stress indicators when these horses were in their individual home boxes. Our results revealed that (1) the number of horses and rates of adult play appeared very high compared to field report data and (2) most stress indicators measured differed between 'players' and 'non-players', revealing that most 'playful' animals were suffering from more chronic stress than 'non-playful' horses. Frequency of play behaviour correlated with a score of chronic stress. This first discovery of a relationship between adult play and altered welfare opens new lines of research that certainly deserves comparative studies in a variety of species.

AB  - Biolistics has been studied to inoculate grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), a Nepovirus, to its natural woody host, Vitis sp., and its herbaceous host, Chenopodium quinoa. At first, bombardment conditions for in vitro and greenhouse grown plants were set using the uidA reporter gene. The infectious feature of the cartridges was then evaluated by studying infection of C. quinoa plants. Systemic infection was obtained with either GFLV particles or RNA extracts in experimental conditions which gave also the highest transient uidA gene expression. Concerning grapevine, our results indicate that extrapolation to this plant is difficult. In only 1 out of 8 independent bombardment experiments done with GFLV and 41 B, we we're able to detect the virus in freshly bombarded leaves. Similarly, later after bombardment, Pol mRNAs were detected once, at days 7 and 14 only. Incubating the plants in darkness, as suggested in the literature, or using Rupestris Saint Georges, an indicator for GFLV presence, did not yield any improvement. Finely, our observations suggest that detection of GFLV in bombarded grapevine tissues by immunological or molecular techniques remains a limiting factor, probably due to an excess of inhibitory compounds released during the biolistic process.

AB  - We conducted the first taphonomic and paleoenvironmental study based on late Pleistocene-Holocene small mammal remains recovered from the famous Mylodon Cave (Cerro Benitez area, ultima Esperanza, Chile). Most of the analyzed material came from the extensive excavations made by Earl Saxon in 1976. We also studied late Holocene small mammal samples of the neighboring rock shelter Dos Herraduras 1. Analyzed remains were mostly produced by owls, probably living inside the caves. In Mylodon Cave, the higher values of girdle bones are consistent with a windblown litter. We recorded nine species of rodents, seven cricetids, and two caviomorphs; almost all the identified taxa integrate recent local communities. Late Pleistocene-Holocene assemblages are characterized by the chinchilla rat Euneomys, indicating unforested areas around the caves under cold and moist climatic conditions. Middle Holocene amelioration is reflected by incremental rodent species richness, including the first record of taxa clearly associated with forest (e.g., Abrothrix lanosa). Late Holocene assemblages are markedly stable, indicating local conditions similar to the current (historical) environment. Quaternary rodents from Cerro Benitez area do not indicate abrupt environmental changes during middle-late Holocene, but a progressive trend towards forest increase.

AB  - A life cycle framework for a new integrated classification system for buildings and the identification of renovation strategies that lead to an optimal balance between reduction of seismic vulnerability and increase of energy efficiency, considering both economic losses and environmental impacts, is discussed through a parametric application to an exemplificative case-study building. Such framework accounts for the economic and environmental contributions of initial construction, operational energy consumption, earthquake-induced damage repair activities, retrofitting interventions, and demolition. One-off and annual monetary expenses and environmental impacts through the building life cycle are suggested as meaningful performance metrics to develop an integrated classification system for buildings and to identify the optimal renovation strategy leading to a combined reduction of economic and environmental impacts, depending on the climatic conditions and the seismic hazard at the site of interest. The illustrative application of the framework to an existing school building is then carried out, investigating alternative retrofitting solutions, including either sole structural retrofitting options or sole energy refurbishments, as well as integrated strategies that target both objectives, with a view to demonstrate its practicality and to explore its ensuing results. The influence of seismic hazard and climatic conditions is quantitatively investigated, by assuming the building to be located into different geographic locations.

AB  - As bio-indicators, seabirds across the globe help us understand how our environment is changing, and how this is affecting our wildlife. Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) in Australia are a key species in understanding the changes to the Australian environment. However, studies generally focus on the effects of oceanic changes without always accounting for the potential interactions with the environmental conditions experienced on land during breeding. This study examined the relationships between both marine and terrestrial environmental variables and breeding success in South Australian Little Penguins, observing 10 colonies over a nonconsecutive 28-yr time period. Our results showed that South Australian Little Penguins had a lower breeding success (fewer fledglings produced per pair) when sea surface temperatures were higher in the 3 mo before breeding and when high winds occurred during the breeding season. We also observed local variation between the colonies: breeding success was only influenced by environmental variables for colonies located near open waters and not for colonies located in enclosed bays. These results confirm the idea that future oceanographic warming is expected to reduce the breeding success (and population size) of some Australian seabirds, including Little Penguins.

AB  - In order to improve the accuracy of fire identification based on video in the Internet-of-Things environment, this article proposes a new fire identification algorithm by merging fire segmentation and multifeature fusion of fire. First, according to the relationship between R and Y channels, the improved YCbCr models are established for initial fire segmentation under reflection and nonreflection conditions, respectively. Simultaneously, the reflection and nonreflection conditions are judged by comparing the areas obtained by the two improved YCbCr models. Second, an improved region growing algorithm is proposed for fine fire segmentation by making use of the relationship between the seed point and its adjacent points. The seed points are determined using the weighted average of centroid coordinates of each segmented image. Finally, the quantitative indicators of fire identification are given according to the variation coefficient of fire area, the dispersion of centroid, and the circularity. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fire detection method considerably outperforms the traditional methods on average in terms of three performance indexes: precision, recall, and F1-score. Specifically, compared with the deep learning method, the precision of the proposed method is slightly higher. Although the recall of the proposed method is slightly lower than the deep learning method, its computation complexity is low.

AB  - In the present paper, the mid-term performance of two different architectures of a solar-driven jet-ejector refrigeration system is numerically compared: the first one is fitted with a fixed-geometry jet-ejector while the second one is equipped with an adjustable spindle that modifies the jet-ejector area ratio. The jet-ejector behavior has been predicted with a validated computational fluid dynamics approach and the dynamic response of the overall system accounts for transient effects in a small parabolic trough collector and a hot thermal storage tank. The investigation shows that the adjustable jet-ejector allows for continuous and smooth operation in a much wider range of outdoor conditions. Additionally, it enables more efficient management of the thermal level in the hot storage system. As a result, the adjustable refrigeration system improves the performance indicators in all the warm months of the typical meteorological year under evaluation. The maximum improvement potential is found in May; the fixed-geometry system provides an average COPth of 0.34 while the adjustable system reaches an average COPth of 0.48 considering the same boundary conditions in both cases.

AB  - Range anxiety has remained a critical technological bottleneck in electric vehicles (EVs). The issue lies in the fact that the estimation of the EV's batteries state of charge (SoC) is still inaccurate and unreliable due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of the batteries. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel real-time mixed SoC estimation algorithm for the EV's lithium-ion batteries for implementation in an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The mixed estimation algorithm combines: i) an improved Coulomb counting method (CCM) that takes into account the battery state-of-health, operating temperature, and aging effect, ii) a model-based method (MBM) that represents a real-time recursive structure of the battery, and iii) a bottom-up basedmethod (BUBM) that takes into account a variety of the environmental conditions, traffic conditions, auxiliary loads, and driver's behavior. To validate the proposed algorithm, several laboratory tests under real-time driving cycles have been conducted on aManganese-oxide Li-ion cell of a 2012 Nissan Leaf battery cell. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model has been demonstrated by driving the Nissan Leaf along a selected route in Australia. The results demonstrate a great accuracy for the SoC estimation compared to previous models.

AB  - Based on infrared spectral characteristics, six archeological sample sets of charcoals from German (5) and Brazilian (1) sites, covering the time span from the nineteenth century CE to 3950 BCE, were compared to a chronological (present to the fifteenth century BCE) series of Austrian charcoals. A typical chronological trend of several bands (stretch vibrations: O-C-O of carboxylates at 1,585-1,565 and 1,385-1,375 cm(-1), C-O carboxylic acids at 1,260-1,250 cm(-1)) that indicate oxidation and subsequently increasing hydrophilicity (O-H stretch vibration at about 3,400 cm(-1)) was also contained in the archive samples. Three sample sets fit in the typical band development according to their age. For three sample sets this conformity was not observed. Despite the age of two sample sets (3950-2820 BCE), most charcoals were assigned to the Modern Period. Apart from the high degree of carbonization, anaerobic depositional conditions over a longer period of time seem to contribute to the surprising conservation. Non-removable mineral components in charcoals, as observed in a third sample set, strongly influence infrared band intensities and positions of organic compounds. The role of inorganic components in terms of charcoal aging, and the information we can obtain from spectral characteristics in an archeological context, are discussed.

AB  - Lead (Pb) ranks among the most problematic environmental pollutants. Background contamination of soils is nearly ubiquitous, yet plant Pb accumulation is barely understood. In a survey covering 165 European populations of the metallophyte Arabidopsis halleri, several field samples had indicated Pb hyperaccumulation, offering a chance to dissect plant Pb accumulation. Accumulation of Pb was analysed in A. halleri individuals from contrasting habitats under controlled conditions to rule out aerial deposition as a source of apparent Pb accumulation. Several elemental imaging techniques were employed to study the spatial distribution and ligand environment of Pb. Regardless of genetic background, A. halleri individuals showed higher shoot Pb accumulation than A. thaliana. However, dose-response curves revealed indicator rather than hyperaccumulator behaviour. Xylem sap data and elemental imaging unequivocally demonstrated the in planta mobility of Pb. Highest Pb concentrations were found in epidermal and vascular tissues. Distribution of Pb was distinct from that of the hyperaccumulated metal zinc. Most Pb was bound by oxygen ligands in bidentate coordination. A. halleri accumulates Pb whenever soil conditions render Pb phytoavailable. Considerable Pb accumulation under such circumstances, even in leaves of A. thaliana, strongly suggests that Pb can enter food webs and may pose a food safety risk.

AB  - This study uses a continuously sampling sensor to document the respiration rate dynamics of lactating dairy cows under conditions of heat stress. Previously available respiration rate data on lactating dairy cows had primarily been generated by manually counting flank movements at discrete points in time, typically several times per day. Continuous measurements provide much higher-resolution data over time. The primary objective of this study was to analyze these continuous respiration rate measurements in relation to ambient conditions, body temperature, lying time, and time of day. Better understanding continuous responses to heat stress may help synchronize cooling system operation to the cows' need for heat stress relief. For 19 days during a summer season in Wisconsin, eight lactating Holstein cows were equipped with sensors designed to detect the abdominal expansion associated with breathing. An algorithm was developed to derive respiration rate from each sensor's signal. To validate the accuracy of the sensor and algorithms, measurements from the sensor were compared to respiration rate measurements taken via visual observation. Overall, variation in continuously measured respiration rate corresponded to changes in temperature-humidity index (THI) and body temperature. However, respiration rate and body temperature also remained elevated at night despite decreasing THI.

AB  - FRET sensors based on fluorescent proteins have been powerful tools for probing protein-protein interactions and structural changes within proteins. However, they are intrinsically limited by their large size and the requirement for N- or C-terminal fusions. In this report, a FRET-based sensor was developed by incorporating a fluorescent unnatural amino acid into glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP), which formed a FRET pair with green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP was fused to the N-terminus of GlnBP, and the fluorescent unnatural amino acid was incorporated into the site for N138 in GlnBP. FRET sensors were tested that contained linkers of different length between GFP and GlnBP, and assay conditions were optimized by changing the pH and salt concentration of the assay buffer. Under optimal conditions, the best sensor protein produced a 1.9-fold increase in the FRET ratio upon L-Gln binding, whereas either no change or minimal change was seen using other amino acids, including the other 19 natural amino acids and D-Gln. This novel design strategy for FRET sensors overcomes the limitations of current FRET sensors, which require the use of two fluorescent proteins. Consequently, our strategy may prove useful for investigating protein-protein interactions and for probing changes in protein conformation.

AB  - Organisms tend to be sensitive to drastic changes in environmental conditions. For unicellular microorganisms, variations in physico-chemical conditions are particularly challenging and may result in acclimation, entrance into quiescence, or death through necrotic or autocatalytic pathways. This study focuses on the thecate dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense. Cellular responses to oxidative, thermal, and nutrient stress were characterized using stress indicators, such as pigment content, efficiency of photosystem II or production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as hallmarks of apoptosis including activity of caspase-like enzymes and expression of a metacaspase gene homolog. The formation of temporary cysts, a survival strategy of short-term quiescence, was also monitored. Cellular responses appeared to depend on multifactorial influences where type and intensity of stimulus as well as position in cell cycle may act in combination. Sequences of events observed implicate ROS production as a key determinant of stress-related pathways, playing potential roles in intracellular signaling, formation of temporary cysts, or cellular damage. Variations observed in caspase-like activities and metacaspase gene expression did not appear to be associated with programmed cell death pathways; our results suggest a wider range of functions for these proteases in phytoplankton cells, including roles in survival pathways and cell cycle progression.

AB  - In this article a quantitative analysis was devised assessing driver's cognition responses by exploring the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals in a left and right turning experiment on simulator environment. Driving brain signals have been collected by a 19-channel electroencephalogram recording system. The driving pathway has been selected with no obstacles, a set of indicators are used to inform the subjects when they had to turn left or right by means of keyboard left and right arrows. Subsequently in order to remove artifacts, preprocessing is performed on data to achieve high accuracy. Features of signals are extracted by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Absolute power of FFT is used as a basic feature. Scalar Feature selection method is applied to reduce feature dimension. Thereafter dimension-reduced features are fed to Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) recognizing different brain potentials stimulated by turning to left and right. The performances of HNN are evaluated by considering five conditions; before feature extraction, after feature extraction, before reduction of features, after analyzing reduced features and finally subject-wise Hopfield performances respectively. An increase occurred in each level and continued until it has reached its highest 97.6% of accuracy on last condition.

AB  - Although fish health may influence key population-level processes, particularly those dealing with natural mortality, reproduction, and growth, which, in turn, affect stock productivity, little emphasis has been placed on the links between fish health and the management of marine fisheries. This article addresses this gap and illustrates how knowledge of fish health could provide insight for marine fisheries biologists, stock assessment modelers, and managers. The study proposes ways in which the consideration of condition indicators (energy reserves) and parasitism improves stock assessment and fisheries management, especially in situations of data shortage when standard methods cannot be applied, as is the case in many Mediterranean fish stocks. This article focuses on seven case studies of different fish species from the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Overall, and although the relationship between fish health and productivity cannot always be found or quantified, the article emphasizes the importance of the physical health of exploited stocks, particularly during critical life periods of the fish (e. g., prior to spawning, migration, or in the early life stages), as an essential element of sustainable and profitable fisheries. On the basis of these results, stock assessment and fisheries management implications are discussed.

AB  - Performance assessment is an increasingly relevant concept in present-day irrigation systems. To this end some indicators have been proposed for comparing actual performance with established design criteria. Concerning sprinkler irrigation, evaluation of the jet losses due to environmental conditions can be considered an important indicator of system performance. The issue requires a full analytical description of spray flow and waste and entails both experimental and theoretical studies. In the former, it appears to be difficult to identify, and so to measure, the contribution of each parameter to the final result; in the latter, the non-linear relationships among the variables make it difficult to obtain an exhaustive analytical picture of the process. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted recently in an attempt to gain a deeper insight into the phenomenon but much work still remains to be done. A mathematical model for irrigation sprinkler droplet ballistics, based on a simplified dynamic approach to the phenomenon, has been presented. The results compare very favourably with the kinematic results obtained by other authors using more complicated procedures. Moreover, field trials showed the model to reliably estimate spray evaporation losses caused by environmental conditions. Further analytic and experimental work is needed to gain a better understanding of the problem. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Seed priming protocols implement incomplete imbibition phases, as well as physical, chemical or biological treatments, to activate pre-germinative metabolism and stress response, thus improving germination performances, seedling establishment and stress tolerance according to agricultural productivity requirements. The dehydration phase following priming treatments represents a critical variable, since an excessively prolonged imbibition (overpriming) impairs desiccation tolerance, compromising seed viability and seedling establishment. Priming protocols generally optimize imbibition-dehydration timing empirically to avoid overpriming. Hence, a better understanding of the dynamics underlying the loss of desiccation tolerance represents a promising route to test and develop efficient and cost-effective priming techniques. In the present work, priming and overpriming conditions were defined to explore the role of desiccation tolerance in seed priming efficiency in the model legume Medicago truncatula. The positive effects of hydropriming and kinetin-mediated hormopriming on germination parameters were screened in combination with conditions of short/prolonged priming and mild/severe overpriming. Biometric analyses highlighted contrasting responses in terms of germination performances and seedling development, while ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels measured during dehydration positively correlate with the loss of desiccation tolerance in early seedlings, suggesting possible applications to monitor priming progression and predict overpriming occurrence.

AB  - The typhoon process has a significant influence on the distribution of heavy metals in sediments. Based on the heavy metal (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Mn) contents in surface sediments collected under normal conditions and post-typhoon Matmo in Quanzhou Bay in 2014, the distributions, sources, and impacts of typhoon processes on heavy metals and pollution conditions were studied and discussed. The results showed that the heavy metals can be divided into two categories: Class I metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Mn) were mainly distributed in the estuary and significantly increased after the typhoon, and Class II metals (V, Cr, Co, and Ni) were distributed in the coastal intertidal zone and estuary and remained unchanged or decreased after the typhoon. The heavy metal assessment showed that heavy metal pollution in Quanzhou Bay was serious and tended to increase after the typhoon. The increased metal supply and enhanced riverine and tidal hydrodynamics after the typhoon may be the main factors influencing the variations in heavy metal content and distribution. This study provided a basis for the accurate evaluation and scientific management of heavy metal pollution caused by typhoon processes in Quanzhou Bay.

AB  - Nitrates represent one of the main groups of contaminants in the Zagreb aquifer system. Some natural groundwater quality indicators can have a significant influence on their stability and mobility in the saturated zone. Correlation and multivariate statistical analyses were used to test the correlation of average values of NO3- with O-2, ORP, pH, EC and temperature of groundwater, and to allocate observation wells that belong to the same clusters. ORP values didn't relate to any observed variables, which is probably due to their variability which suggests changes in the oxidation-reduction conditions in the aquifer system. Principal component analysis was used for the determination of variables that are related to the nitrate concentrations and which were then used in cluster analysis. Other variables were excluded from cluster analysis. Three methods were used to perform cluster analysis, where the results calculated with Ward's method were chosen as the most appropriate. In the end, two clusters were identified, one with smaller, and one with higher NO3-, O-2 and EC values. Observation wells from cluster 1 are generally located near the Sava River and have similar nitrate concentrations. Lack of other nitrogen species and moderately aerobic conditions suggest very fast nitrification in the shallow Holocene aquifer.

AB  - A low-cost infrared measurement system has been developed to monitor in real time thermal comfort conditions in indoor environments. The device employs a scanning linear array of thermopiles installed on the ceiling of the room and is assessed and controlled by an embedded microcontroller to measure indoor surface temperatures. This feature allows the evaluation of the mean radiant temperature (T-r), in compliance with ISO 7726, for several positions inside the space. Together with T-r, the variables required by ISO 7730 are measured to calculate the predicted mean vote (PMV). The PMV and T-r are provided as real-time outputs of the device through a wireless or wired connection, also as distribution maps. The paper reports a detailed description of the system, its calibration and uncertainty analysis. The capability of predicting thermal comfort conditions for multiple positions in the room has been tested and validated in a real case study with respect to a reference measurement system (microclimate station). Comparison showed a deviation of +/- 0.5 degrees C for T-r and +/- 0.1 for PMV without direct solar radiation and an average deviation of +/- 2.0 degrees C for T-r and +/- 0.2 for PMV with direct solar radiation.

AB  - Defoliation is one of the most important parameters monitored in the International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests). Defoliation is an indicator for forest health and vitality. Conventional statistical analysis shows weak or not significant correlations between tree crown defoliation and climatic conditions or air pollution parameters, because of its high variability. The study aims to evaluate the most important factors among climatic, pollutants (N-ox and NHy) and stand parameters affecting crown defoliation of the main European tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Quercus ilex, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus petraea) through application of a new and powerful statistical classifier, the random forests analysis (RFA). RFA highlighted that tree crown defoliation was mainly related to age in P. abies, to geographic location in F. sylvatica and to air pollution predictors in Q. ilex, while it was similarly linked to meteorological and air pollution predictors in P. sylvestris and Q. petraea. In this study, RFA has proven to be, for the first time, a useful tool to discern the most important predictors affecting tree crown defoliation, and consequently, it can be used for an appropriate forest management.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increase in the use of watershed-based cumulative effects assessment (WCEA) in Canada; however, several challenges remain regarding its effective implementation and execution. Fundamental to WCEA is the establishment of linkages between environmental stressors and particular and measurable components of the aquatic environment. Dynamic and often synergistic relationships between the multiple physicochemical stressors in the landscape can affect water quantity, quality, and the health of aquatic species. Essential decisions must be made about what to measure to characterize both stressors and aquatic effects, what scale is appropriate for measurement, and to what the measurements should be referenced. This review presents lessons learned from case studies conducted in 6 different watersheds across Canada, each focused on advancing the science behind WCEA, but with varied objectives and approaches. Issues of scale, selection of aquatic environmental components or indicators for assessment, and reference conditions were compared and contrasted to highlight common challenges that can affect the implementation and outcome of a WCEA. The lack of long-term monitoring data and data inconsistencies were identified as frequently limiting factors for the advancement of WCEA science and the application of WCEA. Recommendations were made for developing a comprehensive and integrated methodology for WCEA in Canada. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2013;9:370-379. (c) 2013 SETAC

AB  - The present investigation conducted to study the fundamental aspects of fruit development that determine fruit size would indicate how and when size could be affected and to specify which components could be environmentally manipulated and which are fixed under genetic control. With this objective fruit compositional changes in pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) cv Dholka, comprises length, volume and weight, seed+aril weight and number of seed+aril per fruit, rind weight, rind thickness seed, calyx length, calyx diameter and juice content were evaluated in fruits of variable sizes. Pearson correlations and factor analysis were determined to find out association among fruit and aril traits. Results indicated that fruit length, fruit volume, fruit weight, seed+aril weight per fruit and number of seed+aril per fruit are closely correlated therefore; any of these traits could be utilized as an indicator of fruit size. The number of seed+arils per fruit was highly correlated with fruit size with larger fruit containing greater numbers of arils. This is in contrast to individual average aril weight, which showed no significant relationship to fruit size. These results will be useful to breeding programs that require awareness of fruit qualities in the selection of traits for improvement. For production strategies which aim in increasing aril numbers for obtaining larger fruits in pomegranate cv Dholka under temperate condition.

AB  - Background: Many tools used to analyze microarrays in different conditions have been described. However, the integration of deregulated genes within coherent metabolic pathways is lacking. Currently no objective selection criterion based on biological functions exists to determine a threshold demonstrating that a gene is indeed differentially expressed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To improve transcriptomic analysis of microarrays, we propose a new statistical approach that takes into account biological parameters. We present an iterative method to optimise the selection of differentially expressed genes in two experimental conditions. The stringency level of gene selection was associated simultaneously with the p-value of expression variation and the occurrence rate parameter associated with the percentage of donors whose transcriptomic profile is similar. Our method intertwines stringency level settings, biological data and a knowledge database to highlight molecular interactions using networks and pathways. Analysis performed during iterations helped us to select the optimal threshold required for the most pertinent selection of differentially expressed genes.
   Conclusions/Significance: We have applied this approach to the well documented mechanism of human macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. We thus verified that our method was able to determine with the highest degree of accuracy the best threshold for selecting genes that are truly differentially expressed.

AB  - Seventy-six surface marine sediment samples from the northwest margin of North America, between 40degreesN and 60degreesN, were analysed for their palynological content in order to document the regional distribution of dinocyst assemblages and their relationships with environmental conditions (sea-surface temperature and salinity, productivity and upwelling). The results illustrate a high concentration of dinocysts, notably in the neritic area (up to 34 000 cysts cm(-3)) and a relatively high species diversity with 32 taxa identified. The assemblages include cysts of both autotrophic and heterotrophic species. Brigantedinium spp. accompanied by other heterotrophic taxa such as Votadinium spp., Quinquecuspis concreta, Trinovantedinium variabile and Lejeunecysta spp. dominate in the nearshore areas influenced by seasonal upwelling. The offshore sites are dominated by autotrophic taxa represented mainly by Operculodinium centrocarpum, Pyxidinopsis reticulata, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and Impagidinium aculeatum in the south, and by O. centrocarpum, Pentapharsodinium dalei, Spiniferites ramosus and Spiniferites elongatus in the Gulf of Alaska. Principal component analysis demonstrates that the regional distribution of dinocyst assemblages is controlled by the primary productivity and upwelling, and by the winter temperature gradient.

AB  - Initial investigations of Holocene carbonate sediment from Hawes Water, Northwest England, yielded lower numbers of chironomid head capsules than anticipated. Standard techniques used to prepare sediment for chironomid analysis were ineffective in breaking up the coarse crystalline sediment structure sufficiently. This led to large amounts of sediment being retained and increased sample processing times. The low yield of head capsules also meant that more sediment was needed to produce adequate numbers of head capsules for analysis. The use of ultra-sound as part of the sediment processing was investigated. This technique reduced the amount of sediment left for sorting and yielded significantly more head capsules which were of equivalent structural condition and cleaner than those produced by conventional methods. The technique was extended to clay samples where similar results were obtained although shorter treatment times are recommended. The proportion of Tanytarsini and Tanypodinae heads increased significantly in carbonate and clay samples, respectively; both sediment types showed a significant decline in the proportion of Chironomini. The results indicate that ultra-sonic preparation of samples will yield a more accurate representation of chironomid assemblages in sediments leading to greater sensitivity and reliability in analysing past environmental conditions.

AB  - In line with the prevailing global interest in value extraction from biomass waste streams, the current study explored the technical feasibility of valorizing waste apple pomace (WAP) to produce high-value biochemicals of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), lactic acid, and xylitol. Technical feasibility was demonstrated via a process simulation study that employed experimental data and incorporated previously reported approaches in the literature. Economic and environmental performances of the WAP based biorefinery were assessed using the internal rate of return (IRR) and the mass of greenhouse gas emission per unit mass of feedstock (G(F)) as sufficient performance indicators, respectively. The study was able to show that as the IRR value increased (better economic performance), the G(F) increased (poorer environmental performance). This suggested that the determination of the optimal condition of the environmental and economic performances would require the imposition of trade-offs. The preferred trade-off condition for enhanced economic and environmental performances was subsequently determined via multi-objective optimization, with a Pareto front containing non-dominated equally optimal solutions subsequently developed. The present work, therefore, provides an in-depth performance analysis of WAP based biorefinery as a waste management strategy. Notably, the proposed strategy of multiple product generation from biomass may be extended to other organic waste based biorefineries.

AB  - Native pig breeds originate from local, primitive breeds. In Poland the 'Pulawska', 'Zlotnicka White' and 'Zlotnicka Spotted' pigs are considered native breeds. Pigs of such breeds possess many valuable traits inherited from primitive ancestors, including adaptation to local environmental conditions, feed resources and farming conditions. They are characterized by good indicators of breeding performance. Nowadays, these pigs are usually kept in individual and organic farms where they provide good fattening results even with less favourable nutrition and maintenance. Pigs of the 'Pulawska' breed compared to the 'Zlotnicka' one have a higher content of meat in the carcass, however still lower than in high-production breeds of pigs. Better slaughter value parameters can be achieved by cross-breeding of native pig breeds with conventional ones. Despite their lower meatiness, meat obtained from the native pig breeds is of good quality. Due to proper protein, water and fat content, as well as higher intramuscular fat content, meat obtained from native pig breeds is often used to produce premium quality meat products. Taking into consideration current Polish market requirements, increasing the population of native pig breeds seems challenging, but is possible in the production of traditional and regional food the popularity of which is growing.

AB  - This paper deals with the health monitoring of tubular structures by means of Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGW) technique. It investigates mainly the stability of measurements, which is a key topic in Structural Health Monitoring. A corrosion-like defect is machined in a full-scale tube and then its size is increased in five steps. Their cross-section areas (CSA) go from less than 1% to around 4.5%. To get a high accuracy, a 3D laser scanner was used to measure these CSAs. The influence of the probe/tube adhesion quality on defect detectability is investigated. Propagation mode type and central frequency are also taken into account. Environmental and operational conditions variations (EOC) are studied too. Regarding the obtained results, it can be concluded that the UGW are an efficient technique for the monitoring of tubes. However, to reach a high-performance level, statistical algorithms are needed to face the problem of EOC and then manage false alarms as reliable as possible. Furthermore, to make data more stable, special care should be paid to the implementation of the sensor, such as glue durability, bonding issues, etc. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cliff coasts are dynamic environments that can retreat very quickly. However, the short-term changes and factors contributing to cliff coast erosion have not received as much attention as dune coasts. In this study, three soft-cliff systems in the southern Baltic Sea were monitored with the use of terrestrial laser scanner technology over a period of almost two years to generate a time series of thirteen topographic surveys. Digital elevation models constructed for those surveys allowed the extraction of several geomorphological indicators describing coastal dynamics. Combined with observational and modeled datasets on hydrological and meteorological conditions, descriptive and statistical analyses were performed to evaluate cliff coast erosion. A new statistical model of short-term cliff erosion was developed by using a non-parametric Bayesian network approach. The results revealed the complexity and diversity of the physical processes influencing both beach and cliff erosion. Wind, waves, sea levels, and precipitation were shown to have different impacts on each part of the coastal profile. At each level, different indicators were useful for describing the conditional dependency between storm conditions and erosion. These results are an important step toward a predictive model of cliff erosion.

AB  - Context: The sugar cane plantlet stage undergoes stress during the strengthening period, which may be caused by various reasons: pest infestation, nutritional deficiencies, and mechanical damages due to manipulation, which bring about the loss of genetic material.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of five bio stimulants on sugar cane seedlings strengthening and resistance to transplantation.
   Methods: A completely randomized experimental design with six treatments (absolute control and samples with the application of azotobacter, phosphorine, improved natural liquid humus, and mineral-fortified liquid humus (BoCalZn)), and four repetitions, was applied. The seedlings were placed on a 60-well tray filled with a mix of soil and filter cake. Seven foliar applications were made between 7 and 56 days following transplantation. Plant height and thickness, foliar area, root length, number of active roots, and fresh and dry weights were evaluated 50 days after. For evaluation of resistance to transplantation, the strengthened plantlets were placed in field conditions, and after 45 days their survival percentage was determined.
   Results: The positive effect of biostimulant application was observed on the morphophysiological indicators.
   Conclusions: The application of biostimulants showed the positive effect on the morphophysiological indicators evaluated. The best results in resistance to transplantation of the mineral-fortified liquid humus (BoCalZn) were observed in field conditions.

AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is an antibacterial and antifungal agent widely used in personal care products, and it has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In the present study, the acute toxicity of TCS to Daphnia magna, Photobacterium phosphoreum, Danio rerio, and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri was assessed under different pH conditions. Generally, TCS was more toxic to the four aquatic organisms in acidic medium. The LC50 values for D. magna and D. rerio were smaller among the selected species, suggesting that D. magna and D. rerio were more sensitive to TCS. In addition, the oxidative stress-inducing potential of TCS was evaluated in Carassius auratus at three pH values. Changes of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione (GSH) level, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were commonly observed in all TCS exposure groups, indicating the occurrence of oxidative stress in the liver of C. auratus. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index revealed that a high concentration of TCS induced great oxidative stress in goldfish under acidic condition. This work supplements the presently available data on the toxicity data of TCS, which would provide some useful information for the environmental risk assessment of this compound.

AB  - The anatomic structure of roots and calms of two Juncus species with different degrees of salt tolerance was analysed in plants grown for two months under salt stress (NaCl treatments) and in control, non-treated plants. The aim of the study was not only to compare the anatomical structures of a halophyte (J. acutus) and a related glycophyre (J. articulatus), but mostly to assess whether salt stress induced anatomical modifications, by identifying differences between control and treated plants. Several slight differences have been indeed detected, in terms of endodermis type, development of aerenchyma and extent of sclerenchyma in perivascular sheaths. The role of Casparian endodermis was here discussed in relation to its complex implications in controlling salt influx at the root level that is an efficient mechanism involved in halophytes. Aerenchyma is a common feature found in marshy halophytes, allowing them to survive naturally under flooding conditions; however, when occurring in non-waterlogged plants, as is the case of this study, it should be regarded as a genetically, constitutive adaptation rather than an inducible one. Nevertheless, such anatomic modifications should be regarded as mere alterations due CO stress that is, as stress responses and not as truly adaptations to salinity. In this context, the nature of these modifications either considered as adaptations or damage indicators of salt stress should be further reconsidered.

AB  - High predation risk and food depletion lead to sexual reproduction in cyclically parthenogenetic Daphnia. Mating, the core of sexual reproduction, also occurs under these conditions. Assessment of the environmental conditions and alteration of mating efforts may aid in determining the success of sexual reproduction. Here, we evaluated the impacts of predation risk, food quantity, and reproductive phase of females on the mating behavior of Daphnia obtusa males including contact frequency and duration using video analysis. Mating-related behavior involved male-female contact (mating) as well as male-male contact (fighting). Mating frequency increased while unnecessary fighting decreased in the presence of predation risk. In addition, low food concentration reduced fighting between males. Males attempted to attach to sexual females more than asexual females, and fighting occurred more frequently in the presence of sexual females. Duration of mating was relatively long; however, males separated shortly after contact in terms of fighting behavior. Thus, assessment of environmental factors and primary sexing of mates were performed before actual contact, possibly mechanically, and precise sex discrimination was conducted after contact. These results suggest that mating in Daphnia is not a random process but rather a balance between predation risk and energetic cost that results in changes in mating and fighting strategies.

AB  - An evaluation of the hygienic-sanitary conditions of a processing industry of pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.) pulp preserve located in the northern area of the state of Minas Gerais was accomplished. The microbial load of the pulp of the fruit in natura, the freshly detached pulp, the pulp stored after the bleaching, hands of handlers, surfaces in contact with the pulp, air, and water were evaluated. The following analysis were carried out: total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeast and mould, enterobacteria, total coliform and coliform bacteria at 45 degrees C, as well as the research of bacteria potentially pathogenic, such as Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus coagulase positive. In variable proportions, the presence of indicators of fecal contamination, pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms were verified. Inefficiency of the procedures of personal hygiene and sanitization of the manipulation surfaces were demonstrated. The water used by the industry was in non-conformance with the bacteriological standards required by the Brazilian legislation. The results alert for the need of implementation of a microbiologic monitoring system in the processing area of pequi pulp preserves, including equipments, utensils, surfaces, air, water and handlers. The implementation of Good Manufacturing Practices will be an essential tool for the evaluated industry to guarantee the safety of the final product.

AB  - Selected environmental indicators for sugarbeet Cultivation were calculated from data of a farm survey for 285 fields. Indicators represented the intensity of tillage. fertilizer application and plant protection, and evaluated possible impacts oil the environment. With the help of these indicators it Could be shown that the tillage intensity had been adapted to the fields' erosion risks, and that potential soil loss remained tolerable. N-fertilizer application partly exceeded the demand although the resulting N-balances still have to be assessed in the Course of crop rotation. The treatment index for the chemical plant protection was similar in different survey regions because, oil the whole. regional distinctions, in the use of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides compensated for each other. In spite of taking into account worst-case-conditions. there was no higher risk potential for organisms in soil, waters and field boundaries.
   On average of the fields file intensity of crop cultivation had no effects oil the environment. On some fields however. the potential tor ail optimized adaptation to the plant demand, and the local conditions became obvious. On the whole, the indicators proved suitable to obtain information across farms about the environmental situation in sugarbeet cultivation.

AB  - Tributyltin (TBT) pollution has been assessed in NW Brittany since 1992 using the bioindicator imposex in Nucella lapillus. The Bay of Brest is highly polluted by TBT and the outgoing water mass has contaminated the adjacent NW coasts. However environmental conditions have been improving in NW Brittany. The decrease in TBT pollution is most likely due to the reformulated antifouling paints (with slower leaching rates or TBT-free) that are used for civil and military careening activities in the Bay of Brest. An increase in imposex levels in 1998 could have been due to the launching of the aircraft carrier 'Charles de Gaulle'. It remains unknown when imposex levels reached their maximum because of the lack of annual surveys in 1996, 1997 and 1999. This underscores the need for annual surveys when using imposex as a monitoring tool. At 3 locations within the Bay of Brest, new populations of N. lapillus have appeared since 1998. At other stations, populations have grown in number of individuals and colonised adjacent rocks. The percentage of less severely affected imposex females (vas deferens sequence stage 3) has increased since 1998. As TBT could soon be banned from antifouling paints, further recovery of favourable environmental conditions for N. lapillus is expected.

AB  - Aging is the result of the deterioration of the homeostatic systems (nervous, endocrine, and immune systems), which preserve the organism's health. We propose that the age-related impairment of these systems is due to the establishment of a chronic oxidative stress situation that leads to low-grade chronic inflammation throughout the immune system's activity. It is known that the immune system weakens with age, which increases morbidity and mortality. In this context, we describe how the function of immune cells can be used as an indicator of the rate of aging of an individual. In addition to this passive role as a marker, we describe how the immune system can work as a driver of aging by amplifying the oxidative-inflammatory stress associated with aging (oxi-inflamm-aging) and inducing senescence in far tissue cells. Further supporting our theory, we discuss how certain lifestyle conditions (such as social environment, nutrition, or exercise) can have an impact on longevity by affecting the oxidative and inflammatory state of immune cells, regulating immunosenescence and its contribution to oxi-inflamm-aging.

AB  - Escherichia coli dynamics in urban watersheds are affected by a complex balance among external inputs, niche modulation and genetic variability. To explore the ecological processes influencing E. coli spatial patterns, we analyzed its abundance and phylogenetic structure in water samples from a stream network with heterogeneous urban infrastructure and environmental conditions. Our results showed that environmental and infrastructure variables, such as macrophyte coverage, DIN and sewerage density, mostly explained E. coli abundance. Moreover, main generalist phylogroups A and B1 were found in high proportion, which, together with an observed negative relationship between E. coli abundance and phylogroup diversity, suggests that their dominance might be due to competitive exclusion. Lower frequency phylogroups were associated with sites of higher ecological disturbance, mainly involving simplified habitats, higher drainage infrastructure and septic tank density. In addition to the strong negative relationship between phylogroup diversity and dominance, the occurrence of these phylogroups would be associated with increased facilitated dispersal. Nutrients also contributed to explaining phylogroup distribution. Our study proposes the differential contribution of distinct ecological processes to the patterns of E. coli in an urban watershed, which is useful for the monitoring and management of fecal pollution.

AB  - Several countries included the assessment of environmental drift contamination risk for the registration of pesticides. This practice is not yet totality effective in Brazil; however, due to the large number of pesticides in use, it is important to identify the real contamination risk during pesticide spraying. Therefore, this study determined the indices of environmental risks for exposure to drift from terrestrial applications of fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides that are used in soybean crops under Brazilian climate conditions and established buffer zones for the application of these products. Based on the three prediction drift models for soybeans in Brazil, risk indices were computed for aquatic organisms and terrestrial organisms according to the modelling procedures proposed by the POCER (Pesticide Occupation and Environmental Risk) and HAIR (Harmonized Environmental Indicators for Pesticide Risk) methodologies. In general, aquatic organisms are the most sensitive to drift contamination, being chlorothalonil, trifluralin and chlorpyrifos the ones that presented the higher risk indexes. No risk was found for earthworms; in contrast, the insecticides chlorpyrifos, spinosad and thiamethoxam presented risks to bees regardless of the nozzle (droplet size) used for the determination of the drift curve, resulting in the demand for different buffer zones.

AB  - Current conservation instruments, which for most species rely heavily on protected areas, are insufficient to halt biodiversity loss. Conservation initiatives in the wider landscape surrounding protected areas are needed to achieve the impact required for reversing negative biodiversity trends. Focussing on intensively used north-western European landscapes, we present a landscape-level conservation approach that coordinates, integrates and evaluates conservation management by different stakeholders in protected areas, farmland and public space. The starting point is the set of environmental conditions or the habitat characteristics that is needed to realize stable or positive biodiversity trends. Such sets are captured in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can be quantified easily over large areas. Integrated monitoring and evaluation of the relationships between KPIs, management and biodiversity need to be used to validate initial assumptions and continuously improve conservation effectiveness. Evaluation relies on trend monitoring in areas with and without conservation management and extrapolations to landscape-level biodiversity trends based on the total area on which conservation is being implemented. The relationships between biodiversity and KPIs can subsequently be used to develop biodiversity-based business models and to inspire and help stakeholders within and outside these focal areas to actively join the initiative.

AB  - To evaluate new applications of cellulose hydrogel films prepared via the dissolution-regeneration of microcrystalline cellulose in two hydrophilic ionic liquids - 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (Bmi-mAc) and chloride (BmimCl), their optical, mechanical, and adsorption properties were concurrently studied and compared for the first time. The mild conditions under which both films were optically transparent and easy to handle were found. The BmimAc-reconstituted films exhibited an increased tensile strength and elongation at break of 9.5 and 2.5 times, respectively, than the BmimCl-reconstituted films. Due to the sponge-like morphology of the surface, BmimAc-reconstituted films demonstrate enhanced adsorption ability with respect to indigo carmine that is widely applied for industrial needs. This finding opens up opportunities for their use as an adsorbent for dyes. BmimCl-reconstituted films appeared to be a more promising material for the noncovalent immobilization of pyronin B, which is a component of the optical indicator systems for detecting different biologically active compounds.

AB  - The sustainability of biological, social, economic and ecological communities is often determined by the outcome of social conflicts between cooperative and selfish individuals (cheaters). Cheaters avoid the cost of contributing to the community and can occasionally spread in the population leading to the complete collapse of cooperation. Although such collapse often unfolds unexpectedly, it is unclear whether one can detect the risk of cheater's invasions and loss of cooperation in an evolving community. Here, we combine dynamical networks and evolutionary game theory to study the abrupt loss of cooperation with tools for studying critical transitions. We estimate the risk of cooperation collapse following the introduction of a single cheater under gradually changing conditions. We observe an increase in the average time it takes for cheaters to be eliminated from the community as the risk of collapse increases. We argue that such slow system response resembles slowing down in recovery rates prior to a critical transition. In addition, we show how changes in community structure reflect the risk of cooperation collapse. We find that these changes strongly depend on the mechanism that governs how cheaters evolve in the community. Our results highlight novel directions for detecting abrupt transitions in evolving networks.

AB  - Hypoliths, photosynthetic microbial assemblages found underneath translucent rocks, are widely distributed within the western region of the Namib Desert and other similar environments. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis was used to assess the bacterial community structure of hypoliths and surrounding soil (below and adjacent to the hypolithic rock) at a fine scale (10m radius). Multivariate analysis of T-RFs showed that hypolithic and soil communities were structurally distinct. T-RFLP-derived operational taxonomic units were linked to 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Applying the ecological concept of indicator species', six and nine indicator lineages were identified for hypoliths and soil, respectively. Hypolithic communities were dominated by cyanobacteria affiliated to Pleurocapsales, whereas actinobacteria were prevalent in the soil. These results are consistent with the concept of species sorting and suggest that the bottom of the quartz rocks provides conditions suitable for the development of discrete and demonstrably different microbial assemblages. However, we found strong evidence for neutral assembly processes, as almost 90% of the taxa present in the hypoliths were also detected in the soil. These results suggest that hypolithons do not develop independently from microbial communities found in the surrounding soil, but selectively recruit from local populations.

AB  - This paper evaluates the usefulness of the hyperspectral imager (HSI) onboard Chinese HJ-1-A small satellite in vegetation mapping. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important surface microclimate parameter for characterizing land surface vegetation cover as well as the most effective indicator for assessing desertification and crop growth condition. The HJ-1/HSI data were used to calculate the narrow band vegetation index by using the in situ plot FVC data, which was then applied in sub-pixel de-composition model for the FVC estimation, namely the dimidiate pixel model. The FVC information in the Shihezi Area, Xinjiang, China was retrieved based on the dimidiate pixel model. Cross-checked with the in situ measured FVC data, a correlation coefficient square of 0.86, and the root mean square error of 10.9% is statistically achieved. The verification indicates that the FVC result retrieved from the HJ-1/HSI data is well correlated with the in situ measurements, demonstrating that the HJ-1/HSI data are promising for studying the potential impacts of global climate change on the arid and semi-arid landscapes.

AB  - The Patagonian Lakes have particular environmental conditions with or without intermittent disturbances. The study of the microorganisms present in aquatic ecosystems has increased notably because they can be used as micro-scale bioindicators of, among others, anthropogenic pollution and climatic change. The aim of the work was to compare the composition of the bacterial communities associated with sediments of three Patagonian Lakes with different geomorphologic patterns and disturbances. The lake sediments were characterized by molecular techniques, physiology profiles and physico-chemical analyses. The metabolic and physiological profiles of the microbial community demonstrated that non-impacted Tranquilo Lake is statistically different to impacted Bertrand and Plomo Lakes. Similar results were detected by DGGE profiles. FISH results demonstrated that betaproteobacteria showed the highest count in the Tranquilo Lake while gammaproteobacteria showed the highest counts in the Bertrand and Plomo Lakes, indicating that their sediments are highly dystrophic. The results demonstrate differences in the metabolic activity and structural and functional composition of bacterial communities of the studied lakes, which have different geomorphological patterns due to disturbances such as volcanic activity and the climatic change.

AB  - Most research on occupational stress and health examines singular psychosocial or physical work characteristics. Occasionally, the interactive health effects of multiple psychosocial and physical work characteristics are examined. Most approaches to occupational stress and health, however, do not fully capture the complex, dynamic ecological context of work stress. This article proposes and tests a model of cumulative risk, a concept adapted from developmental psychology, as an alternative perspective on occupational stress and health. Cumulative risk models categorize singular psychosocial or physical work characteristics dichotomously as risks or stressors that are either present or absent for each worker. Cumulative risk is then the simple additive summation of these multiple dichotomous categories. Herein, the authors show in two different work settings (clerical offices and primary care hospitals) that the accumulation of relatively modest, low levels of multiple physical and psychosocial stressors is associated with multiple indicators of well-being, including fatigue, job stress, and psychological distress. The cumulative risk index, unlike singular risk exposures, predicts well-being. Furthermore, these associations replicate in two quite different work settings and are statistically independent of a control for negative affectivity, a general indicator of neuroticism.

AB  - The degradation and partitioning of sucralose during exposure to a variety of environmental and advanced treatment processes (ATP) and the effect of sucralose on indicator plant species were systematically assessed. Bench scale experiments were used to reproduce conditions from environmental processes (microbial degradation, hydrolysis, soil sorption) and ATPs (chlorination, ozonation, sorption to activated carbon, and UV radiation). Degradation only occurred to a limited extent during hydrolysis, ozonation, and microbial processes indicating that breakdown of sucralose will likely be slow and incomplete leading to accumulation in surface waters. Further, the persistence of sucralose was compared to suggested human tracer compounds, caffeine and acesulfame-K. In comparison sucralose exhibits similar or enhanced characteristics pertaining to persistence, prevalence, and facile detection and can therefore be considered an ideal tracer for anthropogenic activity. Ecological effects of sucralose were assessed by measuring sucrose uptake inhibition in plant cotelydons and aquatic plant growth impairment. Sucralose did not inhibit plant cotelydon sucrose uptake, nor did it effect frond number, wet weight, or growth rate in aquatic plant, Lemna gibba. Though sucralose does not appear toxic to plant growth, the peristent qualities of sucralose may lead to chronic low-dose exposure with largely unknown consequences for human and environmental health.

AB  - We assess species composition, assemblage structure and distribution of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages from diverse substrates in Moreton Bay, South-East Queensland, Australia. Analysis of 47 surface sediment samples revealed 69 species, three distinct foraminiferal assemblages and six sub-assemblages. The assemblages from the western Bay are characterized by stress tolerant taxa and the lowest diversity, whereas the assemblages from the eastern Bay are characterized by symbiont-bearing taxa and high diversity. We found a correlation between foraminiferal assemblages and substrate conditions that was indicative of strong environmental gradients (substrate type, water quality and salinity), from an urban-impacted assemblage in the westernmost part of the Bay, to a hyposaline, estuarine-influenced assemblage in the western Bay to a nearly normal marine to hypersaline assemblage in the eastern Bay. The FORAM Index was consistent with the changes in water and sediment quality gradient, from the western shoreline to the eastern Bay. Thus the foraminiferal assemblages of Moreton Bay make excellent bio-indicators of environmental changes in a subtropical, estuarine setting in eastern Australia.

AB  - Bacteria, moulds, endotoxin and quartz from respirable dust of agricultural and industrial buildings are typically incriminated for the respiratory health decline of exposed workers despite that dust being an undefined mixture and quantification methods of aerosolized bacteria, moulds or endotoxin not being standardized yet. We developed an in vitro alveolar epithelial cell system in which biological activities of peat moss factories' dust might be correlated to bacteria, mould, endotoxin and quartz concentrations of the analyzed samples. Following exposure, interleukin-8 protein secretion, necrosis and apoptosis of the exposed A549 cells were monitored respectively with ELISA on cell supernatants, trypan blue exclusion and DNA fragmentation detection by flow cytometry. Respirable dust was collected with liquid impingers and respirable quartz with 10 mm Dorr-Oliver cyclones. We quantified mesophilic bacteria, mesophilic moulds and endotoxins from liquid impinger samples. No correlation was observed between biological activities of dust and bacteria, mould, endotoxin or quartz concentrations under our experimental conditions. Our speculation is that simple measurements, such as dust concentrations, may not be adequate indicators of the human respiratory health hazard for a given environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a framework for the protection and improvement of transitional and coastal waters; its final objective is to achieve at least 'good water status' for all waters, by 2015. The WFD requires Member States (MSs) to assess the Ecological Status (ES) of water bodies. This assessment will be based upon the status of the biological, hydromorphological and physico-chemical quality elements, by comparing data obtained from monitoring networks to reference (undisturbed) conditions, and then deriving an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR). One of the biological quality elements to be considered is the benthic invertebrate component and some structural parameters (composition, diversity and disturbance-sensitive taxa) must be included in the ES assessment. Following these criteria, several approaches to benthic invertebrate assessment have been proposed by MSs. The WFD requires that these approaches are intercalibrated.
   This contribution describes the comparison of the different methodologies proposed by United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark and Norway. Results show a high consistency between the approaches, both with regard to determining the EQR and boundary settings for the ES. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small differences between the left and right sides of otherwise symmetric traits are related to developmental instability and can indicate how well the genome is suited to current developmental conditions. As these small asymmetries (termed fluctuating asymmetry, or FA) can reveal how well the genome is suited to the environment, researchers have postulated that FA can indicate fitness and be used by other animals as a visual cue to fitness in sexual and social encounters. Despite these claims, we know little about how animals perceive subtle symmetry differences and whether such cues could be used in nature. Here we investigate the symmetry detection abilities of wild caught European starlings Sturnus vulgaris. We presented symmetric and asymmetric images, that resemble the complex dot patterns commonly observed on starling chest plumage, through a series of operant learning sessions. Asymmetric images were produced by introducing a 40% dot number asymmetry. Following extended learning sessions, the birds were not able to accurately discriminate symmetry from asymmetry. Although complex dot patterns (similar to those studies here) are common in nature, it appears unlikely that starlings (and perhaps other birds) could use number asymmetry in such traits as a direct cue to mediate behavioural interactions.

AB  - Climate models predict significant warming in the Arctic in the 21st century, which will impact the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as well as alter land-ocean interactions in the Arctic. Because river discharge and nutrient flux integrate large-scale processes, they should be sensitive indicators of change, but detection of future changes requires knowledge of current conditions. Our objective in this paper is to evaluate the current state of affairs with respect to estimating nutrient flux to the Arctic Ocean from Russian rivers. To this end we provide estimates of contemporary (1970s-1990s) nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate fluxes to the Arctic Ocean for 15 large Russian rivers. We rely primarily on the extensive data archives of the former Soviet Union and current Russian Federation and compare these values to other estimates and to model predictions. Large discrepancies exist among the various estimates. These uncertainties must be resolved so that the scientific community will have reliable data with which to calibrate Arctic biogeochemical models and so that we will have a baseline against which to judge future changes (either natural or anthropogenic) in the Arctic watershed.

AB  - Soil conditions, vegetation features and soil fauna were recorded in montane tall tussock grassland dominated by narrow-leaved snow tussock Chionochloa rigida ssp. rigida up to 30 months after a spring fire. Burning reduced the stature of tussocks and the size and density of tillers in the first growing season. After two growing seasons, tussock canopy development and tiller size remained below those found in the unburnt grassland nearby. New tillers and tussocks established following the prolific fire-induced flowering one year after burning. After the fire and sheep grazing, intertussock cover became progressively dominated by introduced grasses and herbs. While soil pH, moisture content, bulk density, surface litter and total nematodes showed significant treatment (burning) effects, these properties also showed significant year-to-year variation. The greatest increase in any nematode group was in Paratylenchus, a distinctive genus widespread in tussock grasslands and apparently responsive to environmental fluctuation and root development; its population was 100x and 29x greater in the burned area than in the control area 16 and 30 months after burning. Subject to detailed testing, populations of mites and collembola may provide relatively simple indicators of recovery of ecosystem function of such grasslands after burning.

AB  - We examined the association of physical activity (PA) facilities and access to school with total PA and domain-specific PA in adolescents. We enrolled 2610 adolescents (mean: 14.9 years) from Sao Paulo city. The number and presence of sports courts, swimming pools, locker rooms, running/athletics tracks, entrance accessible for student cyclists, bike racks, speed limit signal around the school, and pedestrian crossing were assessed in each school. All participants responded to a questionnaire about frequency and duration of physical education classes, leisure time, and active commuting. Total PA was obtained by adding up all PA domains. Presence of three or more (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.30) sports courts, swimming pool available in usable conditions (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.10), running/athletics tracks (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.07 to 5.18), and bike racks (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.78) were positively associated with total PA. Number of sports courts, swimming pool available in usable conditions, speed limit signals around the school, and pedestrian crossings were positively associated with physical education classes. The bike racks, speed limit signs around the school, and pedestrian crossings were positively associated with active commuting. School environment was associated with increased PA. Our findings should be considered in future epidemiologic studies and for educational and health policy makers.

AB  - Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) is an important food crop for people in semi-arid Africa. The crop is affected by post-flowering drought; therefore, the study was conducted to screen traits contributing to drought tolerance using BC2F4 sorghum genotypes in stressed and unstressed water conditions in a split-plot design. Water stress (0 mm/day) was applied at post-flowering to plant maturity in water-stressed treatment. The genotype SE438 produced the highest grain yield (2.65 ton ha(-1)) in water-stressed environment and NA316C yielded highest (3.42 ton ha(-1)) under well-watered (7 mm/day) environment. There were significant differences of most traits evaluated at p < 0.01 across environments. The mean squares of traits for genotypes by environments revealed interactions at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. The indices geometric mean productivity (GMP) and mean productivity (MP) were highly correlated with yield under well-watered (YP) and water-stressed condition (YS) and each other. The first principal axis (PC1) explained 59.1% of the total variation. It is the best indicator of yield potential and drought tolerance of sorghum genotypes in this study. Therefore, further improvement is needed to strengthen drought tolerance and yield in sorghum.

AB  - Defining the impact of anthropogenic stressors on Antarctic wildlife is an active aim for investigators. Telomeres represent a promising molecular tool to investigate the fitness of wild populations, as their length may predict longevity and survival. We examined the relationship between telomere length and human exposure in Adelie penguin chicks (Pygoscelis adeliae) from East Antarctica. Telomere length was compared between chicks from areas with sustained human activity and on neighboring protected islands with little or no human presence. Adelie penguin chicks from sites exposed to human activity had significantly shorter telomeres than chicks from unexposed sites in nearby protected areas, with exposed chicks having on average 3.5% shorter telomeres than unexposed chicks. While sampling limitations preclude our ability to draw more sweeping conclusions at this time, our analysis nonetheless provides important insights into measures of colony vulnerability. More data are needed both to understand the proximate causes (e.g., stress, feeding events) leading to shorter telomeres in chicks from human exposed areas, as well as the fitness consequences of reduced telomere length. We suggest to further test the use of telomere length analysis as an eco-indicator of stress in wildlife among anthropized sites throughout Antarctica.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid zones, animal health and production are closely correlated with body conformation traits. These selected traits, in turn, allow livestock to adapt unfavorable soil and environmental conditions. The primary objective of this study was to perform a genome-wide association analysis for a set of sampled and imputed SNPs with 16 conformation traits in a population of Holstein cows from a desert area of Northwestern Mexico. Imputation from 6K to 50K SNPs was performed as a low-cost optimization strategy. Results show eight SNPs associated with two conformation traits. The Udder Depth trait resulted in seven associated SNPs from chromosome 10, that related to Marbling Score, Milk Yield, Fat Yield, Protein Yield, and Protein Percentage Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). The Body Depth trait resulted in one associated SNP from chromosome 2, although no QTL relation was found. The discovery of genes associated with conformation traits may be indicative of the adaptive selection pressures the Holstein breed has undergone in response to the extreme weather conditions found in the northwestern areas of Mexico. Results of this study indicate that traits such as stature and body depth may be used as indicators of cows' potential genetic merits for milk, fat, and protein production.

AB  - Public transport is important for Sweden to acquire a fossil-fuel independent vehicle fleet by 2030. The aim of this paper is to assess the status of Swedish public bus fleets towards decarbonization, and explore factors affecting regional performance variations and fuel choices. Environmental performance indicators such as renewable fuel shares, CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency are analyzed nationally and regionally. Fuel preferences and best practices are investigated through a survey and interviews with experts working with strategic planning at Public Transport Authorities. Almost 60% of the bus transport volume ran on renewables in 2014 compared to 8% in 2007, but regional variations are significant, partly due to factors such as driving conditions, bus and fuel types, typical trip lengths, and climatic conditions. However, there is no strong correlation between population densities or bus transport volume and the share of renewables achieved. This places political will, strategic planning and policies to promote public transport as key factors affecting renewable fuel deployment. Environmental factors are a priority when choosing fuels, while barriers to renewable fuels are mainly economic and political. Meanwhile, despite the overall progress, achievements in energy efficiency improvement are falling short in comparison to emissions reduction and adoption of renewable fuels, thus requiring further attention.

AB  - The dynamic response of microorganisms to environmental conditions depends on the behavior of individual cells within the population. Adverse environments can select for stable stress resistant subpopulations. In this study, we aimed to get more insight in the diversity within Listeria monocytogenes LO28 populations, and the genetic basis for the increased resistance of stable resistant fractions isolated after acid exposure. Phenotypic cluster analysis of 23 variants resulted in three clusters and four individual variants and revealed multiple-stress resistance, with both unique and overlapping features related to stress resistance, growth, motility, biofilm formation, and virulence indicators. A higher glutamate decarboxylase activity correlated with increased acid resistance. Whole genome sequencing revealed mutations in rpsU, encoding ribosomal protein S21 in the largest phenotypic cluster, while mutations in ctsR, which were previously shown to be responsible for increased resistance of heat and high hydrostatic pressure resistant variants, were not found in the acid resistant variants. This underlined that large population diversity exists within one L. monocytogenes strain and that different adverse conditions drive selection for different variants. The finding that acid stress selects for rpsU variants provides potential insights in the mechanisms underlying population diversity of L. monocytogenes.

AB  - Introduction: Landing flight in birds is demanding on visual control of velocity, distance to target, and slope of descent. Birds flying in flocks must also keep a common course of landing in order to avoid collisions. Whereas the wind direction may provide a cue for landing, the nature of the landing direction indicator under windless conditions has been unknown. We recorded and analysed landing directions of 3,338 flocks in 14 species of water birds in eight countries.
   Results: We show that the preferred landing direction, independently of the direction from which the birds have arrived, is along the north-south axis. We analysed the effect of the time of the year, time of the day (and thus sun position), weather (sunny versus overcast), light breeze, locality, latitude, and magnetic declination in 2,431 flocks of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and found no systematic effect of these factors upon the preferred direction of landing. We found that magnetic North was a better predictor for landing direction than geographic North.
   Conclusions: In absence of any other common denominator determining the landing direction, the alignment with the magnetic field lines seems to be the most plausible if not the only explanation for the directional landing preference under windless and overcast conditions and we suggest that the magnetic field thus provides a landing direction indicator.

AB  - Globally, overfishing large-bodied groundfish populations has resulted in substantial increases in their prey populations. Where it has been examined, the effects of overfishing have cascaded down the food chain. In an intensively fished area on the western Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic, the biomass of prey species increased exponentially (doubling time of 11 years) even though the aggregate biomass of their predators remained stable over 38 years. Concomitant reductions in herbivorous zooplankton and increases in phytoplankton were also evident. This anomalous trophic pattern led us to examine how declines in predator body size (approx. 60% in body mass since the early 1970s) and climatic regime influenced lower trophic levels. The increase in prey biomass was associated primarily with declines in predator body size and secondarily to an increase in stratification. Sea surface temperature and predator biomass had no influence. A regression model explained 65 per cent of prey biomass variability. Trait-mediated effects, namely a reduction in predator size, resulted in a weakening of top predation pressure. Increased stratification may have enhanced growing conditions for prey fish. Size-selective harvesting under changing climatic conditions initiated a trophic restructuring of the food chain, the effects of which may have influenced three trophic levels.

AB  - Background Camelina sativa(gold-of-pleasure) is a traditional European oilseed crop and emerging biofuel source with high levels of desirable fatty acids. A twentieth century germplasm bottleneck depleted genetic diversity in the crop, leading to recent interest in using wild relatives for crop improvement. However, little is known about seed oil content and genetic diversity in wildCamelinaspecies. Results We used gas chromatography, environmental niche assessment, and genotyping-by-sequencing to assess seed fatty acid composition, environmental distributions, and population structure inC. sativaand four congeners, with a primary focus on the crop's wild progenitor,C. microcarpa.Fatty acid composition differed significantly betweenCamelinaspecies, which occur in largely non-overlapping environments. The crop progenitor comprises three genetic subpopulations with discrete fatty acid compositions. Environment, subpopulation, and population-by-environment interactions were all important predictors for seed oil in these wild populations. A complementary growth chamber experiment usingC. sativaconfirmed that growing conditions can dramatically affect both oil quantity and fatty acid composition inCamelina. Conclusions Genetics, environmental conditions, and genotype-by-environment interactions all contribute to fatty acid variation inCamelinaspecies. These insights suggest careful breeding may overcome the unfavorable FA compositions in oilseed crops that are predicted with warming climates.

AB  - Measurements of air-sea CO2 fluxes with Eddy Covariance (EC) are generally affected by the optical contamination of open path gas analyzers. Since the conditions of saltwater environments may be similar to those of freshwater environments, in this work we evaluate whether this contamination is occurring in the LI-7500 open path CO2 gas analyzer ("LI-COR Biosciences Ltd"), used in an experiment to measure greenhouse gas fluxes over the reservoir of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant. We evaluated the optical contamination indicators in the CO2 measurements and two corrections for this: the numerical method called PKT method, proposed for CO2 flux correction over ocean, and a multiple linear regression model. We find that the PKT method does not produce physically plausible results and that, contrary to what has been reported in ocean measurements, the measurements of the Itaipu experiment suffer less interference in more humid conditions. CO2 correction by the regression model preserved the pattern of CO2 flux daily variation, but it attenuated the magnitude of the fluxes: the average of the uncorrected fluxes was -24.35 mu gm(-2)s(-1), while the average of the fluxes corrected by the statistical model was -11.73 mu gm s(-1).

AB  - Benthic algae, especially diatoms, are commonly used to assess water quality in rivers. However, algal-based assessments are challenging at the river system scale because longitudinal variation in physical habitat conditions may obscure algal responses to changes in water quality. In the present study, we surveyed benthic diatoms and environmental variables from a mountainous Chinese river system. Hierarchical clustering, discrimination analysis, and indicator species analysis were used together to explore associations between distribution patterns of diatom assemblages and water quality variables. Study sites were clustered into five groups based on their diatom community composition, with sites grouped by the sampling months. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), elevation, and total nitrogen (TN) were the most important predictors for site classification. Site groups with higher elevations had higher TN concentrations; however, COD concentrations were higher in lower elevation groups. Moreover, COD concentrations significantly differed between temporally separated groups. In total, 49 indicator species were identified for individual groups, with most taxa indicating the eutrophic condition. Additionally, we found that European diatom indices are not closely associated with water quality variables. We conclude that the identification of algal patterns and their driving forces can provide valuable information to aid bioassessment at the river system scale.

AB  - Duckweed and other free-floating plants (FFP) can form dense surface mats that affect ecosystem condition and processes, and can impair public use of aquatic resources. FFP obtain their nutrients from the water column, and the formation of dense FFP mats can be a consequence and indicator of river eutrophication. We conducted two complementary surveys of diverse aquatic areas of the Upper Mississippi River as an in situ approach for estimating thresholds in the response of FFP abundance to nutrient concentration and physical conditions in a large, floodplain river. Local regression analysis was used to estimate thresholds in the relations between FFP abundance and phosphorus (P) concentration (0.167 mg l(-1)), nitrogen (N) concentration (0.808 mg l(-1)), water velocity (0.095 m s(-1)), and aquatic macrophyte abundance (65 % cover). FFP tissue concentrations suggested P limitation was more likely in spring, N limitation was more likely in late summer, and N limitation was most likely in backwaters with minimal hydraulic connection to the channel. The thresholds estimated here, along with observed patterns in nutrient limitation, provide river scientists and managers with criteria to consider when attempting to modify FFP abundance in off-channel areas of large river systems.

AB  - This work studied the elimination paths of the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole by ozonation in fast kinetic regime. The ozonation runs were performed in conditions favouring either the direct attack of the ozone molecule or the indirect attack by ozone-generated radical species with initial concentration of 0.150 mM. When doses of ozone were transferred to the liquid phase 0.2 mM, in no case did sulfamethoxazole remain in solution. Two main transformation pathways were found involving the preferential attack of molecular ozone or radical pathway and leading to the formation of six intermediates, which were identified by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Both routes took place simultaneously in the different conditions tested, leading to a hydroxylation reaction of the benzene ring, oxidation of the amino group on the benzene ring, oxidation of the methyl group and the double bond in the isoxazole ring and S-N bond cleavage. The most abundant reaction intermediate was that resulting from S-N bond cleavage. The toxicity of partially ozonated samples for Daphnia magna and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata revealed the formation of toxic by-products during the early stages of reaction and the persistence of considerable toxicity after the total depletion of sulfamethoxazole.

AB  - Much time and resources have been invested in understanding plankton dynamics in Guanabara Bay (Brazil), but no attention has been devoted to the protozooplankton. To fulfill this lacuna, abundance and composition of protozooplankton were investigated from January to Dcccmber - 2000 in fortnightly surface water samplings at two distinct water quality sites (Urca - closer to the bay entrance, more saline and cleaner waters; Ramos - inner reaches, hypereutrophic waters). The density at Urca (10(3) - 10(5) cell.l(-1)) was one to three orders of magnitude lower than at Ramos (10(4) - 10(5) cell.l(-1)). A seasonal trend for nanoplankton and protozooplankton was more evident at Urca, but both sites had lower densities during the colder period. Small heterotrophic dinoflagellates (20-30 mu m) were dominant in over 50% of the samples. The protozooplankton abundance and composition reflected the distinct trophic conditions states found at the bay. During the wet-warm season, non-oligotrich ciliates were representative of Ramos site with Gymnodiniaceae dinoflagellates, while tintinnids and heterotrophic dinoflagellates were predominantly found at Urca mainly during the dry-cold season. This first descriptive study towards the understanding of the intricate relationships among the microbial food web components reveals that protozooplankton can be a good indicator of water quality conditions at the bay.

AB  - The Mid-Atlantic region of the USA has experienced increasing annual precipitation amounts in recent decades, along with more frequent extreme events of greater magnitude. Unlike many US regions that have suffered increasing drought conditions from higher evapotranspiration demand, positive trends in the Mid-Atlantic accumulated precipitation are greater than the recent increases in reference evapotranspiration. The temporal correlation between precipitation events and soil moisture capacity is essential for determining how the nature of drought has changed in the region. This analysis has shown that soil moisture scarcity has declined in nine of ten subregions of the Mid-Atlantic that were analyzed from 1985 to 2019. Two algorithms were deployed to draw this conclusion: Climatol enabled the use of the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation on daily observation station data for which complete records were unavailable, and the second algorithm calculated soil moisture levels on a daily basis, more accurately capturing drought conditions than common methods using weekly or monthly summaries. Although the declining drought trends were not statistically significant, a result of more extreme events and higher evapotranspiration rates, the inclusion of direct data from an expanded set of locations provides greater clarity from the trends, allowing policymakers and landowners to anticipate changes in future Mid-Atlantic irrigation water demand.

AB  - Alterations of Young's modulus (YM) and Poisson's ratio (PR) in biological tissues are often early indicators of the onset of pathological conditions. Knowledge of these parameters has been proven to be of great clinical significance for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancers. Currently, however, there are no non-invasive modalities that can be used to image and quantify these parameters in vivo without assuming incompressibility of the tissue, an assumption that is rarely justified in human tissues. In this paper, we developed a new method to simultaneously reconstruct YM and PR of a tumor and of its surrounding tissues based on the assumptions of axisymmetry and ellipsoidal-shape inclusion. This new, non-invasive method allows the generation of high spatial resolution YM and PR maps from axial and lateral strain data obtained via ultrasound elastography. The method was validated using finite element (FE) simulations and controlled experiments performed on phantoms with known mechanical properties. The clinical feasibility of the developed method was demonstrated in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique can estimate the YM and PR of spherical inclusions with accuracy higher than 99% and with accuracy higher than 90% in inclusions of different geometries and under various clinically relevant boundary conditions.

AB  - Vegetable oils (VOs) are based on natural ester oil that is considered as an alternative to mineral oil for transformer applications. The dispersion of nanofillers into the VO is expected to improve the physicochemical and electrical performances. Surface-modified insulating nanoparticle is dispersed into the VO to prepare the VO-based nanofluid (NF). An open-beaker oxidative aging study is carried out at 115 C for VO and NF at three distinct aging durations such as 100, 300, and 500 h. Alterations in the molecular level of aged VO and NF are studied through the various spectroscopic and physicochemical analyses such as nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared, UV-vis absorbance, fluorescence, color, acid number, interfacial tension, and flash point. The fluorescence-based analysis is carried out for VO and NF at fresh and aged condition to monitor the comparative aging degradation. Oxidative aging of VO and NF results in the formation of flammable and harmful gases, which are analyzed using dissolved gas analysis technique. A comparative analysis of the electrical properties such as ac breakdown voltage, dielectric constant, and dielectric dissipation factor for fresh and aged sample of VO and NF is studied.

AB  - Appendicularians are one of the most common animals found within zooplankton assemblages. They play a very important role as filter feeders but are, unfortunately, inconsistently reported in the Antarctic literature. The present paper attempts to describe the zonal diversity of appendicularians and the main environmental factors influencing their communities in the Drake Passage. Samples were collected during Antarctic summer in 2009-2010. A total of eight species of larvaceans were identified. Fritillaria borealis was the species found in the highest numbers in almost the entire studied area, and was observed at all sampling stations. The distributions of other taxa were limited to specific hydrological zones and hydrological conditions. F. fraudax and Oikopleura gaussica were typical of the areas between the Polar Front and the Subantarctic Front zones, and their distributions were significantly correlated with temperature and salinity, likely making them good indicator species. The F. fusiformis distribution was strictly related to South American waters. In summary, temperature was the strongest environmental factor influencing the larvacean community structure in the Drake Passage, and we also found that testing environmental factors on larvaceans as a whole group did not give entirely reliable results.

AB  - Continuous cropping changes soil physiochemical parameters, enzymes and microorganism communities, causing "replant problem" in strawberry cultivation. We hypothesized that soil nematode community would reflect the changes in soil conditions caused by long-term continuous cropping, in ways that are consistent and predictable. To test this hypothesis, we studied the soil nematode communities and several soil parameters, including the concentration of soil phenolic acids, organic matter and nitrogen levels, in strawberry greenhouse under continuous-cropping for five different durations. Soil pH significantly decreased, and four phenolic acids, i.e., p-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid, accumulated with time under continuous cropping. The four phenolic acids were highly toxic to Acrobeloides spp., the eudominant genus in non-continuous cropping, causing it to reduce to a resident genus after seven-years of continuous cropping. Decreased nematode diversity indicated loss of ecosystem stability and sustainability because of continuouscropping practice. Moreover, the dominant decomposition pathway was altered from bacterial to fungal under continuous cropping. Our results suggest that along with the continuous-cropping time in strawberry habitat, the soil food web is disturbed, and the available plant nutrition as well as the general health of the soil deteriorates; these changes can be indicated by soil nematode community.

AB  - Autonomous in situ sensors are needed to document the effects of today's rapid ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (e.g., ocean acidification). General environmental conditions (e.g., biofouling, turbidity) and carbon-specific conditions (e.g., wide diel variations) present significant challenges to acquiring long-term measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with satisfactory accuracy and resolution. SEAS-DIC is a new in situ instrument designed to provide calibrated, high-frequency, long-term measurements of DIC in marine and fresh waters. Sample water is first acidified to convert all DIC to carbon dioxide (CO2). The sample and a known reagent solution are then equilibrated across a gas-permeable membrane. Spectrophotometric measurement of reagent pH can thereby determine the sample DIC over a wide dynamic range, with inherent calibration provided by the pH indicator's molecular characteristics. Field trials indicate that SEAS-DIC performs well in biofouling and turbid waters, with a DIC accuracy and precision of similar to 2 mu mol kg(-1) and a measurement rate of approximately once per minute. The acidic reagent protects the sensor cell from biofouling, and the gas-permeable membrane excludes particulates from the optical path. This instrument, the first spectrophotometric system capable of automated in situ DIC measurements, positions DIC to become a key parameter for in situ CO2-system characterizations.

AB  - The central dry zone of Myanmar is the area with the highest density of small-scale livestock farmers under harsh environmental condition. In this study, we describe and quantify ownership patterns for various livestock species and characterised management and husbandry practices of small-scale farmers. In addition, we identify the husbandry factors associated with selected outcome indicators, herd or flock size' and purpose of rearing'. A total of 613 livestock farmers in 40 villages were interviewed. Multispecies rearing was common with 51.7% of farmers rearing more than one livestock species. Rearing animals to be sold as adults for slaughter (meat production) was more common for small ruminants (98.1%) and chickens (99.8%) compared to cattle (69.8%). Larger cattle herds were more likely to practice grazing (p<0.001) and to employ labour from outside the household to manage cattle than medium or small herds (p=0.03). Patterns of grazing differed significantly between seasons (p<0.01) for cattle, but not for small ruminants and village chicken. Overall, multispecies rearing and species-specific husbandry practices are used to raise livestock under harsh environmental conditions. Our results reveal that herd/flock size and purpose of rearing across different livestock species were significantly associated with feeding and housing practices and experience of farmers.

AB  - The risk assessment of pesticides on soil fauna is an issue to protect agroecosystem sustainability. Enchytraeids are recognized as relevant soil bioindicators of chemical stress in agroecosystems. In laboratory, the reproduction test was found to be sensitive to reveal chemical impacts on enchytraeids. However, it does not allow to assess the impacts on ecological functions in which enchytraeids are involved. The objectives of this study were (i) to explore the feasibility of the bait-lamina test with enchytraeids under laboratory conditions and (ii) to compare its sensitivity with the Enchytraeid Reproduction Test. We exposed individuals of Enchytraeus albidus to two commercial formulations of fungicides widely used in Europe. The EC50 reproduction for the Swing((R)) Gold (50gL(-1) epoxiconazole and 133gL(-1) dimoxystrobin) and the Cuprafor micro((R)) (50% copper oxychloride) were respectively estimated at 1.66 +/- 0.93 times the recommended dose and >496mgkg(-1) of copper. However, no impact was found on the feeding activity of enchytraeids. The bait-lamina test thus appeared less sensitive than the Enchytraeid Reproduction Test to the tested fungicides. Despite that, this test which is achievable under laboratory conditions and allows assessing indirect effects of pesticides is quick, cheap, and easy to perform. It would deserve to be used to explore longer-exposure effects through the repeated addition of bait-lamina sticks.

AB  - Clarifying variations in soil moisture is an important part of hydrological and ecological studies in tropical rainforests. Volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was measured at depths of 10, 20 and 30 cm at Pasoh Forest Reserve (PFR) in Peninsular Malaysia for 12 years. VSWC ranged from 0.280-0.442 m(3) m(-3) (mean +/- standard error; 0.373 +/- 0.001 m(3) m(-3)) and was affected not only by the south-west and north-east monsoons but also by El Nino and La Nina events. Mean VSWC was high during La Nina events and low during El Nino events. In a normal El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase, VSWC showed both low and high conditions. An antecedent precipitation index (API) was calculated using 20 years of rainfall data. API(90) ranged from 1.2-257.3 mm (25.4 +/- 0.2 mm). The variations in API(90) followed a similar pattern to variations in the VSWC. API(90) can be used to estimate soil moisture conditions as a drought indicator. An API(90) of less than 10 mm lasted more than 14 successive days during the normal ENSO phases when five mass flowerings occurred at PFR from 1995-2014.

AB  - Plumage colour variation occurs widely among bird species and is often associated with individual fitness. More specifically, colouration can affect thermoregulatory ability, mate selection and conspicuousness during foraging. Colour aberrations can be caused by genetic mutations, dietary imbalances, environmental conditions or disease and are rare. Plumage variations have previously been noted in Adelie penguins, although without any follow-up to measure implications for behaviour or fitness. To assess how this low-frequency condition affects breeding in Adelie penguins, we monitored the breeding of several colour-aberrant Adelie penguins during the 2019-2020 nesting season at the large Cape Crozier, Ross Island colony (> 300,000 pairs). In total, we found 12 individuals with unusual plumage for a frequency of 1:50,000 breeding penguins. There were seven dark brown Adelie penguins, three progressive greying Adelie penguins, one dilute Adelie penguin and one brown Adelie penguin, of which five were female, three male and four of unknown sex. Six colour aberrants initiated breeding with a normal-coloured mate, and five raised at least one chick to creche. The likelihood of breeding and breeding success of colour aberrants were similar to those of normal-coloured Adelie penguins, suggesting that colour aberrations do not negatively affect breeding.

TI  - RED RING DISEASE OF COCONUTS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
T2  - TROPICAL AGRICULTURE
LA  - English
AB  - A short account is given of the origin of red ring disease of coconuts in Trinidad, its distribution elsewhere, and early investigations of the disease. Reference is made to serious losses caused in recent years. The symptoms of the disease are described and shown to be associated with the production of a strongly reducing substance in the periphery of the cortex of young palms invaded by the nematode Aphelenchoides cocophilus.
   Experiments on the inoculation of stems and roots are described. These showed penetration via the leaf axils to be the normal means of entry of the parasite, root infections, though successfully carried out artificially, being of no account under natural conditions. The coconut weevil, Rhynehophorus palmarum, and by inference Rhina barbirostris, also was shown to be able to transmit the disease by burrowing in diseased debris in the cortex of affected palms, emerging with legs and body covered with this debris, and transferring it to wounds or to leaf axils in adjacent palms.
   Reference is made to reports of natural and artificial alternative hosts of the parasite, and it is concluded that under natural conditions the disease is confined to the coconut palm, at least in the Lesser Antilles.
   Control of the disease is shown to be possible by the removal of all infected palms and complete destruction of diseased tissues by fire.

AB  - The current paper introduces an innovative multicriteria wind potential assessment study using fuzzy logic in decision making. Regarding the diverse conditions and lack of comprehensive studies, Iran was selected as a case study, and by applying the proposed framework, all the 559 synoptic meteorological stations in the country were studied. Fourteen technical, eco-environmental, and social indicators were defined for the assessment. Each of the indicator's effectiveness was determined using related literature and interviews with local experts. Finally, using fuzzy logic in decision making, all the selected sites and the provinces were scored and ranked. Moreover, the priority maps of Iran provinces considering social and eco-environmental aspects were provided. The selected sites' final standing for the development of offshore and onshore wind power plant was also determined. The results indicate that taking just the technical conditions into account can result in misleading conclusions and social and eco-environmental criteria must also be considered for potential assessment studies. Moreover, it was shown that equal supportive policies for wind development throughout the country would mitigate their efficiency. Therefore, the energy strategies should be codified, considering local circumstances to organize investment resources, leading to higher legislation efficiencies and faster development.

AB  - Generating knowledge to explain the dynamics and physicochemical characteristics of groundwater is essential to ensure its availability for different uses. Therefore, in this article we propose an integrated methodology that may help to define the flow patterns governing the movement of groundwater in a semiarid region of Mexico. The methodology incorporates hydrogeochemical characterization with the application of flow systems theory, the behaviour of arsenic and fluoride as indicators of the quality for human consumption and a correlation matrix to identify potential areas of recharge-discharge; these variables are grouped in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results explain how the movement of groundwater was influenced by the dissolution of silicates with the geochemical evolution of arsenic under two natural conditions; however, in one of these conditions, the mobility was facilitated by the presence of mining activities, whereas fluoride exhibited two situations, one natural and the other anthropogenic. Four hydrogeochemical facies were manifested in three flow patterns, with a potential recharge zone in the west of the study area, a discharge zone in the east and a mixture flowing to the northwest. We concluded that the proposed methodology represents a tool for facilitating understanding of the movement of groundwater.

AB  - The representativeness of ambient water samples collected from bridge crossings has occasionally been challenged because critics contend birds nesting on bridges elevate fecal indicator bacteria concentrations over samples collected from river reaches not spanned by bridges. This study was designed to evaluate the influence, if any, of bridge-dwelling bird colonies on instream bacteria concentrations. Three bridges in central Texas were sampled under dry-weather conditions for instream Escherichia coli. Two bridges were inhabited by migratory cliff swallows and one was devoid of birds. Numerous samples were collected from locations upstream, at the upstream bridgeface, and downstream of each bridge to determine whether significant increases in E.coli occurred in a downstream direction when birds were present. E.coli values increased significantly at bridgeface and downstream locations compared to upstream locations throughout the nesting season. During peak bird activity in May, bacteria geometric mean concentrations at bridgeface and downstream locations jumped from background levels <50 to >190colony forming units (CFU)/100mL, well above the state geometric mean criterion of 126CFU/100mL for primary contact recreation use. Results confirmed that under dry-weather conditions bird colonies can have a significant impact on bacteria concentrations in the vicinity of the bridges they inhabit and therefore, to avoid this impact, monitoring should occur upstream of bridges.

AB  - The validity of using the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) test to measure acquired immunity, one of the most widely used methods, is currently being debated due to new knowledge on the complex physiology of the process. As a greater secondary response to repeated challenges linked to increases of circulating lymphocyte levels would be indicative of a T-cell-mediated immune response, we performed for the first time an experiment under natural conditions with repeated PHA challenges in free-living adult birds and chicks to shed light on this topic. We found significantly stronger secondary response to PHA injection independent of sex or age, while controlling for body condition, the second response being on average 90% larger than the first. Likewise, lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in the second PHA challenge, whereas no significant differences were found among untreated birds. Significant positive correlations between the PHA response and both lymphocyte counts and plasma protein levels (mainly albumin, globulin precursor) were recovered, whereas no significant differences were recovered in plasma protein levels between challenges. Our results are consistent with those from captive birds, supporting the validity of the PHA skin-swelling test as an accurate gauge of acquired T-cell-mediated immunity in birds.

AB  - Methane in source rocks may not exist exclusively as free gas. It could exist in equilibrium with carbon and higher hydrocarbons: CH4 + C < = > Hydrocarbon. Three lines of evidence support this possibility. 1) Shales ingest gas in amounts and selectivities consistent with gas-carbon equilibrium. There is a 50% increase in solid hydrocarbon mass when Fayetteville Shale is exposed to methane (450 psi) under moderate conditions (100 degrees C): Rock-Eval S2 (mg g(-1)) 8.5 = > 12.5. All light hydrocarbons are ingested, but with high selectivity, consistent with competitive addition to receptor sites in a growing polymer. Mowry Shale ingests butane vigorously from argon, for example, but not from methane under the same conditions. 2) Production data for a well producing from Fayetteville Shale declines along the theoretical curve for withdrawing gas from higher hydrocarbons in equilibrium with carbon. 3) A new general gas-solid equilibrium model accounts for natural gas at thermodynamic equilibrium, and C-6-C-7 hydrocarbons constrained to invariant compositions. The results make a strong case for methane in equilibrium with carbon and higher hydrocarbons. If correct, the higher hydrocarbons in source rocks are gas reservoirs, raising the possibility of substantially more gas in shales than analytically apparent, and far more gas in shale deposits than currently recognized.

AB  - The concept of pollution load indicators for planning and management of the mixture conditions of centralised and on-site wastewater treatment systems has not been discussed in detail so far. In this paper, pollutant discharge (load) indicators and pollutant removal efficiencies were quantitatively analysed to develop a part of a strategy for planning and management of municipal wastewater treatment systems (WWTSs) under the mixture conditions in Bangkok, Thailand, as a case study. Pollutant discharge indicators of on-site WWTSs were estimated based on the relevant literature. Three kinds of pollutant removal efficiency function at centralised wastewater treatment plants (CWWTPs) were empirically developed for biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total coliforms and faecal coliforms based on the existing CWWTP management data. These results will be integrated into the scenario-based analysis in the second paper in the series. The results will be base datasets, and the concept and estimation methods can be applied for wastewater treatment planning and management in other areas.

AB  - Conodont faunal dynamics and high-resolution biostratigraphy in the lithologically and faunally anomalous 'Taljsten' succession, which spans the Darriwilian Lenodus variabilis Yangtzeplacognathus crassus Zone boundary, were investigated in a 2.5 m-thick section on Mt Kinnekulle that includes an interval yielding fossil meteorites and extraterrestrial chromite. The previous interpretation that this interval reflects a regression is consistent with the occurrence and abundance patterns of some conodont taxa. The disappearance of e.g., Periodon, suggests that the regression began prior to the deposition of the grey 'Taljsten'. The transition from red to grey limestone coincides with a conspicuous faunal re-arrangement. The lower half of the 'Taljsten' reflects a gradual shallowing favourable for some taxa, such as Lenodus, and the immigration of Microzarkodina cf. ozarkodella and Histiodella holodentata. In the middle of the 'Taljsten' interval, coinciding with the appearance of abundant cystoids, conditions became less hospitable for conodonts, resulting in a low diversity and low abundance fauna, which occurs to the top of the interval. The overlying red limestone, apparently deposited during a deepening event, marks a return to pre-'Taljsten' conditions with a re-organised fauna. The close correlation between the lithologic shifts and conodont faunal changes demonstrates the usefulness of conodonts as environmental indicators.

AB  - Ireland was the first country to introduce a legislative ban in April 1987 on the usage of organotin antifouling paints, this included tri-butyl-tin (TBT). Vessels under 25 metres were not permitted to use these substances because of harmful effects to shallow water sea inlets. The ban prevented use of organotins on most fishing vessels and pleasure craft. TBT causes a condition, imposer, resulting in sexual impairment in neogastropods. This condition was examined in the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus at 66 stations in Bantry Bay, SW Ireland, to determine dispersal from source from the main input areas. Highest imposer levels were recorded in the harbour of the fishing port Castletownbearhaven. High levels of TBT in sediments and use of TBT antifouling paints by the fishing fleet have resulted in reductions of dogwhelk abundance at the harbour entrance. Nearby, dogwhelks had high levels of imposer, which declined with distance from source. The lower frequency of imposer observed elsewhere within Bantry Bay may be due to residual flow of water through the Bay and periodic exchanges with shelf water from an area of upwelling off the bay entrance. A gradual recovery of the area would be expected if the ban on TBT usage were applied to vessels of less than 50m.

AB  - Phytoplankton communities have long been used as water quality indicators within environmental policies. This has fostered the development of national and international phytoplankton monitoring programs, but these networks are subject to sources of uncertainty due to laboratory issues. Nevertheless, studies regarding the interference associated with these aspects are not well-documented. Hence, a long time series (2003-2015) from the Basque continental shelf (southeastern Bay of Biscay) was analyzed to evaluate the uncertainty given by laboratory strategies when studying phytoplankton variability. Variability in phytoplankton communities was explained not only by environmental conditions but also by changes in fixatives (glutaraldehyde and acidic Lugol's solution) and laboratory staff. Based on Bray-Curtis distances, phytoplankton assemblages were found to be significantly dissimilar according to the effect of changes in the specialist handling the sample and the employed fixative. The pair-wise permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed significant differences between the two fixatives utilized and also between the three taxonomists involved. Thus, laboratory-related effects should be considered in the study of phytoplankton time series. (C) 2020 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Objectives Intrauterine environmental conditions may affect the number of primordial follicles and in this way the timing of menopause. The aim of the present study was to investigate association patterns between right hand digit ratio, that is, 2D:4D - as an indicator of prenatal androgen and estrogen exposure, and age at menopause. Methods One hundred sixty-nine women, who had experienced natural menopause, were enrolled in the study. Length of second and fourth finger were measured directly from the palmar side and digit ratios of both hands were calculated. For further analyses the digit ratio of the right hand was used only. Additionally, smoking habits, body weight and body height, body mass index and the number of children were determined. Multiple regression analyses were used to test association patterns between digit ratio and age at menopause, body height, BMI, nicotine consumption as well as number of births and age at menopause. Results Age at menopause correlated significantly positively with the digit ratio. A more feminine digit ratio is associated with a higher age at menopause, while a low digit ratio, interpreted as a hint of a higher androgen exposure during prenatal phase was associated with a lower age at menopause. Conclusions Low digit ratio is associated with an earlier onset of natural menopause.

AB  - The objective of this research was to make a preliminary assessment of environmental conditions with respect to the contribution of metals concentrations in the mangrove river sediment Passa Vaca, Salvador (BA). The metals were determined chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), barium (Ba), strontium (Sr), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn). Surface sediment were collected at four points (P1, P2, P3 and P4) of the mangrove major anthropogenic influences. The samples were pre-treated by acid digestion and the determinations of metallic elements were by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP OES). The results reported values higher concentrations at point P4 concentrations for the Fe (28,101.65 mu g g(-1)), followed by V (62.96 mu g g(-1)), Mn (60.57 mu g g(-1)) and Cr (53.09 mu g g(-1)), while at point P2 higher concentration was found to Zn (47.95 mu g g(-1)) P2. The correlation analysis and principal component (PCA) revealed a strong correlation between the metals studied among the finer fractions of the pellet and the elements Fe, Cr and Ni. Taking into account the values of the thresholds of adverse effects (TEL) of NOAA, the concentrations of Cu and Cr in P4, outperformed this index.

AB  - Concentrations of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) were determined in surface sediments of Shanghai, China. The concentrations of total HBCD diastereoisomers (Sigma HBCD) ranged from 0.01 to 13.70 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) with a mean value of 3.41 ng g(-1) dw, which was up to several orders of magnitude lower than those reported for sediments from European countries. The SHBCD concentrations in sediments from chemical/textile industrial or densely populated areas were generally higher than those from rural or less chemical/textile industrialized areas in Shanghai. A high proportion of alpha-HBCD was observed in sediment samples and was significantly higher than that of commercial HBCD products. This might be due to thermal isomerization from gamma-HBCD to alpha-HBCD and slower degradation rate of alpha-HBCD compared to gamma-HBCD in anaerobic conditions. The mass inventory of SHBCD in surface sediments of Shanghai was estimated at 164.4 kg, representing a significant source of HBCDs to the Shanghai environment. This indicates that further study on potential transfer of HBCDs from sediments to aquatic organisms and ecological risk assessments is required.

AB  - Information and approaches to evaluating health risks to terrestrial wildlife from fluoride contamination in the environment are few in the literature. We use environmental field data from a phosphate ore processing site, toxicity reference values (TRVs), and bioaccumulation factors relative to site conditions to develop risk-based concentrations (RBCs) for total fluoride in terrestrial biota and soil. RBCs were derived specifically for forage that are protective of terrestrial mammalian and avian ecological receptors through multiple exposure pathways, and which can be used to evaluate site remediation or as environmental monitoring action levels. Following review of the literature, we recommend fluoride TRVs for mammalian and avian wildlife, and bioavailability factors for estimating exposures related to aerial deposition of fluoride and fluoride gases. For large ungulates, information on fluoride bioavailability from feed and soil, and related effects thresholds, are summarized from studies on grazing livestock. The resultant RBCs for fluoride in forage range from 14 to 63mg/kg dry weight, based on no-effect and low-effect concentrations, respectively. These concentrations bracket most state, provincial, and international regulatory standards of vegetation levels for protection of livestock and wildlife.

AB  - Water quality in lotic and lentic systems is greatly influenced by the land use in the adjacent areas. This study was conducted in order to assess whether different degrees of preservation of riparian forest (from well preserved with 30m wide up to degraded with < 5 m wide) influence potamoplankton community structure. The study was conducted in three streams in the upper region of the Rio dos Sinos basin, at four sampling sites, with different width of the forest. Samplings were gathered for abiotic and biological analysis in winter (August 2010) and summer (January/February 2011). The analysis of environmental and biotic variables indicated that seasonality was the main determinant of biomass patterns, regardless of the width of riparian vegetation. The potamoplankton community of the studied streams responded to environmental conditions, although lack of significant difference among the different degrees of riparian vegetation preservation has been observed. Increasing trends on biomass, richness and diversity of species, and higher concentrations of total phosphorus and nitrogen in the non-preserved areas might indicate that the different gradients of preservation of riparian vegetation are related with the water quality in subtropical streams and consequently with the potamoplankton structure.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence the distribution of understory vegetation is important for biological conservation and forest management. We compared understory species composition bymulti-response permutation procedure and indicator species analysis between plots dominated by Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) and Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) in coniferous forests of the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China. Understory species composition differed markedly between the forest types. Many heliophilous species were significantly associated with juniper forest, while only one species was indicative of spruce forest. Using constrained ordination and the variation partitioning model, we quantitatively assessed the relative effects of two sets of explanatory variables on understory species composition. The results showed that topographic variables had higher explanatory power than did site conditions for understory plant distributions. However, a large amount of the variation in understory species composition remained unexplained. Forward selection revealed that understory species distributions were primarily affected by elevation and aspect. Juniper forest had higher species richness and alpha-diversity and lower beta-diversity in the herb layer of the understory plant community than spruce forest, suggesting that the former may be more important in maintaining understory biodiversity and community stability in alpine coniferous forest ecosystems.

AB  - The eight most abundant species (mean density >20 ind. m(-2)), which occurred at high frequencies (mean >30%) were selected from grab samples in the three Svalbard fjords: Hornsund, van Mijenfjord, and Kongsfjord, in the summer seasons between 1997 and 2007. Six polychaete and two bivalve species comprised more than 47% of the individuals and the biomass in all the samples examined. Four species are cosmopolitan, while the others are widely distributed Arctic-boreal species, and none has Arctic origin. Their density, frequency of occurrence, and biology are very similar across the wide geographical range from boreal to Arctic conditions. As the diversity of benthic fauna in the fjords studied increases (from 172 to 238 species), the dominance of the eight species in the soft bottom community diminishes from 76% to 47%. In times of hydrological regime shift, i.e., the warming of the European Arctic, it is unlikely that the abundancy of these species in the soft bottom fjordic ecosystems will change. The most common soft bottom species are not good indicators of environmental change in the Arctic, and rare, specialized species are better option for indicative purposes.

AB  - The RIHN project "Human impacts on urban subsurface environments" aims to suggest improved development plans of urban centers for human well-being. This will be done by examining reconstructed past changes in urban environments, and by developing integrated nature-social models. Subsurface environmental indicators are developed from the points of view of: (1) human activities; (2) climate change; and (3) character of urban development and social policies. Water, heat, and material environments and transport vectors are being evaluated by a number of different approaches. Some of these include investigating changes in groundwater resources using satellite observations, reconstructing effects of climate change and urbanization using subsurface thermal regimes, and evaluating past contamination patterns from preserved subsurface records. In this overview paper, we describe the current status of urbanization in Asia, subsurface water conditions, material and contaminant transport to surface waters by groundwater, and subsurface thermal anomalies due to the heat island effect. The rapid pace of urbanization in Asia requires that we develop a better understanding of how to deal with environmental impacts, both above and below ground. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bivalve mussels are usually used for biomonitoring persistent toxic substances (PTS) in coastal ecosystems. Nevertheless, these organisms, which live attached on hard substrates, can be found along the sandy coasts only on human manufactured products. In this work different species collected in the Gulf of Gdansk were compared to evaluate their suitability for monitoring PTS pollution at a local scale. The clam Mya arenaria seems to represent an excellent indicator of sediment pollution, mainly for organotin compounds which are selectively bioaccumulated. Organochlorine compounds are bioaccumulated in the different species mainly in function of their lipid body burden. Habitat conditions (salinity, substrate, pollution), however, strongly limited the occurrence of different species in the sampling sites; the most ubiquitous species, the common shrimp Crangon crangon, resulted therefore the most suitable to be used for the comparison of PTS pollution in this aquatic environment. Although the blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus) was confirmed to be a very useful sentinel species to compare pollution level inside and outside the Gulf of Gdansk, we recommend the use of other species to give a more detailed picture of the pollution situation in coastal areas.

LA  - English
AB  - Data collected off the south-west coast of South Africa suggest that easily measured hydrographic or biological parameters may be used as indicators of the suitability of the food environment for those mesozooplankton which preferentially utilize phytoplankton > 10 mum in size. It is proposed that, in the southern Benguela during the upwelling season, there is a temperature window from 12 to 15-degrees-C when conditions are generally good for diatom population development and chlorophyll concentrations exceed 3 mg.m-3. At lower (< 12-degrees-C) or higher (> 15-degrees-C) temperatures, chlorophyll concentrations are < 3 mg.m-3. There is generally a shift in size structure of the phytoplankton population at about 15-degrees-C, high biomass, diatom-dominated populations being replaced by low biomass, flagellate-dominated populations. At temperatures between 12 and 15-degrees-C when chlorophyll concentrations exceed 3 mg.m-3, the nutritional requirements for egg production by a common herbivorous mesozooplankter will be satisfied. Conversely, at lower (< 12-degrees-C) or higher (> 15-degrees-C) temperatures and lower concentrations of chlorophyll, the fecundity of this same mesozooplankter will be reduced severely. These parameters, in conjunction with satellite imagery, may be used to assess minimum potential secondary production of mesozooplankton in South African west coast shelf waters.

AB  - Four wells (K-109, Hr-1, Tk-3, and Bj-1) in NE Iraq (including parts of the Kurdistan Region) were selected to study the Tithonian-Berriasian Chia Gara Formation from the inorganic geochemical point of view. The intervals studied in each well occurred at present-day burial depths of Hr-1 3,075-3,310 m; K-109 2,780-3,090; Tk-1 2,770-2,890; and Bj-1 2,150-2,310 m. A total of 16 samples from the four studied wells were investigated geochemically using X-ray fluorescence in order to measure their major element oxides and their trace element contents. Among the major oxides, CaO has the highest weight percentages in all samples as expected in this limestone-dominated formation. SiO2 and Al2O3 show higher concentrations only in well Bj-1 than the other sections, due to its shallower depth of deposition and its marginal location within the depositional basin. The general trace element distribution along all studied well successions showed good similarity. However, the ratios of V/Ni and V/Cr were of higher values in the lower part of the formation, which is considered as a good indicator to the deposition of this part of the formation within anoxic depositional environment. An exception was in well Bj-1, where the V/Ni ratio was lower in the this lower part of the formation than the upper part that may be due to the different lithology in this succession which is lacking distinct shale or calcareous shale beds. However, the V/Cr ratio can still indicate the prevailing of reducing condition because V/Cr ratios in all samples are > 2. Also, Th/U ratio in the lower part of the studied successions was lower than the upper part, which is also coinciding with the domination of the reducing geochemical conditions in the depositional environment. It may be concluded from this study that the R-mode cluster analysis of the main oxides indicated to the main mineral constituent of the rock which is calcite. It is also confirmed that the SiO2 and Al2O3 contents in the Chia Gara limestones are especially high in well Bj-1, particularly in the lower and upper parts of the succession. On the other hand, R-mode cluster analysis of the trace elements showed lower amounts of Zr and V in relation to silica and confirmed the random distribution of Sr and Ba in the studied samples. Q-mode cluster analysis indicated that the upper part of the studied formation is pure limestone in well H-1 and such purity of limestone beds also occurs in the lower part of the studied formation in well Tk-3. The elemental distribution within the sections as inferred from the studied samples indicates that the anoxic depositional conditions were prevailed during the Chia Gara Formation, especially during the accumulation of the lower part.

AB  - Efficient use of all inputs is vital to achieve and sustain high crop yields, maintain resource quality, and minimize environmental pollution. Fertilizer N is one of the major inputs in rice production. Blanket fertilizer recommendations do not take into account the high field-to-field variability and within-season dynamic changes in indigenous N supply. Since the plant growth reflects the total N supply from all sources, plant N status will be a good indicator of N availability to crops at any given time. The chlorophyll meter (SPAD) and leaf color chart (LCC) are simple, portable diagnostic tools that can measure the crop N status in situ in rice fields to determine the timing of N topdressing. Such decision aids are useful to vary N application rates to rice crops, based on crop demand and indigenous N supply. Although the chlorophyll meter cannot be owned by individual farmers due to its high cost, it is a practically useful tool for field researchers, extension specialists, and crop consultants who do not have access to well-equipped laboratories. On-farm, adaptive research is in progress in 3 countries to adapt the chlorophyll meter technique for transplanted and wet-seeded rice, local cultivar groups, and soil, crop, and environmental conditions. Initial results indicate that the SPAD threshold value of 35 is good for transplanted rice in dry season. The threshold has to be reduced to 32 for wet-seeded rice in dry season and for all rice during wet season with cloudy weather and low radiation. Thus, when calibrated with local cultivar groups and crop conditions, it can be used to accurately monitor crop N status and to advise farmers on N topdressing for rice. It can also be used effectively to verify the adequacy of existing N fertilizer recommendations to rice by the in situ monitoring of foliar N status of crops fertilized with current recommendations and to refine them to further improve N fertilization of rice. The LCC is not as accurate as the chlorophyll meter in determining the leaf N status in rice crops. However, LCC can be calibrated with the chlorophyll meter to fix the critical color shade for local rice cultivar groups and crop conditions. Farmers can, then, use the LCC to qualitatively assess foliar N status and adjust N topdressing to their rice crops. Initial feedback on the use of LCC from farmer cooperators in the Philippines is highly encouraging. Both methods are affected by factors such as varietal group, plant density, crop stress that causes leaf chlorosis, soil nutrient status, and climate; therefore, they have to be adapted to specific soil, climatic, and crop conditions. Adequate training is necessary for both extension agents and farmers to properly use the new tools for increasing the efficiency N fertilizer use on rice. Wider farmer adoption of the two diagnostic tools discussed in this paper will minimize over-fertilization of rice, increase profitability, and decrease fertilizer-related pollution of the environment.

AB  - Just as global institutions and environmental assessment processes embark on the latest effort to integrate more social science into global environmental change research, it appears that the social sciences of climate change are unable or unwilling to address this challenge. In this article, I explore the nature of these dynamics within human geography and argue that climate change occupies a curiously ambiguous position within our discipline of both an explicit presence and an underlying absence. Framed predominantly in terms of a biophysical challenge requiring some form of social response, work on climate change retains an assumed socio-nature divide - a position which has yet to be substantively challenged by the different strands of political ecology, new materialism and environmental humanities that now pervade the discipline. To advance new geographies of climate change, the article argues that our understanding of climate change needs to shift from that of a problem that needs specific responses to a condition that is constituted through specific forms of socio-spatial relation and in turn constitutes the politics, ethics and meaning of particular socio-spatial orderings, from the citizen to the city, the community to the corporation.

AB  - Bogs comprise various niches that are ideal habitats for diatoms. Even though diatoms are widely used bioindicators in many aquatic ecosystems, little is known about their within-site distribution and versatility in bogs. The abundance of bogs in hemiboreal region offers a good opportunity to study the variability of diatom assemblages in different bog habitats and factors influencing it. This study aims to describe the diatom assemblages (1) in the most common bog ecotopes and (2) along the microtopography, and (3) to evaluate the extent to which abiotic environmental parameters (i.e. water table, electric conductivity, pH, moisture and shading) affect the diatom assemblages. According to our results, the most widespread and abundant species are typical bog-inhabiting acidophilic taxa, such as Eunotia paludosa, Kobayasiella parasubtillissima and E. bilunaris. Multivariate analyses showed that some patterns in different microhabitats and ecotopes can be distinguished according to diatom assemblages. In this study, the diatom assemblages were affected by moisture, shading and pH. The study demonstrates the potential usefulness of diatom assemblages as bioindicators to provide additional information about the microsite conditions in bogs.

AB  - A total of 46 surface soil samples collected from the experimental area, buffer area, and core area of the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve (YRDNR), China, and an adjacent area outside the reserve were analyzed for 23 PAHs including highly carcinogenic dibenzopyrene isomers. The total concentrations ranged from 87.2 to 319 ng/g for a23PAHs and 79.2 to 311 ng/g for a16PAHs with average concentrations of 133 and 119 ng/g, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis implied that the total polycyclic aromatic compound (PAH) concentrations had a significant positive correlation with the total organic carbon content on the condition that four sites with abnormal values were removed. Low molecular-weight 2- to 3-ring PAHs predominated in the present study. Source diagnostics based on PAHs isomer ratios, principal component analysis, and multiple linear regression suggested that petroleum contributed most to the PAH contamination in the YRDNR, whereas a potential toxicity assessment using BaPeq indicated that the four dibenzopyrenes were the major carcinogenic PAH contributors in the area under investigation, although their concentrations only represented a small proportion of the total PAH concentrations.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition from anthropogenic sources can facilitate the encroachment of plant species with high-N demands into nutrient-poor ecosystems such as sphagnum bogs. Prior research has demonstrated that altered leaf morphology of the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea L. can serve as a biological indicator of increased bog nitrification. Our objective was to assess the effect of N addition on the root morphology of S. purpurea. To make this assessment, nine S. purpurea plants were grown in microcosms with their roots positioned on transparent acrylic tubes so that root growth could be monitored. Three replicate microcosms received either a high-N treatment (1.0 mg NH4-N.L-1), low-N treatment (0.1 mg NH4-N.L-1), or no additional N. After 7 weeks, we scanned the roots with WinRhizo Pro software, recorded leaf dimensions, and measured the dry mass of the roots and leaves. The high-N treatment had significantly greater root length, surface area, and dry biomass than the controls. In contrast, we found no difference in leaf dimensions or aboveground biomass among treatments. The results of this study support our hypothesis that S. purpurea increases root growth to uptake nutrients from the soil under conditions of increased N deposition.

AB  - Information on relatedness in nematodes is commonly obtained by DNA sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region. However, the level of diversity at this locus is often insufficient for reliable species differentiation. Recent findings suggest that the sequences of a fragment of the small subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA (18S rRNA or SSU), identify genera of soil nematodes and can also distinguish between species in some cases. A database of soil nematode genera in a Ugandan soil was developed using 18S rRNA sequences of individual nematodes from a GM banana confined field trial site at the National Agricultural Research Laboratories, Kawanda in Uganda. The trial was planted to evaluate transgenic bananas for resistance to black Sigatoka disease. Search for relatedness of the sequences gained with entries in a public genomic database identified a range of 20 different genera and sometimes distinguished species. Molecular markers were designed from the sequence information to underpin nematode faunal analysis. This approach provides bio-indicators for disturbance of the soil environment and the condition of the soil food web. It is being developed to support environmental biosafety analysis by detecting any perturbance by transgenic banana or other GM crops on the soil environment.

AB  - Estuarine environmental assessment by sub-individual responses is important in order to understand contaminant effects and to find suitable estuarine biomonitor species. Our study aimed to analyze oxidative stress responses, including glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, total antioxidant capacity (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS) in estuarine crabs Hemigrapsus crenulatus from a high anthropogenically-impacted estuary (Lenga) compared to low and non-polluted estuaries (Tubul and Raqui), in a seasonal scale (winter-summer), tissue specific (hepatopancreas and gills) and sex related responses. Results showed that hepatopancreas in male crabs better reflected inter-estuary differences. Morpho-condition traits as Cephalothorax hepatopancreas index (CHI) could be used as an indicator of physiological status of estuarine crabs. Discriminant analysis also showed that GST and TBARS levels in summer are more suitable endpoints for establishing differences between polluted and non-polluted sites. These results suggest the importance of seasonality, target tissue, sex and physiological status of brachyuran crabs for estuarine biomonitoring assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The term 'exoproteome' describes the protein content that can be found in the extracellular proximity of a given biological system. These proteins arise from cellular secretion, other protein export mechanisms or cell lysis, but only the most stable proteins in this environment will remain in abundance. It has been shown that these proteins reflect the physiological state of the cells in a given condition and are indicators of how living systems interact with their environments. High-throughput proteomic approaches based on a shotgun strategy, and high-resolution mass spectrometers, have modified the authors' view of exoproteomes. In the present review, the authors describe how these new approaches should be exploited to obtain the maximum useful information from a sample, whatever its origin. The methodologies used for studying secretion from model cell lines derived from eukaryotic, multicellular organisms, virulence determinants of pathogens and environmental bacteria and their relationships with their habitats are illustrated with several examples. The implication of such data, in terms of proteogenomics and the discovery of novel protein functions, is discussed.

AB  - The spatial distribution of polychaeta along pollution gradients often reflects different degrees of disturbance. In order to evaluate polychaeta fauna of an organically polluted tropical bay, 20 sandy beaches distributed in five areas were sampled. The relationship between community structure, slope, beach index, exposure, sediment and water quality parameters were analysed. Multivariate analysis of variance (PER-MANOVA) showed differences among areas and beaches. Scolelepis chilensis dominated at mouth of bay beaches whereas Streblospio gynobranchiata and Capitella capitata complex, at inner beaches. Highest polychaete density was recorded at areas 3 and 5 with the dominance of Saccocirrus sp. and the organic indicator species C. capitata complex and Polydora sp. The most important factors obtained from canonical analysis were sorting, slope, mud and organic matter percentage. Marine biotic index (AMBI) showed that areas 3 and 5 were highly affected by anthropogenic factors, given that a poor polychaeta fauna, dominated by opportunistic species, were found. Polychaete assemblages were affected by eutrophication along an estuarine gradient as well as by morphodynamic condition of the beaches. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Expert elicitation is the process of retrieving and quantifying expert knowledge in a particular domain. Such information is of particular value when the empirical data is expensive, limited or unreliable. This paper describes a new software tool, called Elicitator, which assists in quantifying expert knowledge in a form suitable for use as a prior model in Bayesian regression. Potential environmental domains for applying this elicitation tool include habitat modelling, assessing detectability or eradication, ecological condition assessments, risk analysis and quantifying inputs to complex models of ecological processes. The tool has been developed to be user-friendly, extensible and facilitate consistent and repeatable elicitation of expert knowledge across these various domains. We demonstrate its application to elicitation for logistic regression in a geographically based ecological context. The underlying statistical methodology is also novel, utilizing an indirect elicitation approach to target expert knowledge on a case-by-case basis. For several elicitation sites (or cases), experts are asked simply to quantify their estimated ecological response (e. g. probability of presence), and its range of plausible values, after inspecting (habitat) covariates via GIS.

AB  - Forest road construction by bulldozers in Calabrian Pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) forests on mountainous terrain of Turkey causes considerable damage to the environment and the forest standing alongside the road. This situation obliges a study of environmentally sound road construction in Turkey. This study was carried out in 4 sample sites of Antalya Forest Directorate in steep (34-50% gradient) and very steep terrain (51-70% gradient) conditions with bulldozer and excavator machine and direct damages to forest during road construction was determined, including forest area losses and damages to downhill trees in mountainous areas. It was determined that in steep terrain when excavators were used, less forest area (22.16%) was destroyed compared to bulldozers and 26.54% less area in very steep terrain. The proportion of damage on trees where bulldozer worked was nearly twofold higher than excavator was used. The results of this research show that the environmentally sensitive techniques applied for the road construction projects are considerably superior to the traditional use of bulldozers on steep slopes. The environmentally sound forest road construction by use of excavator must be considered an appropriate and reliable solution for mountainous terrain where areas of sensitive forest ecosystems are to be opened up.

AB  - The knowledge of fish biology of stress response to unfavourable environmental conditions is of interest for both basic and applied purpose, providing useful information for fish farming and environmental risk assessment. In this study, tilapias (Oreochromis mossambicus), confined in nets inside the tanks for 4 or 5 h, were examined for induction of Hsp 70 in various organs by western blotting and for cortisol levels in the blood. In net-confined fish, cortisol, primary stress indicator, was found to consistently increase with differences between 4 and 5 h of confinement. Hsp 70 expression, evaluated in striated and cardiac muscle, gill, liver and brain showed fluctuations in confined animals. Indeed, increase or decrease of Hsp 70 expression in stressed fish was modified in organ- and stress duration-dependent manner and subjective fluctuations were minimal. Morphological observations (LM and EM) were carried out on liver, brain and gill from control and stressed animals. In particular, the liver underwent major modifications while the brain was only slightly modified and the gills were unmodified during confinement stress. Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp 70 expression could be an indicator of stress state in fish when measured in the significant responsive organs.

AB  - Although peroxisomes play a key role in plant metabolism under both normal and stressful growth conditions, the impact of drought and heat stress on the peroxisomes remains unknown. Quinoa represents an informative system for dissecting the impact of abiotic stress on peroxisome proliferation because it is adapted to marginal environments. Here we determined the correlation of peroxisome abundance with physiological responses and yield under heat, drought and heat plus drought stresses in eight genotypes of quinoa. We found that all stresses caused a reduction in stomatal conductance and yield. Furthermore, H2O2 content increased under drought and heat plus drought. Principal component analysis demonstrated that peroxisome abundance correlated positively with H2O2 content in leaves and correlated negatively with yield. Pearson correlation coefficient for yield and peroxisome abundance (r = -0.59) was higher than for commonly used photosynthetic efficiency (r = 0.23), but comparable to those for classical stress indicators such as soil moisture content (r = 0.51) or stomatal conductance (r = 0.62). Our work established peroxisome abundance as a cellular sensor for measuring responses to heat and drought stress in the genetically diverse populations. As heat waves threaten agricultural productivity in arid climates, our findings will facilitate identification of genetic markers for improving yield of crops under extreme weather patterns.

AB  - Selected biomarkers of health were examined in 50 post-spawning cod Gadus morhua collected in November 2015 from the southern Baltic. The biomarkers included condition factor (CF), macroscopic lesions, histopathology of spleen, liver and gonads, and morphometry of follicular atresia and hepatic and splenic melanomacrophage cells (MMC). All fish appeared in good body condition. One fish had a dermal ulcer, and in seven, macroscopic nematodes were noted within body cavity. Microscopic lesions in the liver included biliary myxozoanosis, microsporidial and necrocentric granulomas, parasitic hepatitis, multifocal necrosis, foci of cellular alterations, spongiosis, peliosis and cytoplasmic fibrillar inclusions. The spleen and gonads had microsporidial and/or necrocentric granulomas. Some of the biomarkers showed differences as compared to spawning cod collected in May from the same location in 2012, most importantly values an order of magnitude lower for splenic MMC in post-spawning fish. In post-spawning fish, there were statistically significant correlations between MMC, CF, follicular atresia, parasitic hepatitis and microsporidiosis. This is the first comparison of biomarkers of health in post-spawning and spawning Baltic cod. Future studies need to examine the relationships of biomarkers to levels of pollutants in the environment and in tissues of cod.

AB  - Agriculture contributes significant volumes of livestock faeces to land. Understanding how faecal microbes respond to shifts in meteorological patterns of contrasting seasons is important in order to gauge how environmental (and human health) risks may alter under a changing climate. The aim of this study was to: (i) quantify the temporal pattern of E. coli growth within dairy faeces post defecation; and (ii) derive E. coli seasonal population change profiles associated with contrasting environmental drivers. Evaluation of the die-off dynamics of E. coli revealed that a treatment mimicking drought and warming conditions significantly enhanced persistence relative to E. coli in faeces that were exposed to field conditions, and that this pattern was consistent across consecutive years. The internal temperature of faeces was important in driving the rate of change in the E. coli population in the immediate period post defecation, with most E. coli activity (as either die-off or growth) occurring at low dry matter content. This study highlighted that the use of seasonal E. coli persistence profiles should be approached with caution when modelling environmental and human health risks given the increased likelihood of atypical seasonal meteorological variables impacting on E. coli growth and die-off.

AB  - In the framework of climate change, decreased tree growth and enhanced mortality induced by hot and dry conditions are increasing in many forests around the world, and particularly in Mediterranean forests.
   Our aim was to estimate tree growth and mortality in a Mediterranean holm oak forest, using remote sensing data from MODIS.
   We monitored annual increases of aboveground biomass by measuring tree basal area, and we determined tree mortality by counting dead stems. We analyzed the relationships between forest growth and mortality with mean annual values of some MODIS products and meteorological data.
   Mortality and increases of aboveground biomass correlated well with precipitation, September standardized precipitation/evapotranspiration indices (SPEI), and some MODIS products such as NDVI and enhanced vegetation index EVI. Other MODIS products such as gross primary production (GPP) and net photosynthesis, however, showed no clear relationship with tree mortality or measured increases of biomass.
   The MODIS products as proxies of ecosystemic productivity (gross primary productivity, net photosynthesis) were weakly correlated with biomass increase, and did not reflect the mortality following the drought of autumn 2011. Nevertheless, NDVI and EVI were efficient indicators of forest productivity and dieback.

AB  - [1] We explored relations between climate and trophic status of shallow lakes (lake area > 5 ha, mean depth < 3.2 m) located on the subhumid western Boreal Plain of Canada. Correlation and regression analyses were used to assess the association between indicators of climate and satellite-based estimates of trophic status (chlorophyll alpha (Chl alpha)). Chl a was derived using red band reflectance of Landsat satellite images for 76 lakes, which were then averaged for each year to produce a landscape median for summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 and 2003. Our results showed that climate was related to interannual changes in trophic status. Average May temperature was positively correlated to Chl a, suggesting the importance of conditions in the early part of the growing season. Growing season effective precipitation (P - PET) was negatively correlated to Chl a such that wetter conditions seemed to lead to a dilution of Chl a. Very wet years resulted in a larger Chl a drop than one expected by a linear model, suggesting greater water contribution from the landscape. P - PET explained 64% of the variance in Chl a using a nonlinear regression tree. Our study offers clues as to how shallow lake systems may behave on the subhumid Boreal Plain as a function of future climate change.

AB  - The porewater concentrations of pyrene were estimated by a negligible depletive solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method. The effects of organic matter (OM) and soil aging on the bioavailability of pyrene in soil were investigated by generation of reproductive effect concentrations (EC50) for the euedaphic springtail, Folsomia candida, under various test conditions. The soil used was a sandy loam soil with natural OM content of 2.6% (Askov soil). It was enriched with increasing organic matter concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% and was aged for 0, 56, and 112 days. The EC50 values of the springtails increased with increasing OM and aging of the soil. The increase of the OM content in the soil reduced the extractability of pyrene by SPME, as well as the toxicity of pyrene. An aging effect was demonstrated in Askovsoil, EC50 values increased with increased contact time. The amounts of pyrene extracted by SPME were significantly affected by the soil concentration. Porewater concentrations determined by SPME decreased with increasing OM and aging. However, the pyrene EC50 porewater concentration remained largely constant at approximately 23 mu g L-1. The results demonstrated that the SPME method is a useful indicator for bioavailability to soil microarthropods.

AB  - Asymmetry of the frontal bristles and postocular setae was studied in samples from natural populations and laboratory colonies of Anastrepha sp. 1 aff fraterculus, of A. sp. 2 aff. fraterculus, and in F1 hybrids obtained from laboratory reciprocal crosses. Natural populations were sampled in a zone of sympatry and in two geographically distant regions with different climatic conditions. Asymmetry was scored as the differences between the number of bristles and of setae on the right and left sides of the head, males and females analyzed independently. The two traits exhibited variability according to the model of fluctuating asymmetry (FA). No significant differences among samples were found in the FA of frontal bristles. A significant FA was observed for the postocular setae of A. sp. 1 males from a southern population (Vacaria, RS) as compared to the asymmetry exhibited by males and females of some other samples. No significant differences in FA were observed among the interspecific hybrids and the laboratory samples of both parental species. The higher FA found in the males from Vacaria was attributed to climatic conditions prevailing in that region. The absence of a higher FA in hybrids may be related to the relatively recent evolutionary history of the two species.

AB  - Environmental regulations have always been an essential component in the natural gas supply chain, with recent and greater emphasis on shipping operations. Recently more stringent regulations have been imposed by the International Maritime Organization on global maritime shipping operations. This review explores the challenges and opportunities associated with substituting heavy fuel oils used for maritime transportation with relatively cleaner fuels. First, the review considers the feasibility and environmental dimensions of different bunker fuels, including liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, and ammonia. Also, the operational viability and optimal conditions for these fuels are examined. Secondly, the review considers the entire supply chain, with an emphasis on how liquefied natural gas exporters can establish synergies across the supply chain to also deliver the end-product required by customers instead of delivering only liquefied natural gas. Finally, measures that can support ship operators to comply with environmental regulations are suggested. The outcomes of this review supports the notion that the demand for alternative fuels will continue to increase as the transportation sector moves towards integrating cleaner fuels to comply with increasing environmental regulations.

AB  - Epoxides are widely used chemicals, the determination of which is of paramount importance. Herein, we present an enzyme-based approach for noninstrumental detection of epoxides in standard solution and environmental samples. Halohydrin dehalogenase (HheC) as a biological recognition element and epichlorohydrin as a model analyte were evaluated for sensing. The detection is based on the color change of the pH indicator dye bromothymol blue caused by the HheC-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide substrate. The color change is then exploited for the determination of epoxide using a smartphone as an image acquisition and data processing device, eliminating the need for computer-based image analysis software. The color parameters were systematically evaluated to determine the optimum quantitative analytical parameter. Under optimal conditions, the proposed enzyme-based detection system showed a linear range of 0.13-2 mM with a detection limit of 0.07 mM and an assay time of 8 Min. In addition, the repeatability expressed as relative standard deviation was found to be below 5% (n = 6). Validation with gas chromatographic analyses showed that the proposed enzyme-based epoxide detection could be an alternative way in the quantitative determination of epoxides, and particularly useful in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Rodents are classical model species to investigate spatial synchrony in population fluctuation. Yet, previous studies have been strongly biased geographically toward high latitude (boreal ecosystem) and limited in their spatial scale, i.e., few sampling sites separated by a few tens of kilometers. Both aspects currently limit our understanding of rodent population dynamics across space. In this study we investigate vole population synchrony at a large spatial scale in central Europe.We used long-termbreeding success of a vole-eating raptor specialist, the European kestrel, as an indicator of vole abundance. We first demonstrate that the productivity of kestrels is highly dependent on the availability of voles and as such is a good proxy of vole abundance. Secondly, we assessed the spatial synchrony of kestrel productivity and its scaling.We found that kestrel productivity fluctuated synchronously at a large spatial scale, up to a distance of 300 km. This result suggests that vole populations in central Europe varied in synchrony at large spatial scales, similarly as in northern latitudes. The most likely mechanism resulting in such large scale synchrony of vole populations is synchronized density-independent environmental conditions.

AB  - A new, simple, and low residue analytical method is proposed to check the conformity of bleach products containing hypochlorite. The method is economical and environmentally friendly because it uses low cost materials based on natural indicators and generates only 600 L of waste per test and it allows 12 analyses within 5min using only one digital image. The method consists of capturing a digital image of the hypochlorite colorimetric reaction with anthocyanins using a smartphone and a system built with low cost materials to optimize the acquisition of data. Under optimized reaction conditions, the analytical curve was linear in a hypochlorite concentration range of 1.23x10(-4) to 3.69x10(-4) mol L-1, with limits of detection and quantification of 3.5x10(-5) mol L-1 and 1.16x10(-4) mol L-1, respectively. The obtained results are in agreement with those obtained using the titrimetric method recommended by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) with a confidence level of 95%. Moreover, the method provided 100 times lower residue per analysis than that obtained by iodometric titration, and it does not present toxicity when compared to other methods reported in the literature.

AB  - The extractable organic matter of sediment samples from six sampling sites in Lake Perdana, Kuala Lumpur, was analyzed to characterize the source inputs. The analysis of aliphatic homologous series indicated that terrestrial higher plant waxes can be assigned as the major sources of the identified aliphatic components in the lake sediments. The presence of an unresolved complex mixture of branched and cyclic compounds and a series of hopanes ranging from C-27 to C-35 reflected the contamination by petroleum residues from urban vehicular emissions brought in by runoff and fallout. The steroids present included stenols and stanols and showed an input of organic matter from higher plants. The detected pentacyclic triterpenoids comprised oleanane, ursane, lupane and friedelane skeletons including unsaturated oxygenated, mono-, di- and triaromatic counterparts. They are recognized as biomarkers for angiosperms. The presence of des-A-triterpenoids and their aromatized derivatives as the major diagenetic products of triterpenoids reflected the degradation of natural organic matter in the sediments occurring under mainly anoxic conditions. In addition, the presence of tetrahymanol and beta beta-bishomohopan-32-ol indicated a minor algal/plankton and bacterial input to the sediments.

AB  - The silk is the protein polymer spun into fibers by the silkworms (Bombyx mori L). It is a textile fiber highly appreciated for its outstanding properties (handle, luster, dye ability, comfort). In addition silk has been recently investigated as a starting material for non-textile applications(23). In order to assess the effect of air pollution on the yield and quality of silk fibers, two locations of Murshidabad district, West Bengal, India had been chosen on the basis of the ambient air quality for rearing of mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori L. One location (Berhampore city) was considered polluted as about six Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) have been identified and the concentrations of them quantitated to be as high as 8.8 mu g/m(3) apart from heavy particulate matter in the ambient air sample of that area, while the other location (Kiriteswari village) was the control. Different biological indicators for the silkworms as well as yield and quality of silk fibers between the two sites were considered extensively and it was found that overall condition of the silkworms as well as the yield and quality of silk is better in less polluted areas.

AB  - A common assumption throughout the marine ecological and fisheries literature is that growth is a valid indicator of habitat quality and can be used as a criterion for designation of essential fish habitat (EFH). In this study, the validity of growth as an index of habitat quality was tested by examining how variability in otolith growth was related to abiotic and biotic environmental conditions and could be biased by previous growth history, density dependence, and selective mortality. The study was conducted with juvenile Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) collected in two North Carolina, USA, estuaries during two seasons of two recruitment years. Water temperature, a component of habitat quality, explained nearly 40% of the variability in juvenile otolith growth. There was also evidence that estimates of growth could be biased by density dependence (slower growth at higher conspecific abundance) and by selective mortality (higher mortality of individuals with relatively slower larval and juvenile otolith growth). Studies using growth-based assessment of habitat quality that fail to identify factors underlying growth rate differences among habitats may reach incorrect decisions regarding quality of different habitats and assignment of EFH.

AB  - Heterotrophic plate count (HPC) is considered a useful general indicator of water quality. However, the analysis time is too long (48-72h) to provide information about a decrease in water quality that may require immediate remedial measures. High numbers of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) may also interact in the analysis of coliform bacteria resulting in false low numbers. Limited information is available on the variation of cellular 4-methylumbelliferyl-heptanoate hydrolase (MUHase) activity of HE under different environmental conditions and it is not known if MUHase activity exists in all HE. In this study, MUHase activity has been evaluated for rapid (25min) detection of HPC. The MUHase activity of different bacterial isolates from environmental water samples varied by several log units. Natural water samples showed less variation in activity calculated per CFU, indicating a relatively constant ratio between numbers of bacteria with high and low enzyme levels. The MUHase activity therefore provided a rapid estimate of the HPC of the water samples. The MUHase activity was more resistant to chlorine than the HPC, and separate HPC versus MUHase activity correlation curves should be established for chlorinated and non-chlorinated water.

AB  - Urban green areas are becoming increasingly recognized for their biodiversity potential. However, little is known about how urbanization shapes cryptic species communities, such as those residing in deadwood. In this study, we investigated downed Norway spruce trunks at intermediate stages of decay, in urban and semi-natural forests in southern Finland. To understand the interconnections between landscape context, deadwood characteristics and wood-inhabiting fungal communities, we studied structural characteristics, surface epiphyte cover and internal moisture and temperature conditions of the tree trunks, and fungal communities residing in the wood. Our findings showed that urban tree trunks had less epiphyte cover and lower moisture than trunks in semi-natural forests. Overall, urban forests provide less favourable habitats for a majority of the dominant wood-inhabiting fungal species and for red-listed species as a group. Yet, 33% of urban trunks hosted at least one red-listed species. While these landscape-scale effects may be driven by local climatic conditions as well as contingencies related to available species pools, our results also highlight the significance of substrate-scale variability of deadwood in shaping wood-inhabiting fungal communities. We show that epiphyte cover is a significant driver or indicator of these small-scale dynamic processes in deadwood.

AB  - Climate change brings about unprecedented increases in the occurrence of storms and flooding. In response to increased risk of bridge pier scouring, there is a need for increased safety monitoring of bridges. This paper presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) - based solution developed to measure micro-vibrations of a bridge pier. Test measurement values are converted with the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to obtain natural frequencies. Scouring depth of the pier is estimated with the use of a Finite Element Method model. WSN is used to collect the signal and to test data transmission stability in different locations, as well as FFT and Welch method are used to convert the obtained signal into spectral signals allows an automatic determination and storage of pier vibration frequency data. Relevant parameters in a Finite Element Method (FEM) model use the in-situ natural frequencies as calibration parameters, and the soil equivalent spring model was set up by using in-situ drilling data. The maximum spring depth represents the depth of the scouring. The scouring depth and natural frequency data are used as follow-up indicators of bridge scouring condition. WSN is used to monitor condition of piers provides a practical method and tool for mitigating potential bridge collapse.

AB  - High concentrations of calcite fossil granules produced by earthworms (ECG) have been identified in most of the stratigraphical units along the loess-palaeosol reference sequence of Nussloch (Germany). They are particularly abundant in interstadial brown soils and in tundra gley horizons, the latter reflecting short-term phases of aggradation then degradation of permafrost. These granules are characterized by a radial crystalline structure produced in the earthworms by specific bio-mineralization processes. In our study, we used this biological indicator combined with C-14 and OSL dating, and sedimentological parameters to characterize millennial-time scale climatic variations recorded in loess sequences. The approach is based on high-resolution counts of ECG throughout a 17-m-thick loess sequence (332 samples). Strong increases in granule and mollusc concentrations suggest warmer climate conditions during palaeosol formation phases, associated with increasing biodiversity, biological activity and vegetation cover. Decreased granule concentrations occur within primary loess deposits, indicating a strong correlation with palaeoenvironmental conditions and demonstrating the reliability of ECG concentration variations as a new palaeoenvironmental proxy. Finally, this pattern is also recorded in loess sequences located about 600 km westward in northern France demonstrating the large-scale validity of this new palaeoclimatic proxy.

AB  - Different kinds of solar radiation (direct, diffuse) shape microclimate of forest gaps and have significant influence on establishment and growth of young trees. Adjustment of the shape and size of artificial gaps could create favourable conditions that meet the demands of particular species. Unfortunately there is lack of publications concerning this topic, which could be used directly for silvicultural planning in Polish conditions. Empirical assessment of radiation regimes in a wide range of different shaped gaps is impossible from practical reasons, so modelling in ArcGis environment was used instead. Gaps of different shape and size were modelled as elliptical depression in terrain by the use digital elevation model. The Solar Radiation tool was used to model direct and global radiation on the bottom of the gaps with area varying between 2 and 50 are surrounded by stands of height between 15 to 35 meters. The outcome of modelling was presented in form of nomograms. Additional series of analyses was created to describe the influence of terrain aspect and inclination on solar radiations supplies on the forest floor in gaps. Presented nomograms could be helpful in silvicultural planning, because they could be used to design artificial gaps with expected solar radiations supplies.

AB  - Diamondoid hydrocarbons have been examined in condensates reservoired in the Southern Indus Basin using GC-MS. Bulk properties reveal that samples are waxy and low sulfur with the exception of Pakhro and Gopang which are nonwaxy. TIC show bimodal distribution of n-alkanes along with high abundance of C20+ n-alkanes indicating substantial contribution of terrigeneous OM in these samples. CPI close to one is consistent with mature nature of oils. The samples show two ranges of Pr/Ph ratios. Those within the range of 2.2-2.7 reflect marine depositional settings for OM while others with Pr/Ph >3 may have originated from terrestrial OM deposited under marine oxic conditions. The cross plot of Pr/n-C-17 versus Ph/n-C-18 indicate type III kerogen as main source of OM deposited under marine to marine oxic conditions. The values of diamondoid based maturity parameters, like methyladamantane index 54.1-75.8% and methyldiamantane index 34.9-56.3% indicate high level of thermal maturity corresponding to vitrinite reflectance 1.1-1.6%. No biodegradation is observed in any of these samples as shown by methyladamantanes/adamantane 3.99-5.52 and methyldiamantanes/diamantane 2.16-2.99 and supported by high values of API gravity (45.13 degrees-60.02 degrees) and absence of UCM.

AB  - Knowledge of nanoparticle transport and retention mechanisms is essential for both the risk assessment and environmental application of engineered nanomaterials. Laser scanning cytometry, an emerging technology, was used for the first time to investigate the transport of fluorescent nanoparticles in a microfluidic flow cell packed with glass beads. The laser scanning cytometer (LSC) was able to provide the spatial distribution of 64 nm fluorescent nanoparticles attached in a domain of 12 mm long and 5 mm wide. After 40 pV of injection at a lower ionic strength condition (3 mM NaCl, pH 7.0), fewer fluorescent nanoparticles were attached to the center of the flow cell, where the pore-scale velocity is relatively higher. After a longer injection period (300 PV), more were attached to the center of the flow cell, and particles were attached to both the upstream and downstream sides of a glass bead. Nanoparticles attached under a higher ionic strength condition (100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) were found to be mobilized when flushed with DI water. The mobilized particles were later reattached to some favorable sites. The attachment efficiency factor was found to reduce with an increase in flow velocity. However, torque analysis based on the secondary energy minimum could not explain the observed hydrodynamic effect on the attachment efficiency factor.

AB  - The RNA F-specific coliphages, MS2 and Qbeta, have been used as virus indicators in water and wastewater studies. It is therefore useful to have a good understanding concerning the effects of environmental factors on their survival in order to choose an appropriate candidate for assessing microbial safety in relation to water quality management. The effects of pH and temperature on the survival of these two coliphages were investigated. MS2 survived better in acidic conditions than in an alkaline environment. In contrast, Qbeta had a better survival rate in alkaline conditions than in an acidic environment. The inactivation rates of both coliphages were lowest within the pH range 6-8 and the temperature range 5-35degreesC. The inactivation rates of both coliphages increased when the pH was decreased to below 6 or increased to above 8. The inactivation rates of both coliphages increased with increasing temperature. Qbeta behaved peculiarly in extreme pH buffers, i.e. it was inactivated very rapidly initially when subjected to an extreme pH environment, although the inactivation rate subsequently decreased. In general, MS2 was a better indicator than Qbeta. However, within the pH range 6-9 and at temperatures not above 25degreesC, either MS2 or Qbeta could be used as a viral indicator.

T2  - TOXICON
LA  - English
AB  - The venom production of the free hunting neotropic spider Cupiennius salei was tested under different breeding conditions. Three groups kept at different temperatures (17, 21 and 25 degrees C) showed that venom production remained stable within this temperature range, only at a temperature of 15 degrees C the spiders stopped feeding and venom synthesis. Hunger periods do not have a direct effect on the released venom quantity. Two groups of spiders - the first group after a four and the second after an eight weeks hunger period - were compared and no difference in venom production was found, Such long fasting periods are a natural situation for spiders. In this case Cupiennius salei reduces its body weight but not venom supply. This means that body weight is a parameter only of short-term fitness which changes with the actual living conditions (temperature, feeding intervals) of each individual, Long-term fitness is best described by the prosoma length, which was formed during the juvenile growth of each spider and is rather invariable in adulthood. It was shown that the quantity of released venom is better correlated with the length of the prosoma than with the weight of the animal. This means that venom production is mostly an indicator of longterm fitness. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecotones are ecological boundaries or areas of transition between ecosystems. They are sensitive indicators of global change, and studying their dynamics can be useful to predict habitat shifts and landscape transformation. The Ulva-Zostera ecotone in Elkhorn Slough (California, United States) is a good example of a transitional area between habitat-forming macrophytes in a highly eutrophic coastal system. This study focused on understanding its driving factors, spatiotemporal trends, and overall ecological implications. A combination of habitat monitoring, recruitment and transplant experiments, and sediment analysis were used to describe the ecological characteristics of the system. Ecotone dynamics were driven by seasonality of Ulva spp., its distribution across the ecotone delimited by processes affecting its early developmental stages. While water quality and light availability were not linked to abundance and distribution of Ulva spp., sediment composition likely affected macrophyte distribution and overall ecosystem structure. Remarkably, physico-chemical conditions that hinder growth and expansion of Ulva spp. occur where eelgrass (Zostera marina) is present. Understanding the processes involved in habitat boundary dynamics is important to identify stressors and anticipate change at larger scales.

AB  - Desertification is a dynamic and complex system of land degradation. To understand it, physical and anthropogenic processes and their interrelations need to be identified. This study aimed to provide early warning information on desertification risk in the form of warning maps, using effective key indicators of land degradation in a 15-year period in the arid regions of northeastern Iran. E-SMART key Indicators should be E: Economic, S: Specific, M: Measurable, A: Achievable, R: Relevant, and T: Time-bound. Multiple regression analysis showed that the majority of indicators could accurately assess desertification risk at a 99% confidence level with R-2 = 0.81. Furthermore, compared to the beginning of the study period, areas under desertification warning due to natural and anthropogenic factors had increased by about 78 percent in 2015. This observation is aligned with the impacts of drought, which has resulted from the continued reduction in rainfall. The expansion of at-risk areas has in turn exacerbated the adverse environmental conditions and amplified the effects of drought in the area. Spatio-temporal changes in soil salinity, groundwater quality, groundwater level, vegetation, agricultural development, and socioeconomic issues showed that the study area has suffered from land degradation and desertification between 2000 and 2015.

AB  - Sustainable water resource management is a wicked problem, fraught with uncertainties, an indeterminate scope, and divergent social values and interests among stakeholders. To facilitate better management of Southeast Asia's transboundary Sesan, Sekong and Srepok (3S) River basin, we used the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) to diagnose the basin's current and likely future level of freshwater health. We used the conditions for December 2016 as a baseline, where Ecosystem Vitality and Ecosystem Services scored 66 and 80, respectively, out of a possible 100, whilst Governance & Stakeholders scored 43. Thus, the 3S provided a range of desired ecosystem services, but there were signs of environmental stress as well as undeveloped water governance systems and limited stakeholder engagement. We also modelled four hydropower development scenarios and found that increasing development reduced the scores of a subset of indicators. This compromised the future ability of the 3S basin's ecosystem to provide its current range of services. The FHI helped identify data deficiencies, illuminated important social dynamics, made ecosystem-human-water dynamics more understandable to stakeholders, and examined the long-term dynamics of the basin.

AB  - The application of livestock manure on agricultural land is being restricted due to its significant content of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), leading to eutrophication. At the same time, the growing demand for N and P mineral fertilizers is increasing their production costs and causing the depletion of natural phosphate rock deposits. In the present work, seven technologically feasible treatment schemes for energy (biogas) and nutrient recovery (e.g., struvite precipitation) and/or removal (e.g., partial nitritation/anammox) were evaluated from an environmental perspective. In general, while approaches based solely on energy recovery and use of digestate as fertilizer are commonly limited by community regulations, strategies pursuing the generation of high-quality struvite are not environmentally sound alternatives. In contrast, schemes that include further solid/liquid separation of the digestate improved the environmental profile, and their combination with an additional N-removal stage would lead to the most environmental-friendly framework. However, the preferred scenario was identified to be highly dependent on the particular conditions of each site, integrating environmental, social and economic criteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present a novel framework that accurately evaluates the extent of a linear project's effect from the variability of the structure of the plant community while avoiding interference caused by pioneer species and invasive species. This framework was based on the change of dominant species in the plant community affected by construction. TWINSPAN classification and variation of the integrated importance value (IIV) of each plant species group were used to characterize the process of change in the structure of the plant community. Indicator species group and its inflection point were defined and used to judge the extent of the effects of pipelines. Our findings revealed that dominant species in the working area of the pipeline construction were different from the original plant communities. With the disturbance decreased, the composition and structure of the plant communities gradually changed. We considered the outer limit of the area affected by the construction to be the first area in which the plant community reached a steady state and was similar to the original community. The framework could be used in the post eco-environment impact assessment of linear construction to estimate the intensity of disturbance and recovery condition.

AB  - It is increasingly evident that cryptic stages of many parasites cause asymptomatic infections in a diversity of hosts. This review examines what may cause these infectious agents to persist as asymptomatic infections in invertebrates and how environmental change is linked with the subsequent development of overt infection and disease. In many systems, disease dynamics are closely associated with host condition which, in turn, is linked with environmental change. Symbionts (commensals and mutualists) display similar dynamics when environmental change causes them to exert negative effects on their hosts. Although such asymptomatic infections are demonstrated in a range of invertebrate hosts they are greatly undersampled because most invertebrate diseases are uninvestigated, infections are difficult to detect, and many parasite groups are poorly characterized. A better understanding of the diversity and distribution of parasites that cause asymptomatic infections and of their complex relationships with invertebrate hosts will enable a fuller appreciation of context-dependent host-parasite interactions and will address the biased focus on diseases of invertebrates of practical importance. The existence of such infections could underlie novel disease outbreaks that might otherwise be attributed to invasives while altered disease dynamics may provide an additional and complementary indicator of ecosystem change.

AB  - Interdisciplinary studies have proved the interconnectedness of history and ecology relevant to forest conservation proposals and management policies. Engaging local views and concerns in the evaluation and monitoring process can lead to more robust knowledge in the pursuit of effective conservation. This study aimed to assess the degree to which land use change trajectories influence the state of tropical dry forest conservation, as evaluated by scientists and local people. Focusing on northern Nicaragua, the research identified three historical trajectories for types and magnitude of forest disturbance. The assessment process included inventorying sites under different trajectories and integrating ecological and social indicators (namely local perceptions of biodiversity value and concern over species threat). The different land use change trajectories had no influence on the present structure of the dry forest, but strongly affected species diversity, composition and their social importance. The study provided evidence of positive species selection by farmers, which suggested a feedback loop between ecological conditions, social value and awareness of conservation.

AB  - A comparative analysis of submerged Potametea communities in lakes of north-eastern Poland was conducted with respect to 16 water chemistry and 14 substrate parameters. The analysis of 187 releves based on TWINSPAN clustering showed the existence of 8 aquatic vegetation types. Each of them is characterized by a strong dominance of one of the following macrophytes: Potamogeton lucens, P. perfoliatus, Myriophyllum spicatum, M. verticillatum, Elodea canadensis, Ceratophyllum demersum, Ranunculus circinatus and Hydrilla verticillata. The above vegetation types correspond to the plant associations distinguished using the Braun-Blanquet method (Potametum lucentis, Potametum perfoliati, Myriophylletum spicati etc.) It was demonstrated that among properties of water analysed, COD-KMnO4, SO42-, pH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, total hardness, total Fe, Cl- and colour appear to be most important in differentiating the habitats of the communities studied. In the case of substrates the properties which best differentiated the habitats compared were hydration, organic matter content, total N, PO43-, K+, dissolved SiO2, SO42-, Cl- and pH. Most of the aquatic plant communities investigated are distinct with respect to their phytocoenotic structure and ecology and could be good indicators of various types of habitats in lake ecosystems.

AB  - A species' ecological niche depends on the species' adaptations to its present habitat, but also on the legacy from its ancestors. Most authors argue that such a phylogenetic niche conservatism is of minor importance, although no quantitative analyses across a major taxon is available. Higher plants from central Europe offer a unique opportunity for Such an exercise, as the niche positions along various environmental gradients are available for most species. We quantified niche conservatism by two approaches. First, we used a phylogenetic tree and quantified the degree of retention of niches across the tree. Depending on the gradient, the values ranged from 0.43 to 0.22. This was significantly greater than the null expectation. Second, we used a taxonomy and quantified the amount of variance among species that could be explained at higher taxonomic levels. The values ranged from 25 to 72%. Again, this was significantly higher than the null expectation. Thus, both approaches indicated a clear niche conservatism. The distribution of conservatism across taxonomic levels differed considerably among environmental gradients. The differences among environmental gradients could be correlated with the palaeoenvironmental conditions during the radiation of the phylogenetic lineages. Thus, niche conservatism among extant plant species may reflect the opportunities of their ancestors during their diversification.

AB  - The densities of several microbial indicator organisms, including fecal coliforms, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and a male-specific bacteriophage group, were determined in the pre- and post-chlorinated effluents of three wastewater treatment plants during a rainfall event when the plants were operating near maximum flow capacity. These studies were undertaken to determine the effects of elevated flow rates on the relative rates of inactivation of the microbial indicators due to chlorine disinfection.
   Three distinctly different responses to chlorine treatment were observed. The vegetative bacterial organisms (fecal coliforms and enterococci) were most sensitive, the male-specific bacteriophage group was considerably more refractory, and C. perfringens, a bacterial spore-former, was highly resistant to inactivation by the disinfecting agent. These findings are significant for two reasons. First, the vegetative bacterial indicators did not reliably index the decay rates of the bacterial virus under the field conditions experienced. This has important public health ramifications to consumers of certain seafood products and to marine recreationists. Second, because of the highly refractory nature of the C. perfringens spore, this microbial indicator has practical use in assessing the magnitude of the impacts (source strengths) of sewage contaminated wastewaters on estuarine and marine environments.

AB  - Four crude oil samples representing the Jurassic sandstone sequence were collected from several wells in the Shabwah depression and analyzed using conventional geochemical and physical methods. The results were used to evaluate the oil samples, focusing on the characteristics of their source rocks, including the origin of organic matter input, redox depositional conditions, and degree of thermal maturity. The observed physical results show that the examined oils are light crude oils owing to their high American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 35.0-40.1 degrees. The high API gravity and aliphatic hydrocarbon fraction indicate that the examined oils were generated from mature source rocks. The biomarkers of n-alkane, isoprenoid, hopanoid, and steroid with the delta C-13 isotopic compositions suggest that the oil samples were sourced from clay-rich rocks containing mixed organic matter with high contributions of marine organic matter and deposited under suboxic to relatively anoxic environmental conditions. The biomarker maturity indicators also suggest that the oil samples were generated from mature source rocks. According to the biomarker environmental indicators and delta C-13 isotopic compositions, the oil samples are from the Late Jurassic Madbi shale source rock.

AB  - Honey bees exhibit remarkable visual learning capacities, which can be studied using virtual reality (VR) landscapes in laboratory conditions. Existing VR environments for bees are imperfect as they provide either open-loop conditions or 2D displays. Here we achieved a true 3D environment in which walking bees learned to discriminate a rewarded from a punished virtual stimulus based on color differences. We included ventral or frontal background cues, which were also subjected to 3D updating based on the bee movements. We thus studied if and how the presence of such motion cues affected visual discrimination in our VR landscape. Our results showed that the presence of frontal, and to a lesser extent, of ventral background motion cues impaired the bees' performance. Whenever these cues were suppressed, color discrimination learning became possible. We analyzed the specific contribution of foreground and background cues and discussed the role of attentional interference and differences in stimulus salience in the VR environment to account for these results. Overall, we show how background and target cues may interact at the perceptual level and influence associative learning in bees. In addition, we identify issues that may affect decision-making in VR landscapes, which require specific control by experimenters.

AB  - Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane producer with projections for expanding the current area by 30% in the coming years, mainly in areas previously occupied by pastures. We assess soil water changes induced by land-use change (LUC) for sugarcane expansion in the central-south region of Brazil. For that purpose, soil samples were collected in a typical LUC sequence (native vegetation-pasture-sugarcane) in two contrasting soil textures (i.e., sandy and clayey). Soil hydro-physical properties such as pores size distribution, bulk density, soil water content, water tension, and drainage time at field capacity, plant-available water, and S-index were analyzed. Our data showed that long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive pasture induced severe degradation in soil physical quality and soil water dynamics. However, conventional tillage used during conversion from pasture to sugarcane did not cause additional degradation on soil structure and soil water dynamics. Over time, sugarcane cultivation slightly impaired soil water and physical conditions, but only in the 10-20 cm layer in both soils. Therefore, we highlight that sustainable management practices to enhance soil physical quality and water dynamics in sugarcane fields are needed to prevent limiting conditions to plant growth and contribute to delivering other ecosystem services.

AB  - Luminous fireflies are a roadside attraction group of insects which act as environmental indicators and indicate the quality of surrounding milieus. However, recent studies suggest that water pollution and climate change are involved in the decline of firefly populations around the world, and have sounded an alarm regarding the conservation of the firefly population. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the current status of the firefly population in a remote place called "Barrankula" in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh, India, which is surrounded by paddy fields. Two decades ago (during 1996), the population of the firefly Abscondita chinensis Kiesenwetter 1874 (Coleoptera: Lampyridae: Luciolinae) around the freshwater canal of Barrankula was documented in the several hundreds (>500) of individuals within a 10-m(2) area. However, the same site was found to have a declining population of Abs. chinensis (only 10 to 20 individuals) within a 10-m(2) area in January 2019. Thus, further population modeling studies are imperative to investigate the factors influencing the distribution and abundance of Abs. chinensis and to conserve this species. In addition, this study also investigated the luminescence emission patterns of Abs. chinensis under captive conditions, where gradual depletion of luminescence was detected under starved conditions. Abs. chinensis documented in this study is the first record of faunal diversity in Andhra Pradesh.

AB  - The capacity of modern computer numeric control (CNC) machine tool builds on the machine design (structural rigidity, drive system, control looping, etc.), machining process (cutting speed, feed rate and cutting forces) and environment (temperature and vibrations).The linear drive system of CNC machines consists of ball screw and its associated components. The servomotor drives the feed drive system in control conditions at required speed, and providing feedback to controller of the machine. Feed drive system is responsible for the performance of linear axis of machine. The performance indicators include positioning accuracy, repeatability and backlash. The required accuracy on workpiece relies on the torque/power of axis motors. The objective of this article is to derive an equation for the computation of torque for the feed drive system of CNC machines. We have proposed two simple and easiest method of computing torque. Firstly, we computed the torque required for the running of linear axis of machine under load conditions by the first method. Secondly, the verification of computed torque has been done by the second method. Thirdly, we have analyzed three major factors like rapid rate, weight over the system and lead of ball screw to study the behavior of torque. Finally, analytical estimations have been carried out for the validation of the deployed method.

AB  - Silica glass has been shown in numerous studies to possess significant capacity for permanent densification under pressure at different temperatures to form high density amorphous (HDA) silica. However, it is unknown to what extent the processes leading to irreversible densification of silica glass in cold-compression at room temperature and in hot-compression (e.g., near glass transition temperature) are common in nature. In this work, a hot-compression technique was used to quench silica glass from high temperature (1100 degrees C) and high pressure (up to 8 GPa) conditions, which leads to density increase of similar to 25% and Young's modulus increase of similar to 71% relative to that of pristine silica glass at ambient conditions. Our experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide solid evidences that the intermediate-range order of the hot-compressed HDA silica is distinct from that of the counterpart cold-compressed at room temperature. This explains the much higher thermal and mechanical stability of the former than the latter upon heating and compression as revealed in our in-situ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) experiments. Our studies demonstrate the limitation of the resulting density as a structural indicator of polyamorphism, and point out the importance of temperature during compression in order to fundamentally understand HDA silica.

AB  - Animal abundance is a key measure in conservation and management and tightly linked to population demographics. Demographic data from remote regions, however, are often scarce. Here, we present long-term (1996-2013) demographics on the muskox Ovibos moschatus population at Zackenberg in northeast Greenland. We examine both the inter- and intra-annual patterns in demographic parameters and relate these to environmental conditions. The sex and age composition of muskox groups changed during the study period, and changes were particularly evident in the increasing versus the decreasing phase of muskox abundance. The seasonal pattern of muskox density and group size was a parallel increase from late winter to autumn, which peaked at high densities (approximately seven individuals per km(2)) in the autumn. The composition of muskox groups also changed between seasons. Across years, the muskox population dynamics was mainly driven by spring snow cover (an indicator of winter conditions), which primarily impacted the calf and yearling recruitments. This relationship, however, appeared to have a temporary decoupling, which may be attributable to pathogens. Our study provides rare insight into the long-term demographics of a remote ungulate population in relation to drivers of change and thus aids the development of adequate monitoring and management plans for muskoxen in a changing Arctic.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition and the most common type of amnestic dementia in the elderly. Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk of developing AD in adulthood as a result of chromosome 21 trisomy and triplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. In both conditions, the central nervous system (CNS) basal forebrain cholinergic system progressively degenerates, and such changes contribute to the manifestation of cognitive decline and dementia. Given the strong dependency of these neurons on nerve growth factor (NGF), it was hypothesized that their atrophy was caused by NGF deficits. However, in AD, the synthesis of NGF is not affected at the transcript level and there is a marked increase in its precursor, proNGF. This apparent paradox remained elusive for many years. In this review, we discuss the recent evidence supporting a CNS deficit in the extracellular metabolism of NGF, both in AD and in DS brains. We describe the nature of this trophic disconnection and its implication for the atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. We further discuss the potential of NGF pathway markers as diagnostic indicators of a CNS trophic disconnection.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can threaten animal and human health through the production of toxins such as domoic acid. These blooms have become more frequent and toxic over the last few decades. In this study, we investigate the role that nutrients play in a toxic, subsurface bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia in northeastern Monterey Bay, California. Profilers and towed instruments were deployed and laboratory analyses of discrete water samples were conducted to describe the physical and biogeochemical conditions of the sampling site and to characterize the bloom. The subsurface Pseudo-nitzschia bloom occurred within a well-defined layer, containing high levels of domoic acid. In situ images taken within the layer revealed diatom flocs-indicators of nutrient stress. Nutrient ratios and alkaline phosphatase activity, commonly used to determine the nutritional status of phytoplankton, suggest that the Pseudo-nitzschia cells were phosphate stressed, and we speculate that this physiological stress led to increased toxicity of the bloom. Understanding how frequently blooms such as these are characterized by nutrient stress could improve our ability to predict the occurrence of HABs. With increased anthropogenic input of nutrients, such blooms could occur more often and with greater degrees of toxicity in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The eutrophication status of the entire Baltic Sea is classified using a multi-metric indicator-based assessment tool. A total of 189 areas are assessed using indicators where information on reference conditions (RefCon), and acceptable deviation (AcDev) from reference condition could be combined with national monitoring data from the period 2001-2006. Most areas (176) are classified as 'affected by eutrophication' and only two open water areas and 11 coastal areas are classified as 'unaffected by eutrophication'. The classification is made by application of the recently developed HELCOM Eutrophication Assessment Tool (HEAT), which is described in this paper. The use of harmonized assessment principles and the HEAT tool allows for direct comparisons between different parts of the Baltic Sea despite variations in monitoring activities. The impaired status of 176 areas is directly related to nutrient enrichment and elevated loads from upstream catchments. Baltic Sea States have implemented nutrient management strategies since years which have reduced nutrient inputs. However, eutrophication is still a major problem for large parts of the Baltic Sea. The 2007 Baltic Sea Action Plan is projected to further reduce nutrient inputs aiming for a Baltic Sea unaffected by eutrophication by 2021.

AB  - Developmental processes of organisms are programed to proceed in a finely regulated manner and finish within a certain period of time depending on the ambient environmental conditions. Therefore, variation in the developmental period under controlled genetic and environmental conditions indicates innate instability of the developmental process. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a molecular machinery exists that regulates the canalization of the developmental period and, if so, to test whether the same mechanism also stabilizes a morphological trait. To search for regions that influence the instability of the developmental period, we conducted genome-wide deficiency mapping with 441 isogenic deficiency strains covering 65.5% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We found that 11 independent deficiencies significantly increased the instability of the developmental period and 5 of these also significantly increased the fluctuating asymmetry of wing shape although there was no significant correlation between the instabilities of developmental period and wing shape in general. These results suggest that canalization processes of the developmental period and morphological traits are at least partially independent. Our findings emphasize the potential importance of temporal variation in development as an indicator of developmental stability and canalization and provide a novel perspective for understanding the regulation of phenotypic variability.

AB  - Woodsia ilvensis has become extinct from its last known natural localities in Estonia and has not been rediscovered since 1977. This fern grew in northern and north-western Estonia in areas of suitable habitat. Considering that habitat conditions may have changed in previous localities, an experimental project was started to test if it would be possible to reintroduce W. ilvensis into new localities where suitable habitat conditions exist. Two experiments were performed, one on an old stone wall, constructed of stones collected from the surrounding fields, and another on two granite boulders in two localities, one where the surrounding soil was acidic, and the other where the soil was basic. The plants were grown from spores of wild provenance received from Finland via the seed and spore exchange system of botanical gardens. Results confirmed that individual plants can establish and persist for at least 10 years on stone walls without maintenance. The experiment on boulders failed, as plants did not establish there. Young, 2-year old mature individuals proved to be the best stage for planting out onto the stone walls in this case study. The best indicators for selecting suitable habitat were characteristic plant species of the natural community. Here I discuss the experimental methods used and first results of the experiment.

AB  - Leaf area index, biomass accumulation and yield are important traits affected by environmental factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different farming systems (organic and conventional) on leaf area index, biomass and grain yield. Twenty four wheat cultivars were planted during 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 under rainfed conditions at National Agricultural Research and Development Institute Fundulea, Romania, on a cambic chernozem soil. Crop farming system and cultivars strongly influenced leaf area index (LAI) in this study. The highest leaf area index was reached in conventional farming system, while the lowest ones were recorded in organic farming system for all cultivars and experimental years. In organic farming system LAI ranged from 1.87 (Flamura 85, 2009 year) to 3.02 (Dor, 2009 year), reflecting less favorable conditions of water and nutrients supply. The organic farming system produced less biomass than the conventional farming system. A significant correlation between biomass and LAI in organic farming system was found, while in conventional farming the correlation of these traits was not significant. The correlations between total biomass and yield, averaged on experimental years, were very significantly positive (r = 0.65*** in conventional system, 0.70*** in organic system), suggesting that a higher yield can be associated with a higher biomass accumulation in any crop management system.

AB  - The growth rate of fish shows extensive plasticity in response to various environments. Metabolic responses of fish to excessive nutritional shortages such as starvation have been reported, but the effects of moderate nutrient shortage remain unclear. We examined expression levels of some genes related to ATP metabolism and to myogenesis, the RNA/DNA ratio, and the protein/DNA ratio of fish under different feeding conditions: a diet of 212-432% (frequent feeding, FR) or 32-82% (restricted feeding, RE) of initial body weight per week was supplied. The expression levels of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK)-Z2, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and myogenin genes of RE fish were higher than those of FIR fish, although the RNA/DNA ratio and the protein/DNA ratio were unaffected by the feeding amount. Moreover, expression levels of NDK-Z2 and GAPDH were upregulated to a greater extent than those for myogenin and myostatin I under restricted feeding. Together, our results show that gene expression is more sensitive to nutrient conditions of fish than traditional indicators such as the RNA/DNA ratio. The ATP metabolic system is more sensitive to moderate nutrient shortages than the myogenic system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The lipidic fraction from 8 sediments sampled at the confluence between the Fensch River (FR) and the Moselle River (MR) have been analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in order to investigate the transfer of organic micropollutants from the FR to the MR. Molecular markers have been quantified and classified into five categories: natural, petrogenic, pyrogenic and sewage water markers and non-specific molecules. This classification coupled with the quantification of the molecules allows the comparison between anthropogenic and natural inputs and the source apportionment of anthropogenic molecules that are not covalently bound to sedimentary organic macromolecules. The transfer and the fate of organic micropollutants in river sediments seem to be controlled by the water flow. Low water flow conditions induce the settling of fine particles, which could limit the biodegradation. This leads to the preservation of the original anthropogenic fingerprint that is rich in low molecular weight molecules. in high water flow conditions, sediments are mainly composed of coarse particles, limiting the preservation of organic matter, which leads to a persistent anthropogenic fingerprint, mainly composed of high molecular weight compounds.

AB  - The fermentation of non-starch polysaccharides by colonic microflora is popular as a triggering mechanism to achieve colon-specific drug delivery in that the existence of colonic microflora is independent of gastrointestinal transit time, pH, and disease conditions, and various delivery systems were developed using this strategy. One of such delivery systems, COLAL technology, has advanced into late stage of product development. However, in vitro characterization of these delivery systems remains a challenge in part because the critical performance indicator is colonic specificity of drug release. Moreover, the dynamic and ecologically diverse features of the colon are difficult to be incorporated into USP dissolution methods. As a result, alternative dissolution approaches have been designed to better represent the colonic conditions, such as utilizing polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, rat caecal contents, human fecal slurries, and multi-stage culture systems. The primary focus of this article is to summarize and review the dissolution testing currently used in characterizing colon-specific delivery systems activated by microflora. A brief description of physiological parameters of the colon relevant to colonic drug release is also presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geographic and temporal variability in the marine environment affects seabirds' ability to find food. Similarly, an individual's body size or condition may influence their ability to capture prey. We examined the diving behavior of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at Punta Tombo, Argentina, as an indicator of variation in foraging ability. We studied how body size affected diving capability and how diving varies among years and within breeding seasons. We also compared diving patterns of Magellanic penguins at Punta Tombo with those of birds in two colonies at the opposite end of the species' breeding range. Larger penguins tended to dive deeper and for longer than smaller birds. Trips were longer during incubation and in the years and colonies with lower reproductive success, which suggests that in those instances birds were working hard to recover body condition and feed chicks. Average dive depths, average dive durations, and percentages of time spent diving were always similar. We found that the only parameter these penguins consistently modified while foraging was the length of their foraging trip, which suggests that penguins at Punta Tombo were diving at maximum rates to find their preferred prey. Increasing trip length, we suggest, is a physiologically conservative solution for increasing the likelihood of encountering prey.

AB  - Two proposed source-rock sequences in the Lower (Aptian-Albian) and the Upper (Cenomanian-Campanian) Cretaceous sediments of the Perija Range, Maracaibo Basin, were geochemically analyzed in order to find environmentally controlled characteristic fingerprints. Trace metals and sulfur concentrations were found to be closely related with the physicochemical conditions during deposition of the racks. Based on trace metal analyses and sulfur relationships with TOC, the Aptian-Albian sequence (Machiques Member) shows alternate oxic and anoxic episodes close to the bottom-water surface where mixed marine and terrestrial organic matter were deposited. The Cenomanian-Campanian sequence (La Luna Formation) persistently shows anoxic-euxinic conditions that allowed the preservation of marine organic matter. Ratios of trace metals (V, Mo and Zn) characterize both Cretaceous sedimentary columns, however, some limitations are Visualized in using trace metals as correlation tools in further geochemical studies. Biomarker ratios are related to the organic matter type and lithology. Some specific ratios and individual compounds allow a clear differentiation between these two sequences and offer, in the context of delta(13)C, an excellent tool for further oil-source rock correlation studies.

AB  - In mixed oak stands situated within two isolated forest reserves in NE Italy, we investigated how plant communities are modulated by local conditions, forest structure and landscape attributes. Species richness and functional dispersion increased towards canals, whereas soil salinity, canopy density or landscape heterogeneity were less relevant. Mean nutrient indicator values increased near canals and with higher proportions of agriculture around. Functional dispersion decreased at wet, nutrient rich sites. Also, the proportion of salt tolerant species increased towards canals, but was unrelated to measures of soil salinity. At sites with more modified landscapes around, widely distributed species were more prevalent, at cost of plants with restricted distributional ranges. Hence, biotic homogenization is fostered inside the reserves through landscape modification in their surroundings. In contrast to species richness, composition turned out to be markedly modulated by environmental variation, with local site factors, forest stand structure and landscape attributes contributing to roughly the same extent. Conservation practices should therefore not only focus on managing local conditions, but also take landscape structure into account. For coastal forests, dry and open, nutrient poor sites are of special conservation concern, which are believed to most closely resemble the original diverse vegetation of these Mediterranean habitats.

AB  - For any company that sells its products in the networks of city stores, the urgent issue is the optimal delivery of their goods. During routing it is necessary to take into account many restrictions caused by specific conditions of transportation process in the city: number of cargoes, nature of cargoes, delivery time, structure of fleet and its presence, work time of enterprises for load matching, drivers' working hours, loading capacity, road congestion etc. These days, the process of efficient manual routing is difficult because of many restrictions and delivery points wherein it is almost impossible to take into account the road congestion for specific routes. Today's companies are increasingly interested in outsourcing. One of the options for routes planning for enterprises is to use special software products that allow to plan optimal routes according to the chosen criteria and under specific conditions. The process of formation of routes using the Ant Logistics service, based on the Ant Colony optimization algorithm are analysed in the paper. Comparing the two options of forming routes to serve one of the largest retail chains in Kharkiv with the application of Ant Logistics service, it has been elucidated that the application of Ant Colony algorithm is more optimal than the Clarke-Wright algorithm based on delivery routes indicators.

AB  - There is a pressing need for road authorities to take a proactive role in the deployment of automated vehicles on the existing road network. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment characteristics that affect the performance of automated vehicles. In this context, a field test with Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keeping Systems (LKS)-enabled vehicles was conducted in the Netherlands. Empirical data from the experiment was used to estimate the impact of driving environment components such as weather condition and lane width on the performance of the automated vehicles. Driving at night in the presence of streetlights with rain resulted in least detection performance for both the vehicles as compared to other visibility conditions. As for lane-keeping performance, the LKS positioned the vehicle significantly more to the left of the lane on left-curves than on straight sections. The LKS also positioned the vehicle more left on lanes with a width less than 250 cm than on wider lanes. These findings were translated into levels of service of the Operational Design Domain (ODD). Each level of service corresponded to a performance level of the lane assistance systems, classified as "High", "Medium", and "Low", and defined using indicators.

AB  - Droughts have dramatic direct and indirect impacts on vegetation and terrestrial ecosystem stability, including decreases in growth and subsequent decreases in CO2 absorption. Although much research has been carried out on the response of vegetation to droughts, it remains unclear whether biomes are becoming more resistant or more vulnerable to drought. In this study, we used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, a multiscalar drought index) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, an indicator of vegetation growth) to detect the sensitivity of vegetation growth to droughts across 12-24 month timescales and to detect the change in this sensitivity over recent decades. We found that vegetation growth was most sensitive to 17-18 month droughts in water-limited regions, implying pronounce legacy effects from water conditions in previous years. In addition, we detected reduced coupling between drought and vegetation growth, probably caused by release moisture stress in water limited areas. Meanwhile, we observed a shortening of drought timescale to which vegetation most sensitively responded from an average of 18.1 to 17.2 months, suggesting the weakening of the drought legacy effect on vegetation growth. Results of this study contribute to the overall understanding of the resistance and resilience of ecosystems to drought conditions.

AB  - The effect of the built environment on the quality of life of its residents is of growing interest. To investigate this properly. a method for measuring the physical condition of residential areas is required and this paper describes the development of such a tool. The Residential Environment Assessment Tool (REAT) is designed as a survey instrument, to be completed by an independent observer, to produce a contextual measure of a neighbourhood, reflecting both physical aspects and also the extent to which residents have established territoriality over the area. The tool is based on 28 items which are aggregated to give a total score, ranging between 0 and 68, and subdivided into 5 different domains to reflect different aspects of the environment. Inter-observer comparisons show that the tool is reliable, with kappa coefficients for most of the item scores exceeding 0.9. To investigate its validity the results were compared with responses to a detailed survey of individual residents and significant positive associations were found between most relevant items. The tool is being used for studies involving common mental disorders in the community and should be valuable for local authorities in targeting interventions to improve the physical condition of their area.

AB  - This paper presents energy and reliability analyses of eight wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operating in small communities in Ontario, Canada, with rated capacities ranging from 60 to 4,400 m(3)/d. Five different treatment technologies were investigated, namely, rotating biological contactor (RBC), sequencing batch reactor (SBR), membrane bioreactor (MBR), lagoon, and extended aeration activated sludge process (EAAS). Energy benchmarking based on key performance indicators (KPIs) was used to quantify a specific consumption of energy in WWTPs per unit of the pollutant removed. The overall annual electrical energy consumption was correlated to the volume of treated wastewater, the population equivalent, and the amounts of TSS and BOD removed. The RBC plants showed a distinctive advantage for all energy KPI assessed, while SBR plants yielded the highest values of energy KPIs. Analyses of the expected percentage of compliance with discharge standards and the coefficient of reliability (COR) based on WWTPs performance records showed that few WWTPs were able to achieve reliability levels over 95%, considering the mandated discharge standards under the current operating and maintenance conditions. Within each technology, the treatment train, operating conditions, maintenance level, and age of infrastructure were important elements that contributed to the large variability observed.

This article is devoted to the problem of estimating CPS sustainability in the context of modern challenges faced by decision makers and IT developers in order to ensure effective proactive business process management using this innovative technology. The purpose of the research is to propose and substantiate a methodology for estimating CPS sustainability to ensure the reliability and strength of its elements, their interrelationships and interaction, as well as the effective functioning and development of this system in conditions of high dynamism and uncertainty of the external environment. In this study, we used methods of integral evaluation, synthesis, expert assessments, dynamic analysis, and systematic approach, and coined the term 'CPS sustainability'. Our study showed that negative risks, external and internal threats may have a significant adverse impact on CPS sustainability. The reliability of this system should be evaluated on the basis of integrated indicators. The key indicators, reflecting the reliability of maintaining the properties of the CPS in a normal state of its function and further development, were identified. We propose a methodology for estimating CPS sustainability. In general, the presented results form the basis for improving CPS management to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its functioning and development.

AB  - Tackling related climate change impacts and extreme weather events in urban areas located in developing countries is increasingly becoming a challenge for several stakeholders. Responses to such impacts are being framed and addressed by strategies and policies under the climate change adaptation and mitigation frameworks. However, approaching resilience and adaptive capacities are ever more in need in complex neighborhoods, especially when these are facing climate impacts such as flooding. Framing social dimensions into that adaptive capacity in complex urban systems characterized by poverty, exclusion and the poor public services access makes harder their living standards. Thereby, frameworks taking into account social elements and key indicators of inclusiveness, contribute to the understanding of the social fabrics based on the living conditions of disadvantaged localities.
   This special issue explores resilience in the wake of climate-related events such as flooding in neighborhoods with striking social, economic and environmental conditions. Studying the case of the flood-suffering neighborhood of Fredonia in Cartagena, Colombia, will shed light on this particular issue by providing relevant evidence that the levels of climate impacts and hazards occurring in vulnerable urban areas in developing countries, rely on particular social traits that ultimately undermine adaptation efforts for resilience, hence becoming a social problem.

AB  - This paper presents an approach based on the use of transformer no-load and light load current harmonic analysis to detect the presence of an interturn fault at the incipient stage. The presence of fault is detected by performing a trend analysis of specific harmonic components and primary current magnitude. Transformer testing methods suffer from a common drawback of offline nature and require an expert opinion for accurate condition assessment. This paper presents a method that transforms no-load current harmonic analysis, which is a special test for transformer testing, into an online method at light load conditions. Thus, the necessity of complete shutdown and dependency on expert opinion is eliminated since it only requires one reference signature per phase. The proposed approach is verified for different vector groups of the three-phase core-type transformer and three independent units connected in star-star and for a fault on the low-voltage or high-voltage winding of the transformer. The presented experimentation shows that the proposed approach can detect the presence of a fault at an incipient stage involving less than 2% of turns and fault current up to 1 p.u. A case study is presented that validates the method for the transformer of a higher power rating.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that mineral magnetic properties are sensitive indicators of weathering and soil formation (pedogenesis). However, the formation pathways and subsequent alteration mechanisms of specific weathering products are poorly constrained. We report a detailed magnetic investigation through a basalt profile that has been weathered under tropical conditions in South China. The rock magnetic analyses show that hot and humid conditions led to the neoformation of fine-grained magnetite and promoted mineral transformations in the form of maghemitization and hematization. Thus, although the basaltic parent material is rich in titanomagnetite, the final products of the weathering process are maghemite and hematite. Magnetic grain-size varies through the profile, with a combination of pseudo-single domain and single-domain particles at the base, with fining to single-domain in the middle and a mixture of superparamagnetic and single-domain particles in the uppermost profile. Importantly, the magnetic mineral assemblage through the profile is influenced by the mobilization and migration of iron through the sequence. This process is illustrated by concentration-dependent magnetic parameters, which reach maxima at the assembly depth of major and trace elements and minima at the oxic front where Fe content is its lowest.

AB  - Carbonate coatings formed on the lower surfaces of pebble inclusions in the Holocene-Late Pleistocene sediments on the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo Plain have been studied. The coupled analysis of the carbon isotope composition of the soil organic matter and carbonate coatings has indicated the formation of coatings under conditions of phytocenoses with the predominance of C3 plants. A significant effect of the atmospheric CO2 on the carbon isotope composition in the coatings has been noted, which could be related to their formation under low soil respiration rates. The latter was apparently due to the periodic freezing of the soil, which affected the structure of the coatings and was most manifested in the formation of spherulites in their outer layers. The carbonate coatings consist of two laminae significantly differing in their structure and stable isotope composition, which allows separating two main stages of their formation. The lightening of the carbon isotope composition in the outer (younger) layers of the coatings compared to their inner (older) ones coincides with the increase of the delta O-18 values, which points to changes of the environmental conditions in the studied area during the formation of the coatings.

AB  - The extent and intensity of pre-Columbian impacts on lowland Amazonia have remained uncertain and controversial. Various indicators can be used to gauge the impact of pre-Columbian societies, but the formation of nutrient-enriched terra preta soils has been widely accepted as an indication of long-term settlement and site fidelity. Using known and newly discovered terra preta sites and maximum entropy algorithms (Maxent), we determined the influence of regional environmental conditions on the likelihood that terra pretas would have been formed at any given location in lowland Amazonia. Terra pretas were most frequently found in central and eastern Amazonia along the lower courses of the major Amazonian rivers. Terrain, hydrologic and soil characteristics were more important predictors of terra preta distributions than climatic conditions. Our modelling efforts indicated that terra pretas are likely to be found throughout ca 154 063 km(2) or 3.2% of the forest. We also predict that terra preta formation was limited in most of western Amazonia. Model results suggested that the distribution of terra preta was highly predictable based on environmental parameters. We provided targets for future archaeological surveys under the vast forest canopy and also highlighted how few of the long-term forest inventory sites in Amazonia are able to capture the effects of historical disturbance.

AB  - Solar water disinfection is a proven method for household purification of drinking water. Compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) have been used to enhance the inactivation rate of microorganisms. In the present study, a modified CPC with a higher concentration ratio of 1.1 was employed to further speed up the process. A large number of tests were conducted with water samples collected from different naturally contaminated water sources of varying characteristics under natural sunlight. Results indicated substantial reduction in exposure time for complete inactivation of indicator organisms, total coliforms and Escherichia coli, in modified CPCs compared with that in PET bottles at different solar intensity conditions. Even with weak solar intensity conditions (average values <400 W/m(2)), complete inactivation of test organisms could be achieved in all the test waters including those with high initial concentrations (total coliforms -1.1 x 10(6) MPN/100 mL and E. coli - 1.25 x 10(5) CFU/mL) within 6 h of exposure when modified CPC was employed. No regrowth of microorganisms was observed in the modified CPC up to 48 h of storage following exposure. The study thus suggests that the use of modified solar concentrators can result in significant reduction in the exposure time required for complete inactivation of naturally occurring microorganisms.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the sensitivity of 'Pedro Sato' guava to ozone (O(3)), in comparison to the cultivar Paluma, considered sensitive. Eight plants of each cultivar were subjected separately to filtered air and filtered air + O(3) five hours per day, for four days. Photosynthesis (A(sat)), visible foliar injuries, and concentration of anthocyanin and tannin were evaluated. Plants of both cultivars were also exposed, during three months, to environmental conditions at a site polluted by O(3), and growth, photosynthesis, and injuries were evaluated. Plants fumigated with O(3) showed reduction of A(sat) and photochemical activity, besides foliar injury expression. 'Paluma' showed greater reduction of A(sat), severe foliar injury and tannin reduction. When exposed to the polluted environmental conditions, 'Paluma' had higher gas exchange, but showed A(sat) decrease 30 days before 'Pedro Sato'. Growth was not affected in 'Pedro Sato', whose foliar injuries had lower incidence, severity, and precocity than in 'Paluma'. The lower growth rate of 'Paluma' indicates greater O(3) sensitivity. Although the cultivar Pedro Sato responded with less intensity to ozone-induced stress, it cannot be considered tolerant, since it is susceptible to photochemical damage, foliar injuries, and alterations in secondary metabolite content when exposed to this contaminant.

AB  - Citrus sudden death (CSD) transmission was studied by graft-inoculation and under natural conditions. Young sweet orange trees on Rangpur rootstock were used as indicator plants. They were examined regularly for one or two characteristic markers of CSD: (i) presence of a yellow-stained layer of thickened bark on the Rangpur rootstock, and (ii) infection with the CSD-associated marafivirus. Based on these two markers, transmission of CSD was obtained, not only when budwood for graft-inoculation was taken from symptomatic, sweet orange trees on Rangpur, but also when the budwood sources were asymptomatic sweet orange trees on Cleopatra mandarin, indicating that the latter trees are symptomless carriers of the CSD agent. For natural transmission, 80 young indicator plants were planted within a citrus plot severely affected by CSD. Individual insect-proof cages were built around 40 indicator plants, and the other 40 indicator plants remained uncaged. Only two of the 40 caged indicator plants were affected by CSD, whereas 17 uncaged indicator plants showed CSD symptoms and were infected with the marafivirus. An additional 12 uncaged indicator plants became severely affected with citrus variegated chlorosis and were removed. These results strongly suggest that under natural conditions, CSD is transmitted by an aerial vector, such as an insect, and that the cages protected the trees against infection by the vector.

AB  - This study investigates both the methods and the multispecies and functional level effects of a release of a complex hydrocarbon mixture from sediments using a 60-d modified mixed flask culture (MFC) microcosm. Neat Jet-A was injected and mixed into the sediment with one nondosed and three dosed concentrations. Univariate and multivariate statistical and graphical techniques were used to detect patterns in the data. A slow release of the test material from the spiked sediment layer was obtained, and constituents of Jet-A were detected. Functional parameters (such as pH) were generally better at determining treatment groups than structural parameters (population densities). Analysis of the ability of the various parameters to detect treatment differences confirms that there, is not one best indicator for the status of an ecological structure. Transient but statistically significant outcomes were seen at initial treatment concentrations as low as 2 mul/L. The higher concentration treatment groups could be identified as distinguished from nondosed or lower treatments at the end of the 63-d experiment. Each of the three multivariate techniques differed in their ability to distinguish treatment groups during the course of the experiment.

AB  - The bathing water microbiome consists of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. However, the targets of the Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC) focus exclusively on fecal pollution. This study aims to investigate fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), naturally thriving cyanobacteria, and Vibrio bacteria in the Lithuanian coastal Baltic Sea and Curonian Lagoon bathing sites, combining information into an integrated microbial risk assessment scheme. The results show that officially monitored indicators, such as FIB, do not exceed the acceptable 'low' risk threshold. Simultaneously, cyanobacteria and Vibrio cholerae abundance in the Curonian Lagoon sites reveal a 'high' probability of adverse health effects. In coastal bathing sites, a positive correlation was found between Escherichia coli, cyanobacterial harmful algae bloom (cHAB), and V. cholerae, indicating that all target microorganisms may occur at the same time, with consequently high risks for the health of bathers. Therefore, implementing new target organisms in national or even regional bathing water monitoring programs is recommended, in order to safeguard the health of beachgoers.

AB  - Obtaining unculturedEscherichia colifrom natural waters is an important step in the study of microbes in the environment, which are critical for bacterial decay and microbial source tracking. The quality of the samples used can influence the assays, because high contaminant concentrations, differing cell ages, and physiologic states can impair results. The proposed separation is based on a three-step filtration method applied to replicates of seven samples from a sewage plant affluent, collected in different periods. Aliquots of the leachate were inoculated into microcosms, aiming to observe the cultivability of the cells. The assay resulted in colimetry values ranging between 10(4)and 10(5)cells. In the leachate, averages of 1.05% of total coliforms and 1.10% ofEscherichia coliwere recovered from original samples. Although enduring unfavorable temperatures, salinities, and nutritional conditions, the inoculated microcosm populations grew approximately 310 times after 24 h. The final leachate contained cultivable cells in appropriate physiological states and quantities for inoculum in microcosm sets. The bacteria obtained from the leachate were also appropriate for surveys of microbial source tracking, because, in the developed procedure, organisms were separated from contaminants, while cell concentrations were sufficient for inocula.

AB  - Quantifying ecosystem goods and services can help evaluate policies aimed at protecting present and future generations from losing ecosystem benefits. Explicating and quantifying the relationships among risk factors, ecological structure and function, and delivery of ecosystem goods and services requires analytical methodologies that propagate uncertainties. The capabilities of Bayesian networks in generating predictions and accounting for uncertainty are explored with a focus on coral reef ecosystem service assessments. The qualitative aspects of Bayesian networks can be applied to conceptual frameworks developed for coral reef ecosystem service assessments. This is demonstrated using qualitative graphs that describe the relationships between coral reef condition endpoints and benefits from ecosystem services including property protection, recreational opportunities, fish for fisheries, and biochemical metabolites for commercial products developed from reef organisms. Bayesian networks help weigh uncertainties between management decision impacts on stressors and the corresponding delivery of ecosystem services. Quantitative capabilities for inferences are examined in hypothetical scenarios evaluating how decisions affect coral reef ecosystem services and economic benefits and resilience to episodic stress. The described methods facilitate visualizing the potential impacts on ecosystem services from alternative scenarios.

AB  - The relationship between the Palaeolithic-Neolithic cultural transition and environmental changes is important for understanding human history. However, the timing and nature of human behaviour at the transition, and their relationship to local environmental conditions, remain poorly understood. The Yujiagou archaeological site in the Nihewan Basin, northern China, provides valuable chronological and archaeological information about cultural changes in northern China due to its continuous archaeological sequence of cultural layers from the Palaeolithic to Neolithic. In this study, we apply post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) dating on individual feldspar grains to date the Yujiagou deposits. We provide a revised chronology for the archaeological sequence at the site. We combine these results with multi-proxy climatic indicators to gain insights into palaeoenvironmental changes in the region. The results show that the age of the artefact-bearing deposits ranges from 13.5 to 9.7 ka. Polished stones and pottery begin to occur in the archaeological layer around 13 ka, corresponding to a transitional period when the local climate changed from cold to warm. This site provides evidence for understanding the process that led to the regional transition from hunter-gathering to farming.

AB  - Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) was recently found to be the most abundant RNA virus in human feces, and is a plant virus belonging to the genus Tobamovirus in the family Virgoviridae. When in human feces, it is of dietary origin from peppers and their processed products, and is excreted from a large proportion of healthy human populations, but rarely found in animal feces. Over the past decade, this virus has been increasingly attracting research attention as a potential viral indicator for human fecal pollution in aquatic environments and water treatment systems. Results presented in the literature reveal that PMMoV is globally distributed and present in various water sources in greater abundance than human pathogenic viruses, without substantial seasonal fluctuations. Several studies report that increased concentrations of PMMoV tend to be correlated with increased fecal contamination in general, along with more frequent detection of pathogenic enteric viruses. PMMoV also exhibits remarkable stability in water under various environmental conditions. Here, we review recent advancements in our understanding of the occurrence and persistence of PMMoV in natural and engineered water systems and discuss its advantages and limitations as a viral indicator for improved microbial water quality management.

AB  - The new record of a shallow-water submarine hydrothermal field (< 150 m w.d.) in the western Mediterranean Sea (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) allows us to study CO2 fluid impact on benthic foraminifers. Benthic foraminifers calcification process is sensitive to ocean acidification and to local chemical and physical parameters of seawater and pore water. Thus, foraminifers can record specific environmental conditions related to hydrothermal fluids, but at present their response to such activity is poorly defined. The major outcome of this study is the finding of a very uncommon taxon for the Mediterranean Sea, i.e., the Spiculosiphon oceana, a giant foraminifer agglutinating spicules of sponges. This evidence, along with the strong decrease of calcareous tests in the foraminiferal assemblages associated to hydrothermal activity, provides new insights on the meiofauna living in natural stressed environment. In particular, observations obtained from this study allow us to consider S. oceana a potential tolerant species of high CO2 concentrations (about 2-4 times higher than the normal marine values) and a proxy of acidic environments as well as of recent ocean acidification processes.

AB  - This work presents indicators to assess the conservation status of forest patches in fragmented landscapes. However, how can we evaluate the conservation status of forest patches in order to compare it to a hypothetical situation of well-preserved vegetation without human disturbance? It is possible to measure some ecological processes, like nutrient cycling, canopy, edaphic, topographic and hydrological parameters, as well as landscape attributes, and associate them to conservation status. When the attributes of original well-preserved forest are unknown because they are seldom found, it is possible to compare patches by assessing the variability of their attributes. To this end, parameters related to canopy, soil, topography and landscape were analyzed to establish indicators and their integrated analysis was developed to assess the conservation status of forest patches and identify possible causes of shortcomings or obstacles to reach the conservation status. The study area is located in a Semidecidual Forest region, in Brazil. The methodology was developed considering plots distributed in sites within forest patches. The results allowed the identification of patches in different conditions of conservation and provided information of the factors that contribute to this status, in order to help guide and select the most appropriate measures to mitigate degradation and identify forest conservation strategies.

AB  - On Lanzarote (Canary Islands) Quaternary Saharan dust and weathered local volcanic material were trapped in Miocence to Pliocene valleys dammed by younger volcanic edifices. These sediments show sequences of alternating reddish/clayey and loess-like yellowish/silty material. In order to investigate if reddish/clayey layers contain material derived from local pedogenesis and if so, which pedogenetic processes were active, we performed sedimentological, micromorphological and environmental magnetic analyses. The analyses demonstrate that these layers contain material derived from local soils. These soils were characterised by clay formation, rubefication and the formation of superparamagnetic particles during periods of enhanced soil moisture. Thus, they can serve as natural archives in order to reconstruct the terrestrial palaeoclimatic history of Lanzarote. The distribution of soil material in the profiles shows that cold periods of the Late Quaternary were characterised by more humid conditions than today. Using palaeontological remains and a comparison with recent soils on Tenerife, we can roughly estimate maximal palaeoprecipitation values during more humid periods. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report on the presence of lobomycosis-like disease (LLD) and nodular skin disease (NSD) in a community of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) inhabiting the biologically and chemically contaminated Paranagua estuary (Brazil) and on their absence in the community living in the cleaner Cananeia estuary. Prevalence rates of LLD and NSD were 3.9% and 12.6%, respectively, in 103 photo-identified (PI) dolphins from the Paranagua estuary in the period 2006-2007. Adults and calves were affected. Lobomycosis-like lesions may be extensive and form large plaques. Skin nodules were sometimes ulcerated and associated with cutaneous traumas suggesting that traumatic injuries may play a role in the pathogenesis of this condition, In two adult dolphins, NSD evoked the beginning of LLD. In 1996-2007 none of he 200 PI Cananeia S, guianensis had LLD or NSD, a highly significant difference.

AB  - A study of the relationship between benthic macro-invertebrates and water quality parameters, such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO), in a river in Turkey was carried out in order to assess the ecological impact of polluted water discharge into rivers. Five sampling stations were selected on the river; three of them upstream of an industrial and domestic wastewater discharge and two of them downstream. Seven samplings of water and benthic fauna were carried out at the stations fortnightly between March 2004 and June 2004. The kick sampling method was used in collecting benthic macro-invertebrates. The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Trent Biotic Index (TBI), and Chandler Score were used to quantify the conditions of the biota at the study sites. The results of water quality parameter tests and the scores obtained from the indices showed similar responses for pollution. Statistical analysis of the data showed a trend toward gradual pollution in the water, and a peak was observed after domestic wastewater discharge. Hence, the results of the study support the hypothesis that the use of macro-invertebrates as indicator in a water body is an ideal methodology for the assessment of the water quality.

AB  - The paper assesses trends in use of earth observation data in wetland conditions monitoring and assessment in Zimbabwe from 1980 to 2019. Reviewed literature shows academia and research institutions (69.8%), government agencies (14%) and international development partners (16.3%) as the main users of remotely sensed data in wetland ecological assessments and monitoring. There is more reliance by the abovementioned stakeholders on freely available low-cost resolution imagery from Landsat (62.9%) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (14.3%). Other stakeholders, however, are reliant on high-resolution imagery like Rapid Eye (5.7%) and aerial photography (11.4%). Satellite images in wetland management in Zimbabwe are used for land use land cover change detection (42.1%), vegetation health monitoring (21.1%), water quantity monitoring (5.3%), water quality monitoring (13.2%) and wetland mapping (18.4%). The identified challenges faced by different stakeholders to effectively utilise EO data include high cost of high-resolution imageries, limited expertise, inadequate equipment and software. Since the cost of high-resolution satellite imagery mainly constraints the acquisition of suitable satellite data to assess the small wetlands that dominate Zimbabwe's landscape, there is need to promote use of recently launched freely available high-resolution Sentinel data to improve the ecological assessment of wetland conditions.

AB  - Quantitative models that predict stock abundance can inform stock assessments and adaptive management that allows for less stringent controls when abundance is high and environmental conditions are suitable, or tightening controls when abundance is low and environmental conditions are least suitable. Absolute estimates of stock abundance are difficult and expensive to obtain, but data from routine reporting in commercial fisheries logbooks can provide an indicator of stock status. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed using catch per unit effort (CPUE) from commercial fishing in Port Phillip Bay from 1978-79 to 2009-10. Univariate and multivariate models were compared for short-lived species (Sepioteuthis australis), and species represented by 1-2 year-classes (Sillaginodes punctatus) and 5-6 year-classes (Chrysophrys auratus). Simple transfer models incorporating environmental variables produced the best predictive models for all species. Multivariate ARIMA models are dependent on the availability of an appropriate time series of explanatory variables. This study demonstrates an application of time series methods to predict monthly CPUE that is relevant to fisheries for species that are short lived or vulnerable to fishing during short phases in their life history or where high intra-annual variation in stock abundance occurs through environmental variability.

AB  - A differentiated assessment of blood cells and types of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of marsh frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus) living in reservoirs of the Nizhny Novgorod region was performed. The water reservoirs differ by origin, morphology, and chemical composition. The specific abiotic conditions (a peat bog) and anthropogenic load resulted in the most pronounced change in the leukocyte differential count, corresponding to the neutrophilic type of leukemoid reaction, and in an increased micronucleus fraction in the erythrocytes. A moderate positive correlation between the increase in the number of disintegrated micronuclei and the content (mg/L) of nitrites in the reservoir was found (r = 0.72, p = 0.0179). The complex action of high concentrations of technogenic chemical pollutants (copper, chromium, and oil products) caused the activation of erythropoiesis and humoral immunity, which was confirmed by the nature of the leukemoid reaction of a lymphatic type. The cellular and humoral types of immune reaction aimed at self-foreign molecule differentiation provided stability of the frog ontogenesis under anthropogenic pressure. Integral leukocyte indexes, such as the blood cell indicator, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, the lymphocyte-granulocyte index, and the index of leukocyte shift, which reflect the level of the body's general reactivity, can be considered as population markers of the immune status of amphibians.

AB  - Different economic environments differ in their characteristics; this prevents the usage of the same bankruptcy prediction models under different conditions. Objectively, the abundance of bankruptcy prediction models gives rise to the idea that these models are not in compliance with the changing business conditions in the market and do not meet the increasing complexity of business tasks. The purpose of this study is to assess the suitability of existing bankruptcy prediction models and the possibilities to increase the effectiveness of their application. In order to analyze theoretical aspects of the application of bankruptcy forecasting models and frame the research methodology, a systemic comparative and logical analysis of the scientific literature and statistical data, graphic data representation, induction, deduction and abstraction are employed. Results of the analysis confirm research hypotheses that bankruptcy prediction models based on macroeconomic variables are effective in identifying the number of corporate bankruptcies in a country and that the application of the model created on the grounds of macroeconomic indicators together with the traditional bankruptcy prediction model can improve the reliability of bankruptcy prediction. However, it was identified that models which are not specially adapted to companies in the construction sector are also suitable for forecasting their bankruptcies.

AB  - Functionally substituted nitrogen-containing derivatives of alkyl- and alkenylphenols containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments in their structures and having surface-active properties are the subject of systematic research. They find various applications as corrosion inhibitors of metals, biologically active substances, reagents for increasing of oil recovery, ionic liquids, etc. The presence of different reaction centers in their structures that have a various effect on the processes of adsorption and formation of ordered stable systems opens up wide possibilities for targeted regulation of important indicators depending on the structure of the compounds, their concentration and application conditions. The purpose of this article was to establish the surface-active properties of 1-methylene (3-allyl-2-hydroxy-5-octyl-2-phenyl) morpholinium chloride, obtained on the basis of the alkylation product of 2-allyl phenol. In order to determine these properties of the mentioned compound in aqueous solution-air and aqueous solution-hydrocarbons (kerosene) systems and reveal the conditions of micelle formation, laboratory investigations for establishing of the main parameters of the adsorption process depending on the concentration of the compound and structure were carried out. Processing of the obtained results was done using the Shishkovsky and Langmuir equations. The main parameters of adsorption processes and micelle formation indicating the high surface-active properties of the investigated compound were determined

AB  - Planktonic testate amoebae in floodplains exhibit a broad-range of morphological variability. The variation size is already known, but it is necessary to know how this is for morphological variables. This study aimed to identify the relationships between testate amoebae morphology and environmental factors in four neotropical floodplains. We conducted detailed morphometric analyses on 27 common species of planktonic testate amoebae from genera Arcella, Centropyxis, Cucurbitella, Suiadifflugia, Difflugia, Lesquereusia and Netzelia. We sampled subsurface water from each lake in 72 lakes in four Brazilian floodplain lakes. Our goals were to assess: (1) the range of their morphological variability (a) over space within each floodplain, and (b) among the four floodplains, and (c) over time, and (2) which environmental factors explained this variation. Mean shell height and breadth varied considerably among the different floodplain lakes, especially in the Pantanal and Amazonian floodplains. The morphological variability of testate amoeba was correlated to environmental conditions (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, temperature, and depth). Thus, understanding the morphological variation of the testate amoeba species can elucidate many questions involving the ecology of these organisms. Furthermore, could help molecular studies, bioindicator role of these organisations, environmental reconstruction, among others. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - To combat decades of anthropogenic degradation, restoration programs seek to improve ecological conditions through habitat enhancement. Rapid assessments of condition are needed to support adaptive management programs and improve the understanding of restoration effects at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Previous attempts to evaluate restoration practices on large river systems have been hampered by assessment tools that are irreproducible or metrics without clear connections to population responses. We modified a demonstration flow assessment approach to assess the realized changes in habitat quantity and quality attributable to restoration effects. We evaluated the technique's ability to predict anadromous salmonid habitat and survey reproducibility on the Trinity River in northern California. Fish preference clearly aligned with a priori designations of habitat quality: the odds of observing rearing Chinook or coho salmon within high-quality habitats ranged between 10 and 16 times greater than low qualities, and in all cases the highest counts were associated with highest quality habitat. In addition, the technique proved to be reproducible with "substantial" to "almost perfect" agreement of results from independent crews, a considerable improvement over a previous demonstration flow assessment. These results support the use of the technique for assessing changes in habitat from restoration efforts and for informing adaptive management decisions.

AB  - Bioassessments have formed the foundation of many water quality monitoring programs throughout the United States. Like many state water quality programs, Connecticut has developed a relational database containing information about species richness, species composition, relative abundance, and feeding relationships among macroinvertebrates present in stream and river systems. Geographic Information Systems can provide estimates of landscape condition and watershed characteristics and when combined with measurements of stream biology, provide a useful visual display of information that is useful in a management context. The objective of our study was to estimate the stream health for all wadeable stream kilometers in Connecticut using a combination of macroinvertebrate metrics and landscape variables. We developed and evaluated models using an information theoretic approach to predict stream health as measured by macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and identified the best fitting model as a three variable model, including percent impervious land cover, a wetlands metric, and catchment slope that best fit the MMI scores (adj-R (2) = 0.56, SE = 11.73). We then provide examples of how modeling can augment existing programs to support water management policies under the Federal Clean Water Act such as stream assessments and anti-degradation.

KW  - RISK
KW  - MICE
AB  - Consistently at Superfund and other contaminated terrestrial sites, ecological receptors have been chemically exposed for multiple decades by the time risk assessments are conducted. Given that numerous generations of the receptors have lived through the contaminated site condition by the present day, a paradigm shift from risk assessment, where the potential for health effects are forecasted, to a direct, health status assessment scheme for the site-exposed receptor, would seem to be most appropriate. We applied the only such existing direct health status assessment method, Rodent Sperm Analysis (RSA), with small rodents trapped at contaminated sites and at matched noncontaminated reference locations. Reproductive health, ecological risk assessment's endpoint of greatest concern, is targeted with RSA by comparing the sperm parameters of count, motility, and morphology, for each of which it is known how much of a change from a control condition signifies compromised reproductive capability. Given that sperm parameter thresholds were not exceeded in maximally exposed receptors, the data suggest that in the general case, contaminated terrestrial sites do not need cleanups to afford health protection to ecological species, and particularly the larger, wider-ranging, higher trophic level species. Our findings suggest that RSA has the ability to consistently discriminate between clean and contaminated sites, and that the method can allow for as definitive determinations of terrestrial ecological receptor health as are possible, thereby facilitating early site clean-up decisions.

AB  - The concept of predictive microbiology has developed rapidly through the initial phases of experimental design and model development and the subsequent phase of model validation. A fully validated model represents a general rule which may be brought to bear on particular cases. For some microorganism/food combinations, sufficient confidence now exists to indicate substantial benefits to the food industry from use of predictive models.
   Several types of devices are available to monitor and record environmental conditions (particularly temperature). These ''environmental histories'' can be interpreted, using predictive models, in terms of microbial proliferation. The current challenge is to provide systems for the collection and interpretation of environmental information which combine ease of use, reliability, and security, providing the industrial user with the ability to make informed and precise decisions regarding the quality and safety of foods.
   Many specific applications for predictive modeling can be developed from a basis of understanding the inherent qualities of a fully validated model. These include increased precision and confidence in predictions based on accumulation of quantitative data, objective and rapid assessment of the effect of environmental conditions on microbial proliferation, and flexibility in monitoring the relative contribution of component parts of processing, distribution, and storage systems for assurance of shelf life and safety.

AB  - The protection of artistic and cultural heritage is a major challenge due to its peculiarities and its exposure to significant natural hazards. Several methodologies exist to assess the condition of artistic heritage and to protect it from exceptional actions. Moreover, novel digital technologies offer many solutions able to deliver a digital replica of artifacts of interest, so that a reduction in the uncertainties in the analysis models can be achieved. A rational approach to the preservation and protection of artistic heritage is based on traditional approaches supported and integrated by novel technologies, so that qualitative and quantitative indicators of the current condition of artistic heritage can be defined and validated in an interdisciplinary framework. The present paper reports the results of an approach to the maintenance and preservation of art objects housed in a museum complex based on a comprehensive digital path towards a Historical Digital Twin (HDT). A workflow aimed at estimating the stress regime and the dynamic properties of two sculptures, based on the detailed three-dimensional model resulting from a laser scanner survey, is illustrated and discussed. The results highlight the great advantages resulting from the integration of traditional and novel procedures in the field of conservation of artistic assets.

AB  - Diversity metrics, essential for habitat evaluation in conservation, are often based on occurrences records with little consideration of behavioral ecology. As species use diverse habitats to perform different behaviors, reliance on occurrence records alone will fail to reveal environmental conditions shaping the behavioral importance of habitats with respect to resource exploitation. Here, we integrated occurrence and behavioral records to quantify diversity and assessed how environmental determinants shape the behavioral importance of gardens to butterflies across Hong Kong. We conducted standardized butterfly sampling and behavioral observation, and recorded environmental variables related to climate, habitat quality, and landscape connectivity. We found differential responses of diversity and behavioral diversity metrics to environmental variables. Connectivity increased taxonomic richness based on occurrence and flying across records, while temperature reduced richness based on occurrence, settling and interaction records. Floral abundance increased richness based on nectaring records only. No environmental variable promoted the average number of behavioral types observed in each taxon. Our results suggest that connectivity and temperature determine the richness of butterflies reaching gardens, while floral abundance determines whether butterflies use the sites as nectaring grounds via modifying species behaviors. Our study demonstrates the utility in integrating behavioral and diversity data to reveal how environmental conditions shape behavioral importance of habitats.

AB  - The development of urban sustainability indicators has become one of the new topics explored around the world, while cities are growing uncontrollably. The different cities adopt their sustainability assessment indicators according to their local needs and conditions. The current state of sustainability assessment practices depicts that an assessment approach is hardly found in a comprehensive and integrated manner that can meet local conditions, as well as international norms. Historically and traditionally, the city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is one of the oldest and most sacred cities in the world where millions of Muslims gather in this city as a religious pilgrimage throughout the year. The unique form of the city and the gradual increase in the number of pilgrims pose enormous challenges for city dwellers, as well as management authorities. As a result, the development of a sustainability assessment approach has become inevitable to deal with these challenges. This study presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment indicator index for the Holy City of Makkah through the use of an expert opinion method to reach consensus among the experienced researchers in the city. A set of 92 indicators has been formulated among 115 primary sets, with five major aspects, including the physical, socioeconomic, environmental, institutional and spillover, which influence and shape the performance of the city.

AB  - Agriculture is a strategic activity for the society, capable of causing impacts on the environment. Most of the impacts are related to the overuse of synthetic products for pest control and/or chemical fertilization. Sodium phosphite used as a fungicide presents low toxicity under standard laboratory conditions and type test organisms. However, no ecotoxicological tests have been performed to assist in the environmental risk assessment of this substance within a holistic framework. The present study shows the effect of the long-term exposure (60 days) of the fungicide sodium phosphite on the planktonic community, through outdoor microcosm tests. To determine the convenient concentrations to be used in the microcosms, a preliminary monospecific test was carried out with Daphnia magna in the laboratory. Considering its results, the levels of exposure to the microcosms were 5 and 10 mg/L. The results have shown no effect on the zooplankton community structure (taxonomic composition or abundance) associated with treatments. In addition, the community of primary producers, phytoplankton and periphyton, also showed negative response (abundance) under the exposure conditions. Present results indicate that the use of sodium phosphite at these concentrations does not represent a risk for the zooplankton community, however the lack of information about the effects on the phytoplankton structure should make the precautionary principle prevail in the use of this substance.

AB  - This study evaluated the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) status of decomposing roots in three adjacent plantations consisting of one deciduous (larch: Larix leptolepis) and two evergreen (red pine: Pinus densiflora; rigitaeda pine: P. rigitaeda) species planted in the same year (1963) under similar site conditions. The mass loss rates and C and N status of three diameter classes of roots (UF < 2 mm, F 2-5 mm, CF 5-10 mm in diameter) were examined in the upper 15 cm of the mineral soil using in situ buried root bags for 496 days. The remaining mass of decomposing roots was significantly higher for larch (69.0%) than for red pine (59.6%) or rigitaeda pine (59.1%) over 496 days. The mass loss rates of decomposing roots did not differ significantly among the three root diameter classes, but he C and N status of decomposing roots was affected by the tree species. The larch roots showed low C concentrations but high N concentrations, C and N remaining compared to the pine roots over the study period. The results indicate that the substrate quality indicators of roots were not attributed to the mass loss rates, C and N status of decomposing roots in three coniferous tree species grown under similar environmental conditions.

AB  - A reliable geochemical paleo-indicator for phosphorus remains elusive, despite the importance of understanding historical changes in the nutrient status of aquatic ecosystems. We assessed the potential of phytate (salts of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) as a novel phosphorus-specific paleo-indicator by measuring its concentrations in dated sediments from an embayment in Helsinki, Finland, with a known 200-year history of trophic changes. Phytate was extracted in a solution containing sodium hydroxide and EDTA and detected by solution (31)P NMR spectroscopy with spectral deconvolution. Concentrations varied markedly with sediment depth and paralleled previously determined changes in diatom assemblages and geochemical indicators linked to trophic status. In contrast, total sediment phosphorus did not reflect phosphorus inputs to the embayment, presumably due to the mobilization of inorganic phosphate under anoxic conditions during periods of high pollutant loading. Importantly, phytate appeared to be stable in these brackish sediments, in contrast to other organic and inorganic phosphates which declined abruptly with depth. We therefore conclude that phytate represents a potentially important indicator of historical changes in phosphorus inputs to water bodies, although additional studies are required to confirm its stability under conditions likely to be encountered in lakes and coastal ecosystems.

AB  - A field-plot experiment was undertaken to compare the effect of inorganic fertilizer with that of inoculation with an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus intraradices, or with a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium, Pseudomonas mendocina, alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizer, on plant growth and nutrient uptake by lettuce. The influence of the microbial inoculation treatments on soil physical, biochemical and biological properties was also assessed. Two months after planting, fertilizer and inoculation with G. intraradices or P. mendocina had significantly increased shoot and root biomass and foliar nutrient contents (P, Fe). The inoculation with G. intraradices or P. mendocina both increased the soil water-soluble carbohydrates and the percentage of stable aggregates. In this study, we provide the first evidence of the beneficial effect of a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium on soil aggregate stabilization under field conditions. Only inoculation with P. mendocina had a significant effect on the dehydrogenase and phosphatase activities, 21 and 89%, respectively, compared with the control. Inorganic fertilization alone did not increase aggregate stability or enzyme activities in soil, even though this treatment produced the largest increases in mass of lettuce.

AB  - The taxonomic composition of chironomid, cladoceran and diatom assemblages in small lakes in the Alpine serve well and remain identifiable in lake sediments, summer temperature transfer-functions can be developed based on the modem distribution of these organisms and applied to fossil records to reconstruct past summer temperature variability. We provide a summary of the chironomid-, cladoceran- and diatom-based transfer functions available from the Swiss Alps and discuss the potential problem of co-variation between summer temperature and lake nutrient conditions for transfer-function development. Whereas the diatom-based summer temperature transfer function remains to be evaluated in down-core reconstructions, the cladoceran- and chironomid-based transfer functions have been used successfully to produce summer temperature records on Lateglacial and Holocene time scales that are in good agreement with other temperature reconstructions in the Alps. Major problems that can be encountered when using fossil assemblages of aquatic organisms for temperature reconstruction in the Alpine region are biases in the inferred temperatures associated with human impact on lakes and parameters other than temperature affecting the fossil assemblages. A multi-proxy approach to palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is recommended to keep a close control on past catchment and within-lake processes during the time interval of interest.

AB  - The cold-air outbreak of 13-14 January 1998 during the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment was characterized by large positive buoyancy flux and moderate wind shear. Although theory predicts only cellular organization in these conditions, transient-linear organization was observed. Time series of vertical velocity obtained with the Pennsylvania State University 94-GHz vertically pointing cloud radar, which is sensitive to cloud droplets and ice crystals, were used to document the changes in organization that occurred during this wintertime lake-effect event. The cloud radar was deployed on the downwind shore of southern Lake Michigan and measured high-temporal-resolution vertical velocity data at several in-cloud heights. The duration of the event was 18 h, encompassing three cycles of linear organization switching to cellular organization.
   In Part I of this two-part series the authors document the transient nature of the linearly organized convection and evaluate the role of atmospheric conditions in the mode switching between linear and cellular organization. Within the limits of the available measurements, no correlation was found with mean or low-level shear, surface fluxes, or stability parameters. The mode switching in this case does not appear to be controlled by the atmospheric indicators typically associated with linearly organized convection, suggesting that other factors must have played an important role.

AB  - There is a growing interest in replacing fossil-based polymers and composites with more sustainable and renewable fully biobased composite materials in automotive, aerospace and marine applications. There is an effort to develop components with a reduced carbon footprint and environmental impact, and materials based on biocomposites could provide such solutions. Structural components can be subjected to different marine conditions, therefore assessment of their long-term durability according to their marine applications is necessary, highlighting related degradation mechanisms. Through an up-to-date review, this work critically discusses relevant literature on the long-term durability of biocomposites specific for marine environments. Importantly, in this review we report the effects of abiotic parameters, such as the influence of hygrothermal exposures (temperatures and UV radiation) on physical, mechanical and thermal characteristics of biocomposites. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the potential ecotoxicological effects of leaching substances and microplastics derived from biocomposites, as well as the change in mechanical, physical and thermal behaviours correlated to degradation in the fibre matrix interface, surface defects and overall deterioration of the composite's properties. Finally, the combined effects of various environmental exposures on the long-term durability of the biocomposites are critically reviewed.

AB  - Offshore production of oil and natural gas with high carbon dioxide content and high gas-to-oil ratio entail stringent processing conditions that require innovations and first-of-a-kind designs, which bear uncertainties derived from the scarcity of commercial-scale projects, hindering to move along technology learning curves. Consequently, unpredicted scenarios and unachieved specifications cause economic and environmental losses. Such uncertainties force offshore plants to be designed under stochastic factors seeking best statistical performance. The Monte Carlo Method is suitable to such finality. This work proposes a computer-aided engineering framework 'MCAnalysis' automatically applying a probabilistic environmental assessment of offshore gas processing. 'MCAnalysis' integrates HYSYS simulator with 'Waste Reduction Algorithm' to assess potential environmental impacts, whose most relevant categories were identified via Principal Component Analysis. An offshore plant processing natural gas with high carbon dioxide content was submitted to probabilistic raw gas flow rate under two scenarios of carbon dioxide content. The higher carbon dioxide content scenario presented the highest probabilistic potential environmental impacts, being the atmospheric category the most relevant.

AB  - Planktic diatom ecology in the mountain lakes of the northern European Alps has only been studied sparsely so far. To fill this knowledge gap, the driving parameters of planktic diatom assemblage composition in the euphotic zones of twenty lakes located between 955 and 2,060 m a.s.l. were assessed. The mean August water temperature, concentration of major ions, total phosphorous, and lake physical parameters explained significant amounts of variation within the diatom assemblages, as identified by redundancy analysis and consecutive backward selection.Cyclotella comensiswas the most abundant taxon in these oligotrophic (<17 total phosphorus mu g/L), phosphorous (P) limited, stratified study lakes, particularly when the calcium concentration was high (>35 mg/L). The results of generalized linear models and generalized additive models further revealed that August surface temperature, thermocline depth, and nitrate-N positively and significantly influencedC. comensisgrowth. These results shed light on the interplay between physical and chemical parameters as important drivers ofC. comensisabundance in temperate mountain lakes. They may aid in the interpretation of past and the prediction of future climate-driven changes in planktic diatom composition in these lakes.

AB  - Much uncertainty remains about traits linked with successful invasion - the establishment and spread of non-resident species into existing communities. Using a 20-year experiment, where 50 non-resident (but mostly native) grassland plant species were sown into savannah plots, we ask how traits linked with invasion depend on invasion stage (establishment, spread), indicator of invasion success (occupancy, relative abundance), time, environmental conditions, propagule rain, and traits of invaders and invaded communities. Trait data for 164 taxa showed that invader occupancy was primarily associated with traits of invaders, traits of recipient communities, and invader-community interactions. Invader abundance was more strongly associated with community traits (e.g. proportion legume) and trait differences between invaders and the most similar resident species. Annuals and invaders with high-specific leaf area were only successful early in stand development, whereas invaders with conservative carbon capture strategies persisted long-term. Our results indicate that invasion is context-dependent and long-term experiments are required to comprehensively understand invasions.

AB  - Cupric nitrate minerals are rare, but when present may record evidence of past biological activity. The cupric nitrate minerals we examined from localities around the world are broadly divided into four main groups based upon their inferred conditions of formation and delta N-15 values. These groups, named for their probable source of nitrogen, include: 1) termite, 2) bat, 3) atmospheric and 4) coal mine fires and natural gas. It is clear that in three of these categories, the role of past or present biological activity is critical for formation of cupric nitrate minerals. For cupric nitrate minerals associated with an atmospheric source of nitrogen the link is not clear, though a microbial source is possible. Nitrogen isotope analyses of gerhardtite and buttgenbachite mineral pairs from two localities suggest fractionation between these two minerals at ambient temperatures is 1.1 parts per thousand (Australia) to 0.8 parts per thousand (Democratic Republic of Congo). Similarly, differences between delta N-15 values of sal ammoniac and gerhardtite pairs suggest fractionation between these minerals at higher temperatures in coal bed fires is 1.9 parts per thousand (Pennsylvania, USA) to 1.7 parts per thousand (Germany).

AB  - The assessment of the ecological status of the north lagoon of Tunis, a shallow Mediterranean coastal area after its restoration is discussed with respect to different environmental variables as indicators of water quality. Salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and chlorophyll a were determined biweekly from January 2004 to June 2006. After the restoration works, the main changes are the decrease of the residence time of the lagoon's water and the nutrient concentrations. The colonization of the substratum by the seagrass was also observed. The analysis of the data set has indicated that nutrient availability was maintained the year round and was regulated through horizontal lagoon-open sea flux by the inlet-outlet gates. Nitrate dominated slightly ammonium in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool with a percentage contribution of 35-72%, followed by ammonia (16-62%) and nitrites. Dissolved oxygen ranged between 2.8 mg l(-1) and 10.9 mg l(-1) (31% and 118% oxygen saturation respectively). These conditions are sustained by the water circulation system and the short water residence time as confirmed by multivariate analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Explaining Differences in the Environmental Performance of Countries: A Comparative Study

KW  - REGIMES
AB  - What influences countries' environmental performance? Do structural differences alone affect the level of air pollution? Do economic conditions determine water quality? Might society's dominant ideology and values impact national environmental performance? Are different kinds of environmental-performance indicators affected by the same variables? This paper employs comparative empirical analyses of EPI data to address these questions. Doing so enables us to contribute the following five insights to the research literature. First, we propose a conceptual categorization of EP following their health, ecological and global aspects. Second, we demonstrate that social policy, a previously underexplored factor, affects environmental policy and performance. Third, we provide evidence for the role of international engagement in explaining global-related environmental performance. Fourth, our research extends the sample studied beyond the traditional OECD sample to 68 countries with diverse development status. Finally, we demonstrate that the multiple regression models we employed provide high levels of explanatory power (up to 89%). Collectively, the results demonstrate the important role of social policy in explaining differences in the environmental performance of countries. In addition, the differences in the influence of the explanatory variables on each of the proposed category support our theoretical arguments for differentiating between various categories of environmental performance.

AB  - Nanoecology is a new scientific direction in ecology. It has developed as part of the research into particles in the size range from 10(-9) to 10(-6) nm and larger. The particles exist in aqueous, gas, and solid phases and continuously interact depending on the thermodynamic conditions (T, P, pH, Eh) and quantitative phase partitioning. They affect adversely the environment and cause different diseases. Physicochemical simulation predicts the behavioral scenarios of these particles. Using the Selector-C software tool, we first attempted a physicochemical (thermodynamic) simulation of emission of carbon and other nanoparticles in the near-surface atmospheric layer up to a height of 500 m at an average land surface temperature of 15A degrees C and in the lower tropospheric layers at a height of 2-3 km at a temperature of 3A degrees C (at the corresponding pressure levels of 1 bar and 0.79 bar). The simulation was performed by varying the system-contained concentration of carbon dioxide and by estimating its effect on the temperature in accordance with geological processes that occurred on the planet in the periods of its long-term evolution. It was found that the solid particles display fibrogenous activity and carcinogenic properties and are indicators of natural-technical systems.

AB  - Bioluminescence is reported in members of 18 dinoflagellate genera. Species of dinoflagellates are known to have different bioluminescent signatures, making it difficult to assess the presence of particular species in the water column using optical tools, particularly when bioluminescent populations are in nonbloom conditions. A "universal" oligonucleotide primer set, along with species and genus-specific primers specific to the luciferase gene were developed for the detection of bioluminescent dinoflagellates. These primers amplified luciferase sequences from bioluminescent dinoflagellate cultures and from environmental samples containing bioluminescent dinoflagellate populations. Novel luciferase sequences were obtained for strains of Alexandrium cf. catenella (Whedon et Kof.) Balech and Alexandrium fundyense Balech, and also from a strain of Gonyaulax spinifera (Clap. et Whitting) Diesing, which produces bioluminescence undetectable to the naked eye. The phylogeny of partial luciferase sequences revealed five significant clades of the dinoflagellate luciferase gene, suggesting divergence among some species and providing clues on their molecular evolution. We propose that the primers developed in this study will allow further detection of low-light-emitting bioluminescent dinoflagellate species and will have applications as robust indicators of dinoflagellate bioluminescence in natural water samples.

AB  - Portable meters and simplified gas chromatographic (GC) techniques were investigated for monitoring volatile hydrocarbon (HC), CO2, and O-2, concentrations in groundwater, exhaust gases, and soil vapor during in situ remediation using soil vapor extraction (SVE) and air sparging (AS). Results of groundwater samples analyzed in-house using a headspace technique compared well to split samples analyzed by a certified analytical laboratory (r(2) = 0.94). SVE exhaust gas HC and CO2 concentrations measured using a GT201 portable HC/O-2 meter and a RA-4 11A meter (GasTech), respectively, were highly correlated with in-house laboratory GC analyses (r(2) = 0.91). O-2 concentrations fell in a small range and meter analyses were not well correlated with laboratory analyses. Results of soil gas monitoring were not as well correlated as those for exhaust gases for HC, CO2, or O-2, perhaps due to environmental conditions such as changes in relative humidify or the wider range of soil gas values. Overall, the meters were good indicators of vapor contamination, they greatly simplified estimates of total HC mass removal, and they allowed estimates of the biological contribution to contaminant removal during the remediation process.

AB  - The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) includes multiple socioeconomic and demographic indicators related to the risk of obesity. However, it is uncertain how the SoVI input variables empirically affect the individual-level risk of obesity or the mechanisms contributing to the condition via the contextual built environment. This study examines the influence of social vulnerability on individual obesity through county-level built environments, using both individual- and county-level data. The total sample size was 204,610 respondents from 205 counties in the US. We employed two-level structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. The results indicate that counties with high index of Hispanics, African Americans, females, single-parent families, and residents without health insurance were all linked to higher percentages of fast food restaurants and reduced access to exercise opportunities. Furthermore, counties with higher percentages of older adults and population with special needs were positively related to obesity, while wealthier counties and those with larger Asian populations were negatively related to obesity. Our results demonstrate that SoVI variables may be a quality substitute for typical needs assessments, not only for emergency preparedness but also for health prevention.

AB  - In Malaysia, reactive crash statistics have becoming very crucial in evaluating road's safety level and in deciding crash-prone areas known as black spot. The establishments of these statistics normally take years to complete as a result of several well-known setbacks within developing countries. Those obstacles had produced poor crash database having low accessibility, reliability and adequateness of crash data that finally brought major impact to the entire road safety system. In light of that, a proactive safety measure called Road Environment Assessment Program (REAP) has been developed to help evaluating the environment risk factors of a road, calculating the risk index and presented the results through Google Earth platform. REAP was developed based on composite risk index value aggregated from 14 road environment indicators existed in most Malaysia federal roads. Based on the local conditions of the selected roads, specific road environment risk factor were produced where trend and risk level as well as identifications of riskiest road section could be easily identified. REAP is a time-saving and cost-saving tool as it can directly recognize problematic road environment factors while planning on the best and suitable road improvement procedures for problematic sections.

AB  - Efficient optimization of microbial processes is a critical issue for achieving a number of sustainable development goals, considering the impact of microbial biotechnology in agrofood, environment, biopharmaceutical and chemical industries. Many of these applications require scale-up after proof of concept. However, the behaviour of microbial systems remains unpredictable (at least partially) when shifting from laboratory-scale to industrial conditions. The need for robust microbial systems is thus highly needed in this context, as well as a better understanding of the interactions between fluid mechanics and cell physiology. For that purpose, a full scale-up/down computational framework is already available. This framework links computational fluid dynamics (CFD), metabolic flux analysis and agent-based modelling (ABM) for a better understanding of the cell lifelines in a heterogeneous environment. Ultimately, this framework can be used for the design of scale-down simulators and/or metabolically engineered cells able to cope with environmental fluctuations typically found in large-scale bioreactors. However, this framework still needs some refinements, such as a better integration of gas-liquid flows in CFD, and taking into account intrinsic biological noise in ABM.

AB  - Attempts to restore native biodiversity into agricultural landscapes in New Zealand appear to be compromised both by soil nitrogen enrichment from farming and N-leakage to the wider environment. We investigated whether interactions between native earthworms and a native rhizobium-inoculated leguminous shrub (Sophora microphylla) have a measurable effect on the mobility of nitrogen in an agricultural soil that has been nitrogen-enriched and colonised by exotic earthworms. Plants grew better in the presence of both native and exotic soil-burrowing earthworms. Rates of root nodulation were considerably enhanced in the presence of the native megascolecid anecic earthworm Maoridrilus transalpinus. This species consumed more organic matter in the presence of inoculated plants whilst marginally lowering soil pH and enhancing critical concentrations of nitrate, but also reducing nitrous oxide emissions. Earthworms raised dehydrogenase enzyme activity and microbial activity in soil, but this was not commensurate with rates of nodulation. Our results show that some combination of earthworm-mediated soil aeration, modification of moisture conditions in the rhizosphere and drilosphere, and comminution of organic matter, modify microbial communities and significantly impact the N cycle.

AB  - Energy security' has quickly assumed a significant place in the lexicon of policy. Like other handy couplets for characterising socio-natural relations (such as carrying capacity and resource scarcity), energy security is a powerful framing device: it constructs worlds, normalises certain practices of resource use, and establishes grounds for intervention. In this paper, I explore some of the different ways in which energy (in)security is now being used, and reflect on the political work it currently performs. I highlight the historical conditions under which energy and security have become combined, the close association of energy security with crude oil imports, and the imprint that oil has left on the concept. Although geography has tended to interpret practices of security through either a territorial or biopolitical perspective, in this paper I consider how energy's securitisation proceeds through a set of imaginative and calculative practices (referred to here as geo-metrics'). I use the language of world-making' to draw attention to the techno-political practices associated with securitising energy, and their capacity for constituting political ecological relations. I illustrate this with reference to a growing body of knowledge and expertise in the calculation and design of energy security indicators.

AB  - Ecosystem services are ecosystem processes that directly or indirectly benefit human well-being. There has been much recent literature identifying different services and the communities and species that provide them. This is a vital first step towards management and maintenance of these services. In this review, we specifically address the waterbirds, which play key functional roles in many aquatic ecosystems, including as predators, herbivores and vectors of seeds, invertebrates and nutrients, although these roles have often been overlooked. Waterbirds can maintain the diversity of other organisms, control pests, be effective bioindicators of ecological conditions, and act as sentinels of potential disease outbreaks. They also provide important provisioning (meat, feathers, eggs, etc.) and cultural services to both indigenous and westernized societies. We identify key gaps in the understanding of ecosystem services provided by waterbirds and areas for future research required to clarify their functional role in ecosystems and the services they provide. We consider how the economic value of these services could be calculated, giving some examples. Such valuation will provide powerful arguments for waterbird conservation.

AB  - Fagopyrum esculentum commonly named as buckwheat plant is pseudocereal food crops and healthy herbs but is not known as a bioindicator of environmental condition. In the present study, the effects of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles (MPs) on plant growth, bioaccumulation, and antioxidative enzyme activity in buckwheat were estimated under hydroponic culture. The significant biomass reduction at concentrations of 10-2,000 mg/L was 7.7-26.4 % for the ZnO NP and 11.4-23.5 % for the ZnO MP treatment, (p < 0.05). ZnO NPs were observed in root cells and root cell surface by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis. Zn bioaccumulation in plant increased with increasing treatment concentrations. The upward translocation (translocation factor < 0.2) of Zn in plant was higher with the ZnO NP treatment than that with the ZnO MP treatment. Additionally, reactive oxygen species generation by ZnO NPs was estimated as the reduced glutathione level and catalase activity, which would be a predictive biomarker of nanotoxicity. The results are the first study to evaluate the phytotoxicity of ZnO NPs to medicinal plant. F. esculentum can be as a good indicator of plant species in NP-polluted environment.

AB  - This study investigated nitrification performance and nitrifying community in one full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating TFT-LCD wastewater. For the A/O MBR system treating monoethanolamine (MEA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), no nitrification was observed, due presumably to high organic loading, high colloidal COD, low DO, and low hydraulic retention time (HRT) conditions. By including additional A/O or O/A tanks, the A/O/A/O MBR and the O/A/O MBR were able to perform successful nitrification. The real-time PCR results for quantification of nitrifying populations showed a high correlation to nitrification performance, and can be a good indicator of stable nitrification. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) results of functional gene, amoA, suggest that Nitrosomonas oligotropha-like AOB seemed to be important to a good nitrification in the MBR system. In the MBR system, Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB were both abundant, but the low nitrite environment is likely to promote the growth of Nitrospira-like NOB. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sulphur and nitrogen emissions in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) are a threat to regional lentic ecosystems. Benthic macroinvertebrates have been used successfully elsewhere to monitor the impacts of acid emissions on water bodies and the opportunity exists to implement a regional Ionic biomonitoring program in the AOSR. Metrics are open used to assess the impacts of anthropogenic stressors because they describe biological conditions through a variety of measures. The selection of appropriate metrics is an integral component of any biomonitoring program audit depends. on the in situ relationships between it chemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates. In order to establish these relationships we compared lake water chemistry parameters with benthic macroinvertebrate communities and metric scores from 32 lakes in the AOSR through Redundancy Analyses. Lake acidity correlates positively with Hyallelidae and negatively with Chironomidae and Oligochaeta while dissolved organic carbon is also an important determinant of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition. A number of metrics were strongly correlated with lake acidity clad the following compositional metrics proved to be the most suitable for monitoring acidification in the AOSR: % Diptera, % Oligochaeta. % EPT, Total Ephemeroptera and Total Trichoptera.

AB  - Mineral deposits represent extraordinary metal concentrations that form by magmatic, magmatic-hydrothermal or hydrothermal processes in geodynamic environments typified by anomalously high thermal and/or mechanical energy near plate boundaries. As they require the conjunction of specific environmental conditions to form, particular mineral deposit types tend to occupy specific geodynamic niches. The temporal distributions of mineral deposit types reflect both formational and preservational processes. In the Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic, these were linked because of preservation in continental crust connected to thick buoyant subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), but were decoupled by the Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic as a result of evolution to thinner, increasingly dense SCLM. The transition marks a change from mantle plume-influenced plate tectonics to modem-style plate tectonics, with broadly coincident environmental changes and a major impact on the nature and abundance of preserved mineral deposit types. As mineral deposits represent an integral part of tectonic process, they are essential indicators of that process and geodynamic settings, and should be incorporated into any holistic tectonic terrane analysis. Their distribution also provides a particularly critical test on ancient continental reconstructions derived from palaeomagnetic data. Conversely, such reconstructions provide a first-order targeting tool for the conceptual exploration required to discover new mineral provinces and deposits under cover.

AB  - In 1982 diesel fuel migrated from a well lease site into underlying fractured bedrock contaminating the,groundwater-bearing zone approximately 30 m below ground surface. Historical contaminant concentrations, geochemical indicators, and microbiological data were analysed to evaluate natural attenuation, specifically intrinsic bioremediation. Evidence of microbial activity was provided by most probable number (MPN) and commercial biological activity reaction tests (BART (TM)). Laboratory microcosms using groundwater from the site were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with electron acceptor and nutrient amendment to assess microbial activity. Aerobic biodegradation rates were determined by measuring mineralization of C-14-dodecane. Nutrient amendment combined with a higher temperature (28 degrees C) increased the first-order aerobic biodegradation rate to 0.0066 d(-1) from 0.0002 d(-1) at 10 degrees C. Anaerobic biodegradation rates were calculated from depletion of total extractable hydrocarbons (TEH) over 717 d at 10 degrees C. Nutrient addition increased the anaerobic first-order biodegradation rate to 0.0016 from 0.0005 d(-1). Data from these laboratory microcosms indicate that the current slow rates of intrinsic bioremediation may be enhanced with nutrient addition.

AB  - We used developmental instability, water potential, and variable fluorescence to determine if populations of winged sumac (Rhus copallinum) were being negatively effected by military training disturbance. We established nine sites that represented a land-use disturbance gradient with three impact levels (low, medium, and high), the effects mostly due to mechanized infantry training maneuvers. Although mean values of developmental instability, water potential, and variable fluorescence differed significantly among sites, the patterns did not consistently differentiate sites relative to the disturbance gradient. At the population level, some measures of developmental instability and variable fluorescence were positively correlated. All nine sites consisted of habitat mosaics, with the abundance of higher quality habitat patches and canopy gaps closely related to habitat impacts. It may be that R. copallinum is selecting similar micro-environments at all sites and therefore minimizing inter-site variation in stress measures, despite large differences in overall habitat condition. Our results call for caution in developing ecological indicators using the response of physiological and morphological measures from a single plant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pure metallic iron is a common component in extraterrestrial samples (e.g., ordinary chondrite, returned lunar samples), and is thought to be an indicator of extremely reducing conditions. However, tiny pure metallic iron (<1 mm) particles are rarely found in Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite meteorites, and their formation mechanism on Vesta is poorly understood. Sub-micron sized pure metallic iron particles were identified by transmission electron microscope studies of a melt pocket in the basaltic eucrite meteorite Northwest Africa 11592. Our results demonstrate that the pure metallic iron likely formed through a dissociation reaction of ferrous iron (i.e., 3Fe(2+) = Fe-0 + 2Fe(3+)) in pyroxene. Another disproportionation reaction product, ferric iron, was confirmed to be incorporated into Al-rich clinopyroxene in the melt pocket by electron energy loss spectra analyses. The temperature conditions required for the formation of the melt pocket are estimated to be above 1,310 degrees C, as indicated by the crystallization of nano-sized hercynite within acicular plagioclase. Such high temperatures on Vesta could only have been reached if an impact occurred during peak thermal metamorphism, early in the asteroid's evolution. This formation mechanism of these pure metallic iron particles could play a role in redox environment of the Vesta.

AB  - Grasslands are under continuous threat of conversion and subsequent degradation, which has a detrimental impact on grassland productivity and grazing capacity, affecting the livestock industry. Fractional vegetation cover as indicator of grassland condition and productivity has been extensively researched, however, existing approaches and products are limited with respect to accessibility, affordability, applicability, and transferability. This study evaluated the use of publicly available satellite imagery, spectral mixture analysis and cloud geoprocessing technologies for dynamic, continuous, and accurate estimation of FVC for sustainable management. A linear spectral mixture model was developed, calibrated, and implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery. Model accuracy and spatial and temporal transferability were evaluated using existing benchmark products and field data. It was found that Sentinel-2 performed the best using a feature combination of the SWIR2 band and the NDVI, EVI, MSAVI2 and DBSI indices. Accuracies were further improved by dividing the woody and bare endmembers into subclasses. The approach proved both spatially and temporally transferable, thus this research provides a robust approach to FVC estimation using limited field data and open source remote sensing imagery. The combination of this research with further grassland productivity modelling could prove valuable for sustainable environmental and economical rangeland planning and management.

AB  - In both Brazilian and European regulations, the impact assessment of sewage discharges into coastal waters is based on microbiological analyses of fecal indicators such as Escherichia coli, frequently used in prevision hydrodynamic models. However, the decay rates of E. coli vary depending on environmental conditions, and analysis may lead to inaccurate conclusions. This study aimed to analyze the decay of culturable and viable (but not culturable) E. coli in outdoor conditions, by creating microcosms inoculated with pre-treated sewage. The microcosms were filled with 9.88 L of filtered water (0.22 mu m membrane), 3.5% salt, 0.1-0.2% BHI, and 1% bacterial suspension obtained by reverse filtration. PMA-qPCR of E. coli uidA gene and Colilert measurements were applied to evaluate population counts after 2 h, 4 h, and 26 h. After nine hours of exposure to solar radiation, the viable cells decreased to 2.76% (interpolated value) of the initial population, and the cultivable fraction of the viable population accounted for 0.50%. In the dark period, the bacteria grew again, and viable cells reached 8.54%, while cultivable cells grew to 48.14% of initial population. This behavior is possibly due to the use of nutrients recycled from dead cells. Likewise, populations of E. coli in sewage outfalls remain viable in the sediments, where resuspension can renew blooming.

AB  - In the 19th century, the Russian empire, along with European countries, first encountered cholera. Regular outbreaks of cholera with a high mortality rate were an indicator of the sanitary ill-being of populated areas. A particularly unfavorable situation with morbidity and sanitary conditions was in cities where water bodies and the territory had been systematically polluting by household waste. The question about the urban crisis caused by sanitary and living conditions was raised at the Russian's medical congresses 1890-1910s, which indicated the severity of this socio-environmental problem. This issue is given extensive attention in modern historical research on social history, the history of social medicine, environmental history, and urban history. The article is devoted to the analysis and generalization of modern research on the history of solving socio-environmental problems caused by cholera epidemics in European and Russian cities, as well as identifying possible prospects in this research area. The research's relevance is due to the growth of social tension in cities and the increased interest of the scientific community in similar problems in the historical past. The research's results allowed us to reveal the role of urban communities in the institutionalization of sanitary surveillance and solvation local socio-environmental problems.

AB  - Foraminiferal reproduction and preservation have been studied in Holocene tidal flat sediments of Bahia la Choya, Sonora, Mexico (northern Gulf of California). Foraminiferal reproduction at Choya Bay tends to occur in discrete ( similar to a few weeks) seasonal pulses, which are then followed by periods of homogenization and dissolution of several months duration. Foraminiferal number (number of tests/gram sediment) increases northward across the flat primarily because of decreasing intensity of bioturbation and increasing total carbonate weight percent (shell content) of sediments.
   Despite intensive dissolution of foraminiferal reproductive pulses, tests which appear to be relatively fresh are actually quite old (up to similar to 2000 years based on C-14 dates). We hypothesize that after reproduction some tests survive dissolution because of rapid advection (burial) downward by conveyor belt deposit feeders (e.g., callianassid shrimp, polychaete worms) into a subsurface shell layer, where tests are preserved until exhumation much later by biological activity or storms. Thus, taphonomic grade (surface condition) of foraminiferal tests in these sediments is not an infallible indicator of shell age (time since death). The condition of the test surface is indicative of the residence time of the test at the sediment-water interface (''taphonomically active zone'') and not test age.

AB  - The condition of the natural environment, including breathable air, indicates that actions are to be taken related to the reduction of exhaust emissions from transport. One of the sectors of transport is aviation. The reduction of emissions is tightly related to the types of fuels in this sector of transport. In the paper, the authors propose the application of a new generation of jet fuels. A full exploration of the physicochemical properties of these fuels requires research under actual engine operation. The conducted research pertains to the autoignition of modified jet fuels in terms of the thermodynamic indicators and optical analyses of the early phase of flame development. The investigations were conducted using a Rapid Compression Expansion Machine with a simultaneous recording of images using a high-speed camera. Owing to this technique, the authors could assess the thermodynamic properties and analyze the early flame development processes. The investigations enabled the assessment of fuel properties indicating an increased delay of the autoignition process compared to the reference fuel (diesel fuel). The performed analyses have confirmed a huge role of modern fuels (including HEFA in particular) in contemporary aviation-significant delay of autoignition at a simultaneous significant formation of autoignition spots and high intensification of combustion.

AB  - Caves are extreme environments inhabited by microbial communities adapted to thrive oligotrophic conditions. Cave microbes are organised in complex ecological networks and have developed survival strategies involving the production and release of a large variety of secondary metabolites, including antibiotic-like compounds. In this study, the structure and the metabolic features of a biofilm-like microbial community lining the walls of a pristine karst cavity (the Yumugi river cave) located in a remote region of the Western New Guinea were investigated. 16S rRNA and shotgun sequence analyses highlighted the prevalence of chemoorganotrophic phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria), consistent with metabolic predictions inferred from the cave metagenome analysis. Few clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes were detected. A culturebased approach allowed the isolation of some heterotrophic members of the bacterial community, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed an overall high level of resistance to different antimicrobials classes. Isolates presumptively representing new uncharacterized members of genus Pseudomonas displayed interesting antibiotic properties against Gram-positive indicator strains.

AB  - Current projections suggest that climate warming will be accompanied by more frequent and severe drought events. Peatlands store ca. one third of the world's soil organic carbon. Warming and drought may cause peatlands to become carbon sources through stimulation of microbial activity increasing ecosystem respiration, with positive feedback effect on global warming. Micro-eukaryotes play a key role in the carbon cycle through food web interactions and therefore, alterations in their community structure and diversity may affect ecosystem functioning and could reflect these changes. We assessed the diversity and community composition of Sphagnum-associated eukaryotic microorganisms inhabiting peatlands and their response to experimental drought and warming using high throughput sequencing of environmental DNA. Under drier conditions, micro-eukaryotic diversity decreased, the relative abundance of autotrophs increased and that of osmotrophs (including Fungi and Peronosporomycetes) decreased. Furthermore, we identified climate change indicators that could be used as early indicators of change in peatland microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. The changes we observed indicate a shift towards a more "terrestrial'' community in response to drought, in line with observed changes in the functioning of the ecosystem.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticusandVibrio vulnificuscan be found in oysters in coastal environments.Vibrio vulnificuscan induce life-threatening illness when ingested with oysters, whileV. parahaemolyticususually causes self-limiting gastroenteritis. This study investigated correlations between concentrations of theseVibriospecies in Pacific oysters from eight New Zealand coastal regions (2008-2017), and seawater surface temperature (SST), salinity and rainfall. In the pooled data, most (88%) of the oyster samples were collected during summer and autumn. The prevalence ofV. parahaemolyticusandV. vulnificuswas 85% and 15%, respectively.Vibrio vulnificuswas always detected in the presence ofV. parahaemolyticus. Across all regions,V. parahaemolyticusconcentration positively correlated with SST (r(S) = 0.60), but not with salinity (r(S) = -0.01).Vibrio vulnificusconcentration weakly correlated with SST (r(S) = 0.26) and salinity (r(S) = -0.21). Linear and generalised additive models were investigated but none were satisfactory for prediction. Salinity and SST explained < 50% of the variability inV. parahaemolyticusconcentrations, indicating that other environmental or biological factors contributed. When SST, salinity and rainfall 15 days prior to harvesting were investigated for one region, SST was the best pre-harvest indicator for elevated concentrations of bothVibriospecies.

AB  - Two main aspects of the study of diversity can be distinguished: the first is related to the inventory of living organisms, the second is related to the organization of life at the level of biotic communities. Quantitative assessment of diversity is two-components as the richness of elements and their evenness. A model of the ecosystem continuum is proposed. The greatest indicators of diversity should be expected in the middle part of the environmental gradients with temporal stability. Study of producers and consumers in water bodies of Ukraine showed a regular change in their community structure in the gradient of saprobity indices. The decreasing of community diversity estimated by the Shannon index and by species richness was found at both high and low values of the saprobity indices. The fundamental coincidence of the empirical point fields of the Shannon index for the communities of invertebrates and phytoplankton with the field points of the empirical model indicates the universality of the bimodal distribution of diversity indicators in the trophic gradient. It is shown that the estimates by zoobenthos overestimate organic pollution compared with the calculations of the same indicators by phytoplankton.

AB  - The Integrated Marine Observing System National Reference Station network provides unprecedented open access to species-level phytoplankton and zooplankton data for researchers, managers and policy makers interested in resource condition, and detecting and understanding the magnitude and time-scales of change in our marine environment. We describe how to access spatial and temporal plankton data collected from the seven reference stations located around the Australian coastline, and a summary of the associated physical and chemical parameters measured that help in the interpretation of plankton data. Details on the rationale for site locations, sampling methodologies and laboratory analysis protocols are provided to assist with use of the data, and design of complimentary investigations. Information on taxonomic entities reported in the plankton database, and changes in taxonomic nomenclature and other issues that may affect data interpretation, are included. Data from more than 1250 plankton samples are freely available via the Australian Ocean Data Network portal and we encourage uptake and use of this continental-scale dataset, giving summaries of data currently available and some practical applications. The full methods manual that includes sampling and analysis protocols for the Integrated Marine Observing System Biogeochemical Operations can be found on-line.

AB  - Izmir Bay coasts are likely to face increasing pressures and growth of demand for infrastructures, e.g. port, marinas, transport and waste-water treatment facilities since 1970s. This study reflects characteristic features of coastal regions in Izmir Bay and the impacts of human activities between 2015 and 2017. The eutrophication status of coastal zones was assessed using different tools such as the trophic index, eutrophication index, Turkish legislation about eutrophication and Redfield ratios. Low anthropogenic impact is detected from the high DIN:P, Si: P and low DIN: Si ratios in Urla and Guzelbahce indicating that P-limited areas. Nutrient loadings cause to the increase of DIN: Si ratio and decrease of Si: P ratio, thus the ecosystem can be defined as Si limited coasts in Sahilevleri, Inciralti, Goztepe, Karatas, Pasaport, Bayrakli, Karsiyaka. Mavisehir was characterized with high eutrophication problem due to surplus of P and Si. Additionally, maximum E. coli were found in Goztepe, Bayrakli, Karsiyaka while the highest Intestinal enterococci were obtained in Goztepe, Sahilevleri, Karsiyaka. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The negative impact of strong sympathetic arousal on dexterous performance during formal surgical training is well-known. This study investigates how this relationship might change if surgical training takes place as a hobby in an informal environment. Fifteen medical students volunteered in a 5-week training regimen and weekly performed two standardized microsurgical tasks: circular cutting and simple interrupted suturing. Time was taken and two independent reviewers evaluated the surgical proficiency. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaires measured subjective anxiety and workload, respectively. A high-resolution thermal imaging camera recorded facial imagery, from which a computational algorithm extracted the perinasal perspiration signal as indicator of sympathetic arousal. Anxiety scores on STAI questionnaires were indifferent for all five sessions. The continuously measured arousal signal from the thermal facial imagery was moderate and did not correlate with surgical proficiency or speed. Progressive experience was the strongest contributor to improved skill and speed, which were attained in record time. It appears that dexterous skill acquisition is facilitated by the absence of strong arousals, which can be naturally eliminated in the context of informal education. Given the low cost and availability of surgical simulators, this result opens the way for rethinking the current practices in surgical training and beyond.

AB  - Nowadays, it is important to understand how to combine energy efficiency and the point of view of resilience. Regarding buildings, resilience represents the ability to recover from or adapt to an unfavorable condition or event, maintaining their own functionality and performances. This issue has been ignored for several years, especially in building sector, but the impacts of natural hazards and climate change are becoming more and more influential and frequent. Moreover, urban areas are responsible of a great part of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in addition to the intensification of greenhouse effect. For this reason, the use of new technologies (PCM and cool materials) for buildings can affect not only indoor microclimate, but also urban environment. Starting from the dynamic simulations of common buildings in South of Italy and then in other hotter Mediterranean climate (Athens, Tunis), the research analyses various typologies of these materials and possible combined applications. The aim of the study is to understand, through a set of proper indicators, how they can contribute to enhance energy performance of buildings and climate resilience in order to face rising temperatures also at neighbourhood level.

AB  - We used zooplankton communities as indicators to evaluate the potential influence of acidifying-eutrophying emissions from the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) on 244 downwind lakes in northwest Saskatchewan. The impacts of regional environmental change on zooplankton communities are determined by responses of resident species to altered local environmental conditions as well as changes in composition due to dispersal processes. To test and quantify the relative importance of these individual processes, we conducted ordination analyses, spatial modeling, and variation partitioning. Local environmental factors were the dominant determinants of community structure, including two major environmental gradients susceptible to atmospheric emissions (i.e., acid-base status and productivity). Spatial structuring of these factors induced similar spatial structures in zooplankton distribution across the region. However, disentangling any impacts of the AOSR on these environment-spatial-species relationships from the underlying natural variability was precluded by unavailability of baseline data. Nevertheless, as our findings indicate that dispersal of zooplankton was not strongly limiting across this broad geographic region, zooplankton indicators can be crucial to detect future environmental changes in lakes across northwest Saskatchewan.

AB  - For lichen epiphytes the loss of trees from a site represents a complete break in the availability of their primary habitat. Epiphytic species are therefore expected to provide powerful indicators for the ecological continuity of woodlands. Suites of lichen indicators have been developed in a semi-quantitative way, and represent working hypotheses which are cautiously interpreted against site-specific conditions by expert field biologists. Here, we test the utility of lichen indicators in a more generic fashion, by attempting to falsify the null hypothesis that the occurrence of lichen indicators is unrelated to variation in woodland continuity. We compared the association of recommended lichen indicators with woodlands in different continuity classes, after adjusting for sampling bias. We demonstrated differences in accuracy for contrasting sub-groups of indicators related to their biogeography; a sub-group of 'western' indicators tended to be more strongly associated with long-continuity woodland compared to an 'eastern' indicator sub-group. Our results underpin the need for further research into the fundamental biology which explains the value of indicators, before these tools can be applied generally and independently of expert-led opinion in a site-specific context.

AB  - The ecological quality status (EcoQ) of intertidal mudflats constrained by Pacific oyster farming was assessed by single (H', AMBI, BENTIX and BOPA) and multimetric (M-AMBI and average score) index approaches in the Pertuis Charentais (SW France). Fifteen sampling stations were monitored seasonally for sedimentological features and macrozoobenthos in 2004. Sediments affected by oyster biodeposits showed organic matter enrichment, and sediments from off-bottom Culture sites had higher organic matter contents and lower redox potentials than sediments from on-bottom culture sites. Biotic indices consistently registered responses of macrozoobenthos to organic enrichment but there was only partial agreement between single index-derived EcoQs. The average score was better than M-AMBI and single indices for determining EcoQs. Accordingly, oyster farming alters intertidal macrozoobenthic assemblages moderately, and off-bottom cultures cause more disturbance than on-bottom cultures. Hydrodynamics and seasons may interact with culture practices in smothering/strengthening biodeposition-mediated effects through dispersal/accumulation of biodeposits. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A multiple objective mixed integer linear programming model for power generation expansion planning
T2  - ENERGY
LA  - English
AB  - Power generation expansion planning inherently involves multiple, conflicting and incommensurate objectives. Therefore, mathematical models become more realistic if distinct evaluation aspects, such as cost and environmental concerns, are explicitly considered as objective functions rather than being encompassed by a single economic indicator. With the aid of multiple objective models, decision makers may grasp the conflicting nature and the trade-offs among the different objectives in order to select satisfactory compromise solutions. This paper presents a multiple objective mixed integer linear programming model for power generation expansion planning that allows the consideration of modular expansion capacity values of supply-side options. This characteristic of the model avoids the well-known problem associated with continuous capacity values that usually have to be discretized in a post-processing phase without feedback on the nature and importance of the changes in the attributes of the obtained solutions. Demand-side management (DSM) is also considered an option in the planning process, assuming there is a sufficiently large portion of the market under franchise conditions. As DSM full costs are accounted in the model, including lost revenues, it is possible to perform an evaluation of the rate impact in order to further inform the decision process.

AB  - The forest composition we witness today is a product of temporal anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic disturbances. Scholars from geography, anthropology, and other disciplines have long been aware of the informing nature of spatial relationships: human actions in a previous time often leave imprints in today's landscape. Traditional empirical studies of forest condition typically ignore this type of information and rely on aggregated forest-level indicators developed from aspatial plot-level analyses. This paper conducts a spatial analysis of one important forest product species, Shorea robusta, in a foraging setting in southern Nepal. Forest plot locations were located using Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) and were processed using a Geographic Information System. Three rival hypotheses of the geographic distribution of Shorea robusta are presented: (1) a pattern of no human disturbance, (2) a pattern of open access and optimal foraging, and (3) a pattern of optimal foraging altered by the geographic configuration of enforced institutions. Multivariate regression models are estimated and optimal foraging patterns are identified. Statistical tests lend support to the third hypothesis. Methods such as the ones presented here are important if we are to better understand the geographic implications of institutional design on human behavior and the environmental outcomes that result.

AB  - The analysis of only single landscape attributes, like land use pattern, landscape elements, habitat structures, species and biocoenoses at different times is not sufficient to grasp the character of landscape change, especially with regard to the functional aspects. For this, the approach of land evaluation with the help of landscape functions and natural potentials is much more suitable. The assessment of landscape functions is also a supposition to formulate ecological targets of landscape development, on the conditions of landscape changes which continuously increase. The investigation took place within two rural test areas in the hilly zone of Saxony (Germany). At least twice (as a rule in the thirties and the eighties) the following landscape functions were assessed: biotic productivity, resistance of soils to water erosion, water retention capacity, recharge and protection of ground water, and potential for recreation within nature. The special methodologies (including advantages and shortcomings) are described, the past and present situations in the test areas are characterized, and the tendencies of the development are outlined. Additionally, an approach (a decision tree) for the elaboration of landscape-ecological targets and measures is presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) were evaluated in the allohexapolyploid wheat seedling assay developed by Redei and Sandhu (1988), for its ability to induce aneuploidy and/or small chromosome deletions. The wheat strain used (Neatby's virescent) is homozygous for a pair of recessive alleles (v1) present on chromosome 3B and produces virescent seedlings grown at temperatures below 26-degrees-C. When the developing embryos are treated with a test chemical, loss of chromosome 3B or its segment bearing the v1 allele in a progenitor cell produces a green sector in the leaf, whereas a gain of this chromosome induces a white sector. ENU and 4NQO induced dose-dependent increases in the frequency of leaf sectors at concentrations ranging from 0.128 to 1.280 mM and 0.052 to 0.263 mM, respectively. The assay is very simple and can be employed for evaluating the genetic potential of chemicals in a laboratory as well as for in situ hazards assessment under natural environmental conditions.

AB  - In the horticultural zone of Quibor, Lara State, Venezuela, cultivation of furrow irrigated onion has been applied as a conventional management system, although changes are currently being implemented in horticultural production, such as the move towards the conventional system of cultivation of super sweet corn, which could affect the soil. The objective of this work was to evaluate, using multivariate analysis, the level of degradation that might exist in the soil of the two productive systems. A large-plot experiment was applied by sampling in a 10 x 10 grid in the soils of both production systems. At each sampling point, soil samples were taken in three strata (0-5, 5-18 and 18-50 cm deep) and we measured the following attributes: chemical (pH, EC, macronutrient content, CEC and total nitrogen); physical (texture, particle size distribution, apparent density, total porosity, macro and micro-porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability), and biological (basal respiration, microbial biomass, metabolic coefficient and the microbial carbon-organic carbon ratio). The principal component analysis allowed to define the chemical, physical, chemical and biological attributes that best reflected the degradation conditions in each soil. Important degradation conditions were found in both soils, which are related to the intrinsic and management characteristics of each productive system.

AB  - Methods that can be used to check the health of fish, determine their physiological condition and detect abnormalities at an early stage, have been attracting recent attention. The health of fish can be determined by the assessment of stress responses, prediction of spawning time, and highly sensitive detection of bacteria that cause diseases in fish, etc. However, it can be difficult to accurately measure these parameters due to factors such as sampling errors, uncontrollable aquaculture conditions and unsound methodological approaches. Also, the methods currently used are time-consuming and may involve complicated processes. Thus, there is a high demand for novel approaches for the assessment of fish health. We have thus focused on the development of a biosensor to measure target factors of fish health by combining biocatalytics and electronics technology. We believe that this technology can greatly improve the assessment of the health of fish produced for consumption. In this article, we described various biosensors that can both rapidly and easily measure indicators of fish health. Future applications of these techniques are also discussed.

AB  - The biogeographic pattern of single-celled eukaryotes (protists), including ciliates, is poorly understood. Most marine species are believed to have a relatively high dispersal potential, such that both globally distributed and geographically isolated taxa exist. Primary occurrence data for three large, easily identified ciliate species, Parafavella gigantea, Schmidingerella serrata, and Zoothamnium pelagicum, and environmental data drawn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's World Ocean Atlas were used to estimate each species' spatial and environmental distributions using Maxent v3.3.3k. The predictive power of the models was tested with a series of spatial stratification studies, which were evaluated using partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics. Differences between niches occupied by each taxon were evaluated using background similarity tests. All predictions showed significant ability to anticipate test points. The null hypotheses of niche similarity were rejected in all background similarity tests comparing the niches among the three species. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of environmental conditions associated with three species of ciliates and a first estimate of their spatial distributions in the North Atlantic, which can serve as a benchmark against which to document distributional shifts. These species follow consistent, predictable patterns related to climate and environmental biochemistry; the importance of climatic conditions as regards protist distributions is noteworthy considering the effects of global climate change.

AB  - Transmission network control and protection system can be enhanced using synchrophasor measurement data. Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) systems incorporate three levels of protection functions. The first layer is the basic relay protection, the second layer is the central system protection with wide area protection functions (WAP) and the final layer is the power system control level. Centralized protection can use new methods based on synchrophasor data. The phasor data benefits protection functions of both the second and the third layer. Therefore, to investigate the operation of the different protection functions in a centralized system, a multifunctional Matlab simulation environment is developed and presented in this paper. The model is developed using the experience from the real-time operation and was additionally expanded with new function sets that are also described. Real-time operation measurements from various disturbances are used to validate the model. Validated model is then applied to perform a series of simulations of various events in different conditions in the transmission network, such as breaker operation, short circuit faults and power oscillations. Conducted simulations provide foundations and indicators for the development and definition of criteria needed to implement enhanced central protection system resilient to all disturbances.

KW  - PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION
AB  - Previous studies of long-term outcome for personality disorder (PD) were either retrospective in design or did not include a control condition. In this paper we report results for three PD cohorts (N = 111) treated in two different specialist psychosocial programs (step-down and long-term inpatient) and in general psychiatric treatment as usual (TAU), which were prospectively followed up for 72-months after intake. The three PD samples were compared on symptom severity, social adjustment, global functioning and other clinical indicators (self-mutilation, parasuicide and readmission rates) at intake, 6, 12, 24, and 72 months. Results indicated that a specialist step-down model showed significantly greater change than a purely inpatient model and TAU in most key dimensions of functioning, a difference maintained at 72-months follow-up. Improvement in the samples was not associated with amount of intercurrent treatment received in the year prior to the follow-up assessment. This study confirms that a step-down program retains significant improvement associated with a specialist psychosocial approach for PD. However, this conclusion should be qualified by design limitations. The samples were not randomly allocated to the three conditions and the naturalistic geographical allocation used in the study created a potential for a number of confounds. Whilst we used extensive statistical controls, the possibility that the differences found between the groups may be due to population differences cannot be discounted.

AB  - The dynamics of organic carbon (OC), turbidity, faecal indicator bacteria and physicochemical parameters was studied in a karst system near Yverdon, Switzerland. Online measurements and sampling were done at a swallow hole draining an agricultural surface (the input), and two groups of springs (the outputs) that often show bacterial contamination. A fluorescent tracer that was injected into the swallow hole during low-flow conditions first arrived at the springs 10-12 days after injection; the total recovery rate was 29%. Previous tracer tests during high-flow conditions gave shorter travel times. After a major rainfall event, a primary turbidity peak was observed at the springs. It coincides with the rising limb of the hydrograph, indicating remobilisation of autochthonous particles from the aquifer. A secondary turbidity peak occurs several days later, suggesting the arrival of autochthonous particles from the swallow hole. Wider peaks of OC and bacteria were observed simultaneously. Applying methods from molecular microbiology (PCR-DGGE) allowed characterisation of the bacterial communities at the swallow hole and the springs. The results demonstrate that the swallow hole is an important source of groundwater contamination, while its contribution to aquifer recharge is insignificant. OC appears to be a better indicator for bacterial contamination than turbidity.

AB  - Exposure to water-borne pollutants, environmental stressors and pathological agents of a crustacean capable of osmoregulation usually results in a decrease of its Na+ and Cl- regulation and/or of its osmoregulatory capacity (OC: difference between the osmotic pressures of the hemolymph and of the external medium, at a given salinity). The partial or complete loss of osmoregulatory and ionoregulatory capacity is generally linked to disruptions of the osmotic and ionic regulations. Different causes of these variations include alterations in the structure and ultrastructure of the branchial and excretory organs and changes in Na+, K+-ATPase activity, ionic fluxes and surface permeability.
   OC appears therefore as a nonspecific bioindicator. Hyper-OC and/or hypo-OC can be measured according to the type of osmoregulation of the species, respectively, in low-salinity media and in seawater or high-salinity media. Provided several precautions are taken (control of salinity and temperature, size, nutritional status, developmental stage, molt stage, use of controls), measurement of OC variations is proposed as a convenient and reliable way to monitor the physiological condition and the effect of stressors in crustaceans.

AB  - While biomagnification of certain organic contaminants in food chains has been observed in field studies, the mechanism of the biomagnification process is still unresolved. Knowledge of the mechanism by which contaminants are absorbed and biomagnified in food chains is important in environmental risk assessment and studies of chemical bioavailability. In this study, we hypothesize a fugacity based model of the gastrointestinal absorption of contaminants. We test the model in a 73 day laboratory, gastrointestinal magnification study of 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexachlorobiphenyl in adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and in a field study of the gastrointestinal magnification of PCB congeners in rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris). Both studies show that the fugacity of the test chemicals in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) can increase to levels up to 7-8-fold greater than those in the consumed food. The fugacity increase in the GIT is the result of a drop in the chyme's fugacity capacity for the test chemicals (i.e. approximately 4-fold in this study) and an increase in chemical concentration due to food absorption in the GIT (i.e. approximately 2-fold in this study). Food digestibility and absorption are found to be critical factors controlling biomagnification factors and dietary uptake efficiencies under laboratory and field conditions.

AB  - Several methods and criteria to evaluate and assess quarry restoration are available in the scientific literature, but they are very specialized and time consuming. Furthermore, there is a lack of evaluation tools appropriate for technicians involved in these types of activities, such as quarry engineers, restoration managers and quality control supervisors in public administration. The work presented attempts to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practical needs by proposing a simplified methodology (RESTOQUARRY protocol), which enables the non-scientific public to evaluate restored areas. This procedure focused on five groups of parameters for zone (homogeneous portions within the whole restored area) evaluation: geotechnical risk, drainage network, erosion and physical degradation, soil quality and vegetation status and functionality. Moreover, three groups of parameters are proposed for area (whole restoration) evaluation: landscape integration, ecological connectivity and fauna, and anthropic impacts. This protocol has been tested in 55 open-pit mines located throughout Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), covering a wide range of Mediterranean climatic conditions and geological substrates. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is suitable for detecting critical parameters that can determine the success of the restoration.

AB  - Impervious surface (IS) area is an important indicator of ecological environment condition in the basin. We propose an index for IS extraction [i.e., enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI)] by integrating the spectrum character of Landsat-operational land imager (OLI) images, and an automatic threshold selection method using the generalized Gaussian model. Dianchi and Erhai Basin are employed as study areas to test the ENDISI method at the plateau basin scale. The results show that: (1) the ENDISI can reduce the impacts of arid land, bare rock, and bare soil on IS extraction effectively; (2) ENDISI had a much higher separability degree between ISs and pervious surfaces compared with normalized difference built-up index, modified normalized difference IS index, and combinational biophysical composition index; and (3) the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values of IS extraction via automatic threshold selection exceed 93.9% and 82.4%, respectively. Therefore, the ENDISI can serve as an effective index algorithm for rapid and high-precision IS extraction at the plateau basin scale. (C) The Authors.

AB  - In this paper I argue that split-brain syndrome is best understood within an extended mind framework and, therefore, that its very existence provides support for an externalist account of conscious perception. I begin by outlining the experimental aberration model of split-brain syndrome and explain both: why this model provides the best account of split-brain syndrome; and, why it is commonly rejected. Then, I summarise Susan Hurley's argument that split-brain subjects could unify their conscious perceptual field by using external factors to stand-in for the missing corpus callosum. I next provide an argument that split-brain subjects do unify their perceptual fields via external factors. Finally, I explain why my account provides one with an experimental aberration model which avoids the problems typically levelled at such views, and highlight some empirical predictions made by the account. The nature of split-brain syndrome has long been considered mysterious by proponents of internalist accounts of consciousness. However, in this paper I argue that externalist theories can provide a straightforward explanation of the condition. I therefore conclude that the ability of externalist accounts to explain split-brain syndrome gives us strong reason to prefer them over internalist rivals.

AB  - Despite growing evidence that biofilm formation on plastic debris in the marine environment may be essential for its biodegradation, the underlying processes have yet to be fully understood. Thus, far, bacterial biofilm formation had only been studied after short-term exposure or on floating plastic, yet a prominent share of plastic litter accumulates on the seafloor. In this study, we explored the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities on polyethylene plastic sheets and dolly ropes during longterm exposure on the seafloor, both at a harbor and an:offshore location in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We reconstructed the sequence of events during biofilin formation on plastic in the harbor environment and identified a core bacteriome and subsets of bacterial indicator species for early, intermediate, and late stages of biofilm formation. Additionally, by implementing ITS2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, we identified and characterized for the first time fungal genera on plastic debris. Surprisingly, none of the plastics exposed to offshore conditions displayed the typical signature of a late stage biofilm, suggesting that biofilm formation is severely hampered in the natural environment where most plastic debris accumulates.

AB  - A single stage nitritation-anammox pilot scale SBR was implemented to treat reject water from sludge dewatering. The SBR was operated with a new strategy, a combination of interval feeding with interval aeration using the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as the main process indicator parameter. The strategy allowed for optimized treatment of high nitrogen loaded reject water providing stable operation and achieving a nitrogen removal efficiency of more than 90% at a volumetric nitrogen load of 400 g N m(-3) d(-1). COD removal was also observed with an efficiency of around 70%.
   The concept of interval feeding monitored by the ORP also allowed for adjustments to changing environmental conditions (i.e., decrease in temperature) by adjusting the number of intervals per cycle and the number of cycles per day. The distinct swing in the ORP signal which showed the largest amplitudes and most distinct pattern of all monitored parameters made the ORP the most favorable control parameter for nitritation-anammox in this type of SBR.

AB  - In mussels, stress signals such as heat, osmotic shock and hypoxia lead to the activation of the phosphorylated p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (pp38-MAPK). This stress activated protein has been efficiently used as a biomarker to several natural and anthropogenic stresses. However, what has not been tested is whether differences in gender or size can affect the response of this biomarker. The present study tested whether there was variation in the expression of pp38-MAPK in mussels Perna perna of different gender and size classes when exposed to natural stress conditions, such as air exposure. The results show that gender does not affect the expression of pp38-MAPK. However, size does have an effect, where mussels smaller than 6.5 cm displayed significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of pp38-MAPK when compared to those larger than 7 cm. Mussels are one of the most used bioindicator species and the use of biomarkers to determine the health status of an ecosystem has been greatly increasing over the years. The present study highlights the importance of using mussels of similar size classes when performing experiments using stress-related biomarkers.

AB  - Johnny darters (Etheostoma nigrum Rafinesque, 1820) were collected from five localities in the St. Lawrence River in southwestern Quebec to test the effects of natural parasite infections and exposure in situ to pollution on their antipredator behaviour. Three measures of antipredator behaviour were made: (1) capture time (i.e., the time taken to catch individual fish) was used as a proxy for the ability to evade predation, (2) capture order was the order in which fish kept in a single tank were taken from the tank, and (3) flight initiation distance was the distance at which the fish moved when approached by a model predator. Only capture time showed a significant correlation with parasitism or pollution status. A nonparametric permutational multivariate ANOVA showed that capture time was significantly correlated with capture location and the abundance of the brain-encysting trematode Ornithodiplostomum Dubois, 1936. Infection with Ornithodiplostomum sp. may have led to an increase in activity, which would be maladaptive for this cryptic, benthic fish under natural predation conditions. Pollution may have an indirect effect on predator susceptibility in johnny darters, by reducing the abundance of a behaviour-modifying parasite.

AB  - In order to understand the main ecological factors that influence the distribution of mountain vegetation in Azores and to use it as a model for nature conservation, a study on Santa Barbara Mountain on Terceira Island was performed. A multivariate analysis was done on vegetation data and the abiotic factors governing the vegetation pattern are discussed. The major factors contributing to the observed vegetation patterns are wind exposure, soil water saturation and historical human impacts. The vegetation analysis showed that Azorean Mountain habitats have a high variation of vegetation structure as a result of the habitat heterogeneity and the extreme ecological conditions. Using the co-dominant plants as indicator species, eco-zones are distinguished, characterized by the combination of different ecological-human factors which contribute to the distribution of specific types of natural vegetation communities. The studies of vegetation distribution give important information about the relation between vegetation and landscape that is essential for conservation, restoration proposals and landscape planning. Azores terrestrial Natura 2000 sites are largely dominated by mountain vegetation, therefore this work provides essential background data for the management plans of these sites.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive recognises that ecological status is supported by the prevailing physico-chemical conditions in each water body. This paper describes an approach to providing guidance on setting thresholds for nutrients taking account of the biological response to nutrient enrichment evident in different types of water. Indices of pressure, state and impact are used to achieve a robust nutrient (nitrogen) threshold by considering each individual index relative to a defined standard, scale or threshold.
   These indices include winter nitrogen concentrations relative to a predetermined reference value; the potential of the waterbody to support phytoplankton growth (estimated as primary production); and detection of an undesirable disturbance (measured as dissolved oxygen). Proposed reference values are based on a combination of historical records, offshore (limited human influence) nutrient concentrations, literature values and modelled data. Statistical confidence is based on a number of attributes, including distance of confidence limits away from a reference threshold and how well the model is populated with real data.
   This evidence based approach ensures that nutrient thresholds are based on knowledge of real and measurable biological responses in transitional and coastal waters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The family Sphingidae has an important potential as bio-indicators given the 118 species so far enumerated in French Guiana. For instance, more than 25,000 individuals from 104 species have been captured during 90 monthly censuses between January 1990 and October 1997 in the region of Petit Saut, a low-altitude primary forest. Among these species, seven are considered as uncommon on the site of Petit Saut. Therefore, ca 50 % of the species with a sufficient number of individuals for the analysis (n = 30) display particular characteristics: the probability of occurrence differs significantly between months for 14.5 % of them, and for the majority of the species of this family seasonal variations in populations abundances are not linked to rainfall, which is usually the most important ecological factor in this environment, temperature being constant in Guianan forest. These fluctuations are therefore due to other factors. The filling of the dam reservoir affected about a third of the species. Adaptations to variations in environmental conditions are not identical across all species. Certain species were not affected by environmental modifications while others grew up taking advantage of these changes and colonized new biotopes, and others decreased.

AB  - Taking the watershed as the unit for intervention and conservation, in this study we assess water quality along a stretch of impacted watershed of considerable economic importance, the middle Rio Doce basin, using the benthic macroinvertebrate community, along with physical and chemical characteristics as parameters, for the classification of 20 sampling stations. The results showed that parameters often used in temperate regions are also useful to assess water quality in tropical ecosystems, where no specific methodology has yet been developed. In spite of a clear distinction between stations of good and bad quality, the multimetric biological analysis alone was not sensitive enough to identify intermediate conditions. Grouping similar and dissimilar stations by Cluster analysis of physical and chemical variables and biological data, however, it was possible to distinguish three categories based on the biological quality of the water: (1) stations With poor quality waters (2) stations with high quality water, and (3) stations with water of intermediate quality. Classifications of water quality of this sort will hopefully assist decision-makers in defining restoration/conservation strategies, and will provide an important tool for monitoring biodiversity and water quality in tropical watersheds.

AB  - Furfural is one of those promising chemicals obtained from biomass that is able to compete with petrochemicals. The purification of furfural is one the most critical stages during its production process, due to it requires a great amount of energy. In this sense, liquid-liquid extraction is one of the most promising alternatives. However, the main disadvantage of this alternative is the losses of co-products, which reduces the profitability of the process. This is work is one of the first to show the separation of coproducts of a purification process of furfural-based liquid-liquid extraction. Different intensified alternatives were tested in order to determine the best separation process for purifiying coproducts. The total annual cost, eco-indicator 99, the individual risk and the condition number were used to evaluate economic, environmental, safety and controllability aspects respectively, of the separation alternatives. The results indicate that the intensified alternatives have a reduction on total annual cost and environmental impact of around 25 %, while the improvements on the risk index is around 4 %. To conclude, an indirect intensified alternative was selected as the best option due to an improvement in cost and environmental impact, important risks reduction and similar control properties than those of conventional schemes.

AB  - The devastating impacts of natural hazards, including loss of lives and properties, underline the importance of efficient hazard preparedness, especially in the areas with frequent hazard occurrence. Several studies indicated that driving during emergency evacuation is quite challenging due to dense traffic flow, inclement weather conditions, and unexpected maneuvers of other evacuees. However, limited research has been directed towards assessing the perceived driving difficulties of individuals, including vulnerable population, under emergency evacuation. This study deploys a driving simulator in order to emulate realistic emergency evacuation scenarios and to quantify the perceived driving difficulties of individuals under emergency evacuation. Based on the data, collected using a driving simulator, a number of statistical models are proposed to determine a set of performance indicators, including the mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration, experienced by individuals as a result of emergency evacuation. The statistical models also capture a variety of different driver characteristics, traffic characteristics, driving conditions, and evacuation route characteristics. The analysis results suggest that the considered performance indicators are significantly influenced with a number of factors, including age, gender, education, race, presence of chronic diseases, and self-reported driving ability. The insights from the conducted research can be applied at the hazard preparedness stage to mitigate the perceived driving difficulties of individuals under emergency evacuation and ensure their safety.

AB  - We studied the effect of heat stress on milk quality in Spanish organic dairy farms using published milk productivity equations. We collected data from 23 weather stations and 14,424 milk test-days for milk yield and milk fat and protein content for the period July 2011 to June 2013. As an indicator of heat stress, we used the maximum daily temperature-humidity index (THI) from 2 days before the milk test date. We fitted the data using hierarchical regression models stratified by farm, cow parity and monthly test-day milk records. The effect of THI was deemed low on biological costs through milk yield. However, the known negative relationship between milk yield and milk quality (protein and fat content) became even steeper when the THI increased, suggesting a significant negative correlation between heat stress and milk quality. Therefore, although the milk yield of cows in the organic farming systems analyzed appeared resilient to heat stress conditions, milk quality, a major selling point for organic dairy products, was negatively affected. The model presented here could be used to predict the potential impacts of different climate change scenarios on dairy farming, and to delineate adaptation strategies within organic systems.

AB  - The estimated number of sika deer within the Tanzawa Mountains has decreased since the Kanagawa Prefecture sika deer management plan commenced. Meanwhile, unit-specific culling has resulted in various trends in deer density across small monitoring units. Deer abundance is usually surveyed within small monitoring units; therefore, the evaluation of deer abundance changes across the entire management area comprising individual units is difficult. We examined the relationship between deer body condition indicators and densities estimated at both individual unit and entire management scales in the Tanzawa Mountains during 2004-2015. Winter fawn body mass in the study area increased at least until 2011, irrespective of the increase/decrease in deer density in each unit. Observed variations in body mass were related to the estimated number of deer within the entire management area. Winter fawn hind foot length was not related to any density estimates. Inconsistencies between deer density changes in each unit and body mass might derive from the deer movement between units and mitigation of density-dependent food limitations caused by a reduction in the number of deer within the entire management area. We suggest that winter fawn body mass can provide additional evidence of deer abundance changes within management areas.

AB  - Phylogenetic regression is frequently used in macroevolutionary studies, and its statistical properties have been thoroughly investigated. By contrast, phylogenetic ANOVA has received relatively less attention, and the conditions leading to incorrect statistical and biological inferences when comparing multivariate phenotypes among groups remain underexplored. Here, we propose a refined method of randomizing residuals in a permutation procedure (RRPP) for evaluating phenotypic differences among groups while conditioning the data on the phylogeny. We show that RRPP displays appropriate statistical properties for both phylogenetic ANOVA and regression models, and for univariate and multivariate datasets. For ANOVA, we find that RRPP exhibits higher statistical power than methods utilizing phylogenetic simulation. Additionally, we investigate how group dispersion across the phylogeny affects inferences, and reveal that highly aggregated groups generate strong and significant correlations with the phylogeny, which reduce statistical power and subsequently affect biological interpretations. We discuss the broader implications of this phylogenetic group aggregation, and its relation to challenges encountered with other comparative methods where one or a few transitions in discrete traits are observed on the phylogeny. Finally, we recommend that phylogenetic comparative studies of continuous trait data use RRPP for assessing the significance of indicator variables as sources of trait variation.

AB  - We studied the spatial and temporal patterns of forest regeneration using a 24-year time series of Landsat images and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in a homogeneous Pinus halepensis forest, 3000 ha of which were extensively burned in 1995. We demonstrated a progressive slow and linear recovery in NDVI values, based on Landsat images between 1997 and 2007. The forest tended to recover to pre-disturbance conditions, both with respect to the magnitude of the NDVI and in terms of the spatial pattern. We found that the spatial differences in the rates of NDVI recovery were not affected by the burn severity. Moreover, burn severity did not affect the rates of NDVI recovery after the fire. Although highly homogeneous P. halepensis regeneration was the dominant pattern in the study area (more than the 70% of the burn area showed positive and significant trends), some spatial differences in the magnitude of change were observed. The forest tended to recover the spatial pattern corresponding to pre-fire conditions, although it was difficult to establish whether terrain elevation or previous tree size and density were the main governing factors, given the strong relationship between them.

AB  - Cryopreservation plays a key role in the long-term storage of native and engineered cells and tissues for research and clinical applications. The survival of cells and tissues after freezing and thawing depends on the ability of the cells to withstand a variety of stresses imposed by the cryopreservation protocol. A better understanding of the nature and kinetics of cellular responses to temperature-induced conditions is required to minimize cryoinjury. An interrupted freezing procedure that allows dissection of cryoinjury was used to investigate the progressive damage that occurs to cells during cryopreservation using slow cooling. Simulations of cellular osmotic responses were used to provide interpretation linking states of the cell with events during the freezing procedure. Simulations of graded freezing (interrupted slow cooling without hold time) were correlated with cell recovery results of TF-1 cells. Calculated intracellular supercooling and osmolality, were used as indicators of the probability of cryoinjury due to intracellular ice formation and solution effects, providing direct links of cellular conditions to events in the freezing process. Using simulations, this study demonstrated that both intracellular supercooling and osmolality are necessary to explain graded freezing results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A recent analysis published in this journal found different relationships between mean Ellenberg indicator values and environmental measurements in different vegetation types. The cause was stated as bias in mean Ellenberg values between releves which in turn suggested to reflect a bias in individual Ellenberg values. We discuss two phenomena that could explain these results without the need to invoke bias in either individual or mean Ellenberg values. Firstly, slopes of linear regression lines underestimate true relationships when analyses involve explanatory variables measured with error. Secondly, syntaxon-specific distributions of Ellenberg values follow from the floristic definition of phytosociological units. Mean Ellenberg values per releve therefore carry the stamp of their associated syntaxon even though associated abiotic conditions may vary between releves. This will lead to variation in slopes and intercepts between vegetation types not because of bias in individual Ellenberg values but because of prescribed bias in the distribution of Ellenberg values between syntaxa. The residual variation in calibrations carried out across vegetation types is undoubtedly reduced by introducing vegetation type as a factor. However users should note that this is unlikely to reflect bias in individual Ellenberg values but is more likely to reflect error in environmental measurements as well the constraint imposed by phytosociological classification.

AB  - Sustainability indicators covering economic, social and environmental aspects of human activities have emerged, including one by a state research institute advocating the construction of sustainability indicators on the basis of different world views. The proposed indicators have essentially an additive character, that is, the composing elements are added up, with or without weighing. Economic and social elements so far suggested for inclusion in such indicators have no demonstrated or plausible causal relation to sustainability defined as a production level that does not threaten the living conditions of future generations. Such a sustainable level is dependent on the lasting availability of the vital functions of our nonhuman-made physical surroundings (the environment) because loss of one or more vital functions leads to a collapse of production. Both the construction on the basis of different world views and the essentially additive character of indicators conceal conflicts and consequently difficult choices. Therefore, economic and social elements should be presented as separate indicators. Physical indicators for sustainability for renewable resources should focus on the processes that form part of life support systems. One attempt at sustainability indicators, the so-called 'genuine savings' (GS), is only a proper indicator of sustainability when a number of conditions are met; this is currently not yet the case.

AB  - Post-combustion (PC) was the mature technology for CO2 capture from a power plant, but the sorbent regeneration diminished its efficiency. The chemical looping combustion (CLC) was proposed to serve power plants with higher efficiency. The objectives of this study consisted of (1) examine the sustainability of power production between PC and CLC and (2) investigate the high sustainability operation conditions. There are 6 case studies which were simulated using the Aspen plus program with the Peng-Robinson-Boston-Mathias model. All cases were evaluated by three quantitative aspects of thermal efficiency, economic, and emergy analyses. The best case from each analysis was different. Since emergy analysis expressed a holistic aspect, including resource usage, economic performance, and environmental burden, this indicator would be used for selecting the proper technology. In this study, the decision had made into two aspects. From a global viewpoint, the CLC with high energy recovery and HAT cycle would be selected since it had the lowest UEV, reflecting the least natural resource consumption. On the other hand, from a local viewpoint, the CLC without HAT would be selected since it had the highest ESI, which implied its sustainability since the process was less reliant on external resources.

AB  - The sustainability of agriculture in social, economic and environmental dimensions is important in terms of development policies. In this study, agricultural sustainability has been evaluated in social, economic and environmental dimensions. Twenty-one indicators were used and each dimension had 7 indicators. The research was carried out in Sarikum Lake Basin of Sinop province in Turkey. The information obtained by face-to-face surveys with the farmers and the related statistics were used as data. The index method was used in the evaluation of these data. As a result, agricultural sustainability in the basin was found 13.95% in the environmental dimension, 9.64% in the economic dimension and 16.62% in the social dimension. The agricultural sustainability in Sarikum Lake Basin was determined as 40.21%. As a result of the study, in order to achieve economic sustainability it is necessary to increase the agricultural income, the ratio of irrigated land and the number of agricultural holdings with sufficient income. In order to ensure social sustainability, it is necessary to establish conditions to prevent migration and to ensure that farmers are satisfied with farming. In order to achieve environmental sustainability, it is necessary to increase the amount of protected area and to reduce wild animal damage.

AB  - Molluscs have been widely used in biomonitoring of aquatic environments because they are highly sensitive to hazardous chemical substances and have the capacity to express the history of environmental changes in their shells. Mollusc shells have biomolecules playing an essential role in the biomineralization process, which are also susceptible to environmental stressors that promotes chemical and structural alterations. Thus, the present study evaluated structural and compositional shell changes in the limpet Lottia subrugosa along a spatial contamination gradient in Santos Estuary. Results showed that organisms collected in more contaminated sites presented shells more fragile, with a reduction of thickness in the prismatic layer associated with the enlargement of the periostracum layer. In addition, a significative reduction in the organic fraction amounts, including a decrease in protein content, was observed in shells of organisms from the most contaminated site. An opposite pattern was also observed at sites under the influence of lower contamination rates. Moreover, our results suggested that limpets inhabiting contaminated environments might be more vulnerable to predatory pressures due to the increase in shell fragility. The core set of endpoints tested in field conditions by the present study appears to be promising environmental assessment tools.

AB  - The ultrastructure of biologically formed calcium carbonate crystals like the shell of Emiliania huxleyi depends on the environmental conditions such as pH value, temperature and salinity. Therefore, they can be used as indicator for climate changes. However, for this a detailed understanding of their crystal structure and chemical composition is required. High resolution methods like transmission electron microscopy can provide those information on the nanoscale, given that sufficiently thin samples can be prepared. In our study, we developed sample preparation techniques for cross-section and plan-view investigations and studied the sample stability under electron bombardment. In addition to the biological material (Emiliania huxleyi) we also prepared mineralogical samples (Iceland spar) for comparison. High resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging, electron diffraction and electron energy-loss spectroscopy studies revealed that all prepared samples are relatively stable under electron bombardment at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV when using a parallel illumination. Above an accumulated dose of similar to 10(5) e/nm(2) the material - independent whether its origin is biological or geological - transformed to poly-crystalline calcium oxide. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The first experimental group was reared alone (single strain) i.e. without competitors and in the second experiment the mice were reared with another strain Balb/C (mixed strains) i.e., with competitors. Present study revealed violent and aggressive of individuals behavior in the presence of compitots and retarded the gonadal activity and inhibited sexual efficiency. Exposure to longer photoperiod increased the size of testes and accelerated sexual maturity. Exposure to long photoperiods combined with high level of food,without competitors was considered the best environmental conditions for the earlier sexual maturity of mice. While the sexual maturity was retarded in mice exposed to shorter photoperiod and insufficient food with competitors,which lead to an atrophy in the testes and delay the spermatogenic index at the third level in higher ages. This state was considered unsuitable for the sexual maturity.

AB  - The technocratic approach for managing the Missouri River and other large rivers is not effective in resolving conflicts among competing uses of water and dealing with uncertainty about how river ecosystems respond to alternative management actions. Adaptive management offers an alternative way to address these and other issues. It has the potential to alleviate management gridlock and provide lasting solutions to management of the Missouri River and other large river ecosystems. In passive adaptive management, simulation models and expert judgment are combined to select a preferred management action. While passive adaptive management is relatively simple and inexpensive to use, it does not necessarily provide reliable information for making management decisions. Active adaptive management uses statistically designed experiments to test assumptions or hypotheses about ecosystem responses to management actions. It is best carried out by a collaborative working group. Active adaptive management has several advantages, but the inability to satisfy certain prerequisites for successful application makes it more difficult to implement in large river ecosystems. A second-best approach is proposed here to select, implement, monitor, and evaluate a preferred management action and retain that action provided ecological conditions improve and socioeconomic indicators do not fall below established acceptability limits.

AB  - Stormwater ponds can provide flood protection and efficiently treat stormwater using sedimentation. As the ponds also host aquatic biota and attract wildlife, there is a growing concern that the sediment bound pollutants negatively affect aquatic organisms and the surrounding ecosystem. In this study, we used three methods to assess the accumulation and the potential ecological risk of 13 different heavy metals and metalloids (e.g. trace elements) including both elements that are frequently monitored and some which are rarely monitored in sediment from 5 stormwater ponds located within catchments with predominately industrial activities. Ecological risk for organisms in the older ponds was observed for both commonly (e.g. Cd, Cu, Zn) and seldom (e.g. Ag, Sb) monitored trace elements. The 3 methods ranked the degree of contamination similarly. We show that methods usually used for sediment quality assessment in aquatic ecosystems can also be used for screening the potential risk of other trace elements in stormwater ponds and may consequently be useful in stormwater monitoring and management. Our study also highlights the importance of establishing background conditions when conducting ecological risk assessment of sediment in stormwater ponds.

AB  - Greenery and open spaces play significant roles in environmentally sustainable societies, providing urban ecosystem services and economic benefits that reduce urban poverty. Current urban poverty research has solely focused on top-down observations or direct human exposure to greenery and open spaces and has failed to sense landscape characteristics, including occupation and inequality, representing the social attributes of urban poverty. This paper demonstrates the potential to better understand certain social characteristics, including occupation and inequality between urban greenery and open spaces, and to further investigate their relationship with urban poverty. Percentage and aggregation indicators are proposed based on street view images to estimate the occupation and inequality between human perception-based greenery and open spaces. The relationship between human perception and urban poverty is accordingly analysed using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The GWR model results attain an R-squared value of 0.583 and further reveal that the relationships between human perception-based landscapes and urban poverty are spatially non-stationary, indicating varying relationships across space. This implication leads to an improved understanding of the relationship between greenery and open-space landscapes and living conditions and to further allowing effective policies to help identify deprived areas.

AB  - Macrophytes (aquatic plants or hydrophytes) are sources of food and oxygen for aquatics (e.g., fish, invertebrates) and act as bioindicators for the assessment of environmental conditions in water reservoirs. This articles describes the bioaccumulation pattern of different elements (P, S, Cl, K, Rb, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Mo, As, Se, and Pb) and polyphenols in seven plants (Azolla pinnata, Pistia stratiotes, Salvinia molesta, Nelumbo nucifera, Trapa natans, Persicaria punctate, and Persicaria maculosa) grown in the Kharun River (India). Total accumulated concentrations of the aforementioned elements of 55,140, 63,894, 55,706, 67,320, 32,071, 30,282, and 48,077 mg kg-1 (dw) were found for the biomass of the aforementioned plants, respectively. Certain elements, Mg, Ca, and Fe, were predominated in bioaccumulation. The concentrations of total polyphenols were 2,870, 12,970, 4,500, 10,720, 3,800, 20,800, and 18,950 mg kg-1 of dried weight (dw) for the previously mentioned plants, respectively. The distribution ratio of the elements in macrophytes to water is discussed, and a canonical correlation analysis is used to assess the relationship of water contaminants with macrophytes.

AB  - The production of agricultural crops depends on the optimisation rate of plant genetic factors, climatic and soil factors and the level of agrochemicals. These factors are in constant dynamism and also are the production of agricultural plants. Changing in climatic conditions of the area will necessitate bring changes in the genetic resources of the plants that will be cultivated as well as in the technology of cultivation. The study analyses the thermal and pluviometry performance of the Korca field, one of the areas with the best agricultural development and on this basis is experimented with the time of potato planting and the adaption to these changes. The analysis of climate variability and trends of ecological climate factors is determining for the sustainability of agricultural production. Especially the increase in temperature indicators requires adaptation to the changes in the technology of crops cultivation. The planting time, which is essentially determined by the optimum agronomic temperature, determines the entire biological cycle of the plant by directly influencing the morphologic and plant yield. Climate changes of the last decades make experimentation necessary to determine the optimal planting terms. Sustainable agricultural development determined by long-term climate change requires adaptation to these changes.

AB  - Monthly samples of caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae were taken from ten localities along a 151 km long section of the Nisava River (eastern Serbia) during a one year study, with the aim to assessing the spatial composition of the caddisfly assemblage along the river gradient, to identify key environmental factors influencing its variability, to find out if caddisflies are suitable as biological indicators of water quality in this region, and to asses if the caddisfly assemblage in the river follows the river continuum concept. Twenty-three morphologically distinct taxa belonging to 14 genera were identified. The dominant family was Hydropsychidae with 70.34% of specimens examined, followed by Brachycentridae with 9.74% specimens. The longitudinal variability of the caddisfly assemblage has shown a clear dependence on physical and chemical parameters. The CCA analysis suggests that BOD5 and concentration of total phosphorus are the most important factors in structuring the caddisfly assemblage. The species diversity was greatest at localities with the highest oxygen concentration and low nutrient levels. The caddisfly assemblage proved to be useful in identifying differences in environmental conditions in the Central Balkan region.

AB  - Accurate sorption modeling is critical for environmental risk assessment and development of sound remedial technologies. Adsorption to iron oxide phases is one of the important sorption processes regulating the bioavailability and toxicity of metal ions in natural systems. In this study, we used spectroscopically derived bidentate surface species to constrain surface complexation modeling in addressing Ni(II) and Zn(II) adsorption and competition on goethite surfaces. The 2-pK(a) triple layer model successfully predicted adsorption in single adsorbate systems. The curvature in adsorption isotherms was accurately depicted using two types of sites: high affinity and low affinity, and mononuclear bidentate surface complexes. A constrained set of parameters was found for each metal (log K-L = -6.63 and log K-H = -2.45 for Ni, log K-L = -3.92 and log K-H = 2.14 for Zn) that successfully described adsorption over a large range of experimental conditions, covering 6 to 7 orders of magnitude in concentration, ionic strength from 10(-3) to 10(-2), and environmentally relevant pH range between 4 and 6.5. Adsorption competition was predicted using the bidentate surface species with parameters calibrated using single adsorbate data.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was performed on 275 pupils from the third and fourth grade of three elementary schools (three urban areas with different traffic conditions) in Zagreb. Lead exposure was environmental, mostly through leaded gasoline. The difference in traffic density around the schools was consistent with biological indicators of lead absorption. The aim of the study was to clarify the relationship between characteristic biological indicators of lead absorption including indicators of hematological status with some psychological functions. Lead absorption in pupils was relatively low (moan blood lead: 70.8 +/- 17.88 mu g/L). Pupils' socio-economic status was evaluated by parents' education. The results obtained indicate that gender and school were associated with both biological and psychological variables. After adjusting for age, parental education, and gender, lead appears to have no association with cognitive or psyche-motor measures. The nonstandardized regression coefficients for blood lead-as a measure of the size of lead effect on VIQ, NIQ, and IQ-were -0.016, -0.031, and -0.025, respectively, all nonsignificant.

AB  - Timberline and environmental change: The importance of scale and space for the study of high altitude ecosystems. The usefulness of the upper timberline as an indicator of climate change is reviewed in the light of the results of a study of subalpine post-pastoral succession in the Maurienne Valley (Savoie, France). The authors propose a hierarchical and systemic approach to take into account the complexity and heterogeneity of the timberline. The latter is considered as a mosaic ecotone whose evolution may be studied (1) by considering a mean line when observing the mosaic from far away, (2) by considering the boundaries between the physionomical and geomorphological units of the mosaic and (3) by focusing on the individual forest borders. The dynamic potentialities of the forest borders mainly depend on their place in the phyto-morphological mosaic. Thus geomorphology is an important feature determining the landscape patterns and the recolonization patterns. The use of the timberline as an indicator of climate change is subjected to two conditions. Firstly, the climate parameters must be considered on a number of scales, according to the scales on which the vegetation dynamics itself may be studied. Secondly, the influence of the geomorphological parameters must not be neglected.

CP  - Session on Case Studies in the Environmental Assessment of Aquatic Systems, at the 1992 Annual Natural Areas Conference
AB  - Spatial and temporal changes in benthic features, especially macroinvertebrate community structure, were examined from 1981 to 1992 in Juday Creek, a northern Indiana stream subjected to habitat degradation due to changes in land use along its length and over time. Watershed land use in 1992 was dominated by agriculture (45%) and urbanization (31%); only about 7% of the basin remained as original woodland or prairie. Habitat quality and biodiversity improved with distance from the agriculturally impacted headwaters to the lower section of Juday Creek, where the stream flows through a heavily wooded area. Organic matter retention, a process critical to stream energy flow, was related positively to stream heterogeneity and the abundance of large woody debris in the channel. Abundance and secondary production of several groups of benthic macroinvertebrates declined after 1982 and have been a result of increased sedimentation in Juday Creek associated with changes in land use. Possible sedimentation effects were best revealed by changes in secondary production of functional feeding groups, especially collector-filters (86% decrease) and collector-gatherers (292% increase). Juday Creek showed short-term longitudinal recovery from upstream watershed disturbance but a long-term overall decline in habitat quality. Careful land use and proper riparian management are needed to restore this Indiana stream to its previous habitat conditions and biological productivity.

AB  - The use of trace fossils as paleoenvironmental indicators is based on empirically-derived and tested links between environmental conditions, behavior, and trace fossil morphology. Four approaches were used to assess how faithfully and at what resolution trace fossils, as mirrors of behavior, reflect environmental change: (1) comparing the abundance and morphology of Ophiomorpha nodosa in tidal channel-margin and tidal channel-axis facies (Miocene, Delaware); (2) determining the range of morphology of O. nodosa produced under unchanging environmental conditions (within the channel-margin facies); (3) evaluating the behavioral response of the modern burrowing thalassinidean, Neotrypaea californiensis, in Mugu Lagoon, California to an environmental perturbation, namely the burial of layers of glass plates; and (4) assessing how ancient producers of Ophiomorpha dealt with obstacles presented by dense shell and coral accumulations (Miocene, Maryland; Pleistocene, Bahamas). Comparison of Ophiomorpha nodosa in channel-margin versus channel-axis facies indicated that O. nodosa was significantly more abundant in the channel-margin facies. However, there was no significant difference in burrow characteristics (exterior or interior diameter, wall thickness) between the facies. As recorded by O. nodosa, its thalassinidean producer did not modify its behavior in response to conditions in the tidal channel axis. Rather, the tracemakers tended to avoid the channel axis, as indicated by the reduced abundance of O. nodosa. In contrast, O. nodosa within the channel-margin facies was highly variable in degree of pelletization of the burrow wall, in burrow fill and definition of the burrow margin, and in architecture of the burrow system. Variation in O, nodosa found within the channel-margin facies reflected behavioral flexibility in the absence of environmental change. Modern burrowing shrimp adapt to barriers (layers of glass plates) implanted within the substrate. They alter the geometry and depth of their burrow systems; they may even share shafts that penetrate the barrier. Meters thick Miocene shell beds (Maryland) in which the shells are not densely packed contain Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides; the producing thalassinideans were able to penetrate and move through the shell bed. Similarly, Pleistocene thalassinideans maneuvered around coral rubble in Bahamian fossil coral reefs. However, Miocene decimeter-thick shell beds that are densely packed and well sorted are not penetrated by thalassinidean burrows, implying that thalassinidean behavioral flexibility was not sufficient to penetrate densely packed shell beds. Likewise, in the Bahamian reefal settings, Ophiomorpha producers formed extensive maze systems immediately above impenetrable lithified surfaces in the reefal sequence. Behavior of thalassinidean shrimp is neither tightly constrained nor highly programmed, and there is no indication that this has changed since Miocene time. Small changes in morphology of traces produced by thalassinideans cannot be used to identify subtle changes in environmental conditions. Shrimp vary behavior apparently "whimsically", as well as in response to environmental change. If this is true of animals other than thalassinideans, the challenge to the ichnologist is to distinguish between "background" and "environmentally triggered" behavioral variation as recorded in the trace fossil record.

AB  - As they quickly respond to environmental conditions, soil enzymes, involved in nutrient cycles, are considered good indicators of soil quality. The Mediterranean area is a peculiar environment for climatic conditions and for fire frequency. Therefore, the research aimed to evaluate the role of seasonality and fire on enzymatic activities (i.e., hydrolase, dehydrogenase, and beta-glucosidase) in soils covered by herbs, black locust, pine, and holm oak. In addition, the main soil abiotic properties that drive the enzymatic activities were also investigated. In order to achieve the aims, surface soils were collected in unburnt and burnt areas and characterized for water and organic matter contents, pH, concentrations of C and N, and available fractions of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, and Pb. The results highlighted that the soil enzymatic activities were mainly affected by seasonality more than by fire; in unburnt soils, their main drivers were nutrient availabilities, whereas, in burnt soils they were pH, water and organic matter contents, C and N concentrations, and both nutrient and metal availabilities. Finally, holm oak, as compared with herbs, pine, and black locust, conferred higher stability to soils that were affected by seasonality and fire.

AB  - Response behaviors of animals to stressors are complicated. Especially, it is difficult to analyze temporal data in addressing the time course development of behavioral states to stressors. Not much study has been conducted in identifying the short-term behavior conditions of indicator organisms responding to stressors. Hence, in the present study, we selected three temporal networks, Temporal Kohonen Map (TKM), Recurrent Self-Organizing Map (RSOM), and Recursive Self-Organizing Map (RecSOM) to characterize the behavior strength of individual fish exposed to Atrazine (ATZ, 0.12 mg/L) for 15 days. The trained networks were able to detect the characteristic behavior strength segments presenting the Stepwise Behavior Response Model (SBRM). TKM was found suitable for detecting strong curves in a short training time, but clustering was limited in grouped segments. In contrast, RecSOM was found to be most suitable for detecting behavior segments with both high and low contrast response under toxic exposure. RecSOM was effective in clustering but could not detect segments with strong changes. Finally, our results presented that the temporal SOMs, especially RecSOMs, were feasible in identifying short-term time series data and could be utilized for on-line monitoring of test organisms under stressful conditions.

AB  - In yeast, adaptation to varying conditions often requires proper regulation of the plasma membrane potential. To determine yeast membrane potential change, optical methods involving potentiometric dyes have been supplemental to the direct electrode-based method. However, the hydrophobic nature of the dyes and their slow distribution across the membrane still limits their utilization. Genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) proteins employed in neuroscience offer a tantalizing alternative for monitoring yeast membrane potential change. In this work, several widely used GEVI proteins were assessed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for their expression and function as a voltage reporter. Among them, only ArcLight and Accelerated Sensor of Action Potential (ASAP) proteins could be expressed and transported to the plasma membrane. While the voltage-sensing capability was demonstrated for both ArcLight and ASAP, ArcLight fluorescence was sensitive to the intracellular pH change concurrently with the voltage change. Therefore, we established that ASAP is the more suitable GEVI protein for reporting yeast membrane potential change. This voltage-sensing reporter for yeast based on ASAP offers a new effective strategy for real-time optical detection of yeast membrane potential change, which potentially facilitates many areas of yeast research including optimizing growth conditions for industrial use and investigating yeast ion transport system.

AB  - With rapid economic development, demand for water resources is continuously increasing, which has resulted in common overexploitation of groundwater, particularly in megacities. This overexploitation of groundwater over many years has brought a series of adverse problems, including groundwater level decline, land subsidence and hydrogeological issues. To quantitatively describe these risks, we propose a risk evaluation model for groundwater exploitation and utilization. By deducing and expanding on the cusp catastrophe type, this study breaks through the limitations on the catastrophe assessment method, e.g., the number of indicators, and establishes an improved catastrophe assessment model for groundwater exploitation and utilization risk. In addition, the index system of the risk evaluation is constructed including three criterion layers: groundwater system condition (B1), groundwater exploitation and utilization (B2) and groundwater environmental problems (B3) and is tested for the conditions in Shanghai City, eastern China. The evaluation results show that the comprehensive risk values for groundwater exploitation and utilization in all districts (counties) of Shanghai are between 0.68 and 0.85, which categorizes the city as in the moderate risk zone; therefore, the improved catastrophe model is suitable for assessing groundwater exploitation risk in Shanghai City and should be applicable more broadly for the effective protection and sustainable supply of groundwater.

AB  - We have studied the effect of soil conditions on the productivity (site index) of pine forests in the zone of coniferous-broad-leaved forests. The research object is natural pine forests of different productivities related to the effect of soil and ground factors. The research is performed in northeastern Moscow oblast at the Sverdlovsk branch of the Moscow educational-experimental forestry. It is revealed that it is the main soil properties that determine the site index of the studied pine forests, include groundwater level, the thickness of the ungleyed mineral part of soil profile, and humus reserves in the mineral part of soil. Gleying rate, the depth of the gley horizon, the thickness of the organic horizon, and the occurrence of ortsteins and iron-manganese concretions are the most important soil indicators of the water regime, which is closely related to forest productivity (site index). The cluster analysis has enabled us to assign the soil varieties to five groups with respect to their productivity and taxonomic position. These informative soil properties should be included into forest GIS and taken into account when planning forestry measures. The diagnostic model may be used in assessing the potential productivity of forest soils and elaborating measures for the rational use of forest lands.

AB  - The present study demonstrates the optimization of a heat pump for an application with a large temperature glide on the sink side and a smaller temperature glide on the source side. The study includes a numerical simulation of a heat pump cycle for binary mixtures based on a list of 14 natural refrigerants. This approach enables a match of the temperature glide of sink and source with the temperature of the working fluid during phase change and thus, a reduction of the exergy destruction due to heat transfer. The model was evaluated for four different boundary conditions. The exergy destruction due to heat transfer, which is solely caused by the fluid having a non-ideal temperature profile was quantified and an indicator describing the glide match was defined to analyze its influence on the performance. The results indicated, that a good glide match can contribute to an increased performance. The increase in performance was dependent on the boundary conditions and reached up to 20% for a simple cycle and up to 27% if the superheating can be avoided. The temperature glide match in the source was identified to have a higher influence on the performance than in the sink. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forests in southern Italy are mainly located in mountainous areas, where ground-based extraction is still the most common harvesting technique. In particular, 60% of southern Italy's forests are on slopes with an angle of inclination between 20-60%. The low level of mechanization in forest operations is due to the difficult site conditions, as well as the small-scale characteristics of both the forest owners and the harvesting contractors. The most common work method uses chainsaws to fell the trees, and animals or farm tractors equipped with winches for bunching and extraction. This study assesses the productivity and cost effectiveness of extraction with a purpose-built John Deere 548H skidder, including a comparison of winch and grapple configurations. The results show that the productivity of skidding depends on distance as well as the condition of the skid trail. The number of trees per cycle and volume of each load also had a clear effect. While large purpose-built skidders represent a significant investment, this study demonstrates that the productivity is very high compared to traditional extraction methods and the resulting extraction costs are very competitive. As such, this study indicates that, over time, southern Italian harvesting operations should invest in purpose-built harvesting systems.

AB  - The shales in the Baijiantan Formation are considered to be an important potential source rock in the Junggar Basin. To evaluate this basin's source-rock characteristics, 61 core samples from 14 boreholes were analyzed using total organic carbon and total sulfur analyses and Rock-Eval pyrolysis. Thirty-two core samples were analyzed using solvent extraction, column fractionation, biomarker analysis and the organic petrology of kerogen. The results suggest that the shales in the Baijiantan Formation have fair to excellent hydrocarbon generation potential, and the organic matter types include both Type II and Type III. The shales in the Baijiantan Formation are mainly oil-generating rocks, and better source rocks are mainly distributed in the middle-lower section of the Baijiantan Formation. The total organic carbon and total sulfur analyses, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and biomarkers indicate that the shales in the Baijiantan Formation formed in a low-salinity to freshwater lacustrine sedimentary environment under reducing conditions. Biomarkers indicate that the organic matter input of the shales exhibits varying contributions from plankton, algae and terrestrial organisms. The biomarker molecular composition of the source rock is related to the organic matter source, salinity, redox conditions and maturation. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the few bacteria that have been consistently linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) is the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus gallolyticus. Infections with this bacterium are generally regarded as an indicator for colonic malignancy, while the carriage rate of this bacterium in the healthy large intestine is relatively low. We speculated that the physiological changes accompanying the development of CRC might favor the colonization of this bacterium. To investigate whether colon tumor cells can support the survival of S. gallolyticus, this bacterium was grown in spent medium of malignant colonocytes to simulate the altered metabolic conditions in the CRC microenvironment. These in vitro simulations indicated that S. gallolyticus had a significant growth advantage in these spent media, which was not observed for other intestinal bacteria. Under these conditions, bacterial responses were profiled by proteome analysis and metabolic shifts were analyzed by H-1-NMR-spectroscopy. In silico pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins and metabolite analysis indicated that this advantage resulted from the increased utilization of glucose, glucose derivates, and alanine. Together, these data suggest that tumor cell metabolites facilitate the survival of S. gallolyticus, favoring its local outgrowth and providing a possible explanation for the specific association of S. gallolyticus with colonic malignancy.

AB  - 1. Discoloration of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tape has been used in peatland ecological and hydrological studies as an inexpensive way to monitor changes in water-table depth and reducing conditions.
   2. We investigated the relationship between depth of PVC tape discoloration and measured water-table depth at monthly time steps during the growing season within nine kettle peatlands of northern Wisconsin. Our specific objectives were to: (1) determine if PVC discoloration is an accurate method of inferring water-table depth in Sphagnum-dominated kettle peatlands of the region; (2) assess seasonal variability in the accuracy of the method; and (3) determine if systematic differences in accuracy occurred among microhabitats, PVC tape colour and peatlands.
   3. Our results indicated that PVC tape discoloration can be used to describe gradients of water-table depth in kettle peatlands. However, accuracy differed among the peatlands studied, and was systematically biased in early spring and late summer/autumn. Regardless of the month when the tape was installed, the highest elevations of PVC tape discoloration showed the strongest correlation with midsummer (around July) water-table depth and average water-table depth during the growing season.
   4. The PVC tape discoloration method should be used cautiously when precise estimates are needed of seasonal changes in the water-table.

AB  - Due to the low fecundity of Varroa jacobsoni, it is presently not possible to explain satisfactorily the observed rapid build up of mite populations in APis mellifera colonies. The number of reproductive cycles, i.e. the number of times a mite enters brood cells to reproduce, has been suggested to be the key to this problem. Despite several studies on this aspect, large discrepancies in the published data remain. This paper describes a new experimental method for studying this aspect of the mites' biology in order to resolve this question. Colonies containing only worker bee brood were manipulated so they had discrete brood cycles. Colonies were kept in a mite-free area and infested with a known number of mites at the start of the study. To estimate the average number of reproductive cycles performed, the observed growth in the mite populations was compared with the theoretical growth of mite populations which performed different numbers of reproductive cycles, but with conditions otherwise similar to those observed in the study colonies. The level of mite drop was used as an indicator of the mite population. The average potential number of reproductive cycles required to explain the observed mite population growth was between two and three.

AB  - Barley is one of the most widely cultivated crops in tainted areas of the Mediterranean. where drought is the main factor that limits yield. Knowledge of the physiological traits responsible for adaptation of barley cultivars to Mediterranean environments may be relevant for future breeding strategies. Yield potential versus drought tolerance is an open debate. Here, we studied two barley cultivars (Graphic and Kym), of similar time to anthesis and crop duration. that are widely cultivated in the western Mediterranean. Grain yield was evaluated in 41 field trials and ranged (averaged for the 16-32 cultivars assayed in each trial) from 0.7 to 9.1 Mg ha(-1). Yield components and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) of grains was analysed in another two trials. Graphic production was greater than Kym in all conditions. This greater yield was sustained mainly by more ears per unit ground area, which may be attributable to higher growth potential during tillering. Moreover, Graphic showed greater Delta(13)C of kernels, indicating improved water status even at the end of the crop cycle. To examine differences in early growths these, cultivars were grown in optimal conditions and then photosynthetic activity and biomass analysed at the end of tillering. Graphic showed greater above-ground and root biomass as well as total leaf area per plant and per filler than Kym, and also tended to have more tillers per plant, but its shoot-to-root biomass ratio was lower. Nitrogen content per unit leaf area was correlated negatively with plant and with tiller leaf area and positively with the shoot-to-root biomass ratio. Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area was lower in Graphic and positively related to a lower nitro-en content, whereas stomatal limitation of photosynthesis and water use efficiency was similar in the two cultivars. Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate regeneration capacity contributed to the lower photosynthetic rate of Graphic. Moreover, quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) electron transport was also lower in Graphic than Kym, which suggests that mechanisms other than leaf structure also contributed to the higher photosynthetic capacity of the former. Nevertheless, as result of differences in leaf area, total plant photosynthesis was greater in Graphic.
   The results indicate that the higher yield of Graphic under a wide range of Mediterranean conditions may be sustained by increased plant growth and total photosynthesis during tillering, although the photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area is lower than that of Kym. Graphic has a more extensive root system than Kym, subsequently improving its water status in later stages of the crop cycle. Nitrogen content per unit leaf area is a good indicator of the growth and photosynthetic activity of barley plants in the early stages of the crop cycle. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents an analysis of the species richness and diversity of microcrustaceans (Cladocera, Cyclopoida, and Harpacticoida) and Oligochaeta from the zoobenthos of streams and waterbodies of the Pechora River delta, Korovinskaya Bay and the lakes of its islands, and an adjacent section of the continental Malozemelskaya tundra. We have identified 87 species and forms. It is shown that, due to the heterogeneity of habitats and environmental conditions, the delta is characterized by a specific composition of the fauna of these groups of invertebrates, as well as the specific structure of taxocenoses. According to the Shannon-Wiener (H-N), Pielou (E), Simpson (D-S), and Whittaker's (beta(w)) indexes, the highest diversity of the groups is recorded in the streams and waterbodies of the delta; the lowest is in the surveyed area of the Malozemelskaya tundra. Based on our analysis, it is concluded that benthic Cladocera, Cyclopoida, and Oligochaeta are the most effective biodiversity indicators in the Pechora basin in its lower course. This is demonstrated by the cross-taxon correlation data on the species richness of these groups per sample.

AB  - This study assesses the technological, environmental and economic feasibility of biodrying to valorise cellulosic sludge as a renewable energy source. Specifically, three different aeration strategies were compared in terms of biodrying performance, energetic consumption, gaseous emissions, quality of end products and techno-economic analysis. These strategies were based on different combinations of convective drying with biogenic heat produced. Two innovative biodrying performance indicators (Energetic Biodrying Index and Biodrying Performance Index) were proposed to better assess the initial and operational conditions that favour the maximum energy process efficiency and the highest end product quality. The end-products obtained consistently presented moisture contents below 40% and lower heating values above 9.4 MJ.kg(-1). However, the best values achieved were 32.6% and 10.4 MJ.kg(-1) for moisture content and lower heating value, respectively. Low N2O and CH4 emissions confirmed the effective aeration of all three strategies carried out, while NH4 and tVOCs were related either to temperature or biological phenomena. A techno-economic analysis proved the economic viability and attractiveness of the biodrying technology for cellulosic sludge in all the strategies applied. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Twenty-three species belonging to the class Euglenophyceae were recorded from the Museum Lake, Thiruvananthapuram, India. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between environmental variables and the dominant euglenophytes indicated interaction with certain physical and chemical parameters, in particular rainfall, electrical conductivity and phosphate versus their distribution in the Museum Lake. The dominant species were Euglena deses, Trachelomonas hispida and Trachelomonas volvocina. The CCA results indicate interaction between a variety of environmental parameters and species abundance. A closer examination suggests some external factor (e.g. evaporation) affecting water quality rather than the environment changing the algal biomass. With low rainfall the phosphate concentration increased from 1.5 to 6.9 mg P/l (likely as a result of anoxic conditions in the muddy bottom) and simultaneously nitrate was (partly) taken up by these dominant algae, as a result of which N : P ratios decreased from 4.5 to 0.7. The present study shows that the dominant euglenoid species co-occur in relatively hard water with high phosphorus concentration, and can be considered as useful bio-indicators in assessing the health and extent of deterioration of a lake ecosystem.

AB  - Compilation of the Red Data Books of soils for the subjects of the Russian Federation will provide for conservation of natural diversity of soils in regions significantly modified by management activities. When compiling the list of the reference soils it is proposed to focus primarily on soils, which are typical for provinces of soil-ecological zoning and to identify reference soils within protected nature areas. The research of virgin soils included in the Red Data Book of the Rostov oblast showed that their characteristics can be used as reference in the course of soil monitoring. The maintenance of the fallow regime in soils promotes restoration of their humus condition. In virgin and fallow chernozems, the weighted mean humus content (for a 25-cm thick soil layer) is by 0.7-3.0% greater than that in the arable analogs. It is demonstrated that the available normative documents are not applicable for assessing the degree of pollution of regional soils with heavy metals. To fulfil this task it is proposed to use regional background concentrations established for virgin soils with similar typology and textural composition, while taking into account natural variation of characteristics.

AB  - The nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) in tissues of native macroalgae was evaluated as a means of indicating the intensity and spatial extent of organic contamination due to disposal of waste from land-based marine fish farms (LBMFFs). Three species of macroalgae from the genus Fucus and the green macroalgae Codium tomentosum were selected for study. The study was carried out at seven flat marine fish farms located in Galicia (NW Spain). Tests were carried out to determine the intra-annual variation in delta N-15 values and any differences between selected macroalgae. The delta N-15 values enrichment was observed close to the disposal point, and delta N-15 values varied more widely throughout the year (+/- 5.57 aEuro degrees) at sites affected by the marine fish farm effluent compared to natural conditions (+/- 2 aEuro degrees). No significant differences in the isotopic signals were observed in the different species studied (standard major axis). The delta N-15 values of macroalgae may be an ideal means of detecting the presence of LBMFFs effluents.

AB  - The functional and structural attributes of algal assemblages were studied in 25 restored and 20 extant depressional wetlands in southern central Michigan. Environmental conditions and algal assemblages were compared between restored and extant wetlands and among habitats within wetlands. Restored marshes generally had lower shading by macrophytes, nutrient concentrations, and sediment organic matter. Relative biovolume of non-diatom algae was significantly different among plankton, macrophyte and sediment habitats in restored wetlands, but did not differ between macrophytes and sediments in extant wetlands. Species composition of diatom assemblages was not significantly different between plants and sediments in both restored and extant wetlands. The observed differences in non-diatom algae could not be attributed to any measured environmental variable; however, diatom assemblage differences between habitats increased with light irradiance. Differences in sediment diatom assemblages were observed between restored and extant wetlands and were related to differences in nutrients, pH, and canopy cover. Differences were also observed between epiphytic diatom assemblages in restored and extant wetlands and they were related to light and dissolved oxygen. In summary, differences in light and nutrient availability were the main environmental factors differentiating algal communities in wetlands.

AB  - There has been little experimental work in West Africa that distinguishes grazing from climate effects on rangeland vegetation. In the absence of such knowledge, the recurrence of boom-bust cycles in livestock populations, along with the seemingly degraded state of semiarid range, have been used to support notions of the inevitability of overgrazing. Regional stocking rates are used as indicators of degradation potential. I argue that the persistent reliance by environmental analysts on carrying-capacity models oversimplifies range ecology and excludes social processes from causal analyses. Both regional stocking rates and the seasonality of livestock distributions should be treated as proximate factors, each affected by biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. The common assumption that the size of local livestock populations is primarily affected by bioclimatic factors results from a misunderstanding of the pastoral economy. A case study examines the underlying causes of the cattle population boom in the Maasina during the 1960s. Rather than being solely a biological phenomenon, growth in the Maasina cattle population resulted from the historical confluence of inoculation programs with greater local demand for covert accumulation brought about by the changing social relations between the Fulbetae and the Rimaybetae.

KW  - TRANSPORT
AB  - Both aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity information can be detected in riverine water environmental DNA (eDNA). However, the effectiveness of using riverine water eDNA to simultaneously monitor the riverine and terrestrial biodiversity information remains unidentified. Here, we proposed that the monitoring effectiveness could be approximated by the transportation effectiveness of land-to-river and upstream-to-downstream biodiversity information flows and described by three new indicators. Subsequently, we conducted a case study in a watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results demonstrated that there was higher monitoring effectiveness on summer or autumn rainy days than in other seasons and weather conditions. The monitoring of the bacterial biodiversity information was more efficient than the monitoring of the eukaryotic biodiversity information. On summer rainy days, 43-76% of species information in riparian sites could be detected in adjacent riverine water eDNA samples, 92-99% of species information in riverine sites could be detected in a 1-km downstream eDNA sample, and half of dead bioinformation (the bioinformation labeling the biological material that lacked life activity and fertility) could be monitored 4-6 km downstream for eukaryotes and 13-19 km downstream for bacteria. The current study provided reference method and data for future monitoring projects design and for future monitoring results evaluation.

AB  - In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Wheat, Barley, fruits, vegetables, and fodders are the most common agricultural products. Agricultural sustainability depends on socioeconomic and climatic conditions. Proper crop selection is vital to maximize productivity, yielding more revenue to the farmer at a lower cost. To rank the crop alternatives based on the available natural resources and cost, a multicriterion based decision-making model (MCDM) may be applied to identify the best suitable crop, encouraging sustainable agricultural practices. To make the agricultural activities sustainable, most of the critical criteria are taken into account. Four criteria linked to sustainability are included in this study. The research focuses on developing a model for sustainable agricultural practices in KSA employing MCDM. Three MCDM techniques were employed to evaluate the most suitable crop, and the results are compared and validated. The results from all three methods gave consistent results. Fruits emerged as the most productive crop, followed by Wheat, vegetables, fodders, and Barley. Such methodology shall be further extended across the other regions and over various crops for sustainable agricultural practices. The study is expected to help the Ministry of Water, Environment, and Agriculture, KSA, draft a suitable agricultural policy.

AB  - Biodiversity offsetting aims to mitigate the impacts of development through habitat restoration or creation. Biodiversity net gain seeks to go further by achieving an increase in biodiversity. There is further interest in the wider ecosystem services impacts of development, although this broader scope may increase the resources re-quired for assessments. We apply a habitat map based approach to biodiversity and ecosystem services net gain on a site in central Scotland where there is a proposal combining development, land use change and habitat creation. The results suggest that biodiversity net gain can be achieved through trading-up to more distinctive habitats and improving habitat condition. The loss of ecosystem services was not offset, whether considering the potential for the affected habitats to supply services, or the demand for services as indicated by their value. However, the valuation did not account for changes in the numbers of service beneficiaries, although these will increase the value of services the pressure on supply is also increased. The broadening of the application of ecosystem services assessments into planning and development also creates trade-offs between the sophistication of assessment approaches and their usability by non-specialist practitioners.

AB  - Litterfall plays an important role in nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility in terrestrial ecosystems. We gauged the effects of anthropogenic impacts on the production, decomposition and seasonality of litterfall in primary and secondary forests within a tropical landscape of the Brazilian Amazon. We hypothesized that leaf litter quantity and quality would differ in line with forest disturbance and that these changes would translate into dissimilar decomposition rates. If proved, these processes could be used as surrogates for indentifying the ecological status of forest habitats. The obtained results have shown that, in the study area litterfall is reduced and litter decomposition is braked in disturbed habitats when compared with primary and recovered secondary forests. Also, within similar climatic conditions, the litter production and decomposition rates begin to stabilize in mature secondary forests. Our results represent a useful contribution to understand the dynamics of the litterfall and litter decomposition processes in the neotropics. Both processes were correlated and sensitive to disturbance gradients and should used as forest recovery indicators in ecological monitoring and ecological restoration studies.

AB  - We hypothesize that the physical features of river habitats and anthropogenic hydromorphological alterations influence macrophyte communities and lead to habitat fragmentation. Sampling included 1081 contiguous survey units positioned in the main channel and side arms along 588 km of the Danube River, along its middle course. To identify habitat fragments, Multivariate Regression Tree analysis (MRT) was applied on macrophyte and environmental data. Indicator species analyses were combined with MRT. To identify habitat fragments on a scale larger than final MRT groups, we set thresholds for an MRT complexity parameter. We identified 20 fine, 7 medium, and 3 large scale habitat fragments. Damming was the main fragmentation agent. Macrophyte communities show continuous variation at all scales of habitat fragmentation. High species diversity indicates major anthropogenic alteration of the river's hydrology and decline of the natural riparian zone. Future studies of themacrophyte communities, and their habitat fragmentation must include more factors (e.g. nutrient status, physicochemical quality of the water, etc.), as well as assessment of the importance of tributaries.

AB  - Increase agricultural output is conditioned by a number of factors, among which the protection of plants against pests plays a very important role. Along with chemical methods, methods of biological and integrated control against harmful organisms in crops have recently taken on a large scale, and one of these methods is the use of entomophages (predators and parasites). In order to identify and monitor species of entomophagous arthropods from the winter wheat culture, in the years 2016, 2017, an experiment was carried out in two locations in the center of Transylvania, namely in Turda in open field agroecosystem and in Boldut, in agroecosystem with protective agroforestry curtains. The field results were calculated and interpreted using ecological indices (abundance, dominance, constancy, and W ecology significance index). In addition to the monitoring of the entomophages, production and some of its components were determined. Entomophagous arthropods identified in the two agroecosystems differ only in ecological indicators, belonging to the same groups of entomophagous. The positive role of the agroforestry curtains in Boldut reflected both on the abundance of entomophages and wheat production, obtaind an 8% production increase compared to the production made in the unprotected system in Turda.

AB  - Rich and diverse molluscan assemblages have been found in calcareous tufa exposed in the valley of the Skalski stream in the Pieniny Mountains. 59 samples representing 10 profiles were subjected to malacological analysis. Very rich malacofauna (over 20 000 specimens belonging to 78 species) was the basis for carried out reconstruction. Three faunistic assemblages differing in composition and structure, as well as age, were separated. The oldest of them (the assemblage with shade-loving species) is characteristic of forest habitats and corresponds to the Middle Holocene (Atlantic Phase). Two younger assemblages (the assemblage with open-country species and the assemblage with Bythinella austriaca) represent historical period. The first of the mentioned is characteristic of the agricultural zones subjected to strong anthropogenic impact on the environment, mainly deforestation. The second one is typical of areas with unfavourable terrain conditions which are therefore not used for agricultural purposes. Such a diversity in malacocenosis allows the assessment of the degree of anthropogenic changes to the environment and of the intensity of anthropogenic impact on the environment.

AB  - Data on bryophyte species diversity in the Nagliai Strict Nature Reserve (Curonian Spit, Lithuania) are presented. Bryophyte diversity and their patterns of distribution across different habitats were analysed. Species richness, biotal dispersity, Shannon's diversity and evenness indices were used for the evaluation of bryophyte diversity in various habitats, and the Jaccard and Bray-Curtis coefficients employed for comparisons of similarity. A total of 75 species were recorded for the territory (32 in grasslands and 62 in forests). Two species and three varieties were new to Lithuania, and four species and one variety were new to the Curonian Spit. Variations in bryophyte species richness and relative abundance of the most frequently encountered species were observed for fore-dune grassland, sand plain and dune ridges.
   Distinct species composition was ascertained for various substrata located in both dry and wet forests. The most frequent species occurring throughout the territory were those that favoured dry conditions and grow on different substrata, whereas obligate epixyles and epiphytes were rare. Species preferring full light were the most frequently encountered taxa in grassland habitats.

AB  - Diazinon is a widely used organophosphorus pesticide in agriculture and environmental health, hence its adverse effects on non target animals, especially on fish is to be determined. The present research is conducted to study the influence of diazinon [0, 0-diethyl 0-(2-isopropyl-6-methylpyrimidin-4yl) phosphorothioate] on acetylcholinestrase (AChE) and lipidperoxidation (LPO) on freshwater common carp (Cyprinus carpi L.). Adult fish (mean body weight 42.6 +/- 3.86 g and 19.1 +/- 2.66 cm mean length) were divided into five groups with 3 replicates and subjected to 5 concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mu g L-1) of diazinon for 30 days and compared with control (untreated) fish. Fishes were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days and then Physio-chemical characteristic of water was determined before the treatment. Induction of oxidative stress in various tissues was evidence of increased lipid peroxidation levels seems to be associated with the concentration of diazinon. Acetylcholinesterase activity responded positively in a concentration dependent pattern. It was concluded that LPO and AChE could be a valuable biomarker as an indicator of water pollution on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Late spring frost disturbances have significant ecological and physiological impacts on forests. Frost-induced cambial damage that occurs when cells are actively dividing can result in the formation of frost rings, abnormal modifications to wood anatomy within the annual growth rings of an injured tree. Frost rings are indicators of growing season frost damage to the cambium and therefore have potential to be used both as a proxy in the reconstruction of extreme climatic events and to identify frost-prone environmental conditions. In this study, we measured the occurrence of earlywood frost rings across cambial age and diameter class in 11 jack pine (Pinus banksiana) populations of northern lower Michigan. Earlywood frost ring formation was greater in younger trees and in trees with smaller diameters. Biotic (cambial age, diameter, and ring width) and abiotic (elevation, initial site-related growth rate, and minimum temperature) factors demonstrated significant influence on the probability of earlywood frost ring formation. When using frost rings as a proxy of historical climate, susceptibility to abrupt freezing temperatures during the growing season and thus the ability of an individual tree to record a frost disturbance should be considered.

Most indicators for ecosystem change require timeseries data, but here a new method is proposed enabling inference of vegetation boundary movement from one snapshot' (e.g. an aerial photograph or satellite image) in time. The method compares the average spatial position of frontrunners of both communities along the vegetation boundary. Mathematical analyses and simulation modeling show that the average frontrunner position of retreating communities is always farther away from a so-called optimal vegetation boundary as compared to that of the expanding community. This feature does not depend on assumptions about plant dispersal or competition characteristics. The method is tested with snapshot data of a northern hardwood-boreal forest mountain ecotone in Vermont, a forest-mire ecotone in New Zealand and a subalpine treeline-tundra ecotone in Montana. The direction of vegetation boundary movement is accurately predicted for these case studies, but we also discuss potential caveats. With the availability of snapshot data rapidly increasing, the method may provide an easy tool to assess vegetation boundary movement and hence ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Ecological indicators were synthesized to identify ecologically significant and priority areas within each province/administrative territory of Pakistan. We compiled the spatial distribution of six aspects of ecological value for geographical targeting of conservation priority areas. A Geographic Information System (GIS) based overlay analysis of ecological dynamics was carried out. Indices for forest cover, vegetation zones, endemic mammals, highly significant wetlands, bird species richness and mammal species richness were developed by compiling the secondary data into Geographic Information System. Analytical hierarchy process was used to weight these indicators and also multi-attribute utility theory to combine them into a single spatial layer of ecological value. On the basis of these indices each district was ranked within its respective province/administrative territory. The results highlighted ranking of districts in order of their ecological significance within the province for all the provinces/administrative territories. The study is a pioneer study to identify administrative areas of high ecological value and can guide in setting the conservation priorities. The current broad scale study can help decision makers in provincial level policy making. In the highly significant districts, development activities should require special attention to assess their environmental impacts. In contrast, for the least significant districts a set of indicators can be identified and shared with the District Governments to improve and monitor their ecological conditions.

AB  - Nightlight surveys are commonly used to evaluate status and trends of crocodilian populations, but imperfect detection caused by survey- and location-specific factors makes it difficult to draw population inferences accurately from uncorrected data. We used a two-stage hierarchical model comprising population abundance and detection probability to examine recent abundance trends of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in subareas of Everglades wetlands in Florida using nightlight survey data. During 2001-2008, there were declining trends in abundance of small and/or medium sized animals in a majority of subareas, whereas abundance of large sized animals had either demonstrated an increased or unclear trend. For small and large sized class animals, estimated detection probability declined as water depth increased. Detection probability of small animals was much lower than for larger size classes. The declining trend of smaller alligators may reflect a natural population response to the fluctuating environment of Everglades wetlands under modified hydrology. It may have negative implications for the future of alligator populations in this region, particularly if habitat conditions do not favor recruitment of offspring in the near term. Our study provides a foundation to improve inferences made from nightlight surveys of other crocodilian populations.

AB  - 1. Understanding evolutionary responses to global climate warming can be dauntingly complex. But, primarily, it requires careful quantification of rates of temporal change of biomonitors.
   2. Long-term biomonitoring programs capitalize on traits for which there already exist retrospective measurements. Those programs are thus faced with the decision as to the appropriate time to update historical records, especially in species whose gene frequencies cycle over the successive seasons. In these cases, the time during the year at which descendant populations are sampled needs to take into account effects of the lengthening growing season that can impose direct selection on specific genotypes and, concomitantly, indirect selection on photoperiodic response.
   3. Standardising new and past collections by calendar date can lead to an overestimation of the magnitude of long-term responses to global warming; standardising by equivalent seasonal temperature conditions can lead to an underestimation of the magnitude of long-term responses to global warming.
   4. The results of a recent monitoring study with Drosophila indicate that caution should be exercised in how the updating of historical records is used to quantify evolutionary responses to global warming.

AB  - Lichens are widely used to assess the atmospheric pollution by heavy metals and radionuclides. However, few studies are available in publications on using lichens to qualitatively assess the atmospheric pollution levels. The paper presents research results applying epiphytic lichens as bio-monitors of quantitative atmospheric contamination with uranium. The observations were conducted during 2.5 years in the natural environment. Two experimental sites were used: one in the vicinity of a uranium contamination source, the other one - at a sufficient distance away to represent the background conditions. Air and lichens were sampled at both sites monthly. Epiphytic lichens Hypogimnia physodes were used as bio-indicators. Lichen samples were taken from various trees at about 1.5 m from the ground. Air was sampled with filters at sampling stations. The uranium content in lichen and air samples as well as isotopic mass ratios U-235/U-238 were measured by mass-spectrometer technique after uranium pre-extraction. Measured content of uranium were 1.45 mg kg(-1) in lichen at 2.09E-04 mu g m(-3) in air and 0.106 mg kg(-1) in lichen at 1.13E-05 mu g m(-3) in air.

AB  - The quantification of chromosomal damages in root tip meristem cells of spruce trees was used to characterize natural spruce stands at the altitude profiles Achenkirch and Loisach-Valley in the Northern Tyrol Calcareous Alps. The number of chromosomal aberrations amounted to 4 - 8%. The highest rates, indicating lowest site qualities, could be observed at particular plots between 970 in and 1250 in. These results were obtained on young trees from the stand regeneration and, simultaneously, on cloned trees exposed at the sites for at least 3 months.
   For calibration, these data were compared to responses of cloned spruce trees to different experimental exposures to clean air, ambient air, and ozone: Under clean air conditions, root meristematic tissues of spruce trees responded with 2% of chromosomal aberrations, whereas the root tip tissues from trees grown under ambient air showed up to 5% of chromosomal defects. Ozone treatments (100 nl l(-1)) induced a significant, long-lasting increase of aberrations.
   Although an identification of specific stressors is not possible in the field, these investigations provide a risk assessment at natural spruce stands: Aberration rates of 5% indicate average site qualities, and increased rates point to stress impacts on trees.

AB  - Treated wastewater may provide an effective alternative for meeting agriculture's demands and increase freshwater resources for other needs. Disinfection of treated wastewater protects the receivers; nevertheless, hazards of handling disinfectants, and the fact that some of them do not remove certain pathogenic and opportunistic organisms, are two main reasons for undertaking research in this field. Ecotoxicity of effluent from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant, subjected to disinfection by chlorination, ozonation and UV irradiation, was investigated under laboratory conditions. The efficiency of bacterial inactivation was examined: microorganisms were sensi-tive to chlorine and UV disinfection, however, they were more resistant to ozonation. Ecotoxicity was evaluated on samples before disinfection and on disinfected samples in which the bacterial inactivation level was similar. Immobilization, growth and enzymatic ecotoxicological tests were performed using consumers, producers and decomposers, respectively. UV irradiation had the least negative impact on the tested bioindicators. Although some studies have shown opposite trends, it has been proved that ozonation and chlorination increase the toxicity of treated wastewater. This study suggests that the wide application of disinfectants to wastewater should be reviewed because, under the experimental conditions tested, they were able to cause harmful effects on one or more of the species tested and they could adversely affect biodiversity in the environment.

AB  - Ocean-atmosphere climatic interactions, such as those resulting from El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are known to influence sea level, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and rainfall in the western Pacific region, through to the north-west Australian Ningaloo coast. Mangroves are ecologically important refuges for biodiversity and a rich store of blue carbon. Locations such as the study site (Mangrove Bay, a World Heritage Site within Ningaloo Marine Park and Cape Range National Park) are at the aridity range-limit which means trees are small in stature, forests small in area, and are potentially susceptible to climate variability such as ENSO that brings lower sea level and higher temperature. Here we explore the relationship between mangrove dieback, and canopy condition with climatic variables and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)-a measure of ENSO intensity, through remote sensing classification of Landsat satellite missions across a 29 year period at a north-west Australian site. We find that the SOI, and seasonal mean minimum temperature are strongly correlated to mangrove green canopy (as indicator of live canopy) area. This understanding of climate variations and mangrove temporal heterogeneity (patterns of abundance and condition) highlights the sensitivity and dynamics of this mangrove forest and recommends further research in other arid and semi-arid tropical regions at mangrove range-limits to ascertain the extent of this relationship.

AB  - Sec-butyl alcohol (SBA), an important chemical intermediate, is widely used in the synthesis of methyl ethyl ketone, herbicides and other products. However, there are some problems, such as high energy consumption and high equipment investment, in the traditional method of SBA production. With the mature application of the synthesis method of sec-butyl acetate (SBAC) in industry, the excess capacity of SBAC gradually appears. The synthesis of SBA from SBAC has become a research hotspot. SBA synthesized via the hydrolysis of SBAC has the advantages of fewer byproducts and wide sources of raw materials, but it has the limitation of a low degree of hydrolysis. In this study, based on Douglas's economic optimization model, taking the total annual cost (TAC) as the objective function, the influencing factors and suitable operating conditions of the SBAC hydrolysis reactive extractive distillation process were explored, and TAC was obtained under the optimal operating conditions. The environmental performance of the process was studied according to life cycle analysis. The exergy efficiency was obtained based on thermodynamic analysis. The process was analyzed from the aspects of exergy, environment and economy, which provided theoretical guidance for the industrial design of the new SBA process.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess the reliability of a wireless sensor network (WSN) equipped with mini photovoltaic cells (PV-WSN), simulating forest fire conditions. Our assessment considers the hardware specifications of WSN sensors, photovoltaic (PV) cells, rechargeable batteries, communication protocols, and elements required for efficient fire detection. Our study's main assumptions are that: the PV-WSN is structured randomly with one sink per cluster and identical sensors used, random losses due to environmental interference to the network and variability of PV-cell orientation are accounted for, the shape of forest fire propagation is uniform and elliptical, the surrounding vegetation is homogeneous, and packets lost during transmission are retransmitted with the use of a dynamic source routing protocol. Physical hardware specifications were included in our reliability assessments for each network type and a realistic battery re-charge/depletion scenario based on sensor states, sun availability, and PV efficiency was considered for a PV-WSN. We developed a simulator to study and to compare how the PV-WSN behaved differently under different forest fire conditions. Our results support the use of a PV-WSN, as network lifetime can be efficiently prolonged in the context of large-scale fire detection with this setup.

AB  - Long-term impacts of drought, such as groundwater decline, can emerge during a persisting drought. Though not easily visible, they are severe and harder to cope with. Groundwater is considered a resilient source during drought in semi-arid areas. In this paper the response of a coastal aquifer to meteorological drought severity is investigated. The relation between drought severity and natural undisturbed coastal aquifer flow conditions is determined, based on the seawater intrusion extent, at a temporal scale. The Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) is used to assess the meteorological drought severity, since it incorporates precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, which both affect the recharge processes. Recharge volumes for different timeseries, estimated through a hydrological model, are used as input to a transient variable-density and salt transport numerical model. An indicator based on the freshwater volume and RDI index, are used to assess the aquifer response to drought. The multi-year drought effect is also investigated. The results show that the RDI index can be utilised successfully to associate the meteorological drought with aquifer flow conditions. Specifically, a reliable early prediction of the freshwater availability at the end of the hydrological year can be achieved by the RDI of the first semester. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seep carbonates, the product of cold seep fluids mediated by microbial activity, archive information on seabed fluid flow and microbiological processes that led to their formation. Sedimentary fabrics are well developed in the authigenic carbonate from active seep sites at Bush Hill, Green Canyon Block 185 of the Gulf of Mexico. This authigenic carbonate has much lower carbon isotope values than typical marine cements and the carbonate is concluded to be derived from the oxidation of seeping petroleum. The authigenic fabrics commonly exhibit microbial or texturally unique sedimentary structures; e.g. framboidal pyrite, clotted microfabric and peloid, botryoidal aragonite, microfilament, and rosette-like aragonite are all preserved in seep carbonate. These fabrics are indicators of biological influence during microbial oxidation of petroleum and sulfate reduction when cold fluids seep on to the seabed. The textures are therefore considered as additional evidence that can be used to identify and interpret ancient cold-fluid seeps on seafloor. The difficulty of the preservation of these biogenic fabrics is thought to be related to the redox condition and dynamic signature (e.g. rate of fluid flow) of cold seeps.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that tobacco plants are tolerant of perchlorate and will accumulate perchlorate in plant tissues. This research determined the uptake, translocation, and accumulation of perchlorate in tobacco plants. Three hydroponics growth studies were completed under greenhouse conditions. Depletion of perchlorate in the hydroponics nutrient solution and accumulation of perchlorate in plant tissues were determined at two-day intervals using ion chromatography. Perchlorate primarily accumulated in tobacco leaves, yielding a substantial storage capacity for perchlorate. Mass balance results show that perchlorate degradation was negligible in plants. Tobacco plants were shown to effectively accumulate perchlorate over a wide range of initial concentrations ( 10 ppb to 100 ppm) from the hydroponics solution. Results suggest that tobacco plants are potential plants for the phytoremediation of perchlorate. A mathematical model was developed to describe the distribution of perchlorate in tobacco plants under rapid growth conditions. The Plant Kinetic (PK) model defined a plant as a set of compartments, described by mass balance differential equations and plant-specific physiological parameters. Data obtained from a separate hydroponics growth study with multiple solution perchlorate concentrations were used to validate predicted root, stem, and leaf concentrations. There was good agreement between model predictions and measured concentrations in the plant. The model, once adequately validated, can be applied to other terrestrial plants and inorganic chemicals currently used for both phytoremediation and ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Anaerobically digested sewage sludge is currently applied to farmland surrounding Tucson, Arizona to supply nutrients for the growth of cotton. Bacterial pathogens introduced into the environment by this practice may survive or move through the soil profile thus posing health risks to animals and humans. We have conducted both laboratory and field studies to monitor the survival and transport of bacterial pathogens added to soil via sludge. In laboratory studies, sewage sludge was added to soil and incubated at constant moisture and temperature conditions. Populations of fecal streptococci, fecal coliforms and total coliforms were monitored at weekly intervals using the Most Probable Number (MPN) method. Two soils and 3 temperatures were evaluated. Field studies determined the survival of indicator organisms in the surface horizon, and survival and transport of fecal coliforms up to a depth of 300 cm. We found that soil moisture, texture and temperature all affected the persistence of bacterial pathogens in sludge amended soil. Survival of organisms increased with increasing soil moisture and clay content, and with decreased soil temperatures. In the field, when soil moisture content increased after rainfall events, regrowth of indicator organisms occurred. Soil acted as an efficient filter negating bacterial transport, and thus fecal coliforms did not appear to migrate through the soil profile under non-irrigated conditions.

T2  - ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS
LA  - English
AB  - Pyrite formed by the inversion of marcasite or by oxidative leaching of pyrrhotite can be recognized in polished sections by the following characteristics, compiled from synthetic pyrite after marcasite and natural samples of pyrite after marcasite and after pyrrhotite. Pyrite formed by inversion from marcasite is characterized by approximately 2 modal percent pore space, no by-products filling the pores, optical anisotropy (dark green to dark red), anhedral shape, and polycrystalline daughter pyrite domains in two orientations relative to the marcasite parent crystal. Pyrite or marcasite formed by oxidative dissolution (as opposed to leaching) of pyrrhotite exhibits up to 32 modal percent pore space, gaps between the pyrite and parent pyrrhotite, pores and gaps filled with by-product siderite, magnetite, hisingerite, or other Fe-bearing phase, optically isotropic character (for pyrite), development of crystal faces, and random orientation relative to the parent pyrrhotite. Marcasite formed by oxidative leaching of Fe (as opposed to complete dissolution) from pyrrhotite also exhibits a large amount of pore space but has preferred orientation relative to the parent pyrrhotite.
   Pyrite after marcasite may be used as an indicator of pH < 5 and T < ca 240-degrees-C during deposition of the parent marcasite. Marcasite precipitated following dissolution of pyrrhotite is also indicative of those conditions during alteration. Marcasite formed by oxidative leaching of pyrrhotite cannot be used as evidence of those conditions, however.

AB  - The recycling of printed circuit boards (PCBs) causes environmental problems by releasing dioxins and furans. The objective of this study is the recovery of copper from PCBs through the bioleaching process using Aspergillus niger which was isolated from the surface of Abu Tartur phosphate. In the bioleaching process, the optimum conditions were used to modify ammonium medium with inoculum spore size are 2.10(6) SFU/50 ml for 5 days at 30 degrees C in a pulp of 0.5% solid 150 mesh particle size and aeration at 200 rpm. Different carbon and nitrogen sources were used. Glucose (1.5%) and ammonium chloride (0.2%) were the best source of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. Also, the optimum initial medium's pH was 7. At these conditions, about 100% of Cu was extracted. The mechanism of bioleaching was studied by detecting the production of organic acid through using brome cresol green as an indicator and HPLC analysis. The color change of agar medium of the incubated plate with A. niger from blue to yellow, and HPLC analysis showed detection malic and citric acids in the sample in presence e-waste higher than the sample without e-waste. E-waste before and after the bioleaching process was investigated using SEM. The surface of e-waste becomes more smooth and porous due to the bioleaching process.

AB  - As global warming worsens, climatic conditions in many regions are undergoing profound change, which could influence certain industries, such as agriculture and transportation, and affect the livability of cities. In this study, cities statistics and meteorological station data of the past decade in China were used to analyze the effect of climate change on cities livability. The livability of 288 Chinese cities during 2006-2016 was assessed using an analytic hierarchy process method. Results showed the mean cities livability index in China has improved about 12% throughout the past decade. Moreover, the Moran's I statistic and local indicators of spatial association revealed that the distribution of cities livability reflects a trend of gradual spatial agglomeration. In addition, geostatistical analysis was used to evaluate the impact of extreme weather events on cities livability. It was established that heatwaves and extreme precipitation events have significant impact on the livability of cities in southern China, whereas freezing weather drives the change of urban livability in northern areas. Combinations of different extreme weather conditions will have greater impact on urban livability. Based on mobile phone user data, the relationship between livability change and climate change in Chinese cities was elucidated to provide reference for urban environmental management.

AB  - The potential leaching of organic micropollutants from swimming accessories was studied in the laboratory experiment. Seventeen different swimming accessories have been placed in various water matrices under different conditions in order to reproduce the actual environmental conditions of swimming pool water. The presence of micropollutants in water samples, after the exposure of swimming accessories, was assessed using indirect indicators (Total Organic Carbon and Phenol Index) and directly using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer with electron ionization. A wide range of organic compounds emitted from swimming accessories have been identified. The most common in tested samples was isophorone. The frequency of its occurrence in 50 swimming pools located in Poland was equal to 89% in concentrations ranged from 0.75 to 1.01 mu g L-1 (below the concentration of 40 mu g L-1, which is estimated to increase the cancer risk). Content of combined chlorine (1.52-3.16 mgCl(2 )L(-1)) in chlorinated matrices indicated a high potential for disinfection by products (DBPs) formation from organic matter emitted into pool water from swimming accessories. Ten of seventeen tested samples showed the toxic effect, measured as the bioluminescence inhibition of bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri.

AB  - Paper presents the results of complex gas-geochemical studies of bottom sediments of the East Siberian Sea along the meridional profile from Cape Billings to the Mendeleev Ridge. Abnormal concentrations of methane (up to 2.4% vol.) and hydrogen (up to 600 ppm) are controlled by neotectonic faults and are typical for the areas of gas hydrate formation. The carbon isotope composition indicates the predominance of the thermogenic component. When studying the chemical composition of sediments, the data helped to identify the permeability zones of neotectonic faults that have favorable conditions for the concentration of a number of elements: Mn, Cu, Ag. Such zones are characterized by the gas anomalies in sediments (methane, hydrogen, etc.). The accumulation of anomalous metal contents is facilitated by specific geological conditions that occur in zones of gas anomalies within tectonically active structures, where fine-grained sediments enriched with organic matter are present. The gas-geochemical fields formed in this pattern can be applied as indicators in forecasting of hydrocarbon accumulations, for mapping permeable fault zones, and for the environmental impact assessing of hydrocarbon anomalies. This approach could be especially effective in the basins with low seismic activity such as seas of East Siberian shelf and some of the marginal seas of Pacific Ocean, for instance, East Sea.

AB  - The feasibility of scheduling deficit irrigation using maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) was evaluated during two consecutive seasons in a citrus orchard planted with mature 'Clementina de Nules' trees, in Valencia, Spain. Results showed that MDS in well irrigated trees varied largely according to the environmental conditions (higher correlation was obtained with global radiation), and therefore, the absolute values of MDS cannot be employed as the only variable to schedule irrigation. To avoid the effects of the climatic conditions we scheduled deficit irrigation using the MDS ratio, which is the MDS of any treatment related to the MDS of a control, well irrigated, treatment located in the same plot. We explored the feasibility of scheduling irrigation based on the MDS ratio in a deficit irrigated treatment, where water was applied as necessary, from July until mid October, in order to maintain the MDS values at 125% of that of the control treatment. Despite the large variability observed in the MDS measurements in both years no significant reduction in yield and fruit weight was observed in the deficit irrigated treatment compared with the control, allowing seasonal water saving between 18 and 12%.

AB  - We have examined the functional characteristics of microglia in an environment where the cytoarchitecture of the brain is preserved. Using organotypic slice culture under serum-free conditions, microglia initially demonstrated a rounded morphology but after 10 days in vitro (DIV), microglia in the slice were highly branched. Stimulation of the microglia at 4 DIV with phorbol ester significantly increased the number of cells stained with nitroblue tetrazolium, an indicator of superoxide anion production, compared to non-stimulated conditions. At 10 DIV, superoxide anion production was significantly less than that seen at 4 DIV and no increase in production was seen with phorbol ester stimulation. Phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads and chemotaxis of microglia in response to zymosan activated serum was also reduced at 10 DIV compared to 4 DIV, These experiments indicate that microglia at 4 DIV in tissue slice culture have functional characteristics that resemble microglia in primary culture. However, prolonged culture of the slices results in a return of the microglia to a ramified and functionally down-regulated state, reminiscent of an "in vivo"-like environment. The organotypic slice culture, thus, provides a useful model system ito examine the interactions of microglia with neurons and other glia in the normal and injured brain. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This study has investigated the impact of the adaption of environmental accounting practices on the firm performance and environmental efficiency respectively through an empirical approach.
   Methodology: In this research the environmental accounting practice has been defined and measured using three constructs namely positive environmental strategy, financial condition and government enforcement. Environmental efficiency has been measured using the scale developed by Doorasamy, (2014) and firm performance has been measured using the scale developed by Ismail and King, (2005). Quantiative primary data has been collected from 323 respondents working in the finance department of select sugar manufacturing companies in the northern part of India through stratified disproportionate random sampling technique. Analysis of the data has been done using MLR through SPSS software
   Findings: The application of Multiple Linear Regression on the data collected reveals that the variable financial performance is found to explain 56% of the variable environmental accounting practices and the variable environmental efficiency explains 83.1% of the variable environmental accounting practices revealing a good model fit
   Originality/Value: There are very few numbers of studies so far done with respect to Indian sugar cane industries' environmental accounting practices. This study has addresed the gap. Original conceptual model has been developed and tested through empirical approach.

AB  - Water shortage is a common problem around the world, especially in rural areas of developing countries. Water shortage is closely linked to natural and social conditions, and the linkages between these natural and social conditions and their underlying spatial and temporal variations are less well explored in rural areas. The water poverty index (WPI) is a holistic tool for resource planning and management and is an effective tool in solving water shortage problems in developing countries through water resources managements. This study defines five components and 19 indicators using the WPI and assigns integrated weights to measure water poverty in rural China from 1997 to 2016. The results show that the level of water poverty has been gradually declining over time, and the improvements in the coastal and inland water poverty situation are not harmonious. This study also analyzes spatial and temporal variations of water poverty in rural China by the kernel estimation (KDE) and the exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) models. Hence, specific areas require special policy interventions. The research findings are intended to provide a new insight for the evaluation of water poverty in the context of sustainable development and to provide a strategy for regional water resource management to relieve rural water poverty in developing countries.

AB  - Ante-mortem stress is recognized as one of the factors that could reduce shelf life in fish, although this topic has been scarcely addressed in crustaceans, particularly in cultivated penaeid shrimp where common harvest practices involves stressful conditions such as chasing, emersion, and confinement. This study analyzes indices of freshness in shrimp in response to such practices before storage in ice for six days. During ice storage, several indicators follow the typical postmortem pattern, although most of them (hypoxanthine, change in pH, and color) did not reach critical levels at day 6. Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and degradation products (adenosine monophosphate, AMP, and inosine monophosphate, IMP), as well as several indicators of freshness (pH, expressible water, hardness, color, and the overall fatty acid composition) were not significantly affected by harvest. Other variables such as lower springiness, higher hypoxanthine, lipid hydroperoxides, and 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 ratio were observed in shrimp subjected to common harvest practices. However, under the current conditions of harvesting, these effects were marginal and probably do not substantially affect meat quality for human consumption, but care should be taken at higher environmental temperatures (e.g. harvest in summer) and for a duration of ice-storage over 6 days.

AB  - Current application of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) as an indicator of sewage contamination has its limitation and other alternative indicator systems are needed for enhanced monitoring of recreational water quality. To explore the potential use of human enteric viruses (HEV) as a potential indicator, human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV-7) was tested in this study as a model virus. Through spiked HAdV-7 into the sample seawater, different procedures for viral concentration and elution were comparatively analyzed in a side by-side fashion. Nearly 80% infectious viruses were recovered from the spiked seawater with the use of a magnetic stirring method and 1.0 mM NaOH as elution buffer. A viral plaque assay was established with optimized conditions for the detection and quantification of infectious HAdV and used to determine the stability of HAdV-7 in seawater and a possible correlation for HAdV detection between the viral infectivity assay and PCR. Findings from this study suggest it is possible to concentrate and recover infectious HAdV from environmental waters effectively with optimized laboratory conditions, which warrants the future test and establishment of using HEV as an alternative indicator of water quality.

AB  - Canadian peatlands are subject to disturbance and destruction, and drainage for agriculture is responsible for 85% of this degradation Few studies have explicitly addressed the effects of habitat degradation on arthropod diversity in Nearctic peatlands Because higher Diptera (Brachycera) in peatlands are diverse, are an important component of food webs, and exhibit a wide range of ecological requirements, we examined species richness, abundance, and community composition of Brachycera across transects at 1, 6, and 11 m from a collector drainage ditch in Johnville Bog and Forest Park, Quebec In total, 1453 Brachycera were collected, representing 24 families and 166 species Species diversity (based on Simpson's diversity index) and rarefaction-estimated species richness were higher at 6 and 11 m than at 1 m from the ditch, probably because of the homogeneous moss cover and moister conditions at greater distance from the ditch. Species composition also differed between 1 m and other distances, based on cluster analysis, multiresponse permutation procedures analysis, and the presence of five predaceous species that were significant indicator species 1 m from the drainage ditch. Our results suggest that anthropogenic degradation of hydrological conditions may be responsible for the low species richness and high dominance of a few species currently seen at the ditch margin

AB  - This study adds to the literature on subjective well-being and life satisfaction by exploring variation in individual life satisfaction across countries. Understanding whether and how individual life satisfaction varies across countries is important because if the goal of development is to increase well-being, we must identify the causes of well-being in different national and regional contexts. Using hierarchical linear modeling techniques, I test the hypothesis that individual well-being does vary across countries, and that national wealth, human development and environmental conditions explain this variation. I also test whether the effects of individual characteristics on life satisfaction (including age, marital status, education, income, employment status, and sex) vary across countries, and which country level characteristics explain these variations. Using individual level data from the World Values Survey, I find that there is significant variation in life satisfaction across countries. There is also significant variation in the slopes of individual predictors of life satisfaction across countries and regions. Regional differences in the effects of individual characteristics on life satisfaction explain most of the between country variation in life satisfaction. This indicates that universal development indicators may not adequately reflect differences in life satisfaction across countries, and that development measurements should better reflect regional differences.

AB  - Measures of organic matter processing have been proposed as indices of stream ecosystem function to complement structural measures (water quality, taxonomic composition) in stream health monitoring. However, to be meaningful for ecosystem management, functional responses must be informed by knowledge of multiple stressors in the face of global change. We manipulated nutrient concentrations (two levels), fine sediment (two levels) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) in 128 streamside mesocosms to determine the individual and combined effects of these stressors on decomposition rates of fresh and pre-dried leaf packs and cotton strips. Raised temperature affected all seven studied decomposition measures. Leaf biomass loss rates were linearly positively affected, while strength loss rates of leaves and cotton strips showed nonlinear, weakly unimodal responses. Respiration of fresh leaves was positively affected by warming, but respiration of dried leaves showed the opposite pattern. Nutrient enrichment enhanced dried leaf biomass loss and respiration, and cotton tensile strength loss. Sediment addition increased loss of fresh leaf strength and biomass, but decreased dried leaf respiration. Interactions among stressors occurred in three cases. The positive effect of raised temperature on biomass loss of dried leaves was weaker in mesocosms with added sediment, the negative effect of sediment on dried leaf respiration annulled the positive effect of nutrients, and cotton strength loss increased strongly under enriched nutrients but less so when sediment was added.Synthesis and applications. Sediment greatly increased decay rates of fresh (living) leaves, but not of dried leaves or cotton strips. Leaf condition can strongly affect decomposition processes, with important consequences for streams that naturally receive freshly fallen leaves and have high sediment loads. Nonlinear responses of decomposition to rising temperature highlight how a warming climate may alter organic matter processing in complex ways. Our finding that dried leaf biomass loss responded positively to nutrient enrichment but not sediment addition, while fresh leaf biomass loss responded positively to sediment addition but not nutrient enrichment, suggests the two measures may offer complementary information in the functional assessment of multiple stressors in streams.

AB  - The Barreirinha Formation-Upper Devonian, is the main petroleum source rock of the Amazon Basin, deposited during the great Devonian Transgression, contributing to significant accumulations of organic matter (OM) in anoxic conditions, which allowed its preservation. The present work had the objective of characterizing the molecular composition of biomarkers in outcrops samples of the Barreirinha Formation, aiming to evaluate the paleoenvironment, thermal evolution, and the preservation of OM total organic carbon (TOC) and Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicate considerable amounts of immature OM deposited in a low oxygenation environment. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) data corroborate that the OM was deposited in a suboxic to the oxic environment and low salinity (absence or low relative abundance of beta-carotane and gammacerane). 24-N-Propyl-cholestane was detected and identified by synthetic pattern co-injection. High concentrations of tetracyclic polyprenoids (TPPs) in ascending order from base to top, high hopane/sterane ratios, to suggest that the samples had a high molecular weight n-alkanes, C29 steranes, low thermal evolution, and anoxic depositional paleoenvironment.

AB  - Arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) are pollutants presented in marine environment. A process of atomic fluorescence spectrometry was proposed for the simultaneous determination of As and Hg in marine sediment samples (n = 38) collected from the Changjiang River Estuary and adjacent East China Sea. The proposed method used an optimized pretreatment procedure in an aqua regia-H2O digestion system. Recoveries of As and Hg increased to 97% and 98%, respectively, with suitable precisions (2.7%-4.1%) under optimized process conditions. As and Hg were widely presented in these samples, with the ranges of content values were 2.39-8.77 mu g/g for As and 48.03-410.8 ng/g for Hg. Results indicate that anthropogenic factors strongly influence the abundances of As and Hg in investigated samples. The preliminary environmental risk assessment was investigated using the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and anthropogenic contribution rate (M). Findings reveal that Hg demonstrates a strong ecological risk (with average values of 1.3 and 72% for I-geo and M, respectively) in the sediments from the Changjiang River Estuary and adjacent East China Sea. Therefore, Hg should be considered in future investigations.

AB  - Wastewater pollution with organic toxic substances leads to many environmental problems. Industrial wastewater discharges pollute many water bodies which leads to serious damage to the flora and fauna of the aquatic ecosystem. 3 water samples were analyzed according to the contract HS-153/2-18 between the Oil Refinery named Heydar Aliyev and Baku State University. At the catalytic cracking unit of the oil refining industry water samples were taken and 15 PAHs, 13 phenolic compounds, 9 heavy metals were analyzed in the samples. All GC-MS analyzes were performed on a high-sensitivity Agilent 5975 mass detector equipped with an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph. Heavy metals were analyzed in ICP-OES, Optima 2100DV. Then photochemical reactions were considered in the presence of rutile TiO2 nanoparticles to purify phenol from wastewater. The course of the photochemical reaction was monitored on a "Varian Cary50" spectrophotometer. After the mixture was analyzed and the decomposition of phenol was 99%. The SEM, XRD analyzes of the TiO2 nanoparticles were performed in the Nano laboratory of Baku State University. The size of TiO2 nanoparticles used in the photochemical reaction ranged from 10 to 30 nm and TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol-gel method under mild conditions. The concentrations of the chemicals found in industrial effluent surpassed the allowed limit.

AB  - The methods conventionally used for the extraction of organic pollutants in different environmental matrices are not suitable for measuring low concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bioaccumulated in terrestrial snails that are both indicator of soil quality and a food item of various consumers including human being. A protocol, adapted from the QuEChERS method, originally designed for the extraction of pesticides in fruits and vegetables, in combination with gas chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was developed to assess the bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon extraction at low levels in soils to the soil quality bioindicator Cantareus aspersus. Bioaccumulation was measured in snails exposed ex situ for 28 days under controlled conditions to soils lightly or highly contaminated (sum of 16 molecules in the range 3.32-140 mg kg(-1) dry weight). The method was validated (low limits of detection, linear calibration curves, good precision and trueness) and found to be efficient to show that strongly contaminated soils were not necessarily those that presented the highest bioavailable organics concentrations. This methodology offers a tool to assess the environmental risk of contaminated soils and to prioritize the management of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-contaminated soils.

AB  - Agricultural land use and degradation of natural vegetation in riparian zones can impair water quality. This study was conducted in seven agricultural watersheds in Ibiruba, RS, Brazil, with the following objectives: identify relationships between concentrations of soluble phosphorus (Psol) and nitrate (NO3-) in surface water and agricultural use of soil and current vegetation in riparian zones, and assess the risk of eutrophication. Water samples from the main watercourses in each watershed were collected monthly from 10/2013 to 6/2014. Current land use was established by field surveys in the watersheds. The riparian zones of the watercourses were evaluated in terms of the condition of permanent preservation area (PPA) and access of the animals to the watercourses. The concentration of Psol and NO3- were correlated with land use indicators obtained from geoprocessing tools. Agricultural use of PPA increases the risk of surface water degradation, which increases through application of manure on crops and free access of livestock to PPAs and to these watercourses for drinking water. Surface water samples obtained showed water Psol concentrations that generate risk of eutrophication, whereas concentrations of NO3- were generally below critical levels.

AB  - Our study aimed to analyse the vegetation of the Borgotrebbia landfill in phytosociological and ecological terms, in order to contribute to the current knowledge of the landfill's vegetation, and to better understand the environmental characteristics of the area, with a view to its restoration. Five vegetation types were identified, all classified into the Stellarietea mediae class that includes annual ruderal communities. Ellenberg's and Landolt's indices shed light on the ecological characteristics of all the vegetation and five typologies. The vegetation of the study area indicates a moderately basic, semi-dry soil, rich in nutrients, low in humus and badly aerated. The high therophyte percentage indicates a stressed environment, the main cause of this stress being a marked edaphic aridity during the dry summer months. In these conditions, annual plants, which complete their life cycle in a short time after the spring precipitations, are favoured. Finally, the species variety within the various typologies of vegetation increases with a decrease in the percentage of species tolerating salts and heavy metals in the soil. As a consequence, this suggests a possible contamination of the soil in some of the areas.

AB  - We have been investigating an advanced sterilization system that employs active oxygen species (AOS). We designed the sterilization equipment, including an evacuation system, which generates AOS from pure oxygen gas using ultraviolet irradiation, in order to study the conditions necessary for sterilization in the system's chamber. Using Geobachillus stearothermophilus spores (10(6) CFU) in a sterile bag as a biological indicator (BI) in the chamber of the AOS sterilization apparatus, we examined the viability of the BI as a function of exposure time, assessing the role of the decompression level in the sterilization performance. We found that the survival curves showed exponential reduction, and that the decompression level did not exert a significant influence on the survival curve. Subsequently, we investigated the sterilization effect as influenced by the spatial and environmental temperature variation throughout the chamber, and found that the sterilization effect varied with position, due to the varying environmental temperature in the respective areas. We confirmed that temperature is one of the most important factors influencing sterilization in the chamber, and estimated the temperature effect on the distribution of atomic oxygen concentration, using the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method with fluorocarbon thin film prepared by radio frequency sputtering.

AB  - Poor diet quality frequently constrains the growth and reproduction of primary consumers, altering their population dynamics, interactions in food webs, and contributions to ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling. The identification and measurement of an animal's nutritional state are thus central to studying the connections between diet and animal ecology. Here we show how the nutritional state of a freshwater invertebrate, Daphnia magna, can be determined by analyzing its endogenous metabolites using hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics. With a multivariate analysis, we observed the differentiation of the metabolite composition of animals grown under control conditions (good food and no environmental stress), raised on different diets (low quantity, nitrogen limited, and phosphorus limited), and exposed to two common environmental stressors (bacterial infection and salt stress). We identified 18 metabolites that were significantly different between control animals and at least one limiting food type or environmental stressor. The unique metabolite responses of animals caused by inadequate nutrition and environmental stress are reflective of dramatic and distinctive effects that each stressor has on animal metabolism. Our results suggest that dietary-specific induced changes in metabolite composition of animal consumers hold considerable promise as indicators of nutritional stress and will be invaluable to future studies of animal nutrition.

AB  - A research project on the Saudi Gulf of Aqaba was initiated in January 2012 to evaluate, protect, and develop a proper management plan for sustainable use of water resources in the coastal region. Within the framework of this project, a total of 85 surface water samples was collected and investigated to document the surface distribution of the hydrographical parameters (including water temperature, salinity, density, hydrogen ion concentration, and dissolved oxygen) as well as concentration of the nutrient salts (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate). The results show no thermocline or thermal pollution in the studied water and that they are mostly well oxygenated. In addition, no significant variations in the pH and salinity values have been observed. Relatively low levels of nitrogen, phosphorus (in the dissolved and total forms), and reactive silicate are observed. Inorganic nitrogen is found in the order of NO3-N > NO2-N > NH4-N. On the basis of the relatively low level of nutrient salts, the Gulf of Aqaba coastal water is classified as oligotrophic to mesotrophic in nature, and the study area is not yet seriously affected by contamination in spite of rapid population growth and fast infrastructural/recreational development during the past decade.

AB  - In an area disturbed by long-term extraction of ores of non-ferrous metals as well as by their preparation and processing, unexplained effects of heavy metals (Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd) of different soil concentrations and various degrees of vegetation cover on the species diversity and abundance of ground beetles habitat specialists and generalists in heavily changed forest ecosystems were monitored so far. We found that in environments characterized by extreme concentrations of heavy metals some forest specialists may prefer poorly wooded sites to fully wooded sites in an effort to avoid contaminated environment. Nevertheless, the majority of species remain good site indicators even under these conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that all monitored variables had more or less significant effects on the spatial activity of ground beetles at the species level. Vegetation cover differentiating the species spectrum into forest and open habitat specialists proved to be a decisive factor. The analysis also revealed that forest specialists and generalists were, in addition to cover, associated with Mn concentrations and, on the contrary, responded negatively to the presence of Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and high pH values. Open-habitat specialists were associated reversely.

AB  - This work is part of a larger project, which aims at investigating the environmental sustainability of the Province of Siena and of its communes. by means of different indicators and methods of analysis. The research presented in this article uses ecological footprint and biocapacity as indicators to monitor the environmental conditions of the area of Siena, thus complementing previous studies carried out using Emergy. greenhouse gases balance and other methods. The calculations have been performed in such a way as to enable a disaaaregation of the final results according to the classical categories of ecologically productive land and of consumption; but also according to citizen's and public administration's areas of influence. This information allows us to investigate in detail the socioeconomic aspects of environmental resource use. Among the notable results; the Siena territory is characterized by a nearly breakeven total ecological balance, a result contrasting with the national average and most of the other Italian provinces. Furthermore, the analysis has been carried out at different spatial scales (province, districts and communes), highlighting an inhotnogeneous territorial structure consisting of subareas in ecological deficit compensated by zones in ecological surplus.

AB  - Gradients in stressed areas potentially provide a powerful too[ to interpret relations between soil biodiversity and site quality. We measured soil chemistry, soil microbiology and nematodes along three transects representing a fertility gradient and at a disturbed site near a road in a Dracophyllum subulatum-dominated shrubland in which frosts are a major factor in preventing succession to forest; we used D. subulatum size as a site-quality index. Significant correlations between both shrub height and shrub growth rate and volumetric measures of total soil phosphorus and anaerobically mineralisable nitrogen indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus regulate plant growth. Microbial. biomass and total nematode abundance significantly increased with greater plant growth, presumably in response to greater titter input. Conversely, neither heterotrophic microbial diversity nor nematode diversity was correlated with shrub performance along the transects. Litter was from a single species and thus likely similar in quality so changes in microbial or nematode diversity might not be expected. In this oligotrophic environment, nutrient levels were not only the important regulators of plant growth but also appeared to have an indirect influence on the size of the microbial, and nematode populations.

AB  - In recent years, a variety of approaches to deriving sediment quality guidelines have been developed. One approach relies on establishing an empirical relationship between the concentration of a contaminant in sediment and the condition of some biological indicator, for example, combining measured sediment concentrations of contaminants combined with data on colocated benthic species to measure in situ community effects of contamination. Biological threshold concentrations derived in this manner are being considered or have already been adopted by some regulatory agencies as a means for deriving sediment guidelines (e.g., Canada's Provincial Sediment Quality Guidelines). In order to test the validity of this method, we constructed several Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate that the methodology used to develop these guidelines is flawed by the effects of sampling and statistical artifacts that emerge from undersampling a lognormal density function. As a case study, this paper will present the screening level concentration method used by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (Toronto, ON, Canada) and provide the results of several probabilistic exercises highlighting these issues. We present a word of caution on the applicability of methods that rely exclusively on statistical and mathematical relationships between invertebrate data and sediment concentrations to derive sediment quality guidelines.

AB  - An aquatic ecological risk assessment is presented including the aquatic effects and exposure assessment of five plant growth regulators: beta-indolylacetic acid (IAA), 2,4-di-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-methyl-4-chloro-phenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA) and N-6-(delta(2)-isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA) on D. magna and T. tubifex. The tests were done under laboratory conditions and survival late was the only biological end-point checked. The hazard of plant growth regulators to non-target aquatic organisms was evaluated as LC5 and LC50 values (concentration causing 5 or 50% mortality, respectively) for the given aquatic test organisms. On the basis of LC50 values rank toxicity orders were established. These rank orders were NAA > IAA > IPA > 2,4-D greater than or equal to MCPA for T. tubifex and NAA = IAA greater than or equal to IPA > MCPA greater than or equal to 2,4-D for D. magna. The 96 h LC50 values in both species were very similar for IPA, MCPA and 2,4-D. T. tubifex worms were more sensitive to IAA and NAA than D. magna.

AB  - The microbial communities which often give rise to the fine lamination in sediments are very diverse both in species composition (e.g. phototrophic and chemotrophic bacteria, fungi, algae) and metabolism (e.g. oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis, organic and inorganic chemosynthesis, anaerobic and aerobic respiration, organic and inorganic fermentation). These microbial ecosystems have separated for more than 3.5 Ga (3500 m.y.). They intervene in the biostructuration of sediments by active mineral deposition, particle trapping and sediment stabilisation. They build bioconstructions (stromatolites, oncolites, oolites and microbial bioherms). Further they are active in a number of biogeochemical biomineralisation processes including phosphatogenesis, carbonate genesis and the formation of iron ore and sulfur deposits, and petroleum and kerogen. They are also active agents in the biocorrosion and bioerosion of sedimentary rocks under marine and terrestrial conditions. Since they have an enormous capacity for proliferation, microbial laminated communities invade new habitats, practically instantaneously where suitable energy sources and gradients for electron flow are available. In addition such microbial systems are excellent and sensitive paleoecological indicators. In order to study their impact on sedimentation and fossilisation a close collaboration between geologists and microbiologists is needed. Only in this way can the nature of fossil microbial ecosystems and the metabolisms that were at work be recognized and reconstructed.

AB  - The potential of reflectance spectroscopy to infer the paleoecological and depositional evolution of different micro and macro invertebrate fossils has been evaluated by analyzing their reflectance spectra within the spectral domain of 350-2500 nm using the FIELDSPEC3 spectroradiometer. Mineralogical information derived from the rapid and non-destructive spectral analysis has been substantiated using concurrent mineralogical data from conventional geochemical analyses. The diagnostic Fe-crystal field effect induced spectral features are identified on the representative spectra of different benthic foraminifera. These spectral features are resulted due to the incorporation of Fe during the biomineralization process. These features are absent in planktic foraminifera. The encrustation of Fe-oxides is inferred to be responsible for imprinting the Fe-crystal field feature in the spectra of micro and macrofossils at 900-1200 nm. Vibrational spectral features of the Al-OH bond are also identified. Both of these features are an indicator of post-depositional diagenetic history. The presence of Al and Fe in macrofossil shells is also believed to be related to ecological conditions as these elements are biogenically incorporated during shell formation. This study reveals the value of reflectance spectroscopy to infer ecological behavior and post-depositional environment of different organisms.

AB  - Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) pollinate plants, predate other insects, and feed on vegetal and decay materials, being used as bioindicators of different ecosystem conditions and processes. The main aim is to enhance the bioindicator potential of hoverflies in Algeria by increasing our knowledge on the hoverfly communities of different environments in the semi-arid Northeast of Algeria: unpolluted riverbank, plant nursery, polluted riverbank, olive orchard (Olea europaea), prickly pear plantations (Opuntia ficus-indica), and a cypress hedge (Cupressus sempervirens). With an entomological net, hoverflies were sampled fortnightly from December 2016 to November 2017. In total 37 species were identified. The unpolluted and polluted riverbanks and the plant nursery had the highest species richness with 26, 24, and 23 species respectively, whereas, the lowest species numbers were detected in the prickly pear plantations, the cypress hedge and the olive orchard with 16, 14, and 10 species respectively. One species was new to North Africa (Eumerus etnensis), whereas four species were recorded for the first time in Algeria (Eumerus obliquus, Eupeodes nuba, Paragus vandergootiandPlatycheirus ambiguus). Examined material also contributes to better understand each species phenology in Algeria.

AB  - The temporal influence of reaction atmosphere and chlorine on arsenic release in combustion, gasification and pyrolysis of sawdust was studied using an on-line analysis system. The arsenic release amount in combustion atmosphere was higher than that in CO2 gasification and argon pyrolysis. The derived values of activation energy followed the order: combustion < gasification < pyrolysis. Furthermore, the enhancement effect of chlorine species on arsenic release percentage in air combustion was also higher than that in gasification and pyrolysis conditions. The total proportion of arsenic release in combustion with additive chlorine is bigger than the case in gasification and pyrolysis, especially when 20% chlorine is added. According to equilibrium analysis, arsenic oxides were identified as the main gaseous arsenic species and their formation were decreased in the oxygen-deficient environment, mainly accounting for lesser arsenic release proportion in gasification and pyrolysis than combustion. The release of arsenic was promoted to a different extent with additive chlorine, mainly caused by the AsCl3 (g) formation. By the findings of the experiments and theoretical analyses, the possible reaction pathways and release mechanisms of arsenic species were proposed.

AB  - Farm ponds or irrigation ponds, providing a vital habitat for diverse bird communities, are an environmental feature with characteristics that cross over typical urban and natural conditions. In this study, the species richness and community structure of irrigation ponds were characterized on the local and landscape scales. Within a landscape complex in the Taoyuan Tableland of Taiwan, 45 ponds were surveyed, ranging in areas from 0.2 to 20.47 ha. In total, 94 species and 15,053 individual birds were identified after surveying four times. The association between ponds and birds was determined to establish the effect of pond dimensions on species richness and community composition in the complex by comparing the responses of functional groups to pond configurations. Seven avian functional groups were identified. Compared with landbirds (i.e., families Alcedinidae, Apodidae, Icteridae, and Sturnidae), waterbirds (i.e., families Anatidae, Ardeidae, Charadriidae, Podicipedidae, and Scolopacidae) exhibited a stronger correlation with pond variables. Our study provides substantial evidence that these artificial ponds have influenced wintering waterbirds. The final results of this study may help stakeholders and land managers identify areas not to establish large-scale solar facilities considering waterbird habitats in pond areas.

AB  - In order to mitigate the environmental pollution and ease the energy consumption intensity, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and combined heating and power (CHP) system is expected to be widely applied throughout the world. This paper proposes a hybrid distributed energy resources (DER) system integrating CHP, photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, to handle the electrical and thermal load for residential buildings. The system economic, technical and environmental performance is analyzed in seven typical Chinese cities based on various evaluation indicators. Moreover, a non-renewable grid-connected energy system is assessed as a reference system. It is found that the optimized DER system not only meets load supplying, but also effectively minimizes emissions and system lifetime costs. DER systems are of great advantages over reference systems in almost all optimal evaluations, especially in Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai and Nanjing. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic performance of DER system will become better with increase feed-in tariff, decrease local grid tariff and natural gas price. The impacts of subsidy coefficient and loan ratio on return on investment are more significant than other factors.

AB  - The Adelie penguin is a well-known indicator for climate and environmental changes. Exploring how large-scale climate variability affects penguin ecology in the past is essential for understanding the responses of Southern Ocean ecosystems to future global change. Using ornithogenic sediments at Cape Bird, Ross Island, Antarctica, we inferred relative population changes of Adelie penguins in the southern Ross Sea over the past 500 yr, and observed an increase in penguin populations during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1500-1850 AD). We used cadmium content in ancient penguin guano as a proxy of ocean upwelling and identified a close linkage between penguin dynamics and atmospheric circulation and oceanic conditions. During the cold period of similar to 1600-1825 AD, a deepened Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) led to stronger winds, intensified ocean upwelling, enlarged Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound polynyas, and thus higher food abundance and penguin populations. We propose a mechanism linking Antarctic marine ecology and atmospheric/oceanic dynamics which can help explain and predict responses of Antarctic high latitudes ecosystems to climate change.

AB  - Pollution (air, water, soil, etc.), waste management, and biodiversity depletion are the most important environmental problems of Tehran city. This paper considers the biophilic urbanism as a complementary approach alongside the other strategies and plans to promote the environmental sustainability in Tehran city. In this research, we used D'ANP method to determine the influential and importance weight of indicators and dimensions. The result showed that biophilic institutions and governance, and biophilic infrastructure and conditions are the influencing dimensions, whereas the biophilic attitude and knowledge, and biophilic activity are the affected dimensions. Also, results showed that 'percentage of population engaged in nature restoration and volunteer efforts, priority given to environmental education, Priority given to nature conservation and education by local government, adoption of green building and planning codes and adoption of a local biodiversity action plan or strategy' are the most important indicators among the indicators respectively. In general, this paper concludes that the biophilic planning and designing increase the environmental attitude and knowledge of citizens, and enhanced environmental attitude and knowledge lead to environmental behaviour modification and green lifestyle of citizens and thus environmental sustainability.

AB  - Epilithic diatoms from three geographically isolated hill streams of Central and Eastern India were studied and analysed to find their efficacy in determining difference in ecological conditions of aquatic systems. Three sampling sites (site-1, site-2 and site-3) shared commonness of being hill streams of forests with difference in source points. 34 diatom species were identified with species richness of 17 at site 1, 10 at site 2 and 19 at site 3. Two sets of hypotheses - null (H01, H02 and H03) and alternative (HA1, HA2 and HA3) were framed. Null hypotheses were rejected in favour of alternative hypotheses. Diversity t-tests yielded significant 't' values: at alpha<0.0001 and <0.002, implying differences within the sampling sites. Furthermore, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon paired-sample tests were performed to test the alternative hypotheses, of which Kruskal-Wallis yielded significant difference between the sample medians with x(2)=5.457 at p=0.03801, and Wilcoxon paired-sample test yielded significant differences between sampling site pairs at alpha(2)=0.05 and 0.10. Thus significant differences could be established based only on diversity profile study of the epilithic diatoms.

AB  - In this article we present EnviroAtlas, a web-based, open access tool that seeks to meet a range of needs by bringing together environmental, economic and demographic data in an ecosystem services framework. Within EnviroAtlas, there are three primary types of geospatial data: research-derived ecosystem services indicator data in their native resolution, indicator data that have been summarized to standard reporting units, and reference data. Reporting units include watershed basins across the contiguous U.S. and Census block groups throughout featured urban areas. EnviroAtlas includes both current and future drivers of change, such as land use and climate, for addressing issues of adaptation, conservation, equity, and resiliency. In addition to geospatial data, EnviroAtlas includes geospatial and statistical tools, and resources that support research, education, and decision-making. With the development of EnviroAtlas, we facilitate the practice of ecosystem services science by providing a framework to track conditions across political boundaries and assess policies and regulations. EnviroAtlas is a robust research and educational resource, with consistent, systems-oriented information to support nationally, regionally, and locally focused decisions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Standard protocols are critical for maximizing data comparability and aggregation in national monitoring programs, and taxa richness is a common indicator of site condition and biological diversity. There are two general approaches for sampling stream macroinvertebrate assemblages: targeted richest habitat and site wide. At seven sites, we compared three methods: Ontario Benthic Biomonitoring Network (OBBN), Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), and Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP). The OBBN method produced a biased sample at a site with a single small riffle, the RBP method produced the most total taxa, and the EMAP method produced the most taxa at four sites and the most individuals at six sites. The RBP method produced asymptotes for percent tolerant individuals, percent chironomid individuals, and Hilsenhoff Biotic Index score after five to ten stations. The EMAP method produced asymptotes for those metrics after 10 to 20 stations per site. The EMAP method typically required half the number of stations as the RBP method to obtain 70-90% of true taxa richness as estimated by the Jaccard coefficient. We conclude that the EMAP method is preferable because of its greater precision in taxa richness estimates.

AB  - With the rapid increase in demand for agricultural products for food, feed and fuel, concerns are growing about sustainability issues. Can agricultural production meet the needs of increasing numbers of people consuming more animal products and using a larger share of crops as fuel for transport, electricity and heat, while still sustaining the natural resource base? In addition to economic models and learning from statistics and trends, there is a perceived need for decision support tools at global,field and plant levels and for the certification of best practices based on crop production ecology (CPE). This paper illustrates the need for and availability of a generic approach to sustainability principles, criteria, indicators and norms to ensure maximum efficiency in the use of resources such as land, water, chemicals and energy in crop biomass production at various levels of scale. The authors propose a method based on a transportable CPE approach, covering ranges of commodities and environments, to address choices in agricultural production: which crop to promote where, how it should be grown to optimize the efficient use of resources, how to certify the best practices and which crop properties need genetic improvement to make the best use of scarce resources in adverse conditions.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Sustainability indicators have been widely developed to monitor and assess sustainable development. They are expected to guide political decision-making based on their capability to represent states and trends of development. However, using indicators to assess the sustainability of urban strategies and policies has limitations - as they neither reflect the systemic interactions among them, nor provide normative indications in what direction they should be developed. This paper uses a semi-quantitative systematic model tool (Sensitivity Model Tools, SM) to analyze the role of urban development in Taiwan's sustainability. The results indicate that the natural environment in urban area is one of the most critical components and the urban economic production plays a highly active role in affecting Taiwan's sustainable development. The semi-quantitative simulation model integrates sustainability indicators and urban development policy to provide decision-makers with information about the impacts of their decisions on urban development. The system approach incorporated by this paper can be seen as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a sustainability assessment. The participatory process of expert participants for providing judgments on the relations between indicator variables is also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Progenies from a natural stand of Picea abies planted on a forest site with heterogeneous growth conditions were characterized for genetic and environmental control of internodal and whorl branch formation and lammas growth. The progenies studied were 27 years old from seed and planted in a randomized complete block experiment. Internodes and whorls studied were located in the top section of the trees. Significant genetic variation (p<0.01) was found for a number of internodal and whorl branches. Block means for the length of internodes, a strong indicator for the site index in respective blocks, were correlated strongly with branch dimensions (r >= 0.90), intermediately with the frequency of lammas growth (r = 0.81) and number of branches in whorls (r = 0.68), and only weakly with the number of internodal branches per length unit of internode (r = 0.25). A strong environmental effect on branch dimensions was supported by the relative size of variance components. The results show that the environmental effect expressed by site index dominates the control of branch dimensions, while the number of branches is under stronger genetic control in P. abies.

AB  - The voluntary or accidental spread of xenobiotic compounds or heavy metals may have subsequent unwanted effects on non-target organisms. In this way, all soil micro-organisms are indirectly exposed to repeated pesticide treatments, to sewage sludge landspreading and to accidental leaching. Assessment of micropollutant impacts requires either the global description of their effects on the total soil microflora, or the study of the behaviour of some bioindicator groups. The global description is generally based on the measurements of soil biomass and its turnover, the enumeration of the cultivable microflora, or the determination of soil microbial activities. Other methods aim to describe and characterise the evolution of the phenotypical (Biolog fingerprints, phospholipid fatty acid composition of soil communities) or genotypical biodiversity (diversity of soil DNA or 16S rRNA genes). Finally, bioindicators tan be used to assess the of micropollutants. Functional microbial groups (groups involved in a specific activity of agronomic relevance) or specific groups (a given microbial species which tan be detected in soil or cultivated on selective media) can constitute potential bioindicators. However to be meaningful, such indicators must be sensitive and present reproducible results in various environmental conditions.

AB  - The Nile River is the soul of Egypt, providing more than 95% of its freshwater demand. However, it receives different pollutants discharged into the water body along its stretch from Aswan (downstream of the High Dam) to Cairo, which is approximately 950 km. Alternatively, sediments play an important role in the dynamics of the entire aquatic environment and act as a sink or a source of pollution in the overlying water under various conditions. This study assessed sediment quality and its heavy metal levels. Several indices and human health risks were determined to assess the potential ecological risk of the Nile River sediment. On the basis of the index results, Cd registered the highest pollution ranking, whereas Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Ni had the lowest effect. In another context, southern sites represented the lowest ecological risk relative to the central and northern sectors. The results of the noncarcinogenic hazard indices, hazard quotient, and hazard index in addition to the lifetime cancer risk were below the acceptable international limits, confirming that there are no adverse effects on the exposed population due to the Nile sediment.

AB  - The study of pro-environmental behavior has been dominated by self-report scales and field observations. Although both approaches have their merits, they also suffer from critical limitations that obstruct progress towards a better understanding of pro-environmental behavior. The Pro-Environmental Behavior Task (PEBT) was developed to address these limitations by facilitating the study of actual pro-environmental behavior under controlled laboratory conditions. In the present research, we examined whether the PEBT can also provide a valid and reliable indicator of people's propensity to show pro-environmental behavior. In support of the task's test-retest reliability, we found PEBT choice behavior to be strongly correlated across a period of approximately one month (r = 0.81). In addition, PEBT performance was significantly correlated to both objective observations and subjective reports of other pro-environmental behaviors. Our results further suggest participants' PEBT choices to be most closely related to individual differences in transportation behavior. These findings indicate that the PEBT might prove useful not only as a procedure for the experimental study of pro-environmental behavior, but also for the performance-based assessment of a person's propensity to engage in pro environmental behavior.

AB  - Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, has a coastline that occupies 76% of the country's Arabian Gulf coastline. The pressures accompanying the economic development that the country is undergoing ultimately affected the marine ecosystem including water and sediment quality. In order to protect the marine ecosystem and public health, the Environment Agency- Abu Dhabi developed ambient marine water and sediment quality standards using the long-term data collected along the coast of Abu Dhabi. Along with the data collected on 39 marine water quality and sediment parameters (hydrography, nutrients, and heavy metals), a review of best practices from jurisdictions whose approach was scientifically based and whose physical conditions were as similar as possible to those found in Abu Dhabi were used for the establishment of marine water and sediment quality limits. These promulgated ambient limits were then used to develop the marine water and sediment regulation that establish two uses of marine waters (protected and general) and an anti-degradation policy. In addition, the ambient water and sediment limits provide a bench mark to both assess trends that may indicate stress to marine flora and fauna and support the work of environmental permitting and enforcement.

AB  - In aquatic ecosystems, real-time water-quality (WQ) biomonitoring has become the most effective technology for monitoring toxic events by using living organisms as a biosensor. In this study, an online WQ monitoring system using sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) was tested to monitor WQ changes in real-time in natural stream water. The WQ monitoring system consisted of three SOB reactors (one continuous and two semi-continuous mode reactors). The SOB system did not detect any toxicity in relatively unpolluted, natural stream water when operated for more than six months. When diluted swine wastewater (50:1) was added to the influent of the reactors, the system detected toxic conditions in both the continuous and semi-continuous operational modes, showing 90% inhibition of SOB activity within 1 h of operation. The addition of 30 mg/L NO2--N or 2 mg/L of Cr6+ to the influents of SOB reactors resulted in the complete inhibition of the SOB activity within 1-2 h. The results demonstrated the successful application of an SOB bioassay as an online toxicity monitoring system for detecting pollutants from stream or river waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The implementation of modernizing projects in the midst of rural societies, in parallel with the great benefits in terms of regional and national growth, generates threats to local socio-ecological sustainability. Such is the case of the discharge of sludge generated by the Bajo Anchicaya dam in the Colombian Pacific in 2001. The economic assessment of the environmental impact is given to address the past, present and future impacts in cases such as the one described above where environmental goods and services as well as supervening exchange relationships are not guided by the logic of the market. However, this article attempts to account for the direction and scope of such effects, based on a pricing chrematistics and compensatory assessment claimed by court litigation by the affected communities un-der information restrictions and slightly commercialized economic dynamics. At the end, it was possible to establish the operability of the assessment methods, type of stated preferences, which simulate market conditions in favor of alternative strategies such as the transfer of benefits that while not infallible, with the lack of environmental accountancy, try to respect the spatial, time and socio-ecological complexity of territories such as the Pacific Coast.

AB  - Global population growth will require substantial increases in agricultural production worldwide. Yet, despite growing concern about the environmental and social impacts of increased agricultural productivity, no consensus exists on the appropriate method for assessing the appropriate tradeoffs for sustainability. To address this need, this paper proposes the use of Data Envelope Analysis to create an index that permits assessment of the relative sustainability of smallholder farms in a given region, with minimal external interpretation about how individual farmers weight tradeoffs on their own farms. The method is applied to the Ethiopian highlands to explore the determinants of economic, social and environmental sustainability in the region's agricultural sector. Econometric model results suggest that farmers felt that farm size, market access, access to off farm income, agricultural loans, and access to agricultural extension and demonstration plots are key drivers of agricultural sustainability at the farm-level. Differences in agro-ecological conditions and region-specific factors were also significant determinants of relative farm sustainability. This underscores the importance of geographical targeting and tailoring of interventions to increase farm sustainability.

AB  - Speciation analysis has become an invaluable tool in human health risk assessment, environmental monitoring or food quality control. Another step is to develop reliable multielemental speciation methodologies, to reduce costs, waste and time needed for the analysis. Separation and detection of species of several elements in a single analytical run can be accomplished by high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS). Our review assembles articles concerning multielemental speciation determination of: As, Se, Cr, Sb, I, Br, Pb, Hg, V, Mo, Te, Tl, Cd and W in environmental, biological, food and clinical samples analyzed with HPLC/ICP-MS. It addresses the procedures in terms of following issues: sample collection and pretreatment, selection of optimal conditions for elements species separation by HPLC and determination using ICP-MS as well as metrological approach. The presented work is the first review article concerning multi elemental speciation analysis by advanced hyphenated technique HPLC/ICP-MS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nutrient levels, competition from autochthonous microorganisms, and protozoan predation may all influence survival of fecal microorganisms as they transition from the gastrointestinal tract to aquatic habitats. Although Escherichia coli is an important indicator of waterborne pathogens, the effects of environmental stressors on its survival in aquatic environments remain poorly understood. We manipulated organic nutrient, predation, and competition levels in outdoor microcosms containing natural river water, sediments, and microbial populations to determine their relative contribution to E. coli survival. The activities of predator (protozoa) and competitor (indigenous bacteria) populations were inhibited by adding cycloheximide or kanamycin. We developed a statistical model of E. coli density over time that fits with the data under all experimental conditions. Predation and competition had significant negative effects on E. coli survival, while higher nutrient levels increased survival. Among the main effects, predation accounted for the greatest variation (40 %) compared with nutrients (25 %) or competition (15 %). The highest nutrient level mitigated the effect of predation on E. coli survival. Thus, elevated organic nutrients may disproportionately enhance the survival of E. coli, and potentially that of other enteric bacteria, in aquatic habitats.

AB  - Thirteen species and thirteen varieties of microscopic green algae from the genus Pediastrum were found in thirty one localities scattered in lowland and upland water bodies in Poland. Seven groups of localities are distinguished with cluster analysis. The groups differ from each other in terms of Pediastrum communities and environmental variables (pH, conductivity, carbonate hardness, nitrate and orthophosphate concentrations). The most distinct group contains five coastal lakes, which have high pH values and chloride concentration. Because the lakes have a high number of taxa, including a few rarely occurring worldwide, they are considered a hot spot for Pediastrum. Redundancy analysis revealed that the environmental variables account for ca thirty per cent of the variability of Pediastrum occurrence. Conductivity and pH statistically significantly explain the taxonomical variation of Pediastrum species and varieties. The genus Pediastrum as a whole is most positively correlated with conductivity. Individual taxa are influenced by different variables, except for P. tetras which is indifferent to them. The environmental preferences of the taxa can make inference on conditions in both recent and past water bodies more reliable.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a new way of analysing habitat preferences of plant communities using the genotype and genotype-by-environment interaction effects (GGE) biplot method. We took into consideration real data on six plant associations belonging to the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class. A total of 241 phytosociological releves collected with the Braun-Blanquet method were described by the Ellenberg indicators. The two-way classification releves-by-indicators was analysed with GGE. As a result it is proposed the modified biplot that contains ellipses for making the plot clearer. Next, we present the equations that described both axes and allow adding into the biplot any other releves or a mean of set of releves. Based on the generated biplot it is possible to present an ecological characteristics of any type of plant community including its acceptable and typical habitat requirements. The ellipse ranges provide important information about the homogeneity and ecological spectrum of the analysed syntaxon. The constructed equations allow comparing new data with data analysed previously. Summing up, the GGE biplot method is useful for analysing and graphically presenting ecological preferences of plant communities in a simple and comprehensive way.

AB  - A large data set from the coastal environment of the Mediterranean across benthic enrichment gradients was used to test the performance of various indices as indicators of the seabed environmental conditions. Comparisons involved samples sieved through different mesh sizes, taken in different seasons and taken with different samplers. Most indices were found not to be affected by sieve mesh size, they showed some variations with sampling season and they varied considerably with sampler (sampling size) used, but also they were found to be significantly intercorrelated. Among the indicators tested, the Benthic Quality Index at the family level (BQI-family) was found to be the least sensitive in changes in the sampling configuration; it is highly correlated with all the other indicators and needs less time and taxonomic expertise. Our results indicate that there is a need for standardization of the methodology used during sampling for the Water Framework Directive, since the sampling configuration (and the indicator used) may to a large extend determine the results of the Ecological Status (ES) analysis.

AB  - The available information on the changes in the reproductive effort (RE) of seagrasses in response to disturbances was reviewed and analysed to assess if seagrasses invest in RE when disturbed, and if this response is related to specific types of disturbance or seagrass traits. In 72% of the documented cases RE increased with disturbance, in 25% it decreased, and in 3% no changes were reported. Overall, seagrass RE increased 4-fold with disturbance. Anthropogenic disturbances had the highest impact on RE (a 13-fold increase); 3 times higher than the effect of natural disturbances. Mechanical and sedimentary/hydrodynamics disturbances caused the highest RE increase (9- and 5-fold, respectively). The positive RE response was significantly correlated with rhizome diameter of seagrasses, but not with shoot size (mass or length), suggesting that species with higher storage capacity have a higher capacity of investing in sexual reproduction when conditions deteriorate. Seagrasses showed a general trend of increasing RE under disturbance; this was evident regardless of the origin and type of disturbance, which suggests that changes in seagrass RE provide a valuable indicator of disturbance in coastal areas.

AB  - We investigated sexual reproduction patterns of a ubiquitous littoral cladoceran Alonella nana (Anomopoda, Chydoridae), using ecological and paleoecological approaches to clarify the forcing mechanisms behind its sexual reproduction. Contemporary sampling of A. nana populations in two environmentally different lakes showed abundant sexual reproduction in the lake with eutrophic, oxygen-deficient conditions and scarce gamogenesis in the oligotrophic, well-oxygenated lake. Sediment core studies from the same lakes indicated that comparable sexual reproduction patterns had prevailed for many centuries. However, in eutrophic Lake Hamptrask, A. nana increased its sexual reproduction from 1700 ad onward, consistently with decreasing trend in chironomid-inferred oxygen. The core samples, together with a surface sediment dataset of 25 lakes from southern and central Finland, showed a negative correlation between ephippia of A. nana and winter oxygen, although the surface sediment data per se did not show any significant correlation. When the dataset was scaled locally to include lakes in close proximity in southern Finland, the correlation became clearer. The results imply that the spatial and temporal variations in sexual reproduction of A. nana populations may partly be explained by differences in oxygen levels.

AB  - This paper deals with wind-induced flows in a semi-enclosed water body in a microtidal environment that is subject to various wind-wave and river discharge conditions. The resulting currents are analyzed using numerical models supplemented by (and calibrated with) field observations. The emphasis is on the driving efficiency of wind fields in generating steady currents as a function of wind velocity and direction. The circulation generated is analyzed for the actual case of Cullera Bay and for a theoretical case in which the cape (limiting barrier) has been "removed" from the computational domain. The results obtained as a part of the EU research project ECOSUD, allow the barrier effect exerted by the cape to be partially quantified. The river plume dimensions and direction of spread are clearly influenced by the cape barrier. On a more local scale, the effluent discharge from the outfall was also found to be influenced by the two Jucar River jetties. Based on these results, a "retention" index that partly characterizes water quality in the bay is defined. This type of index is also a scientifically based indicator that supports more sustainable management of water quality in coastal bays of this type.

AB  - The flora and fauna of 69 aquatic sites in Colombia were surveyed to identify ecological conditions that favor production of Anopheles albimanus. Anopheles albimanus larvae were most numerous at sun-exposed sites with abundant Culex larvae and grass at the edge of the water. Only 29% of the sites with An. albimanus larvae contained pupae, suggesting that poor larval survival prevented the production of adult mosquitoes at many sites. In the Atlantic region, An. albimanus production was highest from large ponds with an abundant and varied aquatic insect fauna, including many kinds of predators of An. albimanus larvae. Although productive sites were often covered with water hyacinth, aquatic vegetation was generally not a reliable indicator of An. albimanus production. In the pacific region, An. albimanus production was highest from small water bodies with few aquatic macrophytes and an abundance of cladocera, reflecting an abundance of microalgal food for mosquito larvae. In both regions, All. albimanus production was negatively associated with a complete cover of Lemna, fish, hydrometrid nymphs, large species of cyclopoid copepods, and dragonfly or mayfly nymphs. Anopheles albimanus production was also negatively associated with dytiscid beetle larvae in the Pacific region.

AB  - Photovoltaic systems (PVSs) are among the most diffuse Distributed Generators based on renewable energy sources. PVSs contribute to the short-circuit currents during a fault, modifying the short-circuit capacity of the distribution systems. Then, the contribution of PVSs to the fault current must be adequately modeled to extend the traditional short-circuit analysis to distribution networks with PVSs. In this paper an analytical model based on the phase-coordinates approach is proposed to evaluate the fault contributions of three-phase PVSs connected to unbalanced distribution networks in presence of symmetrical and asymmetrical shunt short-circuits, with and without fault impedance. The model of the PVS takes into account the environmental conditions, the inverter control system, the maximum current that can flow through the inverter switching devices, the filter, the interface transformer and the self-protections imposed by the Standard IEEE 1547. Both a first cycles and a steady-state model of the PVS are developed accounting for inverter control systems equipped with VAr or LVRT control schemes or inverter control system without reactive power regulation. The model of the PVS is applied to a typical North American MV network and the results of the proposed approach are compared with time-domain simulations.

AB  - In this study, the seasonal succession of the diatoms on Phragmites australis community was investigated in Lake Mogan (Turkey), and the epiphytic diatom community was used to estimate the ecological condition of the lake. Five stations were chosen in the littoral region of the lake, and diatom samples were taken from the P. australis monthly between January and November 2013. Two stations were selected in the pelagial region and chlorophyll a concentrations were determined. Lake water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity and Secchi depths were measured, and total nitrogen, total phosphorus and silicate were analyzed. A total of 61 epiphytic diatom species were identified in Lake Mogan. The dominant species were those with tolerance to alpha-beta mesosaprobic conditions. According to the mean Secchi depth, chlorophyll and total phosphorus concentrations, the lake was eutrophic. The IDG, IPS, DESCY, WAT, IDP and TDI indices, calculated according to epiphytic diatoms, indicated an ecological quality between medium and poor (classes III-IV). Among them, IDG and IPS are recommended for monitoring of ecological status in the lake because these indices also integrated all diatom taxa within the samples. The occurrence of pollution-tolerant species and the fact that most indices showed an ecological quality of medium or poor indicated an increase of organic matter and eutrophication in Lake Mogan.

AB  - The objective of this study is to provide information on source organic matter input, depositional conditions and the correlation between crude oils recovered from Sunah oilfield and Upper Jurassic Madbi Formation. A suite of twenty-six crude oils from the Lower Cretaceous reservoirs (Qishn clastic) of the Masila Region (Eastern Yemen) were analysed and geochemically compared with extracts from source rock of the Upper Jurassic (Madbi Formation). The investigated biomarkers indicated that the Sunah oils were derived from mixed marine and terrigenous organic matter and deposited under suboxic conditions. This has been achieved from normal alkane and acyclic isoprenoids distributions, terpane and sterane biomarkers. These oils were also generated from source rock with a wide range of thermal maturity and ranging from early-mature to peak oil window. Based on molecular indicators of organic source input and depositional environment diagnostic biomarkers, one petroleum system operates in the Masila Region; this derived from Upper Jurassic Madbi organic-rich shales as source rock. Therefore, the hydrocarbon exploration processes should be focused on the known location of the Upper Jurassic Madbi strata for predicting the source kitchen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There are several factors influencing the water quality based on its usage. The quality of drinking water is of the vital concern for human health and life. An essential attempt has to be done to develop a water quality index (WQI) corresponding with different conditions and characteristics of the relevant river or water body such as geographical, hydrological, discharge rate and pollution sources. The index is not specifically focused on human health or aquatic life regulations. However, a water index based on some very important parameters can determine a simple indicator of water quality. In the present study, the Taleghan water quality has been evaluated by available NSF water quality index. Subsequently, the nine present NSF parameters' weights have been changed and modified using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method as well as experts' opinions in the field in a way to satisfy local conditions. In the newly developed WQI, more weights are given to relation with these parameters it can be said that the factors like dissolved oxygen (Do), fecal coliform (F.c) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) when compared with NSF-WQI.

AB  - Conducting city assessments and disclosing those results to the public is important for supporting citizens' understanding of the actual condition of their city. Such assessment and disclosure could introduce a market mechanism that can be expected to provide city governments with strong incentives to improve their city conditions and also recognizes that local policy and strategy can be the most appropriate way to address specific urban and environmental problems. The latest Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) tool, referred to as CASBEE-City, is presented. Designed specifically for city assessment, it supports local governments and other stakeholders in identifying the environmental, social and economic characteristics of their city and in quantifying the effectiveness of their city-wide policies. CASBEE-City is based on the concept of environmental efficiency and it provides a combined evaluation of a city embracing two aspects: the environmental load imposed by the city on the wider environment outside its boundary, and the quality of life (environmental, social, economic) inside the city. A city with low environmental load and high quality receives a high Built Environment Efficiency (BEE) value and is regarded as a sustainable city within the CASBEE framework.

AB  - Biofilms are important in aquatic nutrient cycling and microbial proliferation. In these structures, nutrients like carbon are channeled into the production of extracellular polymeric substances or cell division; both are vital for microbial survival and propagation. The aim of this study was to assess carbon channeling into cellular or noncellular fractions in biofilms. Growing in tubular reactors, biofilms of our model strain Pseudomonas sp. strain CT07 produced cells to the planktonic phase from the early stages of biofilm development, reaching pseudo steady state with a consistent yield of similar to 10(7) cells . cm(-2) . h(-1) within 72 h. Total direct counts and image analysis showed that most of the converted carbon occurred in the noncellular fraction, with the released and sessile cells accounting for < 10% and < 2% of inflowing carbon, respectively. A CO2 evolution measurement system (CEMS) that monitored CO2 in the gas phase was developed to perform a complete carbon balance across the biofilm. The measurement system was able to determine whole-biofilm CO2 production rates in real time and showed that gaseous CO2 production accounted for 25% of inflowing carbon. In addition, the CEMS made it possible to measure biofilm response to changing environmental conditions; changes in temperature or inflowing carbon concentration were followed by a rapid response in biofilm metabolism and the establishment of new steady-state conditions.

AB  - Late Quaternary palaeoenvironments of the Siberian Arctic were reconstructed by combining data from several fossil bioindicators (pollen, plant macro-fossils, ostracods, insects, and mammal bones) with sedimentological and cryolithological data from permafrost deposits. The record mirrors the environmental history of Beringia and covers glacial/interglacial and stadial/interstadial climate variations with a focus on the Middle Weichselian interstadial (50-32 kyr BP). The late Pleistocene to Holocene sequence on Kurungnakh Island reflects the development of periglacial landscapes under changing sedimentation regimes which were meandering fluvial during the Early Weichselian, colluvial or proluvial on gently inclined plaines during the Middle and Late Weichselian, and thermokarst-affected during the Holocene. Palaeoecological records indicate the existence of tundra-steppe vegetation under cold continental climate conditions during the Middle Weichselian interstadial. Due to sedimentation gaps in the sequence between 32 and 17 kyr BP and 17 and 8 kyr BP, the Late Weichselian stadial is incompletely represented in the studied outcrops. Nevertheless, by several palaeoecological indications arctic tundra-steppe vegetation under extremely cold-arid conditions prevailed during the late Pleistocene. The tundra-steppe disappeared completely due to lasting paludification during the Holocene. Initially subarctic shrub tundra formed, which later retreated in course of the late Holocene cooling.

FX  - The studies presented were part of the Russian-German cooperative scientific effort, "System Laptev Sea". Studies of pollen and plant macro-fossils as well as geochronology were funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) within the framework of three different projects (SCHI 975/1 late Quaternary warm phases in the Arctic; KI 849/1 Environmental history of Northern Siberia; FR 877/15-1, Interstadial and interglacial periods). During recent years the Russian-German cooperation was also promoted by several guest science supports from DFG and DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service). We thank all colleagues who helped us during fieldwork (e.g. sampling of bones by Marina V. Dorozkina, Elena Y. Pavlova, Waldemar Schneider) as well as during the analytical work in the laboratories at the Alfred Wegener Institute Potsdam (Ute Bastian, Antje Eulenburg, Lutz Schonicke) and at the GGA-Institute Hannover (Sabine Mogwitz). We thank the Otto Schmidt Laboratory (St. Petersburg, Russia) for the opportunity to use photo equipment for the insect illustrations and Helga Kemnitz (GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam, Germany) for help in SEM photography of ostracod valves. The paper benefited by English language correction and valuable comments from Candace O'Connor (UAF, Fairbanks, Alaska) as well as by highly constructive suggestions from two anonymous reviewers.

AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the physiological response of broiler chickens from four commercial lines to an organic production system. Day-old Ross, Hubbard Flex, Cobb and Hybro broiler chicks were reared under organic conditions and maintained in groups formed from different commercial lines. Chickens were kept on litter at a stocking density of 10 birds/m(2) of poultry house area and had access to free range. Semi-intensive feeding with constant access to feed and water was used. Chickens were reared for 12 weeks until they reached a final body weight of approximately 2.5 kg. At 28, 70 and 84 days of rearing, blood was sampled from 10 birds of each group to determine morphotic blood elements and corticosterone levels. At 4, 10 and 12 weeks of the experiment, rectal temperature was measured in 10 birds of each group. The highest plasma corticosterone concentration was found in Hybro chickens, which were also characterized by lower rectal temperature. Ross chickens were characterized by higher rectal temperature, higher haematocrit value, and greater erythrocyte and leukocyte count. The higher rectal temperature and changes in morphotic blood elements in Ross chickens may indicate that these birds show a higher metabolic rate compared to other broiler lines under an ecological production system.

AB  - Rocky shorelines provide an excellent record that can be used to interpret the environmental conditions prevailing in a particular area in time and space. Former rocky shores are first-rate indicators of sea-level position, and they provide important local to regional information on tectonics and neotectonics. In this paper, sedimentary units made of gravel-size clasts, interpreted as having been deposited on a rocky shore, provide data for the interpretation of the hydrodynamic conditions under which the units were deposited. A model is presented by which to evaluate the minimum wave height associated with rocky-shore deposits located on the Baja California peninsula, both on the Pacific and Gulf of California margins for Upper Cretaceous and Pliocene shoreface deposits and for a modern beach deposit. Elements considered under the application of the model are the average clast size and water depth assigned to each deposit based on an equation proposed by earlier workers in conjunction with Airy's linear theory. Results from the application of the model reflect the position of each deposit relative to sea level and the clast-size population for each deposit. Values calculated as minimum wave heights range from 3 m to more than 7 m. These are interpreted in the context of northern winter storms on the Pacific coast and tropical storms or hurricanes on the Gulf of California coast.

AB  - In urbanising landscapes, planning for sustainable biodiversity occurs in a context of multifunctional land use. Important conditions for species persistence are habitat quality, the amount and configuration of habitat and the permeability of the landscape matrix. For planning purposes, these determinants should be integrated into simple indicators for spatial conditions of persistence probability. We propose a framework of three related indices. The cohesion index is based on the ecology of metapopulations in a habitat network. We discuss how an indicator for species persistence in such a network could be developed. To translate this network index into an area index, we propose the concept of spatial cohesion. Habitat cohesion and spatial cohesion are defined and measured for single species or, at best, for species profiles. Since species differ in their perception of the same landscape, different species will rate different values of these indices for the same landscape. Because landscapes are rarely planned for single species, we further propose the index of landscape cohesion, which integrates the spatial cohesion indices of different species. Indices based on these concepts can be built into GIS tools for landscape assessment. We illustrate different applications of these indices, and emphasise the distinction between ecological and political decisions in developing and applying such tools.

AB  - This study evaluated the use of gill parasitic monogenoideans from Sciades herzbergii (Siluriformes: Ariidae) as bioindicators of environmental quality in Amazonian estuarine ecosystems. Fish were caught in the tidal channels in an impacted area - IA, near the port of Sao Luis and a reference area - RA, in the Caete estuary, Braganca. The influence of the capture site and seasonality on parasite abundance, environmental variables and biometric data of hosts were verified. A total of 416 S. herzbergii specimens were analyzed. The weight and total length of fish from the RA were greater than those of the IA. The relative condition factor was influenced by seasonality. A total of 4,265 monogenoidean specimens from the following species were identified: Chauhanellus boegeri, C. susamlimae, C. velum, Calceostomella herzbergii and Dactylogyridae gen. sp. The seasonal mean parasitic abundance of C. susamlimae was significantly different, with the highest values recorded during the dry season. The mean abundance of C. herzbergii was influenced by seasonality and by the capture site. During the rainy period, the parasite indices in the RA were higher than those of IA. C. herzbergii is a bioindicator sensitive to low water quality, especially in relation to water turbidity in Amazon estuaries.

AB  - Coral reef fisheries are of great importance both economically and for food security, but many reefs are showing evidence of overfishing, with significant ecosystem-level consequences for reef condition. In response, ecological indicators have been developed to assess the state of reef fisheries and their broader ecosystem-level impacts. To date, use of fisheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting fishing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies fishery-independent indicators used to evaluate fishing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight fishing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of fishing gradient, scale of analysis, the influence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, fisheries-independent indicators on coral reefs. Our review provides knowledge that will help underpin the assessment of the ecological effects of fishing, offering essential support for the development and implementation of coral reef fisheries management plans.

AB  - The toxicity of arsenic depends on a number of factors including its valence state. The more potent trivalent arsenic [arsenite (As3+)] inhibits a large number of cellular enzymatic pathways involved in energy production, while the less toxic pentavalent arsenic [arsenate (As5+)] interferes with phosphate metabolism, phosphoproteins and ATP formation (uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation). Environmental risk based corrective action for arsenic contamination utilizes data derived from arsenite studies of toxicity to be conservative. However, depending upon environmental conditions, the arsenate species may predominate substantially, especially in well aerated surface soils. Analyses of soil concentrations of arsenic species at two sites in northeastern Texas historically contaminated with arsenical pesticides yielded mean arsenate concentrations above 90% of total arsenic with the majority of the remainder being the trivalent arsenite species. Ecological risk assessments based on the concentration of the trivalent arsenite species will lead to restrictive remediation requirements that do not adequately reflect the level of risk associated with the predominate species of arsenic found in the soil. The greater concentration of the pentavalent arsenate species in soils would be the more appropriate species to monitor remediation at sites that contain high arsenate to arsenite ratios.

AB  - Summer calls for families to go to the beach enjoying the sun and the bathing water Unfortunately, summer also calls for potential noxious micro-organ isms and some people get in too close contacts with these Several types of pathogenic micro-organisms occur in recreational waters use. Some of these are introduced by humans through point source outfalls and diffuse loading. To detect the pollution, regulation throughout the world stipulates monitoring of faecal indicator bacteria. In EU according to the new Bathing Water Directive compliance necessitates measurements of E. coli and Enterococci. Besides, the Directive demands timely and adequate warnings of the public during short-term contaminations. In Denmark operational modelling systems are already used to fulfil such requirement. Our talk will demonstrate the application of dynamic simulations in Bathing Water Forecasting as well as in measure investmentplanning. Other micro-organisms are natural for the environment and only become a threat to humans when growth conditions promote their growth. For example increased nutrient loadings support blooms of potential toxic cyanobacteria. High water temperatures combined with suitable salinities endorse growth of Vibrio vulnificus, V cholerae and other natural occurring pathogenic bacteria. As for humanoid contamination, dynamic modelling presents a powerful tool,for forecasting and for investigating causes and impact of measures. This will be exemplified by existing Danish early warning systems.

AB  - In systems as heavily disturbed as rivers, the use of biological sentinels is a most interesting way of obtaining continuous assessment of environmental quality. This study seeks to establish the value of such sentinels of two species of crayfish: the native crayfish (Austropotnmobius pallipes, Lereboullet 1858) and an introduced species, signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus, Dana 1852), by comparing the habitat quality (water and sediments) and heavy metal contents in crayfish with the degree of stress manifested by the animals, measured by cell and tissue biomarkers. For this purpose a histological study of the digestive gland was carried out together with measurements of heavy metal contents in samples from various points of the river network of Bizkaia (Spain), selected on the basis of their degree of disturbance. The results establish a positive correlation between these environmental conditions, the cell and tissue biomarkers of the digestive gland (thinning of the digestive epithelium, enlargement of digestive lysosomes) and the heavy metal contents of the animals (converted to an index of pollutant load).

AB  - Soil nematode communities in the 0-15 cm soil layer are used as indicators for describing the processes of fallow succession in the semi-arid zone of West Africa (Senegal). Abundance of plant feeding nematodes, non-plant feeding nematodes, plant parasite index (PPI), species richness and Shannon evenness of plant parasitic nematodes were measured at five stages of succession: fields, early (1-3 years), intermediate (8-10 years), old (18-20 years) fallows, and forest stage. These nematological indexes were analyzed simultaneously by multivariate analysis to show the indicative properties of nematode communities. Overall, changes in abundance of nematode groups, PPI and diversity, show continuous trends from early fallow to mature stages of the succession; these trends parallel theoretical trends in secondary succession. In addition, soil nematode parameters were meaningful and expressed interactions of various uncontrolled factors with successional processes, such as environmental conditions or cropping history. During the 3 years of the survey, the structure of nematode communities, described by index analysis, showed little temporal change and supported the use of nematodes as stable indicators.

AB  - A suite of biomarkers was used to evaluate acute (l-day) to semichronic (3-month) heavy metal-induced toxicity in channel catfish, lctalurus punctatus, caged at an abandoned strip mine and a noncontaminated reference site. Assays performed include indicators of metabolic, hematological, osmoregulatory, and genotoxic stress. Two cage designs were used to evaluate the importance of exposure routes: one excluding contact with the sediments and the other allowing contact with water and sediments. Significant DNA strand breakage was observed in catfish exposed to both exposure regimens, but evidence of DNA repair was observed only in water-exposed catfish. Transient increases in hemoglobin, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, and hematocrit levels were observed at 1 month's exposure for both exposure regimens, followed by a return to control levels for the duration of the study. Environmental conditions (i.e., weather-related changes in water quality) may have contributed to the variable plasma chloride and glucose levels observed in all catfish exposed to strip-mine wastes. The transient changes in biomarkers followed by a return to reference values represent an initial stress and an acclimation to normal levels. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - The lightweight sustainable construction composites prepared with the waste materials are enormously utilized for the construction activities. The geopolymer concrete (GPC) has emerged as the sustainable construction composite and holds potential to get modified as the lightweight composite. To confirm the sustainability attributes and feasibility of the lightweight material for the strength adequacy, the lightweight geopolymer concrete (LWGPC) was prepared with the expanded clay aggregates (ECA) is evaluated for density, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, impact resistance and the ultrasonic pulse velocity response. The sustainability attributes of LWGPC were evaluated by the environment impact assessment (EIA). The objective was to ensure the feasibility of the LWGPC for the lightweight construction applications and the impacts of the composite on the environment. The results showed significant reduction of the density of the composite due to the ECA (0-100% by weight of the natural aggregates). With the replacement of the natural aggregates up to 50% the composite performed fairly well for all the test conditions.

AB  - The WWF water risk assessment tool is a universal methodology, as the establishment of its indicators fully consider various types of natural and social environments. When this tool is applied to China, a large country with a complex water situation in a period of rapid development, appropriate localization adjustment is necessary to ensure that indicators are generally stable and assessment results are internationally comparable. Based on the localization of WWF water risk assessment tools, this is the first application assessing water risk in China in terms of physical risks, regulatory risks and reputation risks. It explores the sources of China's water risk from industrial sectors and constructs a classification index system according to the degree of water dependence and the level of water pollution. Using the classification index system and relevant data, we find the key industrial sectors, enterprises and production processes to reduce water risk in China's ten major water valleys and offer some effective and practical management suggestions. Due to the large regional differences of water risk-bearing capacity in China, the assessment results should be interpreted in combination with specific national conditions of China and emphasis should be laid on key areas and industries.

AB  - Following a series of transformative political and legal battles, California's overcrowded prison system has moved in the direction of moderate decarceration. A softer stance on punishment means that thousands of previously ineligible inmates serving indeterminate sentences are now being considered for release on parole. Drawing on ethnographic observations of twenty parole hearings in one California men's prison, this study outlines how rehabilitation has come to be enmeshed in a logic of punitivity, as parole commissioners subject inmates to an individualizing gaze that misrecognizes the socially embedded nature of their performance. Parole commissioners are tasked with assessing dangerousness, deploying a multifaceted conception of risk that combines formalized actuarial instruments and evaluative judgments to form the inchoate and contradictory notion of "insight." Inmates are expected to demonstrate this if they are to be released, but what is insight? Parole boards assume that it is a valid indicator of future behavior and probable recidivism, and parole commissioners posit that successful inmates will be capable of demonstrating authentic remorse and insight, unimpeded by the constraints of an austere and dangerous carceral environment. However, the discretionary criteria established by the penal system are limited by the deleterious living conditions established by this same penal system.

AB  - Genetically engineered (GE) cropswith stacked insecticidal traits expose arthropods tomultiple Cry proteins fromBacillus thuringiensis (Bt). One concern is that the different Cry proteins may interact and lead to unexpected adverse effects on non-target species. Bi-and tri-trophic experiments with SmartStax maize, herbivorous spider mites (Tetranychus urticae), aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi), predatory spiders (Phylloneta impressa), ladybeetles (Harmonia axyridis) and lacewings (Chrysoperla carnea) were conducted. Cry1A. 105, Cry1F, Cry3Bb1 and Cry34Ab1 moved in a similar pattern through the arthropod food chain. By contrast, Cry2Ab2 had highest concentrations in maize leaves, but lowest in pollen, and lowest acquisition rates by herbivores and predators. While spider mites contained Cry protein concentrations exceeding the values in leaves (except Cry2Ab2), aphids contained only traces of some Cry protein. Predators contained lower concentrations than their food. Among the different predators, ladybeetle larvae showed higher concentrations than lacewing larvae and juvenile spiders. Acute effects of SmartStax maize on predator survival, development andweightwere not observed. The study thus provides evidence that the different Cry proteins do not interact in a way that poses a risk to the investigated non-target species under controlled laboratory conditions.

AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the effect of the process of natural bioremediation, and bioremediation supported by ZB-01 microbiological preparation on the occurrence of Collembola andAraneaein conditions of soil contaminated by petroleum-derived substances. The studies were conducted in 2010-2012, in the area of the Experiment Station of the University of Agriculture, near Krakow. In June 2010, the soil surface was contaminated with petrol, diesel fuel and engine oil with amount of 6 000 mg per kg of dry mass of soil. The studies were conducted in two series. The first employed microbiological bioremediation using ZB-01 biopreparation, and the second - without applying this process. The catching of invertebrates was done by usingpitfall traps. The results of the experiment show thatthe representatives of the EntomobryidaeandIsotomidae families are suitable for assessing the rate of bioremediation. Epigeic spiders do not react negatively to soil contamination. Biopreparationcaused the acceleration of the recolonisation of the soil by representatives of the Isotomidae and Hypogastruidae families. With regard to the spiders, the application of biopreparation eliminated the aforementioned effect of increasing the numbers of the Lycosidae family in the object contaminated with engine oil.

AB  - This paper develops and implements an integrated method to assess climate vulnerability in a socio-natural system by identifying and linking the natural and socio-economic factors that increase such vulnerability. With these insights, the method assists in developing effective strategies and measures to increase the system's resilience and adaptability to the adverse impacts of climate variability and change. In order to detect and address the interactions between natural and socioeconomic dynamics, the climate vulnerability of the socio-natural system, later referred to as study area, is considered based on the concept of a complex adaptive system and is characterized through its natural, economic and socio-cultural local environments. A climate vulnerability index (CVI) is defined as a function dependent on 3 sub-indices, namely: climate exposure, resilience and adaptability, and the related second-order variables. The method was developed to be applied in the following steps: (1) characterization of the natural and socio-economic dynamics; (2) integrated assessment of socio-economic, environmental and climatic baseline and future conditions, through use of an indicator system, related sub-indices and the CVI; and (3) comparative analysis of current and future CVI values, to be used for guidance in adaptation efforts.

AB  - This article brings forth recommendations from a workshop sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Science to Achieve Results (STAR) and Environmental Monitoring and Assessment (EMAP) Programs and by the Council of State Governments, held during May 2002 in Kansas City, Kansas. The workshop assembled microbial ecologists and environmental scientists to determine what research and science is needed to bring existing molecular biological approaches and newer technologies arising from microbial genomic research into environmental monitoring and water quality assessments. Development of genomics and proteomics technologies for environmental science is a very new area having potential to improve environmental water quality assessments. The workshop participants noted that microbial ecologists are already using molecular biological methods well suited for monitoring and water quality assessments and anticipate that genomics-enabled technologies could be made available for monitoring within a decade. Recommendations arising from the workshop include needs for (i) identification of informative microbial gene sequences, (ii) improved understandings of linkages between indicator taxa, gene expression and environmental condition, (iii) technological advancements towards field application, and (iv) development of the appropriate databases.

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors.

AB  - The effects of nitrogen (N) deposition on the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum within montane heath in Scotland were investigated over 5 yr.
   Permanent field plots were sprayed with KNO3 or NH4Cl solutions, at doses equivalent to 10 and 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), in 3-6 applications each summer.
   Racomitrium growth and cover were severely reduced by N addition, whilst the proportion of dead shoots greatly increased. N dose decreased inducibility of shoot nitrate reductase activity (NRA), suggesting that N saturation of Racomitrium occurred, and caused an increase in potassium leakage. At high dosage, effects of NH4+ were more detrimental than NO3-.
   Physiological responses to N indicate that the habitat's critical load (CL) is exceeded by addition of 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The differential toxicity of the two forms of N suggests that predominant ion type in deposition should be taken into consideration when CLs are set. In contrast to tissue N, NRA correlated well with shoot growth, and may thus be a useful biological indicator of moss condition.

AB  - Sediment cores from two mountain lakes (Lake Grusha at 2413 m a.s.l. and Ak-Khol at 2204 m a.s.l.) situated in the Tuva Republic (southern Siberia, Russia), just north of Mongolia, were studied for chironomid fossils in order to infer post-glacial climatic changes and to investigate responses of the lake ecosystems to these changes. The results show that chironomids are responding both to temperature and to changing lake depth, which is regarded as a sensitive proxy of regional effective moisture. The post-glacial history of this mountain region in Central Asia can be divided into seven successive climatic phases: the progressive warming during the last glacial-interglacial transition (ca 15.8-14.6 cal kyr BP), the warm and moist Bolling-Allerod-like interval (ca 14.6-13.1 cal kyr BP), the cool and dry Younger Dryas-like event (ca 13.1-12.1 cal kyr BP), warmer and wetter conditions during ca 12.1-8.5 cal kyr BP, a warm and dry phase ca 8.5-5.9 cal kyr BP, cold and wet conditions during ca 5.9-1.8 cal kyr BP, as well as cold and dry climate within the last 1800 years. The chironomid records reveal patterns of climatic variability during the Late-glacial and Holocene, which can be correlated with abrupt climatic events in the North Atlantic and the Asian monsoon-dominated regimes. Apparently, the water balance of the studied lakes is controlled by the interrelation between the dominant westerly system and the changing influence of the summer monsoon, as well as the influence of alpine glacier meltwater supply. It is possible that monsoon tracks could have reached the southwest Tuva, resulting in an increase in precipitation at ca 14.6-13.1 and ca 12.1-8.5cal kyr BP, whereas cyclonic westerlies from the North Atlantic were likely responsible for considerable moisture transport accompanying the global Neoglacial cooling at ca 5.9-1.8 cal kyr BP. These events suggest the changes of the regional pattern of atmospheric circulation, which could be in turn induced by the global climatic shifts. Some discrepancies compared with other reconstructions from Central Asia may be associated with regional (spatial) differences between the changing predominant circulation mechanisms and with local differences in uplift and descent of air masses within the complicated mountain landscape. In this paper, we also discuss the possibilities and perspectives for using chironomids in reconstructions of past temperatures and climate-induced changes in water depth of lakes in Central Asia.

AB  - Concerns about the environmental effects of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) on marine ecosystems are increasing. Meanwhile, ocean acidification (OA) has become a global environmental problem. However, the combined effects of NPs and OA on marine organisms are still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of OA (pH values of 7.77 and 7.47) on the bioavailability and toxicity of TiO2 NPs to the marine microalga Chlorella vulgaris. The results showed that OA enhanced the growth inhibition of algal cells caused by TiO2 NPs. We observed synergistic interactive effects of pH and TiO2 NPs on oxidative stress, indicating that OA significantly increased the oxidative damage of TiO2 NPs on the algal cells. Importantly, the elevated toxicity of TiO2 NPs associated with OA could be explained by the enhanced internalization of NPs in algal cells, which was attributed to the slighter aggregation and more suspended particles in acidified seawater. Overall, these findings provide useful information on marine environmental risk assessments of NPs under near future OA conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, the bivalve Scrobicularia plana and the polychaete Diopatra neapolitana were exposed to an increasing carbamazepine (CBZ) concentration gradient. Both species are among the most widely used bioindicators, and CBZ is one of the most commonly found drugs in the aquatic environment. After a chronic exposure (28 days), the results obtained revealed that CBZ induced biochemical alterations in both species. Our findings demonstrated that S. plana and D. neapolitana reduced the CBZ accumulation rate at higher CBZ concentrations, probably due to their capacity to decrease their feeding rates at stressful conditions. Nevertheless, this defence mechanism was not enough to prevent both species from oxidative stress. In fact, S. plana and D. neapolitana were not able to efficiently activate their antioxidant defence mechanisms which resulted in the increase of lipid peroxidation, especially at the highest CBZ concentrations. Comparing both species, it seems that S. piano was the most sensitive species since stronger biochemical alterations were observed in this species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The changes in species composition of two isolated stands of Silver fir mixed forest (ass. Abietetum albae, syn. Abietetum polonicum) on the north-western border of its range in Poland were investigated, based on published data from 1966, 1995 and the authors' releves made in 2011-2012. Transformation of vegetation was assessed using relative changes in species density and ordinations (PCA). Environmental conditions were specified using Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) due to the lack of direct measurements from the past. The Zeleny-Schaffers permutation test was used to assess correlation of EIVs with the sample scores of the PCA main axes. Results of the analyses suggest that among the ecological factors causing modifications in species composition were the changes in soil reaction and increase in temperature that occurred between 1961 and 2012. The gradual transition of Silver fir mixed forest in the Polish highlands from mesophilous to acidophilous forest is noticeable, both within investigated areas and the main range of this association in the country. The most likely reasons for this transition may be acidification caused by air pollution and climate change.

AB  - Coastal marshes are composed of distinct vegetation assemblages that contribute to ecosystem functions and services over time and space. In recent decades, natural and anthropogenic changes have led to large-scale marsh loss along the Chenier Plain of the Gulf of Mexico. An understanding of the composition and dominance of the vegetation assemblages that form these coastal marshes is necessary to effectively assess and monitor their stability under changing conditions. To investigate marsh vegetation assemblages along the Texas Chenier Plain, we analyzed the composition and dominance of 135 marsh plots distributed across two study areas bordering the East Bay of Galveston Bay in Chambers County, Texas using cluster analysis. Seven general vegetation assemblages were identified. The assemblages were evaluated using indicator species analysis and Multi-Response Permutation Procedures and compared to marsh vegetation assemblages found in the Louisiana Chenier Plain. Our data provide a foundation for better understanding of vegetation patterns found along the East Texas Chenier Plain allowing managers and conservationists the ability to better evaluate the effects of marsh change due to climatic and human driven pressures.

AB  - Burrowing animals fundamentally influence the character of soils, ecosystem function, erosion, and soil management for food production and hazardous wastes. Perhaps the most important indicator of their potential impacts is the average void space created for burrow construction and maintenance per unit area per unit time. We integrated published estimates of burrow volume (m(3)) and excavation rates (m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) of pocket gophers (Rodentia: Geomyidae) to assess their reliability in assessment of impacts and whether these variables are scale-dependent. Estimates were difficult to interpret and compare because research goals, assumptions, and methods varied considerably among studies, as did site conditions and reporting of results. Volume of burrows made by various species of pocket gophers averaged 0.68 m(3), and averages differed significantly between species. Rate of excavation averaged 18 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) for Geomyidae, and it declined with increasing spatial extent of study area used to make the estimates. Counts of mounds produced the largest estimates of burrow volume and excavation rate, and injection of polyurethane foam into burrows produced low estimates. High variation in estimated rates of burrow excavation indicates the need for further research to characterize magnitude and types of impacts gophers have on natural and managed ecosystems.

AB  - Microfibres are among the most prevalent type of microplastics in marine environments. Man-made fibres derived from cellulose are distributed worldwide, but are often confused with synthetic plastic fibres and consequently neglected. All these fibres may adversely affect aquatic organisms, but their levels and potential effects in wild fish remain unknown. We analysed anthropogenic fibre (AF) ingestion in the red mullet (Mullus barbatus), at both temporal and geographical scales, to assess potential effects of these fibres on fish health condition. AFs were present in 50% of fish digestive tracts, with a mean of 1.48 AFs per individual (SD = 1.98). In Barcelona, an increase of 46% in AF ingestion was observed in 2018 compared to 2007. AF ingestion also increases by 20% when Barcelona is compared to a less urban area (the town of Blanes). Visual characterization of fibres by typologiescorroborated by Raman spectroscopyallowed classification and identification of 88% of AFs as cellulosic (57%), and synthetic polymers (PET) (31%). In all sampling stations, the only histopathological alterations were cysts of unknown etiology, and the most abundant parasites were nematodes. None of these alterations, parasite load, or other fish health indicators (condition indices) indicate an effect of AF ingestion.

AB  - In calculations of future energy demand and environmental pollution problems in which waste-heat recovery play a significant role, efficiency often is the primary factor. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) continues to attract the widespread interest of researchers and/or manufacturer due to technical compatibility, feasibility, and reliability for low to medium grade waste-heat sources. This paper presents thermo-economic analysis on flue-gas assisted organic Rankine cycles (FGA-ORCs) based on both energy and exergy concepts. The heat source of the FGA-ORC system is the exhaust flue-gas of a stenter-frame which is highly used in the textile finishing process. In this study, to convert thermal energy into electrical and/or mechanical energy, an optimization study is performed using three different cycle architectures which have two turbines. Performance indicators such as thermal efficiency, exergetic efficiency, economic profit, performance ratio, and carbon footprint index were examined for the different operating conditions of three investigated thermal architectures. Finally, under the specified operating conditions, the thermal architecture with the best thermo-economic performance was determined by the reduced exergy destruction and increased economic profit due to increased net-work output.

AB  - The paper concerns the experimental research related to the removal of color and permanganate index (CODMn) in the presence of iron and manganese from the underground water by means of coagulation and ozonation. The tests were carried out on a laboratory and technical scale in the real underground water treatment system. Ozone, as a strong oxidizing agent, was used to reduce the color intensity and to convert the iron Fe2+ and manganese ions Mn2+ to Fe(OH)(3) and MnO2, respectively. In order to optimally remove the color to a value below 15 mg/L, the ozone dose of 3 mg/L was sufficient, which also ensured the proper removal of iron and manganese, by 94% and 83%, respectively. However, ozonation conducted under these conditions, did not provide sufficient removal of organic compounds expressed as CODMn below the assumed value of 3 mg/L. The effect of aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride (PAC) was also studied, as a result of which it was found that polyaluminum chloride proved to be more effective reagent. Under the technical conditions of water purification at a dose of 16 mg/L coagulant, the efficiency of color removal was 65.2% and CODMn - 50.8%, which ensured that the values of the tested indicators in the purified water were maintained below the permissible level.

AB  - In this paper a preliminary analysis of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) able to generate at least 100 kW electric power is carried out. Restrictions on the installed power of small farms that are in isolated locations and cannot connect to NPS generally diminish productive activities and, implicitly, profit. Depending on the renewable energy resources (sun, wind, hydro) the characteristics of the isolated location of the work point, the optimal HRES system required for an efficient operation of the agricultural farm even under isolated conditions can be determined by the synthesis elaborated in this paper.
   Renewable energies that are characteristic to abiotic environment have been approached, describing the current technological methods of transforming them into electricity. Critical issues related to energy storage variants were also considered for periods of time when renewable sources are not sufficient to ensure the electricity consumption needs. The mathematical model of the process of generating electricity from renewable sources has been elaborated in order to perform the global energy calculation of the optimum hybrid system required for the isolated farm.
   These elements lead to the determination of the technical-economic indicator zeta (sic)/kW of the HRES system in the management of the agricultural farm from the perspective of a sustainable agriculture that produces more with lower costs and in environmentally friendly conditions.

This paper reviews the main RES systems and how they can be combined into a hybrid system. The optimal development of a complex hybrid system with applicability in the micro-networks of the isolated agricultural farms without possibility of connection to the NPS was followed.

AB  - The population of the Far Eastern region is under stress due to daily exposure to harmful and carcinogenic substances in the air, with average annual levels exceeding health standards. The purpose of this study is to assess the medical and environmental situation in the Far Eastern region and to identify relationships between environmental factors and the incidence in the population. For four years, studies have been conducted to assess the impact of environmental pollution on public health using basic demographic and morbidity indicators for the emissions of harmful substances, according to the data from State reports On the sanitary-epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation and statistical data from the Federal Statistics Service of the Russian Federation. In the course of this research, it was found that the increase in the incidence of malignant neoplasms was promoted by an increase in the amount of air-polluting emissions and an increase in the proportion of people employed in heavy work under conditions that do not meet health requirements. Using the regression equation, the impact of the amount of wastewater discharges and the amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere demonstrated an increase in respiratory diseases. As a preventive measure against negative environmental factors, the mandatory use of local adaptogens in everyday food products has been proposed.

AB  - This paper describes the development and application of a signal-based fault detection method for identifying gas leakage in hydraulic accumulators used in wind turbines. The method uses Multiresolution Signal Decomposition (MSD) based on wavelets for feature extraction from a single fluid pressure measurement located close to the accumulator. Gas leakage is shown to create increased variations in this pressure signal. The Root Mean Square (RMS) of the detail coefficient Level 9 from the MSD is found as the most sensitive and robust fault indicator of gas leakage. The method is verified on an experimental setup allowing for the replication of the conditions for accumulators in wind turbines. Robustness is tested in a multi-fault environment where gas and external fluid leakage occurs simultaneously. In total, 24 experiments are performed, which show that the method is sensitive to gas leakage in the desired range and can be isolated from external fluid leakage. Additionally, the robustness to other operating conditions, such as wind speeds between rated and cut-off, turbulence intensity and ambient temperature is evaluated via simulations of a pitch system in a wind turbine using the Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence program (FAST). Simulation shows that robustness is affected at low ambient temperatures, however, detection is permitted in the range of 22-60 degrees C.

AB  - Whereas the hygienic condition of drinking and bathing water by law must be monitored by culture-based methods, for quantification of microbes and antibiotic resistance in soil or the aquatic environment, often molecular genetic assays are used. For comparison of both methods, knowledge of their correlation is necessary. Therefore the population of total bacteria, Escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci during sewage treatment and in receiving river water was compared by agar plating and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. In parallel, all samples were investigated for clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes. Whereas plating and qPCR data for total bacteria correlated well in sewage after primary treatment, qPCR data of river water indicated higher cell numbers for E. coli. It is unknown if these cells are 'only' not growing under standard conditions or if they are dead. Corresponding to the amount of non-culturable cells, the 'breakpoints' for monitoring water quality should be adapted. The abundances of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes in river water were in the same order of magnitude or even higher than in treated sewage. For estimation of the health risk it is important to investigate which species carry respective genes and whether these genes are disseminated via gene transfer.

AB  - The coastal landscape of Terengganu is dominated by dune landscape formed on dune ridge-originated soil. It supports three distinct natural vegetation types, namely, lowland mixed dipterocarp forest, heath vegetation and Melaleuca swamp. A study was conducted to update the checklist of woody plant species in the first two formations. A belt transect plot of 50 m x 100 m was set up at the Jambu Bongkok Forest Reserve to enumerate trees with 5 cm and larger diameter at breast height (dbh). In the heath vegetation, two belt transect plots of 20 m x 20 m were established at each site of Jambu Bongkok and Lembah Bidong. A total of 44 species from 22 families of woody plants were documented with Shorea materialis (Dipterocarpaceae) dominating in Jambu Bongkok, suggesting that site soil conditions might favour this species over other common coastal species. Most trees had stem diameter of 6-15 cm dbh with only 18 from 451 stems measuring > 50 cm. Soil conditions might limit tree growth resulting in a more uniform stem size. Heath vegetation in Jambu Bongkok supported higher diversity of woody plants than Lembah Bidong. Woody species from 10 families present at both sites could be indicator species for dune landscapes. This paper provides an updated checklist of woody plants on dune landscape of Terengganu.

AB  - The Early Late Cretaceous transition marked the beginning of the final disintegration of the Adriatic Carbonate Platform, which eventually resulted in the formation of the Dinarides mountain belt in the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary. In southern Istria (Croatia) a continuous succession crops out that shows deepening from shallow subtidal to carbonate ramp in the latest Albian followed by gradual shallowing in the early Cenomanian, including well-preserved Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides burrow systems in sections from Cintinera Cove and Vinkuran quarry. Burrow systems that overlie hummocky cross-stratified deposits are good indicators of specific environmental conditions during deposition. During transgression, favorable conditions for suspension- and deposit-feeding crustaceans were established which resulted in complex networks of Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides. The increase in bioturbation up-section is recorded by a gradual increase in the bioturbation index as well as the size of burrow systems during transgressive events; a completely bioturbated interval in Vinkuran quarry indicates the maximum flooding surface. Formation of burrow systems was interrupted by subsequent clinoform progradation interpreted as a highstand shedding of shallow-marine bioclasts caused by high carbonate production and intense bioerosion of rudist and chondrodont shells, causing the relatively rapid infilling of the basin and re-establishment of the shallow-marine peritidal deposition in the entire northwestern part of the Adriatic Carbonate Platform.

AB  - The present work focuses on the reactivity of coal fly ash in aqueous solutions studied through geochemical modelling. The studied coal fly ashes originate from South African industrial sites. The adopted methodology is based on mineralogical analysis, laboratory leaching tests and geochemical modelling. A quantitative modelling approach is developed here in order to determine the quantities of different solid phases composing the coal fly ash. It employs a geochemical code (PHREEQC) and a numerical optimisation tool developed under MATLAB, by the intermediate of a coupling program. The experimental conditions are those of the laboratory leaching test, i.e. liquid/solid ratio of 10 L/kg and 48 h contact time. The simulation results compared with the experimental data demonstrate the feasibility of such approach, which is the scope of the present work. The perspective of the quantitative geochemical modelling is the waste reactivity prediction in different leaching conditions and time frames. This work is part of a largest research project initiated by Sasol and Eskom companies, the largest South African coal consumers, aiming to address the issue of waste management of coal combustion residues and the environmental impact assessment of coal ash disposal on land.

TI  - Main concepts of the "European approach" to karst-groundwater-vulnerability assessment and mapping
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - In order to achieve some consistency in the establishment of groundwater intrinsic vulnerability maps in Europe. a new, approach is proposed by Working Group 1 of the European COST Action 620 on "Vulnerability mapping for the protection of carbonate (karst) aquifers". A general procedure is offered which provides consistency while allowing the required flexibility for application to a continent and under conditions of varying geology, scale, information availability, time, and resources.
   The proposed methodology is designed to be clearly more physically based than the existing vulnerability-mapping techniques. It takes the specificity of the karstic environments into account without necessarily excluding the applicability to other geological conditions. Combined "core factors" for overlying layers and for concentration of flow, account for the relative protection of groundwater from contamination while taking into account any bypass of the overlying layers.
   A precipitation factor is distinguished for describing: characteristics of the input of water to the system. Differentiation is made between groundwater resource intrinsic vulnerability Mapping and Source intrinsic vulnerability mapping. For the latter, a factor describing the karst network development is relevant. This short technical note describes a first stop in the work program of Working Group 1 of the COST Action 620. Future steps are now in progress to quantify the approach and to apply it in various European pilot areas.

AB  - The reproductive seasonality of Puntius schwanenfeldii from the Perak River, Malaysia was investigated over a 19 month period. Females greater than 160 g had mature or rematuring ovaries, and males of all sizes had mature testes throughout the study period. Analysis of female reproductive condition was based upon the presence of post ovulatory follicles (POF), the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the volume fraction of stage IV oocytes (IV%), and GSI and presence of tubercles for males. Recrudescence followed immediately after ovulation, which allowed the use of objective thresholds to identify recently spawned females during the GSI and IV% recovery period. GSI and IV% were the best indicators of reproductive patterns as a result of their recovery period being longer than for POF. Male tubercles and GSI showed some statistically significant variation, but no clear relation with observed changes in female indicators. Reproduction was apparently aseasonal, and this pattern is likely an effect of flow regulation by dams which have virtually eliminated the dominant flood period and most seasonal flow variation. Hypothesized shifts in the reproductive seasonality due to flow regulation are consistent with predictions based on life history theory under conditions of altered environmental seasonality.

AB  - The present work studied the effect of two consecutive years of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) compared to rain fed management on the vegetative growth, yield, and quality of 'Nero d'Avola' grapes. The trial was conducted separately in two soils (vertisol and entisol) located at the top and bottom hillside of the same vineyard. Vertisol was characterized by greater depth, organic matter, exchangeable K2O, and total N than entisol. RDI was based on an irrigation volume at 25% of estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) up to end of veraison and 10% of estimated ETc up to 15 days before harvest. Predawn water potential (PDWP) was used as indicator of plant water status and irrigation timing. No difference in irrigation management was evident between vertisol and entisol. Under Mediterranean climate conditions, RDI was able to enhance grape yield and vegetative growth, especially in vertisol, but it reduced berry titratable acidity and total anthocyanins. 'Nero d'Avola' showed to adapt to drought conditions in the open field. Both soil type and irrigation regimes may provide opportunities to obtain different 'Nero d'Avola' wine quality and boost typicality.

AB  - The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) listed the cod Gadus morhua as one of the target species for environmental biomonitoring in the Baltic, but only limited data on morphological biomarkers in this fish have been published so far. This pilot study examined cod tissues for the presence of selected biomarkers that have been studied in other target fish species for this region: flounder Platichthys flesus, herring Clupea harengus, and eelpout Zoarces viviparus. Twenty cod were collected in May 2012 off the Polish coast near Ustka. The biomarkers studied included condition factor, macroscopic lesions, morphometry of hepatic and splenic melanomacrophages, ovarian follicular atresia, and histopathology of spleen, liver, and gonads. All fish appeared in good body condition and had no macroscopic lesions except for one with multifocal dermal ulcers. Microscopic lesions were present in all fish, and included biliary myxozoanosis, ovarian microsporidiosis, larval nematodes compatible with Anisakidae, one case of intravascular trematodiasis, necrocentric granulomas, mild inflammatory and toxicopathic hepatocellular lesions, and marked accumulations of splenic melanomacrophages. This pilot study expands the types of microscopic lesions that have been documented as part of biomonitoring efforts in Baltic cod.

AB  - In light of a significant increase in the warming trend observed in recent decades in semi-arid Mongolia, tree-ring attributes and anomalies were analysed to detect potential changes in the growth-climate relationship. In a moisture-limited environment, an increase in temperature could cause a shift in the seasonal response of trees to climate. Chronologies were developed for the dominant tree species (Larix sibirica Ledeb., Pinus sibirica Du Tour, and Pinus sylvestris L.) from north-central Mongolia. In addition to annual ring width, both earlywood and latewood width were measured, and tree-ring anomalies such as false rings and light rings were systematically identified. Earlywood width was mainly associated with precipitation in the year prior to ring formation and early growing season conditions. Temperature was associated with current year growth and mainly influenced latewood development. False rings were good indicators of early summer droughts, whereas light rings were mainly associated with a cold end of summer. A seasonal shift in the significance of monthly climate variables was observed in recent decades. This displacement presumably resulted from changes in the timing and duration of the growing season. Tree growth starts earlier in spring and is now affected by late summer to early autumn climate conditions.

AB  - In this study we investigated the use of a DNA dosimeter to accurately measure changes in ultraviolet B radiation (UVBR; 280-315 nm) under Antarctic ozone hole conditions. Naked DNA solution in quartz tubes was exposed to ambient solar radiation at Rothera Research Station, Antarctica, between October and December 1998 for 3 h during UVBR peak hours (1200-1500 h). Trends in UVBR-mediated DNA damage (formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers [CPD]) were related to cloud cover, ozone-column depth and spectroradiometric measurements of ambient radiation. Ozone-column depths ranged from 130 to 375 DU during the study period, resulting in highly variable UVBR doses, from 1.6 to 137 kJ m(-2) over the 3 h exposure, as measured by spectro-radiometry. There was a strong positive correlation (86%) between dosimeter CPD concentrations and DNA-weighted UVBR doses. Ozone depth was a strong predictor of DNA damage (63%), and there was no significant relationship between CPD formation and cloud cover. Subtle changes in spectral characteristics caused by ozone depletion were detected by the biodosimeter; the highest CPD concentrations were observed in October when ozone-mediated shifts favored shorter wavelengths of UVBR. We conclude that the DNA biodosimeter is an accurate indicator of biologically effective UVBR, even under highly variable ozone conditions.

AB  - Local and synoptic conditions associated with freezing-rain events in the continental United States, as well as the temporal and spatial variability of these conditions, have been documented for the period 1976-90. It had been postulated that the characteristics of the thermodynamic stratification observed during freezing rain would be similar regardless of geographical location. However, through hypothesis testing, it was found that some interregional variability exists in the magnitude of various sounding parameters that the authors felt characterized the important aspects of the thermodynamic profile of freezing-rain environments. This variability seems to be related not only to local effects resulting from terrain variations and nearby water sources, but also from regional differences in synoptic-scale atmospheric environments favorable for freezing rain.
   These results suggest that freezing-rain forecast techniques, which rely on critical parameters derived for specific geographical locations, may not be applicable if applied elsewhere. Therefore, forecasters evaluating the possibility of freezing rain over synoptic-scale areas should not expect one variable that characterizes a sounding to be an accurate indicator of freezing rain across the entire region. Algorithms that evaluate the entire thermodynamic profile and consider the effect of this profile on frozen and freezing precipitation may provide forecasters with a quick and more accurate method of evaluating the potential for freezing rain than traditional forecast techniques, such as partial thickness.

AB  - Structural degradation of Vertisols depresses cotton lint yield by extending the period of waterlogging following irrigation or heavy rainfall. Break crops such as wheat and safflower are often grown without irrigation to improve the macroporosity of degraded Vertisols, by encouraging deep cracking, after several years of cotton production.
   Investigations were made into the effects of cultivated fallow, wheat and safflower on soil structure, and the growth of a subsequent cotton crop. The tests reported in this paper, done over a 12-day period following irrigation, were: soil water content and potential, core and clod bulk density, air-filled porosity, an index of macropore continuity using Rhodamine dye, and penetration resistance.
   The results, when compared with established limits of aeration and penetration resistance to cotton root growth, indicate that soil physical conditions at 0.25 m should have impeded root growth regardless of water content. However, cotton roots continued to extract water in this hostile soil environment; this favourable performance was attributed to the better conditions for root growth in the interaggregate fissures than those within aggregates.
   Apart from water content, all indicators of soil structure were able to differentiate consistently between the three crop treatments to a depth of 0.25 m. Below 0.8 m, the cropped plots, particularly safflower, had lower water contents than the fallow plots.

AB  - Practice change is essential if environmental agencies are to incorporate diverse values in decision making, but little is currently known about what constrains or enables such change. Over a 19-month period, we observed how environmental professionals responded to an agency request that they consider a wider range of values in strategic bushfire management planning than had been considered in past practice. Through participant observation, interviews and document analysis, we examined how practices did and did not change and what contributed to these outcomes. Practices for assessing well understood values (e.g. towns and houses, ecological resilience) were refined, while practices for handling less familiar values (e.g. animal welfare, economic values and Indigenous cultural heritage) were either maintained, adapted or transformed, with outcomes varying across values and regions. The findings partly confirm expected biases toward values that can be spatially located and quantified, and point to other conditions supporting change to incorporate new types of values: alignment between policy and planning guidance, alignment between a value and priorities of professionals and agencies involved in planning, collaboration that supported input from cross-agency actors, and scope for experimentation. We discuss the practical implications of these findings for agencies seeking to incorporate values in environmental planning.

AB  - Many river networks in southern Europe are intermittent. In summer, the surface flow is zero and many streams become isolated pools. In this study, 128 dry season pools were studied covering first- to fourth-order streams on the Degebe River network (south Portugal). The aim of the study was to identify pool types based on environmental drivers and conditions and fish assemblages. In summer, dry streambed area exceeded 50% in all reaches and 95% in headwater sections. The pool features were primarily shaped by their location in the river network, which determined the pool morphology and the structure of fish assemblages. Pool sizes increased from upstream to downstream, as did species richness and diversity. Pools in upstream reaches were dominated by small native fishes while the larger-sized individuals tended to occupy deeper, larger, and more persistent pools. Smaller pools in downstream reaches were dominated by non-native species, which may be related to habitat preferences and minimization of negative interactions between native and non-native species. Because dry season pools represent key habitats in intermittent streams, conservation programs should be designed to reduce human pressures and improve hydromorphological heterogeneity and water quality, taking into account the natural patterns of pool types at regional and local scales.

AB  - Mountain regions are sensitive to climate changes, which make them good indicators of climate change. The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation in the Polish Carpathians. This study consists of climatological analyses for the historical period 1851-2010 and future projections for 2021-2100. The results confirm that there has been significant warming of the area and that this warming has been particularly pronounced over the last few decades and will continue in the oncoming years. Climate change is most evident in the foothills; however, these are the highest summits which have experienced the most intensive increases in temperature during the recent period. Precipitation does not demonstrate any substantial trend and has high year-to-year variability. The distribution of the annual temperature contour lines modelled for selected periods provides evidence of the upward shift of vertical climate zones in the Polish Carpathians, which reach approximately 350 meters, on average, what indicates further ecological consequences as ecosystems expand or become extinct and when there are changes in the hydrological cycle.

AB  - The salt marsh grass Spartina anglica is an important habitat-modifying ecosystem engineering agent that facilitates large-scale salt marsh formation by enhancing sediment accretion. It dominates many European tidal environments and is invasive in many other parts of the world. We question (1) to what extent the ecosystem engineering ability of patchy Spartina vegetation depends on large-scale abiotic processes, and (2) whether tussock shape provides an indicator for future lateral salt marsh development. Analysing the topography of 83 individual tussocks in contrasting environments revealed that there are 6 clearly distinguishable tussock shapes, and that the classical example of a sediment-accumulating dome-shaped tussock only occurs under a limited set of abiotic conditions. The outcome of habitat modification by S. anglica is shown to be conditional, depending on large-scale morphodynamics and sediment grain size. Resulting tussock shape provides a clear indication for the long-term development of the pioneer zone. Understanding of the conditional outcome of ecosystem engineering is highly relevant in this era of climate change and ongoing anthropogenic influences on coastal ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change in California is altering habitat conditions for many species and exacerbating stress from other factors such as alien invasive species, pollution, and habitat fragmentation. However, the current legal and planning framework for species protection does not explicitly take climate change into account. The regulatory framework is primarily reactive, kicking in only after species' health is gravely threatened. Neither federal nor state regulations require forward-looking, climate-sensitive species or ecosystem protection plans. Habitat planning is poorly funded and often piecemeal. In this context, the wrong lands may be protected, with development allowed to occur in areas that would be most beneficial for species conservation in the future. A more forward-looking approach to habitat conservation is needed, one based on a statewide strategy to identify and protect critical habitat areas, including corridors to enable species migration. The approach would also require development of assessment indicators and assistance strategies not dependent on current habitat structure, and a governance structure to implement regular, periodic updates of management plans in relation to agreed-upon performance indicators. Such a strategy should integrate habitat conservation planning with other state and regional plans and objectives, such as for transportation infrastructure, urban development, and mitigation of climate change.

AB  - To determine the good working condition of the biological treatment plant of the University Hospital of Patras, Greece, twenty-four raw sewage samples and twenty-four effluent samples were analyzed for the presence of enteroviruses, adenoviruses and Hepatitis A virus (HAV), during the period of March 1995 to March 1996. We used a nested-PRC approach, to increase the sensitivity of the detection. Enteroviruses and adenoviruses were detected in twelve samples (50%) and fourteen samples (58.3%) of raw sewage, respectively. HAV was not detected in any of the raw sewage samples. The more frequent isolation of adenoviruses in raw sewage, indicates their stability as virological indicators of the pollution of the environment. In addition, a seasonal distribution of the detection of enteroviruses and adenoviruses was observed. The absence of HAV is in agreement with the lack of HAV infections in the hospital during that period of time. In contrast with the raw sewage, we were unable to detect the presence of enteroviruses, adenoviruses in samples collected after the biological treatment plant. This fact indicates the effective treatment of sewage by the local biological purification plant.

AB  - The condition of coastal areas around the world continues to decline despite over 50 years of integrated coastal management efforts. A myriad of institutional instruments such as legislation, policies and plans influence decisions made in the coastal zone. Despite this, there is limited comprehensive analysis of the degree to which institutional arrangements are focused on coastal issues and able to progress coastal management objectives. To address this gap we developed and applied an intentionality and substantiality framework to analyse 92 instruments with a role in coastal management at State, regional and local scales in Australia. We found that: (i) threats to Australia's coast are not adequately identified or managed via institutional instruments; (ii) institutional instruments do not make a contribution to coastal management unless intentionally designed to do so; and (iii) even in the presence of intention, comprehensiveness in the proposed actions is limited. The lack of comprehensive action is particularly evident in instruments operating at the local scale. Consequently, a reliance on local scale support to meet coastal management objectives in isolation is misplaced. While some States have recently implemented coastal reforms, the findings show that the decline in coastal condition is unlikely to be comprehensively addressed through current institutional arrangements.

AB  - Objective. Determine the biological response of broilers by including the probiotic additive Lactobacillus pentosus LB-31 in the diet, which was obtained in an economical culture medium and under different production conditions. Materials and methods. A completely randomized design was used with eight animals per treatment. Two experimental groups were established: the first consumed the basal diet without antibiotics (control group) and the second the basal diet with the addition of Lactobacillus pentosus LB-31 in a concentration of 107 cfu/g of food. Hematological, blood biochemical, morphometric and immunological indicators were determined. Results. At 42 days of age of the animals, there was no difference among treatments for hemoglobin and hematocrit. Albumin/globulin relation and albumin, cholinesterase and glutathione levels increased (p<0.05) while concentrations of globulins, uric acid, pancreatic amylase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglycerides decreased (p<0.05) with the inclusion of LB-31 in the diet. In the morphometric indicators, the probiotic only had an effect (p<0.05) on relative weight (g/kg of live weight) of small intestine that decreased and the abdominal fat that increased. Conclusions. Lactobacillus pentosus LB-31, cultivated in a new culture medium and under different production conditions, maintains its probiotic activity in morpho-physiological and blood biochemistry indicators of broilers.

AB  - In most large cities, public policies have led to reducing the prevalence of cars in different urban spaces, developing pedestrian and bicycle facilities or renewing public transport. This raises the question of the conditions of access to everyday resources throughout the urban agglomeration Are the arrangements for sustainable mobility, particularly soft modes (walking, cycling), configured to meet the needs of the population? Globally or selectively? Do soft modes offer a credible alternative to the car to take advantage of daily life resources? For everybody and where they are?
   To answer these questions, an analysis approach based on the concept of spatial ergonomics has been developed and implemented in a Geographic Information System. It takes into account, on the one hand, the availability and distribution of the potential of non-work resources (businesses, education, health, public services and leisure) and, on the other hand, a panel of criteria characterizing their access conditions (service, security, comfort, monetary cost). Although it is a first application of the principles of spatial ergonomics, the synthetic indicator, decomposed into its various components, and put in perspective with the socio-urban environments, has made it possible to reveal polarizing situations within the Strasbourg Eurometropole. The research is developed as part of an ANR RED project.

AB  - Rapid assessment methods (RAMs) have become an integral part of state and federal wetland programs by providing a consistent method for monitoring and prioritizing wetland conservation efforts. RAMs evaluate condition along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient based on qualitative and quantitative measures of wetland indicators. However, RAM applicability outside of the intended region may be difficult or inappropriate due to differences in wetland types, natural variability, and types of stressors. Given the influence of regional and wetland variability on the effectiveness of RAMs, our approach focused on the development and validation of a method applicable to specific wetland types found in Oklahoma and other regions in the Central Great Plains. We applied the Oklahoma Rapid Assessment Method (OKRAM) in 28 depressional wetlands across the state and evaluated the method's ability to detect condition along a disturbance gradient. We found consistent relationships between OKRAM scores and plant data (e.g., Floristic Quality Index, species richness, and diversity) and with a landscape assessment of anthropogenic disturbance. Based on our results, OKRAM has utility as a tool for differentiating between high and low quality depressional wetlands in Oklahoma, with potential for applicability across other regions of the Central Great Plains.

AB  - Leaf coverage is an indicator of plant growth rate and predicted yield, and thus it is crucial to plant-breeding research. Robust image segmentation of leaf coverage from remote-sensing images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in varying environments can be directly used for large-scale coverage estimation, and is a key component of high-throughput field phenotyping. We thus propose an image-segmentation method based on machine learning to extract relatively accurate coverage information from the orthophoto generated after preprocessing. The image analysis pipeline, including dataset augmenting, removing background, classifier training and noise reduction, generates a set of binary masks to obtain leaf coverage from the image. We compare the proposed method with three conventional methods (Hue-Saturation-Value, edge-detection-based algorithm, random forest) and a frontier deep-learning method called DeepLabv3+. The proposed method improves indicators such as Q(seg), S-r, E-s and mIOU by 15% to 30%. The experimental results show that this approach is less limited by radiation conditions, and that the protocol can easily be implemented for extensive sampling at low cost. As a result, with the proposed method, we recommend using red-green-blue (RGB)-based technology in addition to conventional equipment for acquiring the leaf coverage of agricultural crops.

AB  - Crediting green trade patterns is essential for effective national carbon accounting. Neither production- nor consumption-based accounting satisfies this condition. Thus, Kander et al. [Kander, A., Jiborn, M., Moran, D.D., Wiedmann, T.O., 2015. National greenhouse-gas accounting for effective climate policy on international trade. Nature Climate Chang. 5(5):431-435.] proposed a technology-adjusted consumption-based carbon accounting method that focuses on interregional differences in sectoral carbon intensity. The intermediate input structure is also closely related to the production technology level. Therefore, this study recommends a new technology adjusted consumption-based carbon accounting framework that distinguishes between direct and cumulative exports, forward and backward industrial linkages, and different trade patterns. Based on the consideration that production-based accounting will remain the core indicator for regional emissions in the near future, this study proposes a technology-adjusted production-based accounting framework. The empirical study is based on the World Input-Output Database, and the results indicate that technology-adjusted carbon accounting will redraw the global emissions map if the intermediate input linkage is considered. The technology-adjusted carbon accounting method satisfies the conditions of additivity, sensitivity, monotonicity, and scale invariance, through proper selection of the world average emissions multipliers.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are widely used as tools to maintain biodiversity, protect habitats and ensure that development is sustainable. If MPAs are to maintain their role into the future it is important for managers to understand how conditions at these sites may change as a result of climate change and other drivers, and this understanding needs to extend beyond temperature to a range of key ecosystem indicators. This case study demonstrates how spatially-aggregated model results for multiple variables can provide useful projections for MPA planners and managers. Conditions in European MPAs have been projected for the 2040s using unmitigated and globally managed scenarios of climate change and river management, and hence high and low emissions of greenhouse gases and riverborne nutrients. The results highlight the vulnerability of potential refuge sites in the north-west Mediterranean and the need for careful monitoring at MPAs to the north and west of the British Isles, which may be affected by changes in Atlantic circulation patterns. The projections also support the need for more MPAs in the eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea, and can inform the selection of sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heated moist air from a cooling tower forms a visible plume and needs to be predicted, not only for the performance design of the cooling tower, but also for environmental impact assessments. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics analysis is conducted to predict the scale of a visible plume rising from a cross flow cooling tower with mechanical draft (provided by a rotating fan). The results of computational fluid dynamics analysis are verified by comparing predictions with an actual observed plume. The results show that the predicted visible plume represents the observed plume in an error range of 15%-20%, which is permissible for designing a cooling tower. Additionally, the mixing condition of heated dry air and moist air under dry and wet combined operation is examined, and the condition is thought to affect the scale of the visible plume. It is found that, in the case of a mechanical-draft cooling tower, the fan has a mixing function which performs the complete mixing of wet and dry air, and this suggests that the generation of the plume can be determined by the intersection of the operation line and saturation line. Additionally, the effect of external wind on the scale of the visible plume is large, especially for dry and wet combined operation.

AB  - Biological production of plants is a complex variable, which integrates summer weather conditions. To assess summer climate variability over the last century, the concept of the meteorologically possible yield (MPY) can be used, which expresses the highest yield under existing meteorological conditions, not limited by soil quality (except its hydrological properties) or management. The MPY for early and late varieties of potato were computed with a potato-production model (POMOD) for three localities in Estonia for periods of 83-106 years. The computed yields were compared with cumulative meteorological factors and a set of the North Atlantic Oscillation indices. Significant polynomial relationships between the MPY and the cumulative meteorological elements appeared for all localities, whereas linear regression was significant only for the western coastal zone. The dual relationships, the continuously high variance around a polynomial relationship and the changes in the MPY series variability not expressible as single factors, indicate that MPY gives qualitatively new information about climatic variability in a synthesis of different factors. Correlations between the NAO index of some late autumn and winter months and MPY values were significant, albeit weak. The highest, negative correlations, expressing the effects of anticyclonic patterns, proceeded from the previous November. Positive correlations were identified for January only for a late variety of potato at an inland station.

AB  - Comparing spatio-temporal patterns between planktonic and benthic algae is helpful for understanding their associations and differences. However, such studies are still rare especially in large rivers. We used a dataset collected in the upper reach of the Jinsha River in different seasons to explore biodiversity and assembly processes of planktonic and benthic diatom assemblages. We found that planktonic and benthic diatoms presented different seasonal variation in species richness and community compositions. We also found evidence that planktonic and benthic diatoms were coupled in the summer. Planktonic diatom assemblages were mainly affected by spatial processes via directional spatial dispersal, especially in the summer. By comparison, benthic diatom assemblages were more affected by environmental processes. Our findings suggest that mass effect and species sorting paradigms explain the assembly processes of planktonic and benthic diatom assemblages, respectively, but the explanatory powers of these two paradigms vary seasonally. To effectively monitor and assess ecological conditions of large rivers, we recommend using benthic algae as a biotic indicator group as they had stronger correlations with environmental factors.

AB  - The eco-environmental problems caused by land desertification are becoming the main restricting factors in regional development. In this study, the engineering eco-environment patterns (EEPs) are proposed to evaluate the eco-geological environment fragility to desertification in arid and semiarid areas. A revised zoning method in the variable-weight theory (VWT) was used for EEPs and applied in the Dousitu River Basin (DBR). First, the EEP mechanism was elucidated, of which four types were divided. Second, ten key controlling indicators from climatology, geography, vegetation and social conditions were collected, of which the thematic maps were imported. Third, the weight and its interval of the indicator were determined, establishing the partial stimulation-punishment variable-weight zoning model. Finally, the evaluation result was obtained and mapped in four models or zones. Furthermore, the evaluation via the CWT method was also completed for comparison. Both results from VWT and CWT were validated with the ecological groundwater level (EGL) theory, which proved the accuracy of the VWT study. The method helps with the rational plan and design for the regional economic development and protection of eco-geological environment.

AB  - Colorimetric indicators produced from nanofibers have a high contact surface area, allowing better interaction of the indicator with the external environment. In this context, this study aimed to develop time-pH indicator nanofibers with natural pigments for use as an emerging technology in the control of food quality. The polymeric solutions were prepared with 13% (w v(-1)) polycaprolactone (PCL) and 6% (w v(-1)) poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO). The natural dyes added to the polymeric solution were curcumin and quercetin (2%, w v(-1)) with the addition of 0.5 or 1% (w v(-1)) of phycocyanin. Solutions with curcumin, quercetin, and phycocyanin only (2% w v(-1)) were also studied. The color change monitoring was performed for 24 h, followed up every 1 h, using buffer solutions (pH 2 to 7). The condition with 2% (w v(-1)) phycocyanin showed a color variation (Delta E >= 5) noticeable to the human eye in the pH range 3-6 in 5 h of analysis. Thus, the indicator developed with PCL/PEO nanofibers containing 2% (w v(-1)) of phycocyanin is a promising alternative in monitoring the quality of perishable foods, as it can visually estimate changes in pH over time.

AB  - Fish communities are important indicators of the health of riverine ecosystems. Fish monitoring for The Living Murray (TLM) initiative, one of Australia's most ambitious restoration undertakings for the degraded river-floodplain biota of the River Murray system (south-eastern Australia), was carried out annually from 2005 to 2011 across six 'Icon Sites', including the habitats and reaches therein. These spatial and temporal components of variation in fish community abundance and composition must be taken explicitly into account for consistent assessment of riverine ecosystem health. To address this requirement, a standardised analytical framework, consisting of a sampling design and appropriate statistical methods, is outlined in this study. Based on an extensive dataset, multivariate patterns and univariate trends in fish community structure were analysed to show the flexibility, modularity and ability of the framework. The applicability of the framework to Turkish riverine ecosystems is then discussed with emphasis on the need for participatory discussion between researchers and environmental managers. The possibility to incorporate other measures of fish health such as biomass and condition, and to extend the proposed framework to the quantitative assessment of vegetation and bird communities also exists.

AB  - Intensification of catchment land-use and the corresponding habitat degradation pose a threat to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem health, yet few studies comprehensively quantified the effects of specific land-use variables on fish communities for different catchments within the same climatic region. Herein, we investigated the influence of catchment land use on fish community composition in the headwater areas of the European main river systems Elbe, Danube and Main/Rhine. The analyses comprising 289 streams and rivers in Bavaria, southern Germany, revealed that the influence of urbanization (e.g. ground sealing), potamalisation (impoundment of water courses), and erosion-prone, agricultural land-use types (e.g. root crop, maize) were significantly related to the fish community composition. In addition, multiple stressors were effective indicators and their importance differed between survey-area scales, geographical regions, and stream sizes. The findings suggest that terrestrial effects of land-use and urbanization need to be more strongly considered in the conservation of endangered stream fishes, ideally including combined measures of erosion control, restoration of environmental flows and mitigation of structural degradation.

AB  - The soil quality of remediated land is altered and this land consequently exerts unexpected biological effects on terrestrial organisms. Therefore, field evaluation of such land should be conducted using biological indicators. Algae are a promising new biological indicator since they are a food source for organisms in higher soil trophic levels and easily sampled from the soil. Field evaluation of soil characteristics is preferred to be testing in laboratory conditions because many biological effects cannot be duplicated during laboratory evaluations. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid algae-soaked disc seeding assay for assessing soil quality in the field based on soil algae. The collection of algae is easy and rapid and the method predicts the short-term quality of contaminated, remediated, and amended farm and paddy soils. The algae-soaked disc seeding assay is yet to be extensively evaluated, and the method cannot be applied to loamy sand soil in in situ evaluations. The algae-soaked disc seeding assay is recommended for prediction of soil quality in in situ evaluations because it reflects all variations in the environment. The algae-soaked disc seeding assay will help to develop management strategies for in situ evaluation.

AB  - Earth as a constructional material - often combined with other naturally occurring or cultivated materials such as reed and straw, dried, compressed and employed in a variety ways - has been used since prehistoric times and is in continuing use across all inhabited continents. Widely available, affordable, recyclable and quintessentially sustainable, earth buildings have a proven track-record in diverse climates. Well suited for passive solar heating and cooling, and providing important benefits in indoor comfort conditions, their reduced energy consumption for constructional processes as well as in occupancy offers a wide range of environmental benefits, including significant reductions in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. There is a resurgence of interest in earth construction not simply as a heritage resource, whether archaeological sites, vernacular architecture or other, but as a material with an enhanced potential for use today. As such, it is the subject of extensive research both for the conservation of existing structures and realisation in new developments. This article traces the historic use and key typologies of earth construction, materials and conservation indicators, and provides examples of contemporary conservation practice and new construction.

AB  - The politics, economies, and ecology of the Arctic region are experiencing fundamental transformation driven largely by human-caused environmental change. Drawing on the work of Robert Cox, this article presents a critical account of environmental security that allows security issues in the Arctic to be reconceptualised. It outlines the environmental changes transforming the Arctic, and theorises the Arctic as a regional environmental security complex in which conditions of security for state and non-state referent objects are predicated on a particular ecological context. It then surveys state-and human security issues in the Arctic, and argues that environmental change has destabilised the ecological base on which the contemporary Arctic as a cooperative region supportive of human activity has been built. The article concludes by outlining alternative ways of conceiving of Arctic security that are more compatible with maintaining the region's ecological base, and suggests that dominant approaches to Arctic security are pathological because they remain premised on the control, extraction and consumption of hydrocarbon resources. It argues that, in the context of the geological Anthropocene, security cannot be sustainable if it fails to address the relationship between human wellbeing and human-caused environmental change, or informs practices that further contribute to environmental change.

AB  - Stream biomonitoring tools are largely lacking for many developing countries, resulting in adoption of tools developed from other countries/regions. In many instances, however, the applicability of adopted tools to the new system has not been explicitly evaluated. The objective of this study was to test the applicability of foreign diatom-based water quality assessment indices to streams in Zimbabwe, with the view to highlight challenges being faced in diatom-based biological monitoring in this developing country. The study evaluated the relationship between measured water quality variables and diatom index scores and observed some degree of concordance between water quality variables and diatom index scores emphasising the importance of diatom indices in characterisation and monitoring of stream ecological conditions in developing countries. However, ecological requirements of some diatom species need to be clarified and incorporated in a diatom-based water quality assessment protocol unique to these regions. Resources should be channelled towards tackling challenges associated with diatom-based biological monitoring, principally taxonomic studies, training of skilled labour and acquiring and maintaining the necessary infrastructure. Meanwhile, simpler coarse taxonomy-based rapid bioassessment protocol, which is less time and resource consuming and requires less specialised manpower, can be developed for the country.

AB  - Growth and survival of boreal tree species depends on fungal symbionts, namely mycorrhizas. Owing to their rapid turnover, fine roots and their symbionts can be prompt and sensitive indicators of the effects of environmental changes on forest ecosystems. We investigated how a reduction in soil moisture influences the fine roots and ectomycorrhizas (ECM) of black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] after 3 years of rain exclusion in four mature stands of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Rain was excluded with transparent plastic under-canopy covers installed during the growing seasons 2010-2012. Soil moisture was strongly affected by the treatment, with water content being reduced from 40% to 21% on average. As expected, the experimental trees showed a decrease in the proportion of vital root tips and ECM with respect to controls. The proportion of vital ECM was also globally reduced from 73.8% to 68.6%, but the effects of the treatment were only significant in two sites. The expected drier conditions due to current warming will likely influence the presence of mycorrhizas, with potential consequences on the root vitality of boreal tree species.

AB  - We examined the variation of stygofauna composition collected in wells, along a gradient in groundwater salinity/conductivity in a coastal aquifer from southern Portugal. The studied coastal aquifer is considered vulnerable to salinization due to seawater intrusion, caused by overexploitation of the aquifer. Knowing the response of the stygofauna species to present levels of groundwater salinity makes it possible to understand and measure the effects of saltwater intrusion on stygofauna, rendering them potential bioindicators of this environmental pressure. Biotic and abiotic sampling was conducted in six shallow wells located in the fresh-saltwater interface of the Arade estuary along the salinity gradient established in the groundwater from the estuary to inland locations (microSiemens/cm). Groundwater salinity was highly correlated with taxa distribution. The stygobites Eucyclops hadjebensis and Acanthocyclops sensitivus, the cosmopolitan Megacyclops viridis and Cypria ophtalmica were particularly associated with low-salinity conditions, whereas Eucyclops graeteri, Megacyclops brachypus and Daphnia pulicaria were related to high-salinity waters. Multivariate analyses indicated that stygofauna assemblages varied significantly with location. We suggest that stygofauna composition and structure can be a useful complementing tool for monitoring seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers, where reduction or deterioration in groundwater resources is predicted.

AB  - The environmental sciences can be constituted based on some branches of natural science, social science and applied science. Solving environmental problems requires integration of expertise in some academic disciplines. This challenge stems from the essence of environmental sciences because these fields have an interdisciplinary nature. The most academic disciplines have specialized research methodology, but environmental sciences need some research methodologies. The aim of this paper is to present qualitative research methodology for solving environmental problems and respond to expected questions through gathering and inferring from the results of various qualitative studies. In this paper, various qualitative research approaches used in the studies are discussed. Using qualitative research is inevitable under some conditions. Based on presented cases, the capability of qualitative research in environmental areas is explained. Qualitative research can respond to many questions in environmental investigations and professional reports. Qualitative research approaches may be used to respond to the questions arisen in preparation of professional reports such as Environmental Impact Statements, Strategic Environmental Assessment reports and Protected Area Management Plan. This research methodology has the advantage that it can be performed with minimum planning and equipment whereas some quantitative and experimental methods in environmental studies are time-consuming, complex and actually impractical in certain cases.

AB  - It is important to select suitable organisms to adapt the requirement of different environment monitoring purposes. Following our previous study, the behavioral responses of Daphnia magna and Japanese madaka (Oryzias latipes) were investigated and compared under flow-through conditions in an on-line biomonitoring system. The results showed that both D. magna and Japanese madaka had similar biological clock, but the circadian rhythms of Japanese madaka was more clearly recorded than that of D. magna. And the sensitivity of D. magna was about two orders of magnitudes higher than that of Japanese madaka in different types of toxic chemicals (dichlorovos, deltamethrin and cadmium chloride). However, when both animals were used in an on-line biomonitoring system, the life span of D. magna was less than 7 days and Japanese madaka could last for more than one month without feeding. Therefore, D. magna was proposed to be a more sensitive bioindicator and was suitable for short term monitoring the pollution events at concentration level closing to the water quality standard, while Japanese madaka was more suitable for the long-term monitoring for accidental discharges.

AB  - Natural environments are characterized by unpredictability over all time scales. This stochasticity is expected on theoretical grounds to result in the evolution of 'bet-hedging' traits that maximize the long term, or geometric mean fitness even though such traits do not maximize fitness over shorter time scales. The geometric mean principle is thus central to our interpretation of optimality and adaptation; however, quantitative empirical support for bet hedging is lacking. Here, I report a quantitative test using the timing of seed germination-a model diversification bet-hedging trait-in Lobelia inflata under field conditions. In a phenotypic manipulation study, I find the magnitude of fluctuating selection acting on seed germination timing-across 70 intervals throughout five seasons-to be extreme: fitness functions for survival are complex and multimodal within seasons and significantly dissimilar among seasons. I confirm that the observed magnitude of fluctuating selection is sufficient to account for the degree of diversification behaviour characteristic of individuals of this species. The geometric mean principle has been known to economic theory for over two centuries; this study now provides a quantitative test of optimality of a bet-hedging trait in nature.

AB  - The Colombian government has defined the use of bioethanol as a gasoline enhancer to reduce greenhouse gases, gasoline imports, and to boost the rural economy. To meet the projected fuel ethanol demand needed to oxygenate the gasoline in the whole country, the construction of about five additional ethanol production plants is required. For this, a comparative analysis of the technological options using different feedstocks should be performed. In this work, a comparison of the economical and environmental performance of the ethanol production process from sugarcane and corn under Colombian conditions has been carried out. Net present value and total output rate of potential environmental impact were used as the economical and environmental indicators, respectively. Through the integration of these indicators into one index by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach, sugarcane ethanol process was determined as the best choice for Colombian ethanol production facilities. AHP scores obtained in this study for sugarcane and corn ethanol were 0.571 and 0.429, respectively. However, starchy crops like corn, cassava or potatoes used as feedstock for ethanol production could potentially cause a higher impact on the rural communities and boost their economies if social matters are considered.

AB  - Human-induced and natural stress factors can affect fine roots and ectomycorrhizas. Therefore they have potential utility as indicators of environmental change. We evaluated, through meta-analysis, the magnitude of the effects of acidic deposition, nitrogen deposition, increased ozone levels, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, and drought on fine roots and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) characteristics. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was an unsuitable parameter for environmental change, but fine root length and biomass could be useful. Acidic deposition had a significantly negative impact on fine roots, root length being more sensitive than root biomass. There were no significant effects of nitrogen deposition or elevated tropospheric ozone on the quantitative root parameters. Elevated CO2 had a significant positive effect. Drought had a significantly negative effect on fine root biomass. The negative effect of acidic deposition and the positive effect of elevated CO2 increased over time, indicating that effects were persistent contrary the other factors. The meta-analysis also showed that experimental conditions, including both laboratory and field experiments, were a major source of variation. In addition to quantitative changes, environmental changes affect the species composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community.

AB  - Organisms in natural habitats must frequently respond to changes in their environments through various physiological mechanisms. My laboratory has developed several methods for the quantification of stress in crustaceans. An ELISA was developed for the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) from the American lobster (Homarus americanus). It is sensitive to as little as 0.2 fmol of peptide. Increases in hemolymph CHH were observed under conditions of acute hypoxia, elevated temperature, and altered salinity. In addition, elevated CHH concentrations were observed in Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) that were parasitized with the dinoflagellate Hematodinium sp.
   Stress proteins, also known as heat-shock proteins (HSPs), comprise a highly conserved class of proteins that display elevated transcription during periods of stress. Using homologous molecular probes, my collaborators and I have examined the influence of heat-shock, osmotic stress, and the molt cycle upon HSP expression at the protein and mRNA levels. We observed a significant elevation in HSP mRNA expression after 1 hr of heat-shock or after 0.5 hr of osmotic stress. When comparing claw and abdominal muscles during molting, we observed a tissue-specific HSP response. Quantification of these different stress responses may serve as early indicators of the degradation of environmental health.

AB  - Background, Aim and Scope. Most of the cathment areas supplying water and mineral matter to the Adriatic bays with healing mud/peloids are affected by various degrees of human impact, i.e. activity that is introducing various types of contaminants to environment. The bays represent shallow marine depositional environments where organic-rich sediments accumulate. Investigations for balneblogical characterization of several localities along the Croatian coast have shown that these organic-rich sediments may be classified as healing mud, i.e. peloids. Healing mud due to its balneologic features is used in treatment of various diseases and in improvement of the overall health conditions and general well-being. Various components of mud, particularly trace elements, could be absorbed through dermal contact. Therefore, the study of the abundance of such potentially toxic elements as As, Pb, Hg, Cd, Se, Sb, Cu, Zn in marine sediments used as healing mud is necessary in order to know their mobility and to avoid possible intoxications.
   Methodology. In order to assess the most recent record of lithogenic and anthropogenic inputs to the Morinje Bay and Makirina Bay sediments (peloids) on the central Dalmatian coast, concentrations of both lithogenic and potentially toxic element (Cu, Pb, Zn and Mo) concentrations were analysed cores and surface sediments, as well as watershed topsoil. For characterizing the probable anthropogenic effects, the inputs of heavy metals was evaluated by calculation of enrichment factors (EF) for these elements, using Sc as the conservative element. Mobility of metals was assessed by application of the first step (0.11 mol dm(-3) CH3COOH) of the harmonized BCR three-step sequential extraction procedure.
   Results. Analysis of ten composite topsoil samples from the vineyards (5 sampling sites) and uncultivated slopes (5 sampling sites) were used to determine concentrations of metals in soils from the watershed. The Cu concentrations in the vineyard soils ranged from 105 to 553 mg/kg. Analyses of soils with visible traces of the Bordeaux mixture showed that Ph (Pb/Sc 5.6) and Zn (Zn/Sc 21.5) were also being added to the soil. The amount of Cu bound to the carbonate phase of composite vineyard soil was 53.6 mg/kg or 22% of total Cu, while soil containing the Bordeaux mixture contained 2,827 mg/kg of extractable Cu (70% of total Cu), thus indicating that copper is probably supplied to the bay not only with eroded soil but also in runoff solution. Morinje Bay sediments have a higher mean Cu concentration (71.4 mg/kg) than the surrounding soils on limestone (which are not arable) and lower than the soils developed on flysch bedrock (arable soils). In the sediment cores from Morinje Bay, Mo increased (from 4.5 to 43 mg/kg) with increasing depth. The Cu EF in the surface sediments of Makirina Bay fluctuates around 2.5 in the offshore direction and drops to below 2 in the most distant profile.
   Discussion. The calculated enrichment factors or Cu and Ph in sediments of the two bays show that lead is accumulating in the smaller Makirina Bay as a consequence of road runoff which drained into the bay. Copper, on the other hand, is the major indicator of anthropogenic load in the larger Morinje Bay watershed with extensive vineyard activity. Comparisons of total concentrations of the Zn, ph, and Cu in sediments from both bays shows that they are below PEL for these elements. However, the high accumulation rate of sediment with bioavailable Cu could reach levels in Morinje Bay which could cause toxic effects. High amounts of extractable Cu (11-13%) are present in the top 20 cm of the sediment core, which corresponds to the highest Cu enrichment factors (from 2.3 to 4.3). The sediment from the deeper part of the core (75-80 cm) contains only 2.8% of extractable Cu. The anomalous accumulation of Mo in deeper parts of the cores is probably a result of a natural process caused by resolubilization of Mo under aerobic conditions, i.e. upon air-drying of the sediments due to tidal conditions in Morinje Bay.

AB  - Decision-making is a major problem in industry. Therefore this research is focused on the decision-making framework development with Lean and Green Manufacturing tools and End-of-Life scenario consideration. A specific mechanism was developed for used industrial equipment life cycle extension in order to save money, nature, and society.
   The proposed framework makes business more profitable by including an innovative approach of using complex TRIZ to make it more universal and easy to use for the largest variation of used industrial products. To achieve this aim the Green Matrix was elaborated on the basis of the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix and Green Engineering principles. Much attention was paid to the remanufacturing process in the decision-making framework to assess the moment condition of equipment. An integrated method for evaluating the remanufacturability of the used industrial equipment is proposed, in which the technological, economic and environmental assessment of spent industrial products is analyzed in terms of remanufacturing. Development of an approach for used industrial product assessment improves company inventory controllability and utilization that in turn minimizes environmental impact and resource consumption during the entire product cycle.

AB  - How might contact with nature promote human health? Myriad studies have linked the two; at this time the task of identifying the mechanisms underlying this link is paramount. This article offers: (1) a compilation of plausible pathways between nature and health; (2) criteria for identifying a possible central pathway; and (3) one promising candidate for a central pathway. The 21 pathways identified here include environmental factors, physiological and psychological states, and behaviors or conditions, each of which has been empirically tied to nature and has implications for specific physical and mental health outcomes. While each is likely to contribute to nature's impacts on health to some degree and under some circumstances, this paper explores the possibility of a central pathway by proposing criteria for identifying such a pathway and illustrating their use. A particular pathway is more likely to be central if it can account for the size of nature's impacts on health, account for nature's specific health outcomes, and subsume other pathways. By these criteria, enhanced immune functioning emerges as one promising candidate for a central pathway between nature and health. There may be others.

AB  - Mining causes significant damage to the environment: the removal of top layers of soil causes loss of structure and functionality, with a subsequent reduction in biodiversity. Soil communities are important for soil formation, they contribute to the improvement of several characteristics of soils and they play key roles in many processes that enhance the success of restoration. Unfortunately, soil fauna are poorly monitored even though they represent a good tool for assessing soil quality. The "La Speranza" quarry in northern Italy was studied from the start of the restoration process in 2008 until 2012. Sixsites were selected and monitored annually. Microarthropods were extracted from three replicates of soil drawn from each site, identified to order level and then counted. Both the abundances of taxa and the soil biological indices applied (Shannon diversity index (H'), Pielou's evenness index (J), the Acari to Collembola ratio (A/C) and the QBS-ar index) revealed a good level of soil recovery over the years studied. Furthermore, the edaphic organisms that are generally associated with stable conditions in the soil (e.g. Symphyla, Protura, Chilopoda), appeared in the most recent of the years.

AB  - Past natural and future anthropogenic drought variability has and will impact terrestrial ecosystems, agricultural productivity, socio-economic conditions, and public health on various time-scales. In comparison to reconstructed and projected temperature change, much less is known about variations in the hydrological cycle Here we present 953 living and historical oak (Quercus sp) ring width samples from Central Germany (51-52 degrees N and 9-10 degrees E), that span the AD 996-2005 period and explain similar to 18-70% of inter-annual to decadal scale June-September drought variance at the regional-scale. Driest and wettest summers common to the tree-ring proxy and instrumental target data are 1934, 1959, 1996 and 1958, 1966, 1967, respectively. Spatial field correlations are positive with gridded summer hydro-climate over western-central Europe Increased mid-tropospheric geopotennal height (Z500) anomalies over the British Isles appear associated with increased Central German drought, whereas negative Z500 anomalies over Western Europe trigger wet summer extremes due to anomalous moist air advection from the west. Although our study revealed estimates of inter-annual to decadal drought dynamics at the synoptic scale, lower frequency trends remain insecure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Benthic organic enrichment due to sedimentation of waste feed and fecal matter released from salmon and other marine finfish aquaculture facilities has traditionally been measured by observing changes in benthic macrofauna assemblages. Sediment oxygen consumption, dissolved nutrient fluxes and variables such as redox potentials (normalized to hydrogen potential, Eh(NHE)) and dissolved 'free' sulfides (Sigma S2-, HS-, H2S) (S) are also sensitive chemical indicators of benthic enrichment effects. Hypoxic or anoxic sediments are formed when high rates of organic matter (OM) sedimentation stimulate anaerobic metabolic processes such as sulfate reduction. General changes in Eh(NHE), S, OM flux and indices of macrofauna diversity in sediments as a result of increased organic enrichment around salmon aquaculture sites have been described in numerous studies. Some of the results are summarized here in empirical regressions that relate changes in sediment chemical and benthic biological variables to increased OM supply. The equations are descriptive of the data for salmon aquaculture sites where the studies were performed and further investigations are required to determine if the relationships provide general quantitative expressions for changes in sediment geochemical conditions and macrofauna community structure due to benthic organic enrichment.

AB  - The relationships between the presence of endogeic and epigeic collembolan species and chemical and microbiological top soil parameters were examined for eight sugar maple forests. While the composition of the tree strata was similar among sites, the soil conditions varied widely and encompassed three regions of different geological origins as well as contrasting humus types. Endogeic species were extracted using Berlese-Tullgren equipment, whereas epigeic species were collected with pit-light traps (Luminoc(R)). Ln all, 92 species from 14 families and 36 genera were identified. The association between sampling locations and soil parameters was determined by principal component analysis (PCA), and the relationships between epigeic and endogeic collembolan communities and soil parameters were determined by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA and DCCA). The DCCA revealed that the distribution of endogeic species of the collembolan fauna was related to organic matter content, including pH, C, N, and C/N ratio. Sites were clustered according to humus types. Epigeic species were influenced by available P and exchangeable K and Mg. Sites were clustered according to geographical distribution, suggesting that for epigeic species, regional occurrence could be a stronger determinant of community composition than soil parameters.

AB  - High ozone (O-3) levels have been recorded in eastern Spain. A project was developed to identify the areas of elevated O-3 and determine if these levels were above critical concentrations for plant damage. Thus, a network of bioindicators was established in two Autonomous Communities of Spain: Catalunya (31.930 km(2)) and Valencia (23.305 km(2)) to assess O-3 phytotoxicity. Three tobacco cultivars, (Bel-W3, Bel-C and Bel-B) were used during the 1994 growing season in both Regions. In Catalunya the highest O-3 phytotoxicity was recorded in coastal areas, while the phytotoxicity decreased as plants were grown further in-land. A lower O-3 phytotoxicity was observed in coastal sites of the Valencia Autonomous Community, compared to Catalunya, although the O-3 injury was observed downwind from Valencia city in the most resistant cultivar Bel-B. The results in the Valencian Community were difficult to interpret, since plant viruses were widely distributed, not only in indicator plants, but also in commercial crops grown in the area. The analysis of O-3 concentrations, meteorological parameters and visible injury at the Catalan sites showed that high relative humidity levels could favour O-3 phytotoxicity. Therefore, the interactions between O-3 exposure and environmental conditions on plant response should be further studied for the establishment of sound critical levels.

AB  - An extensive literature mainly in connection with the age peculiarities of clinical aspects and the related diagnostic challenges is dedicated to psychogenic disorders in children. According to it the assessment of the social context impact on child development is very challenging. In unfavorable family conditions a refusal to satisfy child's basic psychological needs easily appears. These are the situations when we speak about the phenomenon of deprivation in the family system. Mental deprivation of children rigidly depends on indicators of psychological health of the family. In our study the deprivation conditions in the overall context of family's psychological health played a specific and important role in the development of mental dysontogenesis in children and determined the nature of their social and psychological adaptation.
   Multi-professional analysis of the results allowed us identifying three of the most common options of school disadaptation in children with dysontogenesis of psychogenic origin.
   The first option was distinguished by the dominance of behavioral disorders, in the second option emotional disorders prevailed; and the third meets the definition of a mosaic option, including the decrease in cognitive efficiency, and emotional and behavioural disorders.
   Although the diversity of psychopathological manifestations was sufficiently obvious, in all cases we observed the total, axial syndrome. It was psychogenic asthenia, which pathogenetic mechanisms were associated with the weakening of protective and adaptive functions. The discrepancy between a normal level of intellectual potential and reduced productivity was especially noticeable. In the complex combination of mental processes the asthenic syndrome manifested in some cases as an independent, leading type of dysontogenesis. In others, it evolved in the context of independent, but secondary psychopathological disorders. This combination of dysontogenesis deprivation registers resulted in a different allocation types: asthenic hyperdynamic, asthenic hypodynamic and mixed.
   Motor and emotional conative disorders with the leading excitable radical determined the psychogenic dysontogenesis structure of asthenic hyperdynamic children. In cases of asthenic hypodynamic type of dysontogenesis the dominating factors were signs of low activity, increased mental and physical exhaustion, affective lability with a tendency to a low mood. The third, mixed type was the most anomalous. Disontogenetic symptoms were noted in early childhood. Moreover, prominent features of residual organic pathology were diagnosed.
   The stages of deprivation syndrome development can be represented as follows. First, the initial symptoms of mental dysontogenesis coincide with somatic vegetative level of neuropsychic response. Psychogenic influences of the environment structure first symptoms of dysontogenesis in the form of neuropathy. The critical period of 3-4 years plays an important role in the early period. Second, there are latent physiological changes. They are caused by physiological stress that accompanies the process of adaptation. Signs of psychogenic asthenia appear. In the same period a gradual structuring of the three deprivation types begins. During the third phase the dysontogenetic imbalance increases and a complex of non-adaptive problems appears. At this stage, mental problems and psychological maladjustment aggravated.

AB  - Quantitative estimates of time-averaging in marine shell accumulations available to date are limited primarily to aragonitic mollusk shells. We assessed time-averaging in Holocene assemblages of calcitic brachiopod shells by direct dating of individual specimens of the terebratulid brachiopod Bouchardia rosea. The data were collected from exceptional (brachiopod-rich) shell assemblages, occurring surficially on a tropical mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shelf (the Southeast Brazilian Bight, SW Atlantic), a setting that provides a good climatic and environmental analog for many Paleozoic brachiopod shell beds of North America and Europe. A total of 82 individual brachiopod shells, collected from four shallow (5-25 m) nearshore (<2.5 km from the shore) localities, were dated by using amino acid racemization (D-alloisoleucine/L-isoleucine value) calibrated with five AMS-radiocarbon dates (r(2) = 0.933). This is the first study to demonstrate that amino acid racemization methods can provide accurate and precise ages for individual shells of calcitic brachiopods.
   The dated shells vary in age from modern to 3000 years, with a standard deviation of 690 years. The age distribution is strongly right-skewed: the young shells dominate the dated specimens and older shells are increasingly less common. However, the four localities display significant differences in the range of time-averaging and the form of the age distribution. The dated shells vary notably in the quality of preservation, but there is no significant correlation between taphonomic condition and age, either for individual shells or at assemblage level.
   These results demonstrate that fossil brachiopods may show considerable time-averaging, but the scale and nature of that mixing may vary greatly among sites. Moreover, taphonomic condition is not a reliable indicator of pre-burial history of individual brachiopod shells or the scale of temporal mixing within the entire assemblage. The results obtained for brachiopods are strikingly similar to results previously documented for mollusks and suggest that differences in mineralogy and shell microstructure are unlikely to be the primary factors controlling the nature and scale of time-averaging. Environmental factors and local fluctuations in populations of shell-producing organisms are more likely to be the principal determinants of time-averaging in marine benthic shelly assemblages. The long-term survival of brachiopod shells is incongruent with the rapid shell destruction observed in taphonomic experiments. The results support the taphonomic model that shells remain protected below (but perhaps near) the surface through their early taphonomic history. They may be brought back up to the surface intermittently by bioturbation and physical reworking, but only for short periods of time. This model explains the striking similarities in time-averaging among different types of organisms and the lack of correlation between time-since-death and shell taphonomy.

AB  - Many civil, mining and transportation structures located in rocks are subjected to repeated loading and unloading cycles. Each cycle of load causes fatigue damage which accumulates with increasing cycles. In the present study, damage evolution of two natural rocks namely Garhwal gneiss and Shivpuri sandstone from India has been studied through laboratory tests. The Garhwal gneiss specimens were studied under uniaxial cyclic loading by adopting incremental loading scheme. Load was applied through load control mode and four different loading rates were employed. The Shivpuri sandstone was tested under low confining pressure conditions adopting the similar incremental loading scheme but under displacement-controlled environment. Damage evolution of these rocks was discussed in the form of modulus, irreversible strain, and dissipated energy. Applicability of inverted S-curve model to represent the damage evolution was evaluated. It is observed that irreversible strain and dissipated energy modelled the fatigue damage evolution in better way as compared to modulus. It was also observed that for tests conducted under load-controlled environment, the irreversible strain evolution was more systematic whereas for tests performed under displacement-controlled environment dissipated energy was a better indicator of fatigue damage evolution.

AB  - While coastal reclamation creates huge benefits by providing a variety of resources for socio-economic development, the environmental impact of human activities should be appropriately evaluated. Since 2009, a large-scale tidal flats reclamation project was conducted. The project was suspended and no more reclamation was conducted after 2017. An integral assessment method has been desperately in need to comprehensively understand the environmental impact of such project which has been partly completed. A comparison was made between the states before and after the implementation of the reclamation project in Jiangsu coast. Results show that generally the large-scale reclamation had limited influence on the tidal system and coastal evolution, but inevitably changed the local hydrodynamic conditions in the vicinity of most project sites. Ecology resource suffered most pressure. Environmental pollution was also a critical indicator. An integrated framework was proposed based on the conceptual model of "Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response" to assess the environment impact of large-scale reclamation in Jiangsu tidal flats. However, large numbers of relevant data need to be collected on the way forward. Nevertheless, this assessment model will promote the long-term harmonious development of economic development and ecosystem health.

AB  - The change in the use of agricultural and forestry land for other purposes is the natural process of rural areas urbanisation. In the municipalities located nearby large cities, this transformation is inevitable and indeed desirable, while in the municipalities located close to the protected areas, it is a symptom of negative processes, especially from an environmental perspective. Moreover, such transformations have many other economic and social consequences which are worth paying special attention to. This paper is an attempt to determine the level of negative changes introduced in the planning documents in municipalities located within the borders of National Parks. The indicator analysis based on the statistical data of local date bank [BDL] in the fields of local government and spatial planning was conducted. The analysis enabled to present the differences between municipalities with very high natural values in terms of decreasing the area of agricultural and forestry landscape. Furthermore, to elaborate the typology of the studied administrative units the obtained results were verified by comparing them with recommended percentage share of forest and agricultural lands which potentially guarantee good conditions for the development of tourism in rural municipalities.

AB  - Benthic communities are important to any aquatic ecosystem and form important food source for most organisms especially fish. The study about macro benthos was carried out in a canal of south-eastern coast of Bangladesh with some physico-chemical parameters of water and soil during post and pre-monsoon seasons. The canal originates from hilly areas and opens into the Bay of Bengal. Polychaetes were the most abundant group followed by Oligocheates Bivalves crabs during post-monsoon. Oligocheates were the most abundant group followed by Polychaetes, Bivalves during pre-monsoon. Salinity showed positive significant relationship with the Polycheates and as well as Phosphate-Phosphorus. A negative significant relationship was found between Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Oligocheates abundance in the investigated canal and a positive relationship was found between Total Suspended Solids and Oligocheates abundance. There was no relationship among the parameters of water as well as soil and crab abundance. The abundance of macro benthos is useful indicators of the condition of the canal and of the canal habitat as a whole. The effect of anthropogenic induced stressors had resulted in an unstable physically controlled environment characterized by a low density of macrobenthos.

AB  - Micro-organisms often face multiple stresses in natural habitats. Individual stresses are well known to influence mutation rates and the spectra of mutational types, but the extent to which multiple stresses affect the genetic variation in populations is unknown. Here we investigate pair-wise combinations of nutritional stresses in Escherichia coli to determine their effect on mutation rates and mutational types. Environmental interactions modified both the rate and spectrum of mutations in double-limited environments, but the effects were not additive or synergistic relative to single stresses. Generally, bacteria in the mixed environments behaved as if one of the two single-stress stimuli was more dominant and the genetic variation seen with every dual limitation was intermediate between known patterns with individual stresses. The composition of mutational types with double stresses was also intermediate between individual stress patterns. At least with mutations, the single stressor results available are reasonable indicators of stress-induced genetic variation in multifaceted natural habitats. With the influence of 11 conditions available on mutational patterns, we can now also see the clustering of mutational types as a function of these environments.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, such as conversion of forests to pastures, are considered one of the major causes of Amazonian biodiversity loss. Pastures are hostile environments for forest species that are not adapted to the adverse conditions of open areas. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of forest replacement by cattle pastures in the north-eastern part of the Amazonian rainforest using dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) as indicators. Therefore, we determined edge effects and differences in dung beetle species richness, composition, and abundance between forest and neighbouring cattle pastures. A total of 6723 individuals of 63 species of dung beetle were collected. In comparison to forests, adjacent pastures were sharply less rich and abundant in dung beetles. The forests had 6604 individuals and 59 species, while the pastures had 119 individuals and 12 species. The replacement of forests by pastures results in an increase of dung beetle species turnover. Only 12% of dung beetle species were shared by both forest and pasture environments. We highlight that most Amazonian dung beetles are forest species sensitive to abrupt human-driven modification of habitats and are only moderately affected by edge effects.

AB  - Recently, a number of Antarctic marine environmental studies have used oceanographic parameters collected from instrumented top predators for ecological and physical information. Phytoplankton concentration is generally quantified through active measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence. In this study, light absorption coefficient (K-0.75) was used as an indicator of phytoplankton concentration. This measurement, easy to obtain and requiring low electric power, allows for assessing of the fine scale horizontal structuring of phytoplankton. As part of this study, Southern elephant seals (SES) were simultaneously equipped with a fluorometer and a light logger. Along the SES tracks, variations in K-0.75 were strongly correlated with chlorophyll, a concentration measured by the fluorometer within the euphotic layer. With regards to SES foraging behaviour, bottom depth of the seal's dive was highly dependent on light intensity at 150 m, indicating that the vertical distribution of SES's prey such as myctophids is tightly related to light level. Therefore, change in phytoplankton concentration may not only have a direct effect on SES's prey abundance but may also determine their vertical accessibility with likely consequences on SES foraging efficiency.

AB  - A considerable number of cells expressing typical immature neuronal markers including doublecortin (DCX+) are present around layer II in the cerebral cortex of young and adult guinea pigs and other larger mammals, and their origin and biological implication await further characterization. We show here in young adult guinea pigs that these DOC+ cells are accompanied by in situ cell division around the superficial cortical layers mostly in layer but they co-express proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and an early neuronal fate determining factor, PAX6. A small number of these DOC+ cells also colocalize with BrdU following administration of this mitotic indicator. Cranial X-ray irradiation causes a decline of DCX+ cells around layer II, and novel environmental exploration induces c-Fos expression among these cells in several neocortical areas. Together, these data are compatible with a notion that DCX+ cortical neurons around layer II might derive from proliferable neuronal precursors around layer I in young adult guinea pig cerebrum, and that these cells might be modulated by experience under physiological conditions.

KW  - ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT
AB  - The changes in waste management policy caused by the massive generation of waste materials (e.g. construction and demolition waste material, municipal waste incineration products) has led to an increase in the reuse and recycling of waste materials. For environmental risk assessment, test procedures are necessary to examine waste materials before they can be reused. In this article, results of column and lysimeter leaching tests having been applied to inorganic compounds in a reference demolition waste material are presented.
   The results show a good agreement between the leaching behaviour determined with the lysimeter unit and the column units used in the laboratory. In view of less time and system requirements compared to lysimeter systems, laboratory column units can be considered as a practicable instrument to assess the time-dependent release of inorganic compounds under conditions similar to those encountered in a natural environment. The high concentrations of elements in the seepage water at the initial stage of elution are reflected by the laboratory column leaching tests. In particular, authorities or laboratories might benefit and have an easy-to-use, but nevertheless reliable, method to serve as a basis for decision-making. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sewage disposal in aquatic environments can have significant impacts on assemblages of organisms. There have been few field investigations on effects of sewage disposal on fish larvae. Data on abundances of larvae, current velocities and the size and shape of sewage plumes from point-source shoreline outfalls off Sydney (Australia) indicated that alongshore currents could transport large numbers of fish larvae into plumes, potentially affecting their health. Assemblages of fish larvae in surface sewage plumes differed to those in distant shelf (control) waters, but no such impacts were detected for assemblages in subsurface (20 m depth) waters beneath plumes. No predictable negative or positive numerical responses of fish larvae to sewage disposal were detected. Abundances of fish larvae fluctuated greatly in space and throughout time, and responses appeared to vary between taxa, outfalls and sampling periods. However, the large inherent level of natural spatial and temporal variability in abundances of larvae confounded the detection of possible impacts. Future field investigations need to focus on effects of sewage disposal on the health and condition of fish larvae. Designs for future field-based studies are discussed.

AB  - Zooplankton assemblages of 19 New England lakes were evaluated in relation to lake trophic state, riparian land use, fish assemblage features, and physicochemical factors for potential food web indicators of lake ecosystem condition or health. Principal component analysis (PCA) of species abundance data contrasted productive warmwater lakes dominated by rotifers, small cladocerans, and cyclopoid copepods and nauplii with cold-water salmonid systems dominated by calanoid copepods and large cladocerans, and with few rotifers. The use of 12 aggregate zooplankton assemblage variables based on taxonomic group, body size, life-history stage, and feeding guilds improved the amount of the explained cumulative variance (63.2%) over species data (40.3%) in the first two axes of the ordination. In a second PCA the environmental variables were constrained with respect to the zooplankton variables. This analysis identified total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, cold-water fish assemblages, number of introduced fish species, piscivore numbers, and the percentage of disturbed shoreline as dominant gradients. Small-bodied assemblages represented by small cladocerans, rotifers, ostracods, nauplii, and cyclopoid copepodites were associated with the most disturbed systems. The pattern of distribution among large- and small-bodied taxa from the PCA was used to formulate metrics which were then correlated to the gradients.

AB  - The number, size and severity of aquatic low-oxygen dead zones are increasing worldwide. Microbial processes in low-oxygen environments have important ecosystem-level consequences, such as denitrification, greenhouse gas production and acidification. To identify key microbial processes occurring in low-oxygen bottom waters of the Chesapeake Bay, we sequenced both 16S rRNA genes and shotgun metagenomic libraries to determine the identity, functional potential and spatiotemporal distribution of microbial populations in the water column. Unsupervised clustering algorithms grouped samples into three clusters using water chemistry or microbial communities, with extensive overlap of cluster composition between methods. Clusters were strongly differentiated by temperature, salinity and oxygen. Sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms were found to be enriched in the low-oxygen bottom water and predictive of hypoxic conditions. Metagenome-assembled genomes demonstrate that some of these sulfur-oxidizing populations are capable of partial denitrification and transcriptionally active in a prior study. These results suggest that microorganisms capable of oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds are a previously unidentified microbial indicator of low oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay and reveal ties between the sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen cycles that could be important to capture when predicting the ecosystem response to remediation efforts or climate change.

AB  - Some of the longest and most comprehensive marine ecosystem monitoring programs were established in the Gulf of Alaska following the environmental disaster of the Exxon Valdez oil spill over 30 years ago. These monitoring programs have been successful in assessing recovery from oil spill impacts, and their continuation decades later has now provided an unparalleled assessment of ecosystem responses to another newly emerging global threat, marine heatwaves. The 2014-2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) in the Gulf of Alaska was the longest lasting heatwave globally over the past decade, with some cooling, but also continued warm conditions through 2019. Our analysis of 187 time series from primary production to commercial fisheries and nearshore intertidal to offshore oceanic domains demonstrate abrupt changes across trophic levels, with many responses persisting up to at least 5 years after the onset of the heatwave. Furthermore, our suite of metrics showed novel community-level groupings relative to at least a decade prior to the heatwave. Given anticipated increases in marine heatwaves under current climate projections, it remains uncertain when or if the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH state.

AB  - In order to estimate the global air pollution of the Moroccan Atlantic coast Safi-Essaouira, we have used a qualitative approach based on the spatial distribution of saxicolous-calcicolous lichens that reflect special ecological and pollution conditions. The measurement of the beta diversity by the calculation of the Jaccard index makes it possible to quantify the similarity between the studied sites and has made it possible to measure the gradient of change of this diversity along an increasing gradient of the pollution supposed high in the industrial zone of the Safi city and decreasing going north or south. The hierarchical clustering has made it possible to partition the seven studied sites into two different classes and differentiate four groups of indicator species of poleotolerance and eutrophication. The identification of 36 species of lichens including indicator species of SO2 and NOx pollutions, the study of the impact of climate and pollution on the lichens biological spectrum, and the exploitation of the poleotolerance index and eutrophication index were necessary to elucidate the global air quality of the region.

AB  - A spectrophotometric method based on diazotization of aniline with triclosan has been developed for the determination of triclosan in water samples. The diazotization process involves two steps: (1) reaction of aniline with sodium nitrite in an acidic medium to form diazonium ion and (2) reaction of diazonium ion with triclosan to form a yellowish-orange azo compound in an alkaline medium. The resulting yellowish-orange product has a maximum absorption at 352 nm which allows the determination of triclosan in aqueous solution in the linear concentration range of 0.1-3.0 mu M with R-2 = 0.998. The concentration of hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and aniline was optimized for diazotization reaction to achieve good spectrophotometric determination of triclosan. The optimization of experimental conditions for spectrophotometric determination of triclosan in terms of concentration of sodium nitrite, hydrogen chloride and aniline was also carried out by using Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology and results obtained were in agreement with the experimentally optimized values. The proposed method was then successfully applied for analyses of triclosan content in water samples.

AB  - During the past century, the number and scale of reservoirs worldwide has grown substantially to meet the demand for water and hydropower arising from increased population, industrialization, and urbanization. This is particularly the case in China, where reservoir construction increased rapidly after the Chinese economic reform and the introduction of open-door policies. On average, 4.4 large reservoirs with a capacity greater than 0.1 km(3) were constructed per annum during the 1970s-1990s. This average reached 11.8 such reservoirs per annum in the 2000s. Considering the adverse impact of dams on rivers and riparian communities, various environmentalists and non-governmental organizations in China have begun to protest against the construction of dams. Now China's policy on dams is at a crossroads: Removal or further construction? In this paper, we systematically assess the construction of reservoirs in China and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of large-scale reservoir projects on several major rivers in China: The Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Mekong River. Lastly, we provide a perspective on the future of reservoir development in China, taking into account natural conditions, renewable hydropower resources, and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Climate changes on the Mongolian Plateau are creating new challenges for the households and communities of the region. Much of the existing research on household choices in response to climate variability and change focuses on environmental risks and stresses. In contrast, our analysis highlights the importance of taking into account environmental and economic opportunities in explaining household adaptation choices. We surveyed over 750 households arrayed along an ecological gradient and matched across the national border in Mongolia and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, asking what changes in livelihoods strategies households made over the last ten years, and analyzed these choices in two broad categories of options: diversification and livestock management. We combined these data with remotely sensed information about vegetation growth and self-reported exposure to price fluctuations. Our statistical results showed that households experiencing lower ecological and economic variability, higher average levels of vegetation growth, and with greater levels of material wealth, were often those that undertook more actions to improve their conditions in the face of variability. The findings have implications both for how interventions aimed at supporting ongoing choices might be targeted and for theory construction related to social adaptation.

AB  - Can markets assist by providing support for ecological restoration, and if so, under what conditions? The first step in addressing this question is to develop a consistent methodology for economic evaluation of ecological restoration projects. A risk analysis process was followed in which a system dynamics model was constructed for eight diverse case study sites where ecological restoration is currently being pursued. Restoration costs vary across each of these sites, as do the benefits associated with restored ecosystem functioning. The system dynamics model simulates the ecological, hydrological and economic benefits of ecological restoration and informs a portfolio mapping exercise where payoffs are matched against the likelihood of success of a project, as well as a number of other factors (such as project costs and risk measures). This is the first known application that couples ecological restoration with system dynamics and portfolio mapping. The results suggest an approach that is able to move beyond traditional indicators of project success, since the effect of discounting is virtually eliminated. We conclude that systems dynamic modelling with portfolio mapping can guide decisions on when markets for restoration activities may be feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cladophora in the Great Lakes grows rapidly during the warm summer months, detaches, and becomes free-floating mats as a result of environmental conditions, eventually becoming stranded on recreational beaches. Cladophora provides protection and nutrients, which allow enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, enterococci, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella to persist and potentially regrow in the presence of the algae. As a result of wind and wave action, these microorganisms can detach and be released to surrounding waters and can influence water quality. Enteric bacterial pathogens have been detected in Cladophora mats; E. coli and enterococci may populate to become part of the naturalized microbiota in Cladophora; the high densities of these bacteria may affect water quality, resulting in unnecessary beach closures. The continued use of traditional fecal indicators at beaches with Cladophora presence is inadequate at accurately predicting the presence of fecal contamination. This paper offers a substantial review of available literature to improve the knowledge of Cladophora impacts on water quality, recreational water monitoring, fecal indicator bacteria and microorganisms, and public health and policy.

AB  - In the Corumbatai river basin, State of Sao Paulo, forest remnants occupy less than 3% of the original total area, and the absence of this natural vegetation has been increasing erosion and disturbing hydrological regime of its streams, causing many problems on water supply in urban areas like Piracicaba and Rio Claro. This situation shows the need of a well planned reforestation in areas of this watershed. However, since the funds are limited, it is necessary a site selection study to use available fund on reforestation projects considering the maximum environmental gain. This study aims to develop a site selection method for reforestation based on sustainable indicators of catchments. Five indicators were considered: native forest proportion in the Permanent Preservation Areas (APP); native forest discontinuity in the basin; mean variation of land-use; Shannon landscape diversity index; and mean erosion susceptibility. Catchment areas were selected using linear weighting of indicators and ranking of catchments. An initial simulation was made to select the best 1.000 ha for reforestation and the results showed that the indicators were able to capture distinct aspects of catchment sustainability. The method was considered useful for selecting catchments at extreme conditions, differentiating those that need conservation actions from those that need restoration actions.

AB  - [1] We investigated the factors controlling lake evolution in Arctic ecosystems using a multiproxy paleolimnological approach on a small lake on Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. Lakewater pH was inferred from fossil diatom assemblages, whereas primary production was assessed from sediment concentrations of diatom valves and spectrally inferred chlorophyll a. Our reconstructed limnological variables registered synchronous changes and showed a close coupling to Holocene climatic fluctuations, as inferred by numerous independent paleoclimate proxies. Without exception, our highest pH and production values occurred during warm intervals, and vice-versa. A return towards paleolimnological conditions of the warm early Holocene has occurred since the midtwentieth century, corresponding to climate warming following the Little Ice Age. Maximum recent values of our reconstructed parameters are either directly comparable to, or in some cases exceed, values attained during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, 8000-10,000 years ago. Our data suggest that climate has a first-order influence on primary production and the regulation of in-lake DIC dynamics (and hence on lakewater pH) through its modulation of lake ice cover. We conclude that direct forcing by climate is more important than catchment processes in controlling the chemical and biological development of ice-dominated Arctic lake ecosystems, at the scale of the Holocene.

TI  - Population size - The indicator of the response of a local population to external pressure (A case study of the right shore of the Lipno lake area)
T2  - EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA  - English
AB  - Cultural landscapes have developed within the process of interactions of local human populations with specific natural conditions of the place these populations are situated in. A population actively changes the environment and at the same time adapts to it, but both only to a certain extent. When the pressure of natural or cultural environment exceeds certain limits, people leave the area. The article is aimed at describing: the response of the local population to the extreme pressure caused by external factors. Population size, i.e. the number of people residing in the model area was chosen as the basic indicator. For this ease study the local population was chosen inhabiting the area situated between the right shore of Lipno water reservoir and the Austrian border. Two periods can be distinguished in the history of local population since the beginning of this century. Until 1946 the population was more or less resisting to economic pressure which caused the marginal position of the area, and the number of inhabitants remained almost unchanged. The dramatic decrease of inhabitant numbers in 1946 and later, has never been compensated, mainly due to political decisions made by the central government.

AB  - This study reports the soil-plant relationships within a protected landscape in semiarid SE Spain that includes salt marshes and temporary streams and that is affected by agricultural water leaching. The main objective was to establish a conceptual model in order to use vegetation as bioindicator of soil conditions. With this model, environmental changes - based on the observation of vegetation - could be detectable, allowing the prevention of environmental impacts and the improvement of the environmental management of the studied area. Eight sampling stations with a total of 39 plots were established for the sampling of vegetation (floristic composition and species abundance) and soil (moisture, pH, redox potential, electrical conductivity and soluble ions). Multivariate analysis showed that vegetation was closely related to soil moisture and salinity. The soils colonised by steppe grasses (dominated by Lygeum spartum) and halophilus and halonitrophilus shrubs (dominated by Suaeda vera and Limonium spp.) were the driest (moisture < similar to 20%) and least saline (EC < similar to 30 dS m(-1)). Phragmites australis, Sarcocornia fruticosa and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum dominated in the most saline and wettest soils. P. australis reached maximum cover at EC values similar to 40 dS m(-1) and soil moisture similar to 30% and consistently appeared on those soils with lower seasonal contrasts of moisture and salinity. Between 30 and 80 dS m(-1) of soil salinity, S. frudcosa reached maximum cover (similar to 100%) while A. macrostachyum did not exceed similar to 80%. Outside this range of salinity S. fruticosa declined (cover <10%), while the other species maintained cover > similar to 40%. In addition, A. macrostachyum grew in soils with stronger seasonal changes of moisture and salinity. Based on the model established, if an expansion of P. australis is detected, an increase in soil moisture and a decrease in soil salinity during the year could be inferred. These changes could be due to an increased entry of effluents of fresh and/or brackish water from agricultural areas. In turn, an increase in the cover of A. macrostachyum would indicate higher soil salinity, which could be a consequence of an increase in the evaporation rates (due to rising temperatures) and a decrease in rainfall (predicted consequences of global warming). The expansion of S. fruticosa would be favoured under relatively high soil salinity conditions (which limit P. australis expansion) jointly with high soil moisture, without strong seasonal changes (which limit A. macrostachyum expansion). Our results support the role of vegetation as bioindicator of disturbances and the use of soil-plant relationships models to improve the environmental management of saline ecosystems.

AB  - Daphnia magna is a keystone indicator zooplankton used in environmental quality assessments. Comparative metabolomics, which contrasts small biomolecular regulations under different conditions, has emerged as a sensitive and informative investigation tool for the assessment of environmental stressors on D. magna. Baseline metabolomic variation is likely impacted by the asexual reproduction cycle of D. magna; however, the relationship between metabolite concentration regulation and reproduction cycle has not been investigated. This study investigated the time-course regulation of 51 metabolites during different reproduction stages to determine how the reproduction cycle controlled the metabolite profile of D. magna. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) results reveal that most metabolites show significantly differentiated concentrations by individual or a combination of reproduction stages and sampling time. On the basis of the partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ANOVA-SCA), stages 2 and 3 of reproduction show similarity in metabolite abundance regulation compared to stage 1. Metabolites were classified as being either dependent or independent of reproduction in the pairwise concentration correlation based on Pearson correlation coefficients. This study observed that the D. magna reproduction stage is an important consideration and potential variable and should be considered carefully when conducting metabolomic experiments using D. magna.

AB  - Climate change may increase plant invasion risk, but few studies have paid attention to the relationship between climate change and plant invasion in conservation areas at a global scale. The primary objective of our study was to determine whether climate change would allow or even increase the likelihood that invasive alien plant species would invade conservation areas across the world and in particular regions. We modeled current and future potential distributions of invasive alien plant species using bioclimatic variables in the program Maxent. Our study found that global climate change would not lead to plant invasions in every conservation area, but it would provide the conditions for few invasive plant species to impact conservation areas in some regions. Greenhouse gas concentrations could aggravate the regional invasion of invasive plant species and make larger changes of ability of invasive plant species to invade conservation areas in low gas concentration scenario than high gas concentration scenario. Immediate measures must be taken to deal with this problem, such as developing global indicators of biological invasion and designing long-term management plans at different geographical scales.

AB  - As Sri Lankan water resources are being increasingly exploited, particularly for hydropower and irrigation, ecologists, water practitioners and policymakers alike are realizing the importance of protecting these resources and setting environmental sustainability thresholds. Environmental flows (EF) - the concept that helps define such thresholds - has now become an integral part of environmental impact assessments of river basin development projects. Considering EF is especially vital in the context of the accelerated infrastructure development program, launched after the end of the war in the north and the east of the country in 2009. This paper describes a simple, user-friendly software tool that facilitates quick, first-hand estimation of EF in Sri Lankan rivers. The tool uses 'natural' or 'unregulated' monthly flow time series, at any river location to construct a flow duration curve that is then modified depending on the desired condition of a river - an environmental management class - to generate an EF time series. The tool includes historical flow records from 158 gauged locations, but users may also feed in (observed/simulated) external data. The paper illustrates the application of the tool at two locations of existing/planned infrastructure projects and discusses its usefulness as a policy tool.

AB  - Abnormal behaviour is a potential indicator of pain, suffering and injury in captive animals. Especially stereotypies, i.e. repetitive invariant behavioural patterns without obvious function or goal, can be observed as a consequence of inadequate housing conditions. Hence, they are often considered indicators of impaired welfare. In context of the ongoing scientific debate on captive animal welfare, the number of publications on stereotypies has increased, most notably in veterinary and farm animal research. Based on biological principles and definitions, we present several examples of stereotypic behaviour in (mainly) farm animals, and discuss approaches of preventing or reducing them. The occurrence of abnormal behaviour is often, but not necessarily, associated with the fact that modern housing and management precludes various evolutionary emerged highly motivated behaviours, or poses challenges the animals are unable to cope with adequately. Numerous studies show that stereotypies can be indicative of (current or past) suffering and impaired welfare. They can be avoided or at least reduced by increasing the biological relevance of the housing environments through environmental enrichment which stimulates species specific behaviour.

AB  - The biological effect of ionic liquids (ILs) is one of the highly debated topics as they are being contemplated for various industrial applications. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) showed remarkable hormesis on anaerobic Clostridium sp. and aerobic Pseudomonas putida. Bacterial growth was stimulated at up to 2.5 g L-1 and inhibited at >2.5 g L-1 of [EMIM][Ac]. The growth of Clostridium sp. and P. putida were higher by 0.4 and 4-fold respectively, in the presence of 0.5 g L-1 [EMIM][Ac]. Assessment of the effect of [EMIMI[Ac] under different growth conditions showed that the hormesis of [EMIM][Ac] was mediated via regulation of medium pH. Hormetic effect of [EMIM][Ac] was evident only in medium with poor buffering capacity and in the presence of a fermentable substrate as the carbon source. The hormetic effect of [EMIM][Ac] on bacterial growth is most likely associated with the buffering capacity of acetate anion. These observations have implications in ILs toxicity studies and ecological risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The usefulness of fish parasite communities as bioindicators of environmental stress was tested on two benthic fish species, the red mullet (Mu this barbatus) and the spotted flounder (Citharus linguatula), during the spring of 2006 at two sites of the Catalan coast (northwestern Mediterranean): an anthropogenic-impacted area located close to the city of Barcelona, and a less polluted area close to Blanes (Girona). Gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices and condition factor were determined for the fishes caught. Prevalence, mean intensity, mean abundance and species richness of the parasites found in the survey were calculated for both species and locations, and the main histological alterations were recorded. Cysts of unknown aetiology and intestinal coccidians were reported only in red mullets from the area close to Barcelona, which were highly parasitized by the digenean Opecoeloides furcatus and the nematode Capillaria sp. However, a higher prevalence of Ichthyophonus sp. was reported in the spotted flounder from Blanes. Cysts of unknown aetiology, some nematodes and Ichthyophonus sp. may be associated with pollution.

AB  - Eukaryotic microalgae are highly suitable biological indicators of environmental changes because they are exposed to extreme seasonal fluctuations. The biochemical and molecular targets and regulators of key proteins involved in the stress response in microalgae have yet to be elucidated. This study presents morphological and biochemical evidence of programmed cell death (PCD) in a low temperature strain of Chlorella saccharophila induced by exposure to NaCl stress. Morphological characteristics of PCD, including cell shrinkage, detachment of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, were observed. Additionally, a significant production of H2O2 and increase in caspase 3-like activity were detected. We demonstrated that singly applied environmental stresses such as warming or salt stress trigger a pathway cif PCD. Intriguingly, the prior application of salt stress seems to reduce heat shock-induced cell death significantly, suggesting a combined effect which activates a defense mechanism in algal cells. These results suggest that C. saccharophila can undergo PCD under stress conditions, and that this PCD shares several features with metazoan PCD. Moreover, the simultaneous exposure of this unicellular chlorophyte to different abiotic stresses results in a tolerance mechanism.

AB  - This study identified 83 species from existing publications suitable for inclusion in a database of sensitivity of species to ozone (OZOVEG database). An index, the relative sensitivity to ozone, was calculated for each species based on changes in biomass in order to test for species traits associated with ozone sensitivity. Meta-analysis of the ozone sensitivity data showed a wide inter-specific range in response to ozone. Some relationships in comparison to plant physiological and ecological characteristics were identified. Plants of the therophyte lifeform were particularly sensitive to ozone. Species with higher mature leaf N concentration were more sensitive to ozone than those with lower leaf N concentration. Some relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and Ellenberg habitat requirements were also identified. In contrast, no relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and mature leaf P concentration, Grime's CSR strategy, leaf longevity, flowering season, stomatal density and maximum altitude were found. The relative sensitivity of species and relationships with plant characteristics identified in this study could be used to predict sensitivity to ozone of untested species and communities.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the usefulness of fish scales as a bioindicator reflecting the concentrations of heavy metals in the environment as compared to typical recognized bioindicators such as the liver or kidney. Heavy metal (Zn, Mn, Cu, Cd, Fe, Ni, Pb) concentration analysis (with the atomic absorption technique) was performed in different annuli on the fish scale to characterize the metals' accumulation in the consecutive years of the fish's life corresponding to individual scale increments. The results confirmed the usefulness of fish scales as a bioindicative tissue reflecting the condition of the environment in subsequent growing seasons. The results of the present study demonstrated that fish scales are more sensitive to the accumulation of Mn, Ni, and Pb, whose concentrations in different parts of the scales were even 10 times higher than in soft tissues, and significantly correlated with their levels in liver or kidney. In light of this finding, further studies involving controlled exposure of fish to different metals could be performed. Their results could allow for obtaining an excellent tool for monitoring the environment inhabited by fish in the present and past without the need to kill the animals.

AB  - Toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models offer a mechanistic understanding of individual-level toxicity over time and allow for meaningful extrapolations from laboratory tests to exposure conditions in the field. Thereby, they hold great potential for ecotoxicological studies, both in a regulatory context as well as for basic research. In contrast to mechanistic effect models at higher levels of biological organization, TKTD models can be, and generally are, parameterized by fitting them to data (results from toxicity tests). Fitting models comes with a range of statistical and numerical challenges, which may hamper the application of TKTD models in a practical setting. Especially in the context of environmental risk assessment, there is a need for robust and user-friendly software tools to automatically extract the best-fitting model parameters and quantify their uncertainty from any data set. The study presents a general outline for TKTD model analysis, rooted in likelihood-based ("frequentist") inference. The general outline is followed by a presentation of the specific algorithm that has been implemented into software for the robust and automated analysis of toxicity data for survival. However, the presented approach is more broadly applicable to low-dimensional problems.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-10. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB  - Fish parasites can be good indicators of the quality of water bodies, and their presence or absence can be interpreted as a sign of habitat changes, helping us to diagnose environmental problems. This study was conducted in two estuaries located in the Paraiba state, northeastern Brazil: Mamanguape, an environmental protection area, and Paraiba do Norte, a river with riverside communities along its length. The objective of the study was to determine whether host and abiotic characteristics predict the richness of fish gill parasites and/or the abundance of the most abundant and prevalent parasite species, the copepod Acusicola brasiliensis, testing the species as a possible bioindicator. The fish host species were Anchoa januaria, Atherinella brasiliensis, Mugil curema, and Rhinosardinia bahiensis. Generalized linear models were constructed to test the influence of predictor variables on parasite richness and A. brasiliensis abundance. The predictor variables used in the models were the host relative condition factor (Kn), host length, collection season (rainy or dry), estuary, host species, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. Both parasite species richness and A. brasiliensis mean abundance showed a significant relation to water quality parameters, suggesting their possible use as environmental quality indicators.

AB  - Environmental contextMicroplastic particles are increasingly recognised as human-caused pollutants in soil with potential harmful effects on soil microorganisms. Microplastics may also have evolutionary consequences for soil microbes, because the particles may alter conditions in the soil and hence selection pressures. Including an evolutionary perspective in an environmental assessment of microplastics could lead to new questions and novel insights into responses of soil microbes to this anthropogenic stressor. AbstractMicroplastic pollution is increasingly considered to be a factor of global change: in addition to aquatic ecosystems, this persistent contaminant is also found in terrestrial systems and soils. Microplastics have been chiefly examined in soils in terms of the presence and potential effects on soil biota. Given the persistence and widespread distribution of microplastics, it is also important to consider potential evolutionary implications of the presence of microplastics in soil; we offer such a perspective for soil microbiota. We discuss the range of selection pressures likely to act upon soil microbes, highlight approaches for the study of evolutionary responses to microplastics, and present the obstacles to be overcome. Pondering the evolutionary consequences of microplastics in soils can yield new insights into the effects of this group of pollutants, including establishing true' baselines in soil ecology, and understanding future responses of soil microbial populations and communities.

AB  - Recent work has shown that iron oxides, such as goethite and hematite, may recrystallize in the presence of aqueous Fe2+ under anoxic conditions. This process, referred to as Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization, can influence water quality by causing the incorporation/release of environmental contaminants and biological nutrients. Accounting for the effects of Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization on water quality requires knowing the time scale over which recrystallization occurs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nanoparticulate goethite becomes less susceptible to Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization over time. We set up two batches of reactors in which Fe-55(2+) tracer was added at two different time points and tracked the Fe-55 partitioning in the aqueous and goethite phases over 60 days. Less Fe-55 uptake occurred between 30 and 60 days than between 0 and 30 days, suggesting goethite recrystallization slowed with time. Fitting the data with a box model indicated that 17% of the goethite recrystallized after 30 days of reaction, and an additional 2% recrystallized between 30 and 60 days. The decreasing susceptibility of goethite to recrystallize as it reacted with aqueous Fe2+ suggested that recrystallization is likely only an important process over short time scales.

AB  - Ecosystem accounting is receiving increasing interest as a way to systematically monitor the conditions of ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. A critical element of ecosystem accounting is understanding spatially explicit flows of ecosystem services. We developed spatial biophysical models of seven ecosystem services in a cultural landscape (Limburg province, the Netherlands) in a way that is consistent with ecosystem accounting. We included hunting, drinking water extraction, crop production, fodder production, air quality regulation, carbon sequestration and recreational cycling. In addition, we examined how human inputs can be distinguished from ecosystem services, a critical element in ecosystem accounting. Model outcomes were used to develop an ecosystem accounting table in line with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEER EEA) guidelines, in which contributions of land cover types to ecosystem service flows were recorded. Furthermore we developed spatial accounts for single statistical units. This study shows that for the case of Limburg spatial modelling for ecosystem accounting in line with SEEA EEA is feasible. The paper also analyses and discusses key challenges that need to be addressed to develop a well-functioning system for ecosystem accounting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalgae are unicellular photoautotrophs that grow in any habitat from fresh and saline water bodies, to hot springs and ice. Microalgae can be used as indicators to monitor water ecosystem conditions. These organisms react quickly and predictably to a broad range of environmental stressors, thus providing early signals of a changing environment. When grown extensively, microalgae may produce harmful effects on marine or freshwater ecology and fishery resources. Rapid and accurate recognition and classification of microalgae is one of the most important issues in water resource management. In this paper, a methodology for automatic and real time identification and enumeration of microalgae by means of image analysis is presented. The methodology is based on segmentation, shape feature extraction, pigment signature determination and neural network grouping; it attained 98.6% accuracy from a set of 53 869 images of 23 different microalgae representing the major algal phyla. In our opinion this methodology partly overcomes the lack of automated identification systems and is on the forefront of developing a computer-based image processing technique to automatically detect recognize, identify and enumerate microalgae genera and species from all the divisions. This methodology could be useful for an appropriate and effective water resource management.

AB  - In this work, we present a new automatic supervision and fault detection procedure for PV systems, based on the power losses analysis. This automatic supervision system has been developed in Matlab&Simulink environment. It includes parameter extraction techniques to calculate main PV system parameters from monitoring data in real conditions of work, taking into account the environmental irradiance and module temperature evolution, allowing simulation of the PV system behaviour in real time. The automatic supervision method analyses the output power losses, presents in the DC side of the PV generator, capture losses.
   Two new power losses indicators are defined: thermal capture losses (L-ct) and miscellaneous capture losses (L-cm). The processing of these indicators allows the supervision system to generate a faulty signal as indicator of fault detection in the PV system operation. Two new indicators of the deviation of the DC variables respect to the simulated ones have been also defined. These indicators are the current and voltage ratios: R-C and R-V.
   Analysing both, the faulty signal and the current/voltage ratios, the type of fault can be identified. The automatic supervision system has been successfully tested experimentally. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The correct understanding of contaminant degradation pathways is essential for well-informed decision processes regarding site assessment, monitored natural attenuation, and environmental liability proceedings. Over a 20-year period, and including at least one recent regulatory publication, it has been erroneously reported that cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE) is the daughter product of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA). To clarify the degradation pathways of 1,1,1-TCA, and to corroborate that cis-DCE is not a degradation product of 1,1,1-TCA as suggested and propagated by some sources, we conducted a detailed review of the available literature and mapped out a citation history of 27 publications and reports which contain both the correct and incorrect degradation pathways. Other than the sources containing the erroneous degradation pathways, the reviewed literature shows that cis-DCE is not a proven transformation product of 1,1,1-TCA.

AB  - Criteria and indicators (C&I) have become primary tools in implementing the principle of sustainable resource management. To carry out this principle, it is necessary to develop methodologies that can holistically and systematically generate relevant indicators for a particular forest or resource management unit. This paper describes some methodologies that can be used as tools to carry out structured analysis of C&I. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used as a decision-making tool to analyze and evaluate multiple C&I under a participatory group decision-making environment. Use of the method enables the generation of C&I, estimation of their relative importance, estimation of the performance of each indicator relative to its desired condition, and assessment of the indicators' combined effect or impact. In addition to generating C&I and estimating their relative importance and performance, the paper also presents a soft methodology, called cognitive mapping, which can be used to assess the crossindicator interaction, linkages, and connectivities of the indicators. The method attempts to evaluate the overall cumulative impacts of all indicators, individually and collectively, as they impact sustainability directly and indirectly through their interactions with other indicators.

AB  - Research was conducted to determine the utility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for measuring the fuel moisture status of boreal forests as reflected in Fire Weather Index Codes. Three years (May to August 1992-1995) of SAR data from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) were analysed over the 1990 Tok Alaska burned and adjacent unburned black spruce forests. Corresponding Fire Weather Index Codes of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System were obtained from Tok Area Forestry, Station number 500720. Strong relationships were expected between the SAR data and fire codes because of the dependence of ERS SAR backscatter on the moisture status of forests and exposed surfaces (burn scars). A stepwise multilinear regression procedure was used to analyse the relationships. Three statistically significant multilinear regression models resulted from this analysis procedure. The models developed show there is potential for using ERS SAR backscatter to generate indicators that are related to Fire Weather Index, Duff Moisture Code, and Drought Code. This research could lead to the ability for remote prediction of fire danger over large regions at relatively fine spatial resolution with minimal weather information.

AB  - Organic-rich rocks have received increasing attention for they are essential for evaluating hydrocarbon potential and unravelling the interaction between Earth surface environments and the biosphere. In this paper, we performed a combination of mineralogical, inorganic and organic geochemical analyses on a 200-m core of the Permian Lucaogou Formation organic-rich rocks obtained from Santanghu Basin, NW China, to investigate paleoenvironmental conditions, organic matter accumulation, and hydrocarbon potential. The redox- and salinity-sensitive proxies (e.g. V/Cr, V/(V + Ni) and Sr/Ba, Rb/K, B/Ga, and B content), together with the wide distribution of pyrite and carbonate minerals in these dark, thinly laminated organic-rich rocks, suggest that dysoxic-anoxic, brackish-saline, alkaline conditions prevailed during the deposition of the Lucaogou Formation in the Santanghu Basin. The occurrence of hydrothermal minerals, including strontianite and barite, and enrichments of B (up to 158.0 ppm), Mn (up to 1291 ppm), and certain incompatible elements (Li (up to 923 ppm), Rb (up to 848 ppm), Sr (up to 1760 ppm), Hf (up to 12.7 ppm)) as well as Ni vs. Co vs. Zn and Fe vs. Mn vs. (Cu + Co + Ni) x 10 ternary diagrams demonstrate that the Lucaogou Formation received hydrothermal input during deposition, which suggests hydrothermalism was the source of brine that has caused the salinization of the water column.
   The positive correlation of HI value and TOC content, together with redox-sensitive proxies, illustrates primary productivity in surface water and preservation in anoxic bottom water collectively contributed to the enrichment of organic matter. Moreover, the positive correlation between silicate mineral content and TOC content and the negative correlation between carbonate content and TOC content suggest that terrigenous input as the main source of nutrients promoted organic matter accumulation, while carbonate constituents acted as a diluent to organic matter accumulation during deposition of the Lucaogou Formation. The faint positive correlation between TOC content and hydrothermal intensity indicator (Cr/Zr) seems to indicate that hydrothermal fluids may provide an additional source of nutrients for organic matter accumulation.
   In addition, the oil generation capacity of Lucaogou Formation, with abundant oil-prone organic matter (Type I/II1 kerogen with HI values ranging from 421.18-918.41 mg HC/g TOC) in the early mature to mature stage (T-max values ranging from 435 to 451 degrees C), is considerable. The Rock-Eval oil saturation index (OSI=S-1/TOC x 100) values range from 6.04-164.07 mg HC/g TOC, suggesting the Lucaogou Formation contains producible oil. The high brittle mineral (including quartz and carbonates) contents ( > 50% wt%) and traces of clay minerals ( < 5 wt%) imply that the Lucaogou Formation is likely to respond well to hydraulic stimulation. Consequently, the Lucaogou Formation in Santanghu Basin is expected to be a potential lacustrine shale oil play.

AB  - Oxidation reactions are powerful tools for synthesis because they allow us to reverse the polarity of electron-rich functional groups, generate highly reactive intermediates, and increase the functionality of molecules. For this reason, oxidation reactions have been and continue to be the subject of intense study. Central to these efforts is the development of mechanism-based strategies that allow us to think about the reactive intermediates that are frequently central to the success of the reactions and the mechanistic pathways that those intermediates trigger. For example, consider oxidative cyclization reactions that are triggered by the removal of an electron from an electron-rich olefin and lead to cyclic products that are functionalized for further elaboration. For these reactions to be successful, the radical cation intermediate must first be generated using conditions that limit its polymerization and then channeled down a productive desired pathway. Following the cyclization, a second oxidation step is necessary for product formation, after which the resulting cation must be quenched in a controlled fashion to avoid undesired elimination reactions. Problems can arise at any one or all of these steps, a fact that frequently complicates reaction optimization and can discourage the development of new transformations. Fortunately, anodic electrochemistry offers an outstanding opportunity to systematically probe the mechanism of oxidative cyclization reactions. The use of electrochemical methods allows for the generation of radical cations under neutral conditions in an environment that helps prevent polymerization of the intermediate. Once the intermediates have been generated, a series of "telltale indicators" can be used to diagnose which step in an oxidative cyclization is problematic for less successful transformation. A set of potential solutions to address each type of problem encountered has been developed. For example, problems with the initial cyclization reaction leading to either polymerization of the radical cation, elimination of a proton from or solvent trapping of that intermediate, or solvent trapping of the radical cation can be identified in the proton NMR spectrum of the crude reaction material. Such an NMR spectrum shows retention of the trapping group. The problems can be addressed by tuning the radical cation, altering the trapping group, or channeling the reactive intermediate down a radical pathway. Specific examples each are shown in this Account. Problems with the second oxidation step can be identified by poor current efficiency or general decomposition in spite of cyclic voltammetry evidence for a rapid cyclization. Solutions involve improving the oxidation conditions for the radical after cyclization by either the addition of a properly placed electron-donating group in the substrate or an increase in the concentration of electrolyte in the reaction (a change that stabilizes the cation generated from the second oxidation step). Problems with the final cation typically lead to overoxidation. Solutions to this problem require an approach that either slows down elimination side reactions or changes the reaction conditions so that the cation can be quickly trapped in an irreversible fashion. Again, this Account highlights these strategies along with the specific experimental protocols utilized.

AB  - Hybrid catfish, the progeny of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, females x blue catfish, I. furcatus, males are in high demand by the aquaculture industry due to their superiority for pond culture. Unfortunately, fry production is a limiting factor due to lack of natural hybridization between the species and the necessity to sacrifice males for artificial fertilization. In this study, we used a quantitative genetic breeding design to assess genetic, environmental, and genotype by environment interactions to detail the genetic architecture of fitness during the "critical" early life history (ELH) stages. Males and females were crossed using a full-factorial design, creating 20 unique families. Offspring from each family were split into 2 temperature-controlled environments based on conditions that mimic early (26.6 degrees C) and late (32.2 degrees C) seasonal temperatures. Embryonic survival, hatch success, larval morphology, and deformities were quantified at hatch, mid-yolk sac transition, and swim-up stages of early development. Variation in early performance traits (calculated as variance components, VC) were partitioned to maternal/paternal effects as well as parental x environmental interactions, analyzed across and within temperatures. Embryonic survival ranged from 45 to 93% by 120 degrees-hours post-fertilization and was not impacted by temperature. Maternal effects were responsible for large amounts of variation (VC = 51%), and paternal effects also became apparent during later stages of embryonic development but in smaller quantities (VC = similar to 7%). Temperature significantly impacted hatch success, in which hatch decreased at 32.2 degrees C (from 40% to 32%). Therefore, we conclude that temperatures at the start of the spawning season yield higher hatch success. Maternal effects were highly significant (VC = 65%), and there were also significant paternal effects (VC = 12%) with wide family variation (ranging from 14 to 71%). The deformity rate increased from 3.6% at 26.6 degrees C to 6.0% at 32.2 degrees C, but variation was driven more by maternal effects rather than temperature. For morphology, fry reared at 32.2 degrees C had smaller body sizes at each developmental stage. Maternal variation across morphology traits ranged widely from 9 to 80% and was highest for maternal yolk. Paternal effects/interactions ranged from to 0-29%. Genetic x environmental interactions were also observed for morphology traits since values for VCs differed within each temperature. This information showed the importance of environmental effects, parentage, and their associated interactions, which by isolating indicators of male/female quality, can be used to develop parameters for broodstock selection. Results can also be applied to improve incubation conditions for hybrid catfish during the crucial ELH stages.

AB  - In the face of existing international provisions limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, it is necessary to introduce solutions that will allow the production of electricity from coal with high efficiency and low emissions. Oxy-combustion systems integrated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) installations may prove to be such a solution.
   This paper presents the main results from a thermodynamic analysis of a supercritical unit operating in oxy-combustion technology, fueled with pulverized coal with a power output of 460 MW. The parameters of the live steam in the analyzed system are 600 degrees C/30 MPa. To perform the numerical analyses, models of the individual components were built, including an oxygen production installation (ASU), a boiler, a steam cycle and a flue gas conditioning system (CPU). The models were built in the commercial programs GateCycle and Aspen and then integrated into the Excel environment.
   In this paper, different structures for an integrated oxy-type system were analyzed and compared. The auxiliary power rates were determined for individual technological installations of the oxy-combustion power plant. The highest value of this indicator, in the range between 15.65% and 19.10% was calculated for the cryogenic ASU. The total value of this index for the whole installation reaches as high as 35% for the base case. The use of waste heat from the interstage cooling of compressors in the air separation installation and flue gas conditioning system was considered as the methods of counteracting the efficiency decrease resulting from the introduction of ASU and CPU. The proposed configurations and optimization allow a significant reduction of the auxiliary power of the considered unit. In consequence, the efficiency decrease was reduced by approximately 3.5% points.
   An economic analysis of the different structures of the oxy-fuel system and the reference air-fired power plant was also conducted using a newly developed computational algorithm built in the Excel environment. The algorithm uses a Break Even Point (BEP) method, focusing mainly on determining a break-even price of electricity. It was found that about the profitability of this investment will mainly decide the price of emission allowances. For the assumptions made, the oxy-combustion power plant will be economically comparable with a reference plant without carbon dioxide capture when the price of allowances would be between 34 and 41 (sic)/tonne. A sensitivity analysis concerning the influence of selected components of the cash flows on the break-even price of electricity was also performed. The main results of the calculations are presented in the paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bangladesh - one of the most densely populated countries of the world- has plentiful water sources, but these sources are being polluted continuously. Both surface water and groundwater sources are contaminated with different contaminants like toxic trace metals, coliforms as well as other organic and inorganic pollutants. As most of the population uses these water sources, especially groundwater sources which contain an elevated amount of arsenic throughout the country; health risk regarding consuming water is very high. Death due to water-borne diseases is widespread in Bangladesh, particularly among children. Anthropogenic sources such as untreated industrial effluents, improper disposal of domestic waste, agricultural runoffs are the main contributors regarding water pollution. A total water pollution status of this country, as well as the sources of this severe condition, is crucial to evaluate public health risk. For this purpose, we reviewed hundreds of well recognized international and national journals, conference proceedings and other related documents to draw a complete picture of recent water pollution status and its impact on public health; also the sources of water pollution are identified.

AB  - Water quality information is essential supporting decision making in water management processes. The lack of information restricts, at some point, the implementation of adequate sanitation, which is still scarce in developing countries. In this study, an ecosystemic water quality assessment was conducted in the Virilla river in Costa Rica, in a section of particular interest for future sanitation development. It included the monitoring of physical, chemical, microbiological and benthic macroinvertebrate parameters from 2014 to 2016. Mutivariate statistics and water quality indexes were used for data interpretation. Results indicated that water quality decreased downstream towards more urbanised areas. Particularly, extreme values of phosphorous, nitrogen and E. soli were found. Sample sites were grouped in two clusters, which were consistent with land use. Benthic macroinverterbrates diversity was predominantly represented by Baetidae, Chironomidae, Leptohyphidae, Hydropsychidae, Simuliidae and Physidae. They were mostly influenced by water temperature, nitrite, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorous, total solids, alkalinity, nitrate and total suspended solids. Three water quality indexes consistently showed the poor condition of the water body. The overall results indicate that the main sources of pollution in the river are likely to be wastewater discharges. Thus, special efforts should be undertaken regarding its regulation in the country.

AB  - Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the condition of a building's internal environment that is related to the occupants' health, comfort, and wellbeing. The assessment and improvement of IEQ in buildings are based on either subjective or objective assessment or the use of both measures, and in recent times, have been attracting attention due to its role in contributing to green building and sustainable environment. This study is aimed at evaluating and analysing the validity of the IEQ parameter traits as assessed using subjective and objective measures. The convergent and discriminant validity of the measured parameter traits were tested by analysing a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) matrix using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results indicated that there is no convergent validity in the IEQ parameter traits as assessed using subjective and objective methods. However, discriminant validity of the measured parameter traits was adequately supported. This clearly shows that as much as IEQ parameter traits measured through objective physical measurement and subjective occupant survey define the same concept, they cannot be taken to represent a single and same unit of measurement.

AB  - The aim of the study is to identify possible differences in the prevalence of biological stress markers (cribra orbitalia, linear enammel hypoplasia), dental caries, activity markers (Schmorl's nodes) and markers of violence (traumatic lesions) in populations from a typical graveyard around the first church (9th-10th century AD) in the stronghold and from settlement burials in the southern bailey (second half of the 9th - beginning of the 10th century AD) of Slavs from Pohansko (Czech Republic). Cribra orbitalia and enamel hypoplasia did not markedly differ in either population. On the other hand, co-occurrence of both markers was statistically different and distinction in higher age categories could indicate diverse living conditions. Lower cariousness in the population from the southern bailey was identified. The nature of postcranial traumatic lesions in both populations indicates rather their accidental origin. However, a higher incidence of cranial injuries points to more violent activities in the population from Pohansko compared to Mikulcice. A high number of healed face injuries in males from the southern bailey could indicate higher intragroup violence in this population.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide cross-cultural empirical support that endorses the scientific nature of Quality of Life (QoL), which a review of definitions reveals as a nomothetic and multidimensional concept (personal and environmental circumstances), made up of a set of subjective and objective indicators. Although this is commonly accepted, many instruments and authors reduce it to subjective and personal conditions. Bearing in mind the aim described, multi-group Structural Equation Modelling analysis was applied to two representative samples made up of 1217 participants aged over 60 from Mexico and Spain, recruited both at random (through the random route procedure), who completed the CUBRECAVI (Brief Questionnaire of Quality of Life). In this model two third-order latent variables are considered for QoL: personal and external factors, both made up of objective and subjective indicators. As predicted, the results permit us to state that the structural model is invariant across the two countries-that is, although the QoL construct has the same structure in the two countries, the importance of the indicators (factor loadings) and the relationships between them are not equivalent.

AB  - The macrophyte quality index (MaQI) for the assessment of the ecological status of transitional systems has been recently adopted by the Italian Law in agreement with the WFD (2000/60/EC) requirements and successfully intercalibrated in the framework of the WFD intercalibration exercise. In this paper the last structure of MaQI is presented and discussed. Its application takes into consideration 29 sites spread all over the Venice lagoon. Sampling campaigns were carried out in spring and autumn and monthly in four choked sites showing a high seasonal variance.
   The analysis of the macrophyte assemblages and several environmental parameters measuring anthropogenic pressures indicate that the worst ecological status mainly depends on the combination of high sediment re-suspension, water turbidity and nutrient availability. High water turbidity and the settlement of fine particles prevent the macrophyte attachment to the bottom and their growth also in the presence of nutrients. Under those conditions macrophytes are almost missing and opportunistic taxa, belonging to Gracilariaceae, Solieriaceae and Vaucheria submarina, are replacing Ulvaceae. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper offers a critique of sustainability reporting and, in particular, a critique of the modern disconnect between the practice of sustainability reporting and what we consider to be the urgent issue of our era: sustaining the life-supporting ecological systems on which humanity and other species depend. Tracing the history of such reporting developments, we identify and isolate the concept of the 'triple bottom line' (TBL) as a core and dominant idea that continues to pervade business reporting, and business engagement with sustainability. Incorporating an entity's economic, environmental and social performance indicators into its management and reporting processes, we argue, has become synonymous with corporate sustainability; in the process, concern for ecology has become sidelined. Moreover, this process has become reinforced and institutionalised through SustainAbility's biennial benchmarking reports, KPMG's triennial surveys of practice, initiatives by the accountancy profession and, particularly, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)'s sustainability reporting guidelines. We argue that the TBL and the GRI are insufficient conditions for organizations contributing to the sustaining of the Earth's ecology. Paradoxically, they may reinforce business-as-usual and greater levels of un-sustainability.

AB  - Unpredictable environmental conditions and highly fluctuating population densities are believed to have produced a reversed island syndrome (RIS) in an insular population of the Wall lizard on Licosa Islet, Italy. Several of the physiological, behavioural, and life-history changes that constitute the RIS could result from positive selection on increased activity of melanocortins. For example, increased levels of a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) should lead to increased investment in reproduction and increased immunocompetence in the island population. We tested the crucial assumption of this idea that plasma levels of a-MSH in Licosa Islet lizards are elevated compared to those of the mainland relatives. We also tested for differences in reproductive effort between populations, by measuring plasma levels of 5-a-dihydrotestosterone in males and clutch mass in females. In addition, we assessed ectoparasite load as an indicator for the lizards resistance to environmental stress. In agreement with the RIS, we found that insular lizards exhibit higher a-MSH levels, allocate more energy to reproduction, and have a reduced ectoparasite load compared to the nearest mainland population.

AB  - Lower atmospheric ozone, a gaseous air pollutant, is toxic to many plants and threatens the health of forests across the United States. In the 1990s, the USDA Forest Service began a monitoring program to assess status and trends with respect to the presence of phytotoxic concentrations of ozone in our nation's forests. Ozone detection is based on the foliar (leaf) injury response of ozone-sensitive bioindicator species; a response that is conditioned primarily by the levels of ozone in the air and moisture in the soil. One goal of the program is to use the injury data in conjunction with ozone exposure and plant/soil moisture indices to develop a quantitative assessment of the effects of ozone pollution on plant life across the country. Preliminary work found that a logistic regression model was inadequate to describe the relationship between ozone injury and the environmental factors. Hoping for a better fit, we applied a generalized additive model. We refined the model by using different categorization methods for foliar injury and by incorporating different geographic and ecological factors. Finally, we concluded that our refined model, when compared to the logistic model, explains the data better and provides a better description of the relationship of interest.

AB  - Changes in lake water temperature and trophic states were inferred using chironomid fossil assemblages from 'Lac Long Inferieur' (Southern Alps, France). In the Late Glacial, a colder period, possibly analogous to the Younger Dryas, is characterised by a peak in Micropsectra, a cold stenothermic taxon. The increase in temperatures during the Late Glacial interstadial is indicated by a decrease in the percentages of cold stenothermic taxa (Tanytarsus lugens / Corynocera oliveri grp.) and by an increase in taxa linked to the development of vegetation in the littoral zone. The beginning of the Holocene is marked by the presence of taxa adapted to warmer and more eutrophic waters. During the Holocene, the progressive warming of the climate and increase in lake trophic status were indicated by the increase of eutrophic and warmer water indicators. An increase in tributary inflow into 'Lac Long ' Inferieur' was also inferred by the increase in rheophilous taxa, reflecting increased snowmelt. During the Subatlantic, the composition of the chironomid spectra suggests a re-cooling of the climate and/or a decrease in lake trophic status.

AB  - Many organisms display rhythms of physiology and behavior that are entrained to the 24-h cycle of light and darkness prevailing on Earth. Under constant conditions of illumination and temperature, these internal biological rhythms persist with a period close to 1 day("circadian"), but it is usually not exactly 24 h. Recent discoveries have uncovered stunning similarities among the molecular circuitries of circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and bread molds. A consensus picture is coming into focus around two proteins (called PER and TIM in fruit flies), which dimerize and then inhibit transcription of their own genes. Although this picture seems to confirm a venerable model of circadian rhythms based on time-delayed negative feedback, we suggest that just as crucial to the circadian oscillator is a positive feedback loop based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization. These ideas can be expressed in simple mathematical form(phase plane portraits), and the model accounts naturally for several hallmarks of circadian rhythms, including temperature compensation and the per(L) mutant phenotype. In addition, the model suggests how an endogenous circadian oscillator could have evolved from a more primitive, light-activated switch.

AB  - Conventional onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs) could potentially contribute to the transmission of infectious diseases caused by waterborne pathogenic microorganisms and become an important human health concern, especially in the areas where OWTSs are used as the major wastewater treatment units. Although previous studies suggested the OWTSs could reduce chemical pollutants as well as effectively reducing microbial contaminants from onsite wastewater, the microbiological quality of effluents and the factors potentially affecting the removal are still understudied. Therefore, the design and optimization of pathogen removal performance necessitate a better mechanistic understanding of the hydrological, geochemical, and biological processes controlling the water quality in OWTSs. To fill the knowledge gaps, the sources of pathogens and common pathogenic indicators, along with their major removal mechanisms in OWTSs were discussed. This review evaluated the effectiveness of pathogen removal in state-of-art OWTSs and investigated the contributing factors for efficient pathogen removal (e.g., system configurations, filter materials, environmental and operational conditions), with the aim to guide the future design for optimized treatment performance.

AB  - Seasonally dry tropical forests are strongly impacted by human activities such as agriculture and ranching, as well as variations in climate conditions. Soil nematodes are sensitive to these changes, given that soil and climate characteristics influence their survival and occurrence. We analyzed the changes in the structure of nematode communities in three different types of land use (agricultural areas, secondary forest and natural forest) in the Caatinga, at Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. We recorded a total of 17,177 nematode individuals belonging to 104 genera. Nematode abundance and richness were highest in the secondary forest and lowest in the agricultural areas. The total abundance of bacterivores and omnivore-predators was affected by types of land use. Different soil properties as well as monthly mean rainfall and temperature were strongly related to the differences in taxonomic composition among the agricultural areas, secondary forest and natural forest, accounting for 65.42% of the total variation. In general, our results indicate that agricultural activities in the Caatinga negatively affect the nematode communities, and that soil characteristics and climate variables also strongly affect the structure and composition of these communities.

AB  - Shape variability represents an important direct response of organisms to selective environments. Here, we use a combination of geometric morphometrics and generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to identify spatial patterns of natural shell shape variation in the North Atlantic and Arctic blue mussels, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus, with environmental gradients of temperature, salinity and food availability across 3980 km of coastlines. New statistical methods and multiple study systems at various geographical scales allowed the uncoupling of the developmental and genetic contributions to shell shape and made it possible to identify general relationships between blue mussel shape variation and environment that are independent of age and species influences. We find salinity had the strongest effect on the latitudinal patterns of Mytilus shape, producing shells that were more elongated, narrower and with more parallel dorsoventral margins at lower salinities. Temperature and food supply, however, were the main drivers of mussel shape heterogeneity. Our findings revealed similar shell shape responses in Mytilus to less favourable environmental conditions across the different geographical scales analysed. Our results show how shell shape plasticity represents a powerful indicator to understand the alterations of blue mussel communities in rapidly changing environments.

AB  - Ecological footprint is one of the most important indicators to measure the environment and sustainable development of economic system. As Sichuan is a major province of resources and environment for China, so its resources and environmental conditions have a very important impact on China's southwest region. This paper tries to measure and calculate Sichuan province's ecological footprint based on input-output analysis. The results indicate that aggregate demand for ecological footprint in Sichuan is more than its supply and its ecological footprint per capita is far greater than that of the Beijing and the Fujian in the same period. Therefore, Sichuan is in an unsustainable state of development at this stage. In addition, this study finds that the proportion of energy footprint to total demand is 65.29% and the ecological efficiency is lower than others through the analysis of the ecological footprint and the ecological footprint of per ten thousand Yuan of GDP in Sichuan province. Therefore, in order to achieve sustainable development for Sichuan province, it is necessary to reduce fossil energy use, to improve the efficiency of energy and resources, to promote the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure, and comprehensively to promote the construction of conservation-oriented society.

AB  - An exceptionally high density of gelatinous organisms was observed in May 2015, off the coasts of Doganbey, central Aegean Sea. Eight gelatinous species were found in the accumulation, with salps being the main component. The hydromedusae Solmaris corona and Aequorea forskalea, the siphonophore Nanomia bijuga and the ctenophore Leucothea sp. are recorded for the first time from the Aegean Sea. The hydromedusa S. corona, the siphonophores Hippopodius hippopus and N. bijuga, the salp Salpa maxima and the ctenophore Leucothea sp. are first records for the Turkish coasts. We suggest that the various life histories and different ecological traits of the gelatinous components in the accumulation are indicators of an apparent bloom, i.e., the organisms bloomed/increased their abundances in response to different processes and were aggregated only subsequently at the coast, due to strong southwesterly winds and north-eastward currents originating a few days prior to our observations. The offshore area facing Doganbey is characterized by a large gyre coupled with one of the most vigorous upwelling zones in the Mediterranean Sea, therefore creating favourable conditions for the aggregation of salps and the presence of siphonophores.

AB  - We present findings on the prevalence and abundance of cyamid ectoparasites (Cyamus ceti) or "whale lice" on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) harvested for subsistence in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas from 1973 to 2015. Cyamids were present on 20% of the 673 whales that were examined for cyamid ectoparasites. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with cyamid prevalence. The probability of cyamid presence increased with age, length, and improving body condition, but decreased over the past 35 years. Cyamid presence was also more probable on whales harvested in the spring than on those harvested in the fall. When present, cyamid abundance was typically low (< 10 per whale). Case histories provide ancillary information about the relationships between abundance of cyamids and their bowhead hosts. Environmental change and increasing anthropogenic disturbances are expected to occur in the Arctic regions inhabited by bowheads. We recommend continued monitoring of subsistence harvested whales for cyamids, as well as further investigations into the roles of environmental and anthropogenic variables in cyamid prevalence and abundance, as part of a comprehensive program of Arctic ecosystem assessment.

AB  - In the neotropics, white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) are important indicators of intact natural landscapes and the status of medium-to large-sized mammals dependent on forest habitats. Recognizing the species' value as an environmental indicator of landscape and forest conditions in the southern Pantanal, we evaluated the impacts of deforestation and fragmentation on forest mammals by analyzing T. pecari home ranges in a pristine area with intact natural vegetation cover, and a relatively disturbed area where deforestation and conversion to exotic grass pasture is becoming prevalent. In the relatively disturbed region, the home range area was 51% larger than it was in the pristine area, and there were two centers of activity separated by a large unused deforested patch. In the pristine region, there was only one activity center without large unused patches. We relate the differences in the disturbed area to fragmentation of the original T. pecari home range and loss of forest fruit sources. We discuss the implications of ongoing forest fragmentation and predicted climate change for T. pecari and other forest frugivores in the naturally patchy and highly seasonal environment of the Pantanal.

AB  - Policymakers, program managers, and landowners need information about net terrestrial carbon sequestration in forests, croplands, grasslands, and shrublands to understand the cumulative effects of carbon trading programs, expanding biofuels production, and changing environmental conditions in addition to agricultural and forestry uses. Objective information systems that establish credible baselines and track changes in carbon storage can provide the accountability needed for carbon trading programs to achieve durable carbon sequestration and for biofuels initiatives to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. A multi-sector stakeholder design process was used to produce a new indicator for the 2008 State of the Nation's Ecosystems report that presents metrics of carbon storage for major ecosystem types, specifically change in the amount of carbon gained or lost over time and the amount of carbon stored per unit area (carbon density). These metrics have been developed for national scale use, but are suitable for adaptation to multiple scales such as individual farm and forest parcels, carbon offset markets and integrated national and international assessments. To acquire the data necessary for a complete understanding of how much, and where, carbon is gained or lost by U.S. ecosystems, expansion and integration of monitoring programs will be required.

AB  - The objective ob this work was to define, for edaphoclimatic conditions of Brazil, acceptable levels of dispersion of some biological parameters, used in studies of environmental impact due to the adoption of new technologies with the soybean crop. Two experiments were performed in eleven counties, in six states and in the Federal District, with conventional and transgenic soybean. Evaluated parameters were: carbon and nitrogen of the microbial biomass, microbial respiration, microbial metabolic quotient, electrophoresis of soil DNA in denaturating gradient gel (DGGE), biological nitrogen fixation, number of rhizobial cells, nodule number and nodule dry weight, nodule occupancy by Bradyrhizobium strains, shoot dry weight, total nitrogen in shoot and nitrogen as ureides in shoot. The temporal variability for carbon and nitrogen of microbial biomass, microbial respiration and microbial metabolic quotient was adequate, and the maximum coefficient of variation was estimated at 35%. The homogeneity between replicates, treatments and harvests was confirmed by the DGGE method. In N-poor soils, the parameters of nodules and shoot dry weight, with maximum coefficient of variation 33 and 18%, respectively, were adequate for evaluation of biological nitrogen fixation, which contributed from 72 to 88% of total nitrogen in shoot.

AB  - The seas of Latin America are of great marine richness; however, river contaminants that drains to the seas, the growing human settlements around the coast, overfishing and growing agricultural activity, limit the ecosystem benefits. Guatemala is the most populous country in Central America with 17 million and the agricultural activity has been growing, mainly with monocultures that demand a large amount of water. High human population densities and intensive agricultural land use have negative impacts on the environment. In addition, Guatemala does not have a water quality regulation that allows river water quality monitoring and its effect on the oceans; therefore, the condition of its rivers and its impact on the seas is currently unknown. The objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of several rivers on the Pacific side of Guatemala using Costa Rica's water quality regulations in conjunction with a quality index developed for that nation. It was determined that the rivers sampled for a year showed from moderate to very severe pollution. The main quality indicators that caused such contamination was due to high concentrations in fecal coliforms, phosphates and organic matter load, which vary depending on rainfalls as well as river flow changes.

AB  - In today's competitive global market it is mandatory to improve warehousing operations integrating economic, environmental and social aspects. The recent advancement in monitoring technologies can greatly improve the performance of the food supply chain reducing product loss. In particular,, in the perishable food supply chain, initially inventory operations are critical because they manage the material flows in very variable conditions. The deterioration level of the products as well as the market demand are the main factors that can influence warehouse strategy. This research aims to consider the application of sustainability principles in the context of warehouse storage, evaluating the combined decision of implementing shelf life based picking policy and pricing strategy. In particular, the proposed approach is based on a referenced shelf life model and on the Monte Carlo simulation. Three different pricing scenarios in a case study for the management of the warehouse were defined and their Economic Traceability Lot was determined on the basis of an economic feasibility analysis. Finally, the carbon footprint for each scenario was determined in terms of emissions produced by temperature-controlled transportations and for the landfilling of product wasted.

AB  - Urban dust in cities is a useful indicator of ambient environmental conditions and a sink for pollutants emitted through various natural and human activities. In this study, metal distributions in urban dust samples collected in 2007, using vacuuming, and 2012, using brushing, were compared. Experiments comparing the vacuuming and brushing methods were performed and translation equations were developed to correct the vacuuming results so that they could be compared with the brushing results. Cadmium concentrations were lower in 2012 than 2007; this could be because many industries moved out of the Beijing region after 2007. Concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Zn changed slightly, which could result from a combination of decreased industrial pollution and increased traffic pollution. A health risk assessment found that except for Cr, exposure to metals in urban dust in the Beijing study area would not cause serious health impacts on residents in 2007 or 2012. However, the health risk for children was higher than for adults in both years. Chromium had the highest hazxard index (0.44) and the highest carcinogenic risk (4.16 x 10(-6)).

AB  - Enterococci are indicator bacteria used to assess the risk of acquiring enteric disease from swimming in marine waters. Previous work identified beach sands as reservoirs of enterococci which can be transported from the sand to the sea, where they may instigate beach advisories. The present study establishes that naturally occurring enterococci can replicate in beach sands under environmentally relevant conditions. In unseeded, nonsterile microcosm experiments, it was shown that intermittent wetting of sands by seawater, like that which would occur at the high tide line, stimulates the transient replication of enterococci at rates of 0.20 to 0.63 per day (equivalent to doubling times of 1.1 to 3.5 days). Replication was not observed in control microcosms that were not subjected to wetting. Enterococci were enumerated using both culture-dependent (membrane filtration and mEI media) and culture-independent (quantitative PCR [QPCR], 23S rRNA gene based) techniques, which allowed tracking of both culturable and total enterococcus populations. Inhibition of QPCR and DNA extraction efficiencies were accounted for in the interpretation of the QPCR results. The results provide evidence that enterococci may not be an appropriate indicator of enteric disease risk at recreational beaches subject to nonpoint sources of pollution.

AB  - The south of Chile presents adequate conditions for the development of pastoral ecosystems in volcanic soils. The improvement strategies of these pastures consider soil tillage and fertilization. Andisols have special physical properties, however, their ability to support high stress levels affecting the soil physical quality should be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolution of the effect of different pasture improvement strategies on the physical quality of an Andisol. The study was carried out in the Estacion Experimental Agropecuaria Austral (39 degrees 46' S, 73 degrees 13' W), on a Duric Hapludand. Four treatments were randomly distributed corresponding to a mixed binary species (T1: Lolium perenne L. + Trifolium repens L), a multiple species mixture (T2: Bromus valdivianus Phil., L. perenne, Dactylis glomerata L. and T. repens) both of which were tilled, and another two that had no mechanical intervention of the soil, which was degraded naturalized pasture without fertilization (T3) and, finally, one that represented a naturalized degraded pasture with fertilization (T4). Additionally, a naturalized, degraded pasture without intervention was analyzed, which corresponded to the initial situation (IS) of the pasture. Undisturbed samples were taken between 1 and 10 cm in December 2010 and October 2011. The bearing capacity of the soil (BC), the water retention curve (WRC), the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and the air conductivity (k(l)) were determined. Soil physical quality indicators were derived such as plant available water (PAW), pore continuity indexes (C-2 and C-3) and the S index for physical quality. The tillage of the soil separated the pastures, grouping them into either disturbed (T1 and T2) or non-disturbed (T3 and T4). In general, parameters that were derived from the pore volume never reached the critical levels (e.g., PAW > 20%, S Index > 0.035) proposed in the literature. On the other hand, parameters that define the functionality of the porous system (k(l)), showed differences in one order of magnitude between pastures that maintained their structure (T3 and T4) compared to the tilled ones (T1 and T2), so that for T4 the pore continuity index (C-2 and C-3) increased by 300% and the volume of blocked pores (epsilon(b)) did not reach 1%. At the same time, properties that define the performance of the pores evolved positively over time in a more intense manner in pastures that maintained their structure (T3 and T4). However, this does not mean that in the long term these pastures would not present conditions of physical degradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This investigation focuses on the transformation of the settlement pattern of a lowland landscape as a social response to the hydrological challenges emerging in the late 13th century (c.) overture of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Results of the applied zonal analysis suggested a strong spatial connection between the geomorphological conditions, the agro-ecological suitability (good-excellent, medium and low) and the stability or instability of settlement patterns. The elevation means of archaeological sites in the deserted zones proved significantly lower than those in zones with permanent settlement pattern (BrunnerMunzel test p <= 0.01; n = 377). Additionally, the late medieval (14th-mid-16th centuries) site group was situated, on average, significantly higher than the high medieval (late 10th-13th centuries) site group within the permanent zones (Brunner-Munzel test p <= 0.01; n = 219). These outcomes statistically confirm that not only did low-lying inhabited areas shrink significantly, but they also displaced vertically in the first phase of the LIA. When analysing the relation of settlement pattern to soil conditions, the proportion of areas with good-excellent agro-ecological suitability proved 1.5-2 times higher in the permanent zones than in the deserted and uninhabited settlement suitability zones. Using the linear model, different regression coefficients appeared between the extension of the high and medium agroecological suitability zones and the number of high and late medieval settlements. The different coefficients in the studied two periods suggest that the issue of agroecological suitability in the High Middle Ages did not bear such importance as in the late Middle Ages. The findings of the paper may contribute to answering the question why the relatively dense settlement pattern of the deserted zones was abandoned almost completely by the end of the 13th c. in areas where flood proneness and weak agro-ecological suitability both meant a serious risk for human communities. Finally, we presumed that if hydro-climatic changes increased water levels, they must have changed the plant composition of the studied landscape as well. Chi-squared test of macrofossil plant remains (narchaeological site = 55; ntaxon =-330) shows that the second part of the 13th c. saw the ratio of species from humid habitat types grow (X-2 = 7.81; df = 1; p = 0.02). Comparison of the two studied processes indicates a broad synchronism between the shrinkage of inhabited areas and the increasing proportion of plants with humid environment tolerance during the second part of the 13th c. The reconstructed transformations in the composition of plant remains and settlement structure signal not a mere transitional change, but a 'longue duree' structural transformation of the landscape.

AB  - A regional strategy for safety disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes (LILW) has been implemented in China to protect humans and the environment. A joint onsite and laboratory investigation was conducted for a field site in southern China to assess the probability for safe disposal of LILW, which requires the understanding of long-term radionuclide transport behaviors under field conditions. This study presents the field-scale modeling of radionuclide transport through weathered granites for a conservative, a weakly sorbing and a strongly sorbing tracer by incorporating laboratory and field data. The field-scale radionuclide transport model was developed on the basis of a validated long-term groundwater flow model and field-measured dispersion coefficient, as well as laboratory-characterized strontium and cesium distribution coefficients in the weathered granites. The model was then used to perform the long-term transport prediction and risk assessment of radionuclide pollution for both the natural site setting and the graded site setting. Model simulation reveals that the numerical sensitivities of calculated concentrations are tracer dependent and changing with time. The conservative radionuclide is most sensitive to changes in hydraulic conductivity (K) while slightly sensitive to changes in effective porosity (phi), specific yield (mu) and longitudinal dispersion coefficient (D (L)), indicating advection is the main transport process of conservative radionuclide. The weakly and strongly sorbing tracers, on the other hand, are most sensitive to changes in the distribution coefficient (K (d)) and less sensitive to changes in the rest of model parameters, revealing that sorption is the main process for controlling the transport of sorbing tracers. A conservative radionuclide plume moves at an average velocity of about 54 m/a, which is too fast to be considered as safe disposal under the natural site setting. However, the plume of the conservative radionuclide could be slowed down to a velocity around 5.3 m/a due to the reduction of the hydraulic gradient under the graded site setting. Therefore, the conservative radioactive wastes could be disposed at the mid-eastern part of the site under the graded site setting because the transport path has been prolonged and thus no conservative radionuclides could migrate out of the site in a reasonable timeframe. For the sorbing tracers, however, results of the computed transport distance are 40 and 2 m at 500 years, respectively. Therefore, they can be disposed safely at the site under both natural and graded site settings. This study provides an insight to the field-scale long-term behaviors of radionuclide transport. The integrated modeling method presented in this study is most useful for the environmental impact assessment of the site conditions relevant to the safe disposal of hazardous wastes.

AB  - Over the last decade, nanopartides have been used more frequently in industrial applications and in consumer and medical products, and these applications of nanopartides will likely continue to increase. Concerns about the environmental fate and effects of these materials have stimulated studies to predict environmental concentrations in air, water, and soils and to determine threshold concentrations for their ecotoxicological effects on aquatic or terrestrial biota.
   Nanoparlides can be added to soils directly in fertilizers orplant protection products or indirectly through application to land or wastewater treatment products such as sludges or biosolids. Nanopartides may enter aquatic systems directly through industrial discharges or from disposal of wastewater treatment effluents or indirectly through surface runoff from soils. Researchers have used laboratory experiments to begin to understand the effects of nanopartidis on waters and soils, and this Account reviews that researdi and the translation of those results to natural conditions.
   In the environment, nanopartides can undergo a number of potential transformations that depend on the properties both of the nanopartide and of the receiving medium. These transformations largely involve chemical and physical processes, but they can involve biodegradation of surface coatings used to stabilize many nanomaterial formulations.
   The toxicity of nanomaterials to algae involves adsorption to cell surfaces and disruption to membrane transport. Higher organisms can directly ingest nanopartides, and within the food web, both aquatic and terrestrial organisms can accumulate nanopartides.
   The dissolution of nanopartides may release potentially toxic components Into the environment. Aggregation with other nanopartides (homoaggregation) or with natural mineral and organic colloids (heteroaggregation) will dramatically change their fate and potential toxicity in the environment. Soluble natural organic matter may interact with nanopartides to change surface charge and mobility and affect the interactions of those nanopartides with biota. Ultimately, aquatic nanomaterials accumulate in bottom sediments, facilitated in natural systems by heteroaggregation. Homoaggregates of nanopartides sediment more slowly.
   Nanomaterials from urban, medical, and industrial sources may undergo significant transformations during wastewater treatment processes. For example, sulfidation of silver nanopartides in wastewater treatment systems converts most of the nanopartides to silver sulfides (Ag2S). Aggregation of the nanomaterials with other mineral and organic components of the wastewater often results in most of the nanomaterial being associated with other solids rather than remaining as dispersed nanosized suspensions.
   Risk assessments for nanomaterial releases to the environment are still in their infancy, and reliable measurements of nanomaterials at environmental concentrations remain challenging. Predicted environmental concentrations based on current usage are low but are expected to increase as use increases. At this early stage, comparisons of estimated exposure data with known toxicity data indicate that the predicted environmental concentrations are orders of magnitude below those known to have environmental effects on biota. As more toxicity data are generated under environmentally-relevant conditions, risk assessments for nanomaterials will improve to produce accurate assessments that assure environmental safety.

AB  - Simple Summary Commercial breeder farms are moving forward using colony cages due to high efficiency, low energy input, clean production, and as a result of the rising public concerns with respect to the welfare of hens in conventional cages. Compared with conventional cages, layer breeders in colony cage are the parent-stock of laying hens and are confined together with roosters. However, the use of colony cages is still in a preliminary stage due to behavioral issues such as feather pecking (FP) and cannibalism. These behaviors can cause poor health, poor welfare, and economic problems. It is necessary to identify effective and proximal management practices to alleviate the damage that is caused by FP and cannibalism in such colony cage systems. This study aims to mitigate the problems of FP and cannibalism by utilizing light environment regulation. Results of this study indicates that red light and low light intensity could effectively alleviate FP and cannibalism during the laying period. Such knowledge might help to understand FP behavior and stress susceptibility of hens in this system and will provide a basis for the optimization of the cage equipment and the regulation of light environment.
   Abstract Natural mating colony cages for layer breeders have become commonplace for layer breeders in China. However, feather pecking (FP) and cannibalism are prominent in this system. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of four light-emitting diode (LED) light colors (white: WL, red: RL, yellow-orange: YO, blue-green: BG) with two light intensities for each color, on FP, plumage condition, cannibalism, fear, and stress. A total of 32 identical cages were used for the eight treatments (four replicates for each treatment). For both light intensities, hens in RL had a lowest frequency of severe FP, whereas hens in WL had the highest frequency of severe FP. Hens in RL and BG had better plumage conditions than in WL and YO. Compared with RL and BG treatments, hens treated with WL and YO had a significantly longer tonic immobility (TI) duration. Hens treated with RL had a higher concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a lower concentration of corticosterone (CORT), and a lower heterophil to lymphocyte ratio than WL and YO. Furthermore, RL could significantly reduce mortality from cannibalism. Overall, hens treated with RL and low light intensity showed a lower frequency of severe FP, less damaged plumage, were less fearful, had lower physiological indicators of stress, and had reduced mortality from cannibalism. Transforming the light color to red or dimming the light could be regarded as an effective method to reduce the risk of FP and alleviate the fear responses of layer breeders.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Our study determined the role of light, aeration, grain size, amount of sediments and of water, density of animals and presence of additional food on the movement of Ilyanassa obsoleta. Spiked relative to reference sediments were also tested for avoidance or preference by the mud snails. Our goal was to develop exposure conditions to be used in future assessment studies of the environmental quality of sediments inhabited by mud snails. The behavioural response of the snails towards different concentrations of contaminated Halifax Harbour sediments placed in one half of a tank relative to reference sediments in the other half is examined in Part 2 and a chemical link investigated.
   Methods. Animals were exposed in 7 L aquaria at 12 degrees C to their native sediments placed in one or two halves of a tank and the effect due to the presence of a light source, air bubbles, sediment grain size, added algae examined relative to the snails' behaviour. Preference or avoidance of one half of a tank relative to the second half, the immersed or dry glass surface represented the various media to be chosen by snails. After choosing the optimum set up, exposures were performed in triplicate, under slightly differing initial placement of the snails to compare means and variability in the results. Three specific biogenic chemicals, cholesterol, coprostanol and a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) were spiked at 0.002, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25 and 1.2 mg/g, dry weight of sediment. A hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extract of harbour sediment were also spiked in reference sediments. In all cases, the location of the snails was recorded over a period extending up to 96 hrs.
   Results. Twenty snails exposed during a 72 hrs period in commercial 7 L tanks containing 50 g of sediments (wet weight) in the bottom half of a tank filled half way with seawater represented the chosen conditions to test the avoidance/preference behaviour of snails for part of a tank. The presence of additional food on sediments attracted snails within 24 hrs of exposure.
   Discussion. A general lack of preference was indicated in exposures to three biologically derived compounds spiked in reference sediments, i.e. a C-18 FAME, cholesterol and coprostanol. The repelling properties of a harbour sediment extract pointed to a role for non polar chemicals.
   Conclusions. It is proposed that behaviour reflects a balance between the repelling effects of contaminants and the attractive value of food. The present study provides a robust green assessment tool that is easy to set up to assess the quality of sediments.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The interpretation of field observations regarding the abundance of animals during environmental assessments must consider both nutritional and toxicological causes. Additional laboratory exposures are needed to determine which chemicals play a role in the field.

AB  - The toxicity of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) for human health, plants, animals and micro-organisms is well known. Human activities have resulted in the release of Cd into the environment from a variety of sources. Growing concern about the Cd contamination of soils and food-chain transfer of Cd has prompted a particular debate about the impact of Cd from phosphorus (P) fertilisers on human health and the environment. A study was carried out to estimate the impact of Cd in fertilisers on the environment (ecotoxicology) and on human health (toxicology) under German conditions. The risk assessment was performed by applying adopted EU principles on risk assessments of new and existing substances and a related guidance document for Cd. With respect to ecotoxicology the concentration of Cd which is likely to be found in the environment of concern (predicted environmental concentration = PEC) was compared with concentrations below which adverse effects are not expected to occur (predicted no effect concentration = PNEC). If the resulting PEC/PNEC ratio is > 1, there is a risk for adverse effects on the system under consideration. Risk characterisation for human health was carried out by comparing no observed adverse effect levels NOAELs (e.g. tolerable daily Cd intake = TDI) and total Cd uptake and Cd resorption, respectively, by the population. All environmental and human health assessments were carried out for different scenarios including average and "worst case" Cd exposure and Cd dose-response conditions. To characterise the environmental exposure, a calculation of Cd budgets (input/output relation) for agricultural soils revealed an average Cd input surplus from all sources of ca. 7 g ha(-1) a(-1) Cd if fertiliser supply rates were based on average crop fertiliser requirements and on averaged fertilisation recommendations. When calculations were based on the actual total P fertiliser consumption in Germany which is currently lower than based on averaged crop fertiliser requirements, a Cd input surplus from all sources of ca. 3 g ha(-1) a(-1) Cd was obtained. In nearly all scenarios the share of Cd input from mineral fertilisation of the total Cd input was at least ca. 40%. A similar percentage of the total Cd input into soils resulted from atmospheric deposition. Current and predicted Cd soil concentrations (PEC) calculated from the Cd soil balances were compared to available PNEC values for different soil receptors. The resulting PEC/PNEC ratios based on average Cd exposure conditions did not point to an immediate Cd risk for soil biology. For the Cd exposure pathway soil --> plant --> plant/animal foodstuffs --> man, total human Cd uptake and resorption were calculated from food consumption and Cd contents of foodstuffs, respectively. Under average conditions (average eating habits and average Cd content of foodstuffs, non-smoker) the resulting total Cd body burden was already ca. 40 % of the current NOAEL. There was considerable variability in the risk characterisation of Cd impacts from P fertilisers for both the ecotoxicological and the human health assessment when different scenarios of Cd exposure and Cd susceptibility were considered.

AB  - The water balance of the Arctic tundra is shifting as permafrost stability, seasonality, and the ratio of precipitation to evaporation respond to amplified Arctic warming. While in some northern tundra locations there has been a notable increase in the number of water bodies, generally, the tundra landscape has experienced a decline in the number and area of lakes. We analyzed changes in small lake count (<10,000 m(2)), large lake count (>10,000 m(2)), and lake surface area across the periglacial tundra of western Greenland, using historical satellite and aerial imagery and weather data from the late 1960s to present. Overall, we found a decrease in lake count (21%) and surface area (2%) across our study region. Specifically, smaller ponds were particularly prone to change, with decreases of 28% in count and 15% in surface area. Shrinking lakes often became revegetated by both emergent aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, which captures potential successional trajectories following Arctic lake drying. Additionally, while annual precipitation may be increasing, it occurred primarily during the winter months in the form of snow, which may or may not contribute to the overall growing season water budget. Conversely, the peak growing season months of June, July, and August all have experienced significant increases in potential evaporation rates, thus likely creating a water deficit for much of the growing season. These results suggest that a large section of deglaciated Greenland appears likely to become drier in the summer months, which may result in widespread ecological consequences.
   Plain Language Summary Arctic tundra environments may become drier as the climate continues to warm, due to changes in precipitation and evaporation patterns, and losses of permanent ground ice. In many Arctic systems, lakes are widely distributed and thus can serve as an early indicator of drying conditions. We predicted that our study region of west Greenland would be particularly susceptible to drying due to low levels of precipitation and observed warming trends at a rate of approximately 0.5 degrees C per decade. Using historical and modern satellite and aerial imagery, we observed a decrease in the number of small lakes by 28% and a 15% decrease in the total area of smaller water bodies between 1969 and 2017. Additionally, we found that many of the disappeared lakes from 1969 appeared to have become vegetated. An analysis of historical weather data suggested that water losses to the atmosphere via evaporation have likely increased, especially in the summer months, which may be contributing to observed lake decline. Declining small lake area across our study region and other parts of the Arctic can have landscape-wide effects such as changes to available animal habitat, increases in the risk of fire, and to the prevalence of drought conditions.

AB  - The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an environmental tool to evaluate the sustainability of different bioenergy pathways has become a common practice since the European Renewable Energy Directive was published in 2009. In the evaluation of bioenergy produced out from dedicated energy crops, nitrogen fertilizer production and use are commonly identified as the most important contributors to fossil energy consumption and to several environmental impacts categories including Global Warming Potential. In considering the impacts produced by the nitrogen fertilization of energy crops and in addition to the effects of fertilization schemes on the biomass yield, more attention should be paid to the changes in soil nitrogen to know if fertilization doses and application schemes are sufficient enough to maintain soil nitrogen stocks and ensure that soil quality is preserved for future years. To this aim, in this work soil nitrogen balance is used as an indicator to estimate the evolution of soil nitrogen stocks and complement LCA calculations. In this paper, the effects of three nitrogen top fertilization doses (null, 30 and 80 kg NI (hay)) used for rye cultivation are compared when ry is grown as a dedicated energy crop for electricity generation under the Spanish province of Soria conditions. A LCA was carried out using experimental crop testing results and a centralised (25 MWe) straw power plant data in combination with soil nitrogen balance obtained in each of the experimental crop trials. After that, the LCA results were compared with those obtained when electricity is generated from natural gas in Spanish power plants. According to the average calculations, each additional kg N/(ha y) applied in top fertilization produces a reduction of 0.18% on GHG savings with respect to natural gas electricity, as well as a worsening in the energy balance of 0.00084 TJ fossil energy per TJ of electricity generated but reduces soil nitrogen deficit in 0.43 kg N/(ha y). For top fertilization doses of 80 kg N/(ha y) the average GHG savings with respect to natural gas were 63.7% and the average non-renewable energy consumption was 6, 4 times less for the bioenergy system than for natural gas. Fossil energy accounted for more than 95% of total nonrenewable energy in this calculation. This work evidences that determinate biomass growing conditions associated to high GHG savings and improved energy balances may cause detrimental effects for soil fertility due to considerable associated negative soil nitrogen balances. This finding suggests the convenience to include the soil nitrogen balance as a complementary indicator for bioenergy LCA calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under natural conditions beech forest would be the most widespread habitat in Central Europe. Therefore the knowledge of this vegetation type, including the animal communities dwelling there, as well as the mechanisms forming these communities are of high interest for biodiversity research and conservation in Central Europe. However, historically, Central European beech forests were thought to harbor only relatively few species. Here, faunistic data of five beech forest reserves, which were generated as part of the Hessian strict forest reserves program, are analyzed to investigate diversity patterns of Hessian beech forests of low mountain ranges. We focus on species-level data from six organism groups: Aculeata, Araneae, Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Lumbricidae, and Macrolepidoptera. We show that with 2552 forest-dwelling species from these organism groups an unexpectedly high number of species was found in Hessian beech forests, and that a higher species richness can be expected in these groups. Observed species diversity ranges from 1245 to 1556 forest dwelling species in the five individual forest reserves. Overall, 36 % of the forest dwelling species of the considered species groups known from Germany were found with all applied methods in the forest reserves. Different forest reserves share 40-50 % of the species, representing 50-70 % of the species of the individual reserves, indicating high levels of regional and habitat-structure based differentiation. Only 21 % of the species are found in all five reserves. The low percentage of species found in all five reserves is, in addition to differing local conditions, probably a result of the communities being composed of few highly abundant and many rare species, leading to a high percentage of species only found by chance in our surveys. We also observe differences in community heterogeneity among the five reserves. Patterns differ between organism groups, clearly indicating that a focus on single taxa or a single indicator group falls short of revealing meaningful patterns. In spider communities, beta diversity is linked to the spatial distance between traps. In other organism groups community heterogeneity within reserves rather depends on structural heterogeneity. Species richness was associated with percentage of reserve area not covered with the most dominant habitat type, the deadwood amount, and with survey year. Being the potential natural vegetation of Germany and considering the unexpectedly high diversity of their associated fauna, beech forests bear a great conservation value. However, their widespread occurrence and dominance is likely to push them out of focus of conservation efforts. Yet protecting diverse and richly structured beech forests can contribute greatly to preserving the native arthropod fauna and should play a central role in biodiversity conservation efforts in Central Europe.

AB  - The work examines the timing and environmental conditions of floodplain sedimentation in the valleys of the upland Klodnica and piedmont Osobloga rivers in the Upper Odra River basin. A distribution of 52 C-14-ages shows relatively high floodplain sedimentation at the Late Glacial-Holocene transition, more stable floodplain environments since the Early (in the Klodnica Valley) and Middle Holocene (in the Osobloga Valley) and a gradual increase in floodplain deposition in the Late Holocene (since <3.4 kyr BP). Organic matter [OM] and mineral matter [MM] fluctuations were correlated with variables responsible for the activation of erosion (i.e. vegetation changes, human impact and hydrological events) as well as factors affecting the local record of sedimentation (i.e. valley morphology, hydrologic conditions and episodes of local erosion). A clear relationship is shown between an increase in alluviation and climate- or human-induced extension of unforested areas. The deposition of mineral-rich sediments increases rapidly during periods characterized by non-arboreal pollen values exceeding approximately 8% in pollen diagrams. On the other hand, the results obtained do not confirm significant interactions between Holocene changes in forest composition and alluviation. Despite the settlement of agrarian groups, the sedimentary record of human activity in the Osobloga catchment is very poor during the Neolithic and early Bronze Age. A large-scale alluviation of the Osobloga and Klodnica valleys was initiated during the settlement of people of the Lusatian culture from the middle Bronze Age and escalated in the early Middle Ages and Modern Times. The deposition of products of soil erosion was limited to between ca. 1.9-1.2 kyr BP, probably due to demographic regression during the Migration Period. Comparison of OM/MM fluctuations with phases of increased fluvial activity does not show a relationship between Holocene wetter phases and catchment sediment yield. Sedimentary episodes in the Upper Odra basin also show a low degree of correlation with the probability density curve of the C-14-ages. The results obtained in the Klodnica and Osobloga valleys indicate a strong to moderate correlation between the spatial distribution of the study sites and the origin of MM-rich deposits, but a weak correlation between the spatial distribution of the study sites and TOC content. Such a pattern suggests that OM/MM fluctuations relate predominantly to the changes in sediment yield, although morphological conditions have a significant impact on the capture potential of sedimentary basins during phases of alluviation. Additionally, high OM content is not a simple function of an increase in wetness of the sedimentary environment. On the other hand, hydrologically-conditioned hiatuses as well as erosion episodes impoverish the sedimentary record, complicating the consideration on the geochronology of deposits and making it difficult to calculate reliable accumulation rates. However, they do not reduce the value of OM/MM fluctuations as an indicator of alluviation events for a preserved series of sediments. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the analysis of documentary materials from the funds of the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia, the problem of water use and water supply in terms of a nomadic way of management is first examined on the example of the Kalmyk steppe in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The problem of water use and water supply in history has been urgent for nomads, including Kalmyk cattle breeders. For a long time, Kalmykia belonged to the driest area in the south of Russia, and the problem of water supply was always relevant for it. The use of water resources was particularly specific for steppe pastoralists. As is well known, all their life activity in the semi-desert and desert Kalmyk steppes was inscribed in the system of surface sources of fresh water, on the one hand. On the other hand, their entire life process in the summer took place near dug hoods (well-shaped pits) and artesian wells. Kalmykia, both in the natural climatic and economic terms, had its own dissimilarity, which distinguished it from all other provinces of the Russian Empire. In the area, the average annual air temperature is up to +10 degrees C, the frost-free period is long (on average, 170-180 days a year), and rain in the summer period is scarce (average rainfall is from 180 to 350 mm). The main feature of the climate in the area is its sharp continentality: hot and dry summers with frequent droughts and dry winds, long dry autumns, cold winters with thaws and little snow, and, finally, short springs. These characteristic features of the natural environment, the harsh natural conditions, had a direct impact on the formation of Kalmyk nomads' attentive and reverent attitude to natural resources. The Kalmyks have a centuries-old appreciative attitude to nature, especially to water resources. Living in harsh climatic conditions, the nomads thoroughly guarded their steppe, and, rationally and carefully using their water sources, they sometimes did not allow other khotons to use drinking water from their well (khuduk). In the course of the study, the author classified the water sources of the Kalmyk steppe and made mathematical calculations on the water supply of livestock in the Kalmyk farms of Maloderbetovsky Ulus without taking into account natural reservoirs (lakes, ponds, estuaries, dams). The author proved that the authorities actively supported the initiative of the Kalmyk nomads who sought to reconstruct the old and develop new water bodies on their own. Based on specific material, the author illustrated attempts to solve the problem of water supply by the authorities and the forces of initiative nomadic population in the Kalmyk steppe, one of the most arid regions of the Russian Empire. In general, the author characterized the policy of the imperial authorities in this aspect as half measures.

Comparative and factor methods make it possible to cover the peculiarities of institutional environment of the formation of fiscal policy in EU countries and Ukraine in the context of the development of the institutional budget architectonics and to identify ways for its improvement. Methodology. Substantiation of the role of fiscal policy in terms of the development of institutional budget architectonics, determination of its strategic orientations are based on generalization and systematization of experience of advanced and transition economies. For this very reason, the authors analyse and assess the fiscal policy and define special aspects of the formation and implementation of its components in relevant countries. Results show that to increase the effectiveness of the fiscal policy, it is expedient to ensure its interrelation with other components of financial policy based on a combination of fiscal and motivation function. Effective institutional budget architectonics provides means for creating conditions for sustainable economic growth, achieving strategic goals of socio-economic development of the country. Significant tasks of the development of institutional budget architectonics are regulation of the ratio between direct and indirect tax revenues, the structure of budget expenditures in terms of functional, economic classifications, maintaining the budget gap and public debt at the level that contributes to the financial and economic stability of the country, taking into account economic cyclical nature. Practical implications. A feasible budget architectonics would facilitate the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic growth. It is expedient to carry out institutional changes of budget architectonics on the ground of dynamic interconnection of budget and macroeconomic indicators. Value/originality. Fiscal policy plays a significant part in the process of government regulation of socio-economic development of the country. Elaboration of fiscal policy approaches in the context of the development of institutional budget architectonics is an important prerequisite for improving the quality of budget planning, ensuring the strength, stability and dynamic balance of the budget system. It is advantageous to introduce adaptive institutional changes into the budget architectonics in order to accelerate economic growth. Therefore, the article covers the essence and role of institutional budget architectonics aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, accelerating economic growth, developing human potential, improving public welfare; it defines the approaches to its development in transition and advanced economies. The authors establish that effective fiscal policy based on feasible institutional budget architectonics provides means for creating conditions for sustainable economic growth, achieving strategic goals of socio-economic development of the country.

AB  - In Central Europe, management of forests for multiple ecosystem services (ES) has a long tradition and is currently drawing much attention due to increasing interest in non-timber services. In face of a changing climate and diverse ES portfolios, a key issue for forest managers is to assess vulnerability of ES provisioning. In a case study catchment of 250 ha in the Eastern Alps, the currently practiced uneven-aged management regime (BAU; business as usual) which is based on irregularly shaped patch cuts along skyline corridors was analysed under historic climate (represented by the period 1961-1990) and five transient climate change scenarios (period 2010-2110) and compared to an unmanaged scenario (NOM). The study addressed (1) the future provisioning of timber, carbon sequestration, protection against gravitational hazards, and nature conservation values under BAU management, (2) the effect of spatial scale (1, 5, 10 ha grain size) in mapping ES indicators and (3) how the spatial scale of ES assessment affects the simultaneous provision of several ES (i.e. multifunctionality). The analysis employed the PICUS forest simulation model in combination with novel landscape assessment tools. In BAU management, timber harvests were smaller than periodic increments. The resulting increase in standing stock benefitted carbon sequestration. In four out of five climate change scenarios, volume increment was increasing. With the exception of the mildest climate change scenario (+2.6 A degrees C, no change in precipitation), all other analysed climate change scenarios reduced standing tree volume, carbon pools and number of large old trees, and increased standing deadwood volume due to an intensifying bark beetle disturbance regime. However, increases in deadwood and patchy canopy openings benefitted bird habitat quality. Under historic climate, the NOM regime showed better performance in all non-timber ES. Under climate change conditions, the damages from bark beetle disturbances increased more in NOM compared with BAU. Despite favourable temperature conditions in climate change scenarios, the share of admixed broadleaved species was not increasing in BAU management, mainly due to the heavy browsing pressure by ungulates. In NOM, it even decreased and mean tree age increased. Thus, in the long run NOM may enter a phase of lower resilience compared with BAU. Most ES indicators were fairly insensitive to the spatial scale of indicator mapping. ES indicators that were based on sparse tree and stand attributes such as rare admixed tree species, large snags and live trees achieved better results when mapped at larger scales. The share of landscape area with simultaneous provisioning of ES at reasonable performance levels (i.e. multifunctionality) decreased with increasing number of considered ES, while it increased with increasing spatial scale of the assessment. In the case study, landscape between 53 and 100 % was classified as multifunctional, depending on number and combinations of ES.

AB  - In the system of global information space, it is important to adequately calculate and assess the factors of successful functioning of the banking system, which are directly the engines of the country's development, economic stability, especially from the standpoint of qualitative measurement of innovative technology and human capital in rapid cyber fraud. The work is devoted to studying factors that describe the components of efficiency and potential use of innovative technologies in neo-banking in 90 countries to determine the level of risk of their use for money laundering based on gravitational modeling methodology. The authors substantiated that using four factors consisting of 13 components of digital evolution is expedient. Three indicators (access infrastructure, transaction infrastructure, and fulfillment infrastructure) allowed forming the supply condition factor. It provides a score on developing digital and physical infrastructure to ensure the digital economic system's quality. The "demand conditions" factor consists of 4 indicators (human quality level, device absorption level and digital broadband level, digital payment absorption), which show how much consumers are willing and able to participate in the digital economic system and whether they have the tools and skills needed to connect to the digital economy. Three indicators (institutional effectiveness and trust, institutions and the business environment, institutions and the digital ecosystem) shaped the "institutional environment" factor. It relates to research on countries' support for digital legislation, governments' investment in digitalization, and regulations. Regulate the quality of storage and access to digital data. The fourth factor of "innovation and change" consists of three features that characterize the state of key innovative economic system inputs (talents and capital), processes (i.e., cooperation between universities and industry), and outputs (i.e., new scalable digital products and services). The generalized indicator was formed based on these indicators. It characterizes the degree of risk of using the services of neobanks of the studied countries by economic agents or individuals to legalize criminal proceeds. At the first stage of the proposed method, the authors substantiated the statistical significance and possibility of using the studied indicators. The procedure of logarithmic normalization was carried out. The toolkit of descriptive statistics of the Statgaphics Centurion package provided the normalization parameters. In the second stage, the indicators were collapsed using a geometric weighted average, which provides meaningful information about the average dynamics rate. The third stage provided calculating the value of the integrated rating assessment of the degree of risk of using innovative technologies, services, and neobanking services for money laundering based on gravity modeling methods. The findings showed that 12.22% of the studied countries had a high degree of risk, 25.56% - a medium level of risk, 25.56% - a risk below the average level, for 36.66% of countries - the risk was almost absent.

AB  - The vast majority of European grasslands strongly depend on the regular removal of aboveground biomass by agricultural land use, mostly grazing or mowing or a combination of both. These specific management schemes have strong influence on plant diversity and vegetation composition, depending on their particular characteristics and their intensity. For example, the presence or absence of fertilization will favour some species over others, changing plant communities accordingly. Additionally, the farmer's choice of a specific management scheme will also depend on the abiotic site conditions. This leads to a complex set of associated factors potentially affecting the structure and diversity of grasslands.
   In this study, we compiled a unique dataset of 169 differently managed grasslands (in total 202 plots), which were sampled in five regions across Germany. For each plot, we documented management characteristics, measured plant diversity and functional group composition, recorded endangered species according to red lists, and calculated Ellenberg indicator values. We assessed patterns in vegetation composition and diversity in relation to the particular management scheme, which was categorized as meadow, meadow with autumn or winter grazing (with mowing as predominant management), mown pasture (where mowing and grazing are used at roughly equal intensity), seasonal pasture (with grazing as predominant management) and year-round pasture.
   Our study showed that grasslands of different management schemes significantly differed in diversity, structure and functional composition. However, it also became obvious that vegetation composition was not strictly distinguished by management alone. Local and regional characteristics such as soil conditions, size of the grassland species pool or land-use history, often played a more prominent role than land use alone. Assumingly, the interplay of those local and regional characteristics with the pro portion of grazing and mowing at a particular site inhibit clear differences among our predefined management schemes. Nevertheless, species richness was the lowest in year-round pastures, moderate in meadows and highest in seasonal pastures. In contrast, year-round pastures harboured the highest mean numbers of endangered species. The dependency of a certain management scheme on site-specific environmental factors such as soil fertility, further complicated the clear separation of management effects from those of the environmental background.
   In summary, modern grassland management strongly shaped grassland vegetation, but today's combination of different management practices complicated the assessment of specific land-use effects on plant diversity. Thus, neither mowing nor grazing turned out to be "the one and only" management for nature conservation. Although our results challenge long-term prognoses for future vegetation development under modern grassland management, we clearly showed that low-intensity management and the absence of fertilization promoted plant diversity, with higher values in pastures compared to meadows and mown pastures.

AB  - Background: The main challenge in raising cattle in Brazil is related to ectoparasites, that cause negative effects on milk and meat production, and in severe cases, animal death. Sheds known as creches attracts large number insects mainly due to milk residues in the environment. The housefly is a major problem due to act as vectors of many other diseases, and so there is the possibility of control of infestations with natural products. Andiroba and copaiba oils may act as natural biocides, there are only a few studies on their effect on biological soil parameters. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the repellent effect of andiroba and copaiba oils against flies and on biological soil parameters.
   Materials, Methods & Results: The repellency effect of oils of andiroba and copaiba was tested at a concentration of 5% in lambs shed maternity, containing 64 bays (1.8 m(2)). It was sprayed 30 mL per pen, where they were housed five lambs each. Pre-treatment counts were taken before the treatment (mean 46 per pen after Musca domestica), and post-treatment count was made on 2, 24 and 48 h. The data collected at 2 and 24 h was evaluated and the number of flies was reduced significantly (P < 0.001) in the pens treated with oil of copaiba and andiroba compared to control (untreated) pen. After 48 h, no difference was observed between treatments in relation to fly numbers (P > 0.05). Ecotoxicological test using increasing concentrations in the soil (0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) regarding changes in basal respiration (C-CO2), and survival and reproduction of springtails (Folsomia candida). It was observed an increased amount of mineralized C-CO2 until the day 10 of incubation for both oils without inhibition of the microbial respiratory process in any dose. The copaiba oil showed higher amounts of accumulated C-CO2 compared to andiroba oil in all studied concentrations (P < 0.05). In tests with mesofauna organisms, none of the evaluated concentrations of the two oils showed no negative effect on the survival of springtails (P > 0.05), the same was observed for the reproduction results, where there was no reduction in the number of juveniles (P > 0.05).
   Discussion: According literature, andiroba and copaiba oils have repellent effect against domestic fly when sprayed onto infected cow's horn fly, similar results also were reported in vitro tests against M. domestica larvae using andiroba oil and noted 80% larval mortality. The use of natural products in disease control is growing, but its impacts on the environment are not known, so in addition to suggesting therapies it is important to be concerned with ecotoxicological tests. Researchers showed an effect of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil on F. candida and reported 76% reduction in its survival rate at concentration of 60 mg/kg soil. Basal soil respiration is a sensitive indicator that quickly reveals changes in the environmental conditions that affect microbial activity, and the data presented herein reveal an increase in the respiration of microorganisms depending on the amount of oil added to the soil. The essential oils of copaiba and andiroba have repellent effect against Musca domestica, and did not show any toxicity to inhibit microbial activity in the soil. In addition, the presence of the oils in the soil did not affect the survival and reproduction of springtails Folsomia candida.

AB  - Over 1999-2002, an extensive series of contaminant studies was conducted on freshwater biota of Canada's Arctic and Subarctic regions. The majority of inorganic contaminant studies focused on mercury and fish. While mercury concentrations were low in benthic feeding fish such as whitefish, predatory fish such as lake trout, pike, and walleye frequently had mercury levels which exceeded 0.2 mu g/g, the consumption guideline for frequent consumers of fish, and 0.5 mu g/g, the guideline for the commercial use of fish. Numerous consumption advisories were issued for lakes along the Mackenzie River. Relatively high mercury levels appear to be due to a combination of relatively old fish populations (because of light fishing pressures) and tend to be more prevalent in smaller lakes where warmer summer water temperatures and watershed influences result in greater mercury and methyl mercury inputs. Mercury levels were substantially lower in char than in lake trout, possibly due to a combination of a less fish-rich diet, a colder environment, and smaller MeHg watershed inputs. Less research has been conducted on other metals but some, such as rubidium, show pronounced variations in concentration that may be related to geological influences. Temporal trend monitoring has revealed little evidence of declining mercury levels in fish that can be attributed to declining atmospheric inputs. Because mercury follows complex pathways in the environment, other factors may operate to counteract reductions in atmospheric mercury sources, e.g., climatic variability, changes in the commercial fishery, and interactions between fish species.
   Most organochlorine (OC) investigations were based on long term trend monitoring and focused on char (Cornwallis Island), burbot (Great Slave Lake, Yukon lakes, Slave River at Fort Smith, Mackenzie River at Fort Good Hope) and lake trout (Yukon lakes, Great Slave Lake). There was strong evidence of declining OC concentrations in char, particularly Sigma HCH and Sigma chlordane, which may reflect a response to declining atmospheric inputs. Endosulfan concentrations increased, as in the atmosphere. There also was evidence of declining OC concentrations in burbot in the Slave and Mackenzie rivers but not in Great Slave Lake and Yukon lakes. OC concentrations decreased in lake trout in Yukon lakes in the 2000s, most probably because of changes in the fish themselves (i.e., reduced lipid content, condition factor) and possibly climatic variability. Similarly, OCs declined in Great Slave Lake trout. New research on PDBEs and perfluorinated compounds determined that these contaminants are widespread in freshwater fish and concentrations may be increasing.
   Global warming is a major issue of concern for Arctic and Subarctic waters and may have adverse impacts on contaminant levels in fish and other biota. There is a need for contaminant studies in the north to be broadened to investigate climatic effects. In addition, monitoring studies should be broadened to consider factors affecting other aspects of fish biology. Foremost among these is integrating contaminant monitoring studies on lakes such as Lake Laberge and Great Slave Lake with stock assessment studies. Ecosystem based studies should be conducted on Great Slave Lake and Lake Laberge to more effectively understand contaminant trends and should consider inputs (atmospheric, river inflow, resupension), losses (sedimentation, volatilization), and biological pathways.

AB  - Although facies models of braided, meandering and anastomosing rivers have provided the cornerstones of fluvial sedimentology for several decades, the depositional processes and external controls on sheetflow fluvial systems remain poorly understood. Sheetflow fluvial systems represent a volumetrically significant part of the non-marine sedimentary record and documented here are the lithofacies, depositional processes and possible roles of rapid subsidence and arid climate in generating a sheetflow-dominated fluvial system in the Cenozoic hinterland of the central Andes. A 6500 m thick succession comprising the Late Eocene-Oligocene Potoco Formation is exposed continuously for > 100 km along the eastern limb of the Corque syncline in the high Altiplano plateau of Bolivia. Fluvial sandstone and mudstone units were deposited over an extensive region (> 10 000 km(2)) with remarkably few incised channels or stacked-channel complexes. The Potoco succession provides an exceptional example of rapid production of accommodation sustained over a prolonged period of time in a non-marine setting (> 0.45 mm year(-1) for 14 Myr). The lower approximate to 4000 m of the succession coarsens upward and consists of fine-grained to medium-grained sandstone, mudstone and gypsum deposits with palaeocurrent indicators demonstrating eastward transport. The upper 2500 m also coarsens upward, but contains mostly fine-grained to medium-grained sandstone that exhibits westward palaeoflow.
   Three facies associations were identified from the Potoco Formation and are interpreted to represent different depositional environments in a sheetflow-dominated system. (i) Playa lake deposits confined to the lower 750 m are composed of interbedded gypsum, gypsiferous mudstone and sandstone. (ii) Floodplain deposits occur throughout the succession and include laterally extensive (> 200 m) laminated to massive mudstone and horizontally stratified and ripple cross-stratified sandstone. Pedogenic alteration and root casts are common. (iii) Poorly confined channel and unconfined sheet sandstone deposits include laterally continuous beds (50 to > 200 m) that are defined primarily by horizontally stratified and ripple cross-stratified sandstone encased in mudstone-rich floodplain deposits.
   The ubiquitous thin-sheet geometry and spatial distribution of individual facies within channel sandstone and floodplain deposits suggest that confined to unconfined, episodic (flash) flood events were the primary mode of deposition. The laterally extensive deposition and possible distributary nature of this sheetflow-dominated system are attributed to fluvial fan conditions in an arid to semi-arid, possibly seasonal, environment. High rates of sediment accumulation and tectonic subsidence during early Andean orogenesis may have favoured the development and long-term maintenance of a sheetflow system rather than a braided, meandering or anastomosing fluvial style. It is suggested here that rapidly produced accommodation space and a relatively arid, seasonal climate are critical conditions promoting the generation of sheetflow-dominated fluvial systems.

AB  - Bats today face a number of important threats, including that of heavy metal exposure. While the numerous adverse health effects of heavy metals have long been documented, exposure to heavy metal pollution continues, and is even increasing in some parts of the world. The eleven heavy metal elements of highest wildlife protection concern are arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, tin and thallium. This paper reviews 52 studies reporting on heavy metal concentrations in bats, their organs and guano, and aims to provide an overview of heavy metal research on wild bat populations, and particularly its temporal, geographic, methodological and biological aspects. The published data are biased both temporally and spatially, with the greatest number of articles published over the last decade. While most studies reporting on heavy metal contamination have come from North America and Europe, these are generally restricted to one or two reports per country/state. General trend analysis of heavy metal content in bats is not possible due to variation in the data and the analysis of stratigraphically dated guano deposits provides inconsistent results. Moreover, variability in heavy metal content observed in bat bodies is influenced by background levels and a direct comparison of results between geographically distant areas is, therefore problematic. Comparison of contaminated and reference localities at a regional scale is useful and is regularly used. From a methodological point of view, the determination of heavy metal concentration in tissues may be limited by the typically small sample sizes available. Heavy metals have been analyzed in a range of matrices, with the four most sampled types (liver, kidney, whole body/carcass and guano) and the actual number of compounds analyzed gradually increasing over time as more sophisticated and precise instrumentation are developed. Non-lethal sampling methods are increasingly used for monitoring as these have minimal impact on threatened and highly protected animals. In total, heavy metal content has been studied in 65 bat species, though the species, sex, age, year of collection and locality varies widely with no clear pattern. Only four species (big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus, gray bat Myotis grisescens, greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis and common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus sensu lato) have been analyzed more than five times, and only five heavy metals (cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc) have been measured in fructivorous/nectarivorous species. Insectivorous bats have lower mean contaminant values in tissues than both fructivorous/nectarivorous species and guano. While exposure pathway may have influenced differences between the various food guilds, lowered bioavailability of heavy metals from digested food displaying lower bioaccumulation factors may account for differences observed between guano and other types of samples.
   While the number of articles confirming direct adverse effects and toxicity of heavy metals on bats is low some impacts and poisoning cases have been documented, including hepatopathy, DNA damage, hemochromatosis, renal inclusion bodies, ascending paralysis, and changes in cholinergic functions. Moreover, results suggest that the effects of chronic sub-lethal exposure to heavy metal contamination may be a more important threat to bat populations as bats under natural environmental conditions are frequently exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors at the same time. One of the main challenges facing bat ecotoxicology today is the preparation of standardized monitoring programs using modern analytical technologies that offer more precise data on heavy metal contamination.

AB  - The effectiveness and accuracy of biomonitoring programs, based on benthic macroinvertebrates, is strictly related to the sampling design and effort, whereas the feasibility depends on the economic sustainability of sample collection and processing methodologies. In the last decade, how to improve the Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (RBPs) maintaining the accuracy of the results has been a topic recurrently debated among researchers. It is well known that the sample unit size (i.e., surface of the sampled area, SUS) and the sieve mesh size (SMS), selected to collect and to retain benthic macroinvertebrates from soft-bottom samples, may affect the evaluation of the aquatic ecosystem ecological status; however, studies analyzing the combined influence of SUS and SMS on assessment tools are lacking, in particular for transitional water ecosystems. Even if the Water Framework Directive (WFD) suggests rapid and cost-effectiveness sampling effort and procedures, the identification of optimal SUS and SMS is a basic step to improve the RBPs and to meet WFD suggestions. Therefore, this research analyses the effects of four soft-bottom sample unit sizes (0.0225 m(2), 0.0450 m(2), 0.0675 m(2), 0.0900 m(2)), and three sieve mesh sizes (4 mm(2), I mm(2), 0.25 mm(2)) on the selection of benthic macroinvertebrates and, thus, on assessment tools, in a Mediterranean lagoon. A sampling survey was performed in September 2009 at a perturbed and an unperturbed study site in the Lesina lagoon (SE Italian coastline); three replicates were taken for each SUS and SMS using an Ekman-Birge grab (15 cm x 15 cm). The samples were sieved on a column of three sieves, with decreasing mesh size. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sorted, identified, measured, weighted and included in twelve datasets (4 SUS x 3 SMS). Sampling effort (SE) was calculated for each SUS and SMS combination as: SE = [SUS m(2) x (1/SMS mm(2))] x 100. Four simple community descriptors (numerical density, taxonomic richness, biomass density, individual body-size) and four ecological indicators (AMBI, BENTIX, BITS, M-AMBI) were compared for each combination of SUS and SMS in both study sites. Simple community descriptors and ecological indicators varied significantly between perturbed and unperturbed study site. The results showed that SMS had significant effects on simple community descriptors and ecological indicators, except for BITS index. Conversely, no significant differences were observed for different SUS analyzing simple community descriptors and ecological indicators, except for taxonomic richness and M-AMBI index. The response of the ecological indicators was only slightly affected by the SMS, whereas SUS choice did not influence the ecological status assessment. Anyway, using the larger SMS (4 mm(2)), all ecological indicators showed either the same ecological quality status as the 1 mm(2) and 0.25 mm(2) SMS or, in some cases, one class higher, except for the AMBI index.

AB  - The use of species traits to characterize the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities has become well established in the ecological literature. This approach holds much potential for predicting changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We created a new database on species-trait composition of North American lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4 broad categories: life-history morphological, mobility, and ecological. First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple environmental gradients.

AB  - The gordiids are freshwater representatives of the parasite phylum Nematomorpha that function as a link between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In recent years, different ecotoxicologic studies have been made with the South-American gordiid species, Chordodes nobilii, that have demonstrated the capacity of this group to act as a bioindicator of contamination. Despite the Gordiida ' s ecologic relevance, further studies are still needed to elucidate different aspects of the biology of the class, and among those, the infective capacity, a parameter that can be evaluated by the infection index mean abundance (IIMA). A knowledge of the intrinsic variability in the infective capacity of C. nobilii would warrant priority in order to establish, the range of acceptable responses for normal or standard conditions in the laboratory, and, to compare the criteria among different assays. The objective of this study was to establish a baseline value for the infective capacity for C. nobilii larvae, under controlled laboratory conditions, by employing the IIMA as the evaluation parameter. To that end, we analyzed the infective capacity of C. nobilii larvae that had hatched from different strings of eggs laid in the laboratory by a total of 12 females. The C. nobilii adults were collected from streams within the Argentina Sauce Grande basin, between 2006 and 2009. Once in the laboratory, after mating, the females were placed in individual containers for oviposition. The egg strings obtained from each female were cut in 3 mm long segments; and when free larvae were observed, the segments (N= 90) were placed together with 30 Aedes aegypti larvae for evaluation of the gordiids ' infective capacity. After 72 h, the mosquito larvae were observed by microscopy in order to quantify the C. nobilii larvae in body cavities. The IIMAs were calculated as the total number of C. nobilii larvae present divided by total number of A. aegypti larvae examined. For analysis of the IIMAs obtained, the data were grouped according to the female who made the original ovoposition. Our results enabled the corroboration of an ample range of responses in the infective capacity of this species, a characteristic that would normally be linked to the progenitors originating the hatch. Because this relationship prevents the establishment of a baseline for making comparisons among assays with gordiids, through the IIMA as a response parameter, we recommend expressing the IIMA values in each assay relative to their respective controls. These findings also provide evidence for the greater success in infections by certain members of the progeny over others. Finally, on the basis of the results obtained from this study, we stress the relevance of the use of the IIMA as a decisive aspect to be considered in different studies on the biology of Gordiida.

AB  - Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet's crocodile) and Crocodylus acutus (American crocodile) are generalist, apex predators of subtropical aquatic habitats in Central America. As top predators, crocodiles may be exposed to high levels of micro pollutants, such as trace elements via bioaccumulation that enter the food web as a consequence of human activities. As such, the status of their population can be considered indicative of that of the entire ecosystem - i.e., crocodiles constitute as genuine indicator species. In this study, we report on the concentrations of trace elements found in the caudal scutes of 178 specimens of C. acutus and C. moreletii from Belize. Our objectives were three-fold: (1) to assess variation in trace element concentration between species, sexes, age classes and body index; (2) to identify areas with elevated exposure to trace elements by comparing concentrations in the scutes of crocodiles at various sites in Belize; and (3) to explore links between crocodile trace element load and local land use. All elements tested (Hg, Pb, Cd, As, Cu, Zn, Co) could be detected in at least some scutes. Many of the readings of As and Co were under or close to the detection limit and were not further analyzed. Relatively high Hg concentrations were observed in adults from Chiquibul Forest (median 3.170 mu g/g) and Ambergris Caye (0.834 mu g/g). Concentrations of Hg and Pb tended to be higher in adult animals than in juveniles, especially in C. acutus. On the other hand, concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn were higher in juveniles than in subadult adult animals. Concentrations of Cu were higher in C. acutus than in C. moreletii, but otherwise no species-effects were found for the other trace elements. We found a negative correlation between Hg and Zn concentrations; correlations among Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn concentrations tended to be positive. In both juveniles and adults, animals with high concentrations of Zn had lower body-indices (a proxy for physiological condition). None of the other element concentrations correlated with the body-index. Specimens of C. acutus were more often sampled at coastal sites, while C. moreletii sampling points were typically closer to agricultural or forested areas. A canonical correlation analysis revealed a significant association between trace element load and habitat characteristics. Animals sampled inland, near submontane forests, contained higher levels of Hg, while animals sampled near agricultural, urban or lowland habitats tended to have higher concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn. This study identifies the most prevalent trace element concentrations impacting Belizean watersheds while highlighting the exposure risk to non-essential trace elements in less-urbanised areas or protected areas.

AB  - Palaeogeographic interpretation of the sedimentary rock record depends on correct recognition from the preserved evidence of the processes responsible for transporting and depositing the sediment. This in turn depends on robust knowledge transfer from previous workers, and the successful exchange of ideas between workers requires consistent use of a well-defined vocabulary. We have identified serious breakdowns in all these interpretation steps in the case of terrestrial unconfined flow and its deposits, and these failures are leading to unreliable environmental and climatic interpretation. This is significant because such alluvial deposits commonly form a majority of the rock record of continental environments.
   Working from the basic principles of geomorphology and fluid dynamics, we have undertaken a wide-ranging analysis of the nature of out-of-channel flow and from this make predictions about the characteristics of its deposits. We identify the range of possible locations and conditions that lead to the development of unconfined flow, review the processes operating in each case, and examine the range of lithological features that can be produced by these processes. This allows us to evaluate the reliability of the criteria claimed for identification of out-of-channel flow deposits, and examine how our new insights might alter palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic reconstructions published previously by others.
   The sedimentary record of unconfined flows is much more diverse and complex than usually portrayed. The received wisdom that the record of unconfined flow consists solely of upwards-fining thin beds produced from shallow waning flows is shown to be flawed. A wide range of lithofacies are possible, and the variation in both flow steadiness and uniformity needs to be taken into account. The previously published criteria for recognition of flows of this type are not diagnostic of process or location; unconfined flow deposits cannot reliably be identified from grain size or bed thickness. Similar lithofacies may develop in a wide range of geomorphic and climatic settings because the deposits solely reflect the local flow conditions and sediment availability. We recommend that the terms 'sandflat' and 'sheetflood' should not be used in sedimentological accounts because there is no longer a safe informal usage for either; contradictory application of these terms, and lack of robust definitions, is leading to significant misunderstanding of palaeogeography and process.
   Our analysis should improve reconstruction of past terrestrial environments because it reveals more clearly the true variety of possibilities for the occurrence of unconfined flow and the resultant deposits. Enhanced understanding of the inherent uncertainties, and realisation of the wider range of plausible alternative explanations, should help resolve apparent contradictions with independent indicators of climate or geographic position.

Some of the ideas about the character of flow and sedimentation on floodplains benefited from discussions that took place more than a decade ago between CPN and Martijn Boering, who also kindly supplied the images for Fig. 6. We thank reviewers Katherine Amos and Chris Fielding, and Editor Andrew Miall, for taking the time to plough through an earlier version and make numerous constructive suggestions that greatly improved this article. Reader and author alike benefit from quality peer review, and the process is absolutely central to the scientific method, yet it is usually not given adequate recognition and support by industrial or academic management. We, however, are extremely appreciative!

AB  - A multifactorial approach using environmental, performance, health and welfare parameters was used to investigate the numerous associations of ventilation throughout three consecutive fattening batches (08/2015 to 12/2016) in a farrow-to-finish commercial pig farm in Belgium. Two fattening pig units were used, unit A (1256 pigs) with mechanical ventilation and unit B (1264 pigs) with natural ventilation. Animal genetics, nutrition, stocking density and health management were the same for both units. Key environmental indicators were monitored in real-time (temperature, humidity, CO2 and NH3) and the daily prevalence of respiratory disease cases was recorded to monitor the temporal expression of disease over time within a farm environment. The welfare status of the animals was assessed twice per production round (batch) with a simplified version of the Welfare quality (R) protocol. Serological tests for the most prevalent respiratory infectious agents (Mycoplasma hyopneumonniae, swine influenza virus (subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-2-9-11 and porcine circovirus type 2) were performed during the first, second and final third of each fattening period. Finally, key performance parameters were calculated (average daily growth, feed conversion ratio) and upon slaughter lungs from pigs from unit A (n: 782) and from unit B (n: 544) were assessed for the presence of lung lesions, pleurisy and fissures. To identify the associations of ventilation on the aforementioned parameters, statistical models were run that also included other factors (when applicable) namely production batch, season, age and sampling.
   Overall, the use of natural ventilation was associated with a less optimal environment with regards to thermal comfort (p < 0.001), CO2 (p < 0.001) and NH3 (p < 0.001). A higher daily prevalence of respiratory disease cases was seen in the naturally-ventilated unit (p < 0.001). Concerning the sem-prevalence of the infectious agents tested, the odds to have a positive H1N1 sample were 3.17 higher in the naturally-ventilated unit (p = 0.003). From the visual assessment of the lungs no statistically significant associations were seen between ventilation type and the presence of lesions, fissures or pleuritis. Yet, the lung lesion score was expected to be lower in the naturally-ventilated unit (p = 0.010). Regarding performance parameters, feed conversion ratio and average daily gain were overall better in the mechanically-ventilated unit (descriptive results). Finally, a better welfare score was seen in the mechanically-ventilated unit in all three production batches (descriptive results).
   In conclusion, the mechanically-ventilated farm was associated with better environmental conditions for the fattening pigs. Yet, further research is needed to reach definite causal claims.

AB  - The Zingel asper or apron is one of Europe's most threatened freshwater fish (classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN). It is also listed in appendices II and IV of the European Habitats Directive (1992) and in appendices H and III of the Berne Convention (1979). The geographical distribution of this percid, endemic to the Rhone basin, is extremely limited, making it particularly vulnerable. Since 2005, the Besancon Natural History Museum has been involved in conservation programmes (LIFE Apron Il and a national action plan) to improve the knowledge on its ex situ reproduction, the aim being to produce individuals with which to conduct experimental studies (toxicity tests, design of fish passes, etc.), carry out public presentations (aquariums, nature reserves, etc.) and implement pilot reintroduction schemes, without having to systematically take samples from the natural environment. Innovative devices were designed in the Besancon Citadelle Aquarium to enable replication of complete reproduction cycles in artificial conditions. Control of thermal and zootechnical parameters associated with the development of "artificial spawning grounds" have allowed us to understand the different phases involved in reproducing and maintaining this species in captivity. We were able to observe numerous behaviours, which have never been seen in natural environments, in particular during spawning and early life stage development phases. Several experiments were conducted to study how hatching rates varied according to the duration of the winter cold period, known as "vernalization", applied to broodstock. Hatching rates in the order of 80% were obtained with broodstock subjected to a cold period of 120 days at 5 degrees C, from the beginning of November to the end of February. In contrast, hatching rates dropped rapidly for groups of broodstock subjected to vernalization periods of less than 90 days, and with a cold period of only 30 days, the eggs deteriorated before hatching. A precise annual thermal cycle has therefore been identified, corresponding to the different life phases of Z. asper in captivity. A particular focus of our work was on breeding of fry to ensure that they achieve survival rates in the order of 80% during the first month, and 90% the following month. The results of these experiments have supported other studies and more than 26,000 juveniles have been released into the DrOme River. Regular genetic monitoring of this reintroduced population has allowed us to ensure that they are reproducing naturally. Z. asper born in captivity are also widely used in initiatives to raise public awareness (exhibitions, etc.). To date, the Z. asper breeding programme in the Besancon Natural History Museum is the only one of its kind for this percid, but the high sensitivity of broodstock to the intensity and duration of the vernalization period should raise concerns about the sustainability of its populations in the face of climate change.

AB  - This paper brings together a multidisciplinary initiative to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for analyzing, assessing, and extracting information from raster maps. This information will provide a rigorous foundation to address a wide range of applications including disease mapping, emerging infectious diseases, landscape ecological assessment, land cover trends and change detection, watershed assessment, and map accuracy assessment. It will develop an advanced map analysis system that integrates these techniques with an advanced visualization toolbox, and use the system to conduct large case studies using rich sets of raster data, primarily from remotely sensed imagery. As a result, it will be possible to study and evaluate raster maps of societal, ecological, and environmental variables to facilitate quantitative characterization and comparative analysis of geospatial trends, patterns, and phenomena. In addition to environmental and ecological studies, these techniques and tools can be used for policy decisions at national, state, and local levels, crisis management, and protection of infrastructure.
   Geospatial data form the foundation of an information-based society. Remote sensing has been a vastly under-utilized resource involving a multi-million dollar investment at the national levels. Even when utilized, the credibility has been at stake, largely because of lack of tools that can assess, visualize, and communicate accuracy and reliability in timely manner and at desired confidence levels.
   Consider an imminent 21st century scenario: What message does a multi-categorical map have about the large landscape it represents? And at what scale, and at what level of detail? Does the spatial pattern of the map reveal any societal, ecological, environmental condition of the landscape? And therefore can it be an indicator of change? How do you automate the assessment of the spatial structure and behavior of change to discover critical areas, hot spots, and their corridors? Is the map accurate? How accurate is it? How do you assess the accuracy of the map? How do we evaluate a temporal change map for change detection? What are the implications of the kind and amount of change and accuracy on what matters, whether climate change, carbon emission, water resources, urban sprawl, biodiversity, indicator species, human health, or early warning? And with what confidence? The proposed research initiative is expected to find answers to these questions and a few more that involve multi-categorical raster maps based on remote sensing and other geospatial data. It includes the development of techniques for map modeling and analysis using Markov Random Fields, geospatial statistics, accuracy assessment and change detection, upper echelons of surfaces, advanced computational techniques for geospatial data mining, and advanced visualization techniques.

AB  - We present thorough this review the developments in the field, point out their current limitations, and outline its timelines and unique potential. In order to do so we introduce the methods used in each of the advances in the application of deep learning (DL) to coral research that took place between the years: 2016-2018. DL has unique capability of streamlining the description, analysis, and monitoring of coral reefs, saving time, and obtaining higher reliability and accuracy compared with error-prone human performance. Coral reefs are the most diverse and complex of marine ecosystems, undergoing a severe decline worldwide resulting from the adverse synergistic influences of global climate change, ocean acidification, and seawater warming, exacerbated by anthropogenic eutrophication and pollution. DL is an extension of some of the concepts originating from machine learning that join several multilayered neural networks. Machine learning refers to algorithms that automatically detect patterns in data. In the case of corals these data are underwater photographic images. Based on "learned" patterns, such programs can recognize new images. The novelty of DL is in the use of state-of-art computerized image analyses technologies, and its fully automated methodology of dealing with large data sets of images. Automated Image recognition refers to technologies that identify and detect objects or attributes in a digital video or image automatically. Image recognition classifies data into selected categories out of many. We show that Neural Network methods are already reliable in distinguishing corals from other benthos and non-coral organisms. Automated recognition of live coral cover is a powerful indicator of reef response to slow and transient changes in the environment. Improving automated recognition of coral species, DL methods already recognize decline of coral diversity due to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Diversity indicators can document the effectiveness of reef bioremediation initiatives. We explored the current applications of deep learning for corals and benthic image classification by discussing the most recent studies conducted by researchers. We review the developments in the field, point out their current limitations, and outline their timelines and unique potential. We also discussed a few future research directions in the fields of deep learning. Future needs are the age detection of single species, in order to track trends in their population recruitment, decline, and recovery. Fine resolution, at the polyp level, is still to be developed, in order to allow separation of species with similar macroscopic features. That refinement of DL will allow such comparisons and their analyses. We conclude that the usefulness of future, more refined automatic identification will allow reef comparison, and tracking long term changes in species diversity. The hitherto unused addition of intraspecific coral color parameters, will add the inclusion of physiological coral responses to environmental conditions and change thereof. The core aim of this review was to underscore the strength and reliability of the DL approach for documenting coral reef features based on an evaluation of the currently available published uses of this method. We expect that this review will encourage researchers from computer vision and marine societies to collaborate on similar long-term joint ventures.

AB  - Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) aims to promote sustainable management of coastal zones based on ecosystem and holistic management approaches. In this context, policies have to consider the complex interactions that influence the fragile equilibrium of coastal ecosystems. Beaches represent both valuable and vulnerable natural resources because of the various ecosystem services they provide and their sensitivity to climate change and sea level rise.
   We present the first comprehensive digital record of all Black Sea beaches and provide a rapid assessment of their erosion risk under different scenarios of sea level rise. Through the digitisation of freely available remote-sensed images on the web, we provide broad information on the spatial characteristics and other attributes of all Black Sea beaches (e.g. photo-based visual estimation of the sediment type, presence of coastal defences, urban development). These data have been assembled and stored in full Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) allowing spatial queries, visualisation and data sharing and are therefore particularly interesting to feed/supply web-GIS portals (coastal atlases) for visualisation purpose, spatial queries or spatial indicators calculations.
   The resulting Black Sea beaches database contains 1228 beaches, with a total coastline length of 2042 km with an area of 224 km(2). The majority of the Black Sea beaches have been found to have small widths (61% have maximum widths less than 50 m), whereas 47% of all beaches presented coastal defence schemes, suggesting an already serious beach erosion problem.
   The erosion risk of the Black Sea beaches was assessed through the comparison of their maximum widths with estimations of the sea level rise-induced retreat by an ensemble of six 1-D analytical and numerical morphodynamic models. Following more than 17,000 experiments using different combinations of wave conditions, beach sediment textures and slopes and 11 scenarios of sea level rise (up to 2 m), the means (best fats) of the lowest and highest projections by the model ensemble were estimated; these were then compared to the maximum widths of the Black Sea beaches. The analysis showed that sea level rise will have highly significant impacts on the Black Sea beaches, as for a 0.5 m sea level rise 56% of all beaches are projected to retreat by 50% of their maximum width. For a 0.82 m sea level rise (the high IPCC estimate for the period 2081-2100) about 41% are projected to retreat by their entire maximum width, whereas for 1 m sea level rise about 51% of all Black Sea beaches are projected to retreat by (drowned or shifted landward by) their entire maximum width, if the high mean of the model ensemble projections is used.
   Results substantiate the risk of beach erosion as a major environmental problem along the Black Sea coast, which therefore needs to be taken into account in any future coastal management plans, as a matter of urgency. As these scenarios consider only sea level rise, they are considered to be conservative. Although the present results cannot replace detailed studies, the database and projections may assist Black Sea coastal managers and policy makers to rapidly identify beaches with increased risk of erosion, valuate accordingly coastal assets and infrastructure, estimate beach capacity for touristic development purposes, and rapidly assess direct and indirect costs and benefits of beach protection options. They also provide the necessary inputs to advance discussions relevant to the Black Sea ICZM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A palynological investigation of the last glacial-interglacial cycle in the southern hemisphere tropical Andes reveals changes in the moisture balance as the main driver in vegetation change. Thirty accelerator mass spectrometry. radiocarbon dates, biostratigraphy and tephra correlation reveal that a 119 m sediment core recovered from the Huinaimarca sub-basin of Lake Titicaca (16.0 degrees to 17.5 degrees S, 68.5 degrees to 70 degrees W; 3810 masl) contains sediments covering > 151,000 years. Correlation of aridity indicators with precessional variations in insolation is used to fine tune the structure of the age-depth curve within this period.
   Variations in Isoetes concentration (above/below 10,000 grains/cm(3)) identify the extent of shallow water environments. Examination of another palaeolimnological indicator (Pediastrum) and consideration of the bathymetry of the Huinaimarca sub-basin allow the reconstruction of lake-level fluctuations. These data indicate five wet/dry cycles between c. 15 1,000 and 14,200 cal yr BP. High stands are suggested during the transition into (c. 134,000 cal yr BP), and out of (c. 114,000 and 92,000 cal yr BP), the last interglacial, and during full glacial conditions (c. 70,000 and 45,000 cal yr 13P). These cycles are superimposed on a general trend of deepening lake levels through the glacial period.
   This interpretation is supported by correlation with sediments from Salar de Uyuni (20 degrees S, 68 degrees W; 3653 masl). The youngest wet episode is concurrent with palaeolake Minchin (c. 45,000 cal yr 13P), with further evidence for an additional wet period commencing c. 28,000 cal yr 13P, concomitant with palaeolake Tauca. The timing of lake level fluctuations is also supported by palaeoshoreline reconstructions from the Lyuni-Poopo region. However, our data do not suggest a major peak in lake level in Huinaimarca during the Ouki lake cycle (c. 120,000-98,000 cal yr 13P) as inferred from U-Th ages obtained from palaeoshorelines around Lago Poopo. The most extreme dry event occurs during the last interglacial period and resulted in a sedimentary hiatus tentatively dated to c. 121,000-129,000 cal yr 13P.
   The observed wet/dry cycles are shown to have a marked and rapid impact on the vegetation. The aridity of the last interglacial promoted a community dominated by Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthacae, with no modem Andean analogue. Polylepis/Acaena pollen is also shown to fluctuate markedly (0-20%), particularly during the transitions into, and out of, the last interglacial. It is probable that this pollen taxon is primarily representative of the high altitude arboreal genus Polylepis, which is a key component of highly biodiverse Andean woodlands today. Rapid fluctuations indicate the sensitivity of this ecosystem to natural environmental pressure and potential vulnerability to future human impact and climate change.
   The 100,000 year (eccentricity) solar cycle is shown to be the major controlling factor in moisture balance and vegetation over the last glacial-interglacial cycle. However, significant fluctuations in moisture balance are also evident on timescales considerably shorter than the full glacial-interglacial cycle. We have linked these to precessional (21,000 year) forcing. Nevertheless, precise independent dating during the full glacial cycle is required to confirm the importance of this forcing mechanism.

   The aim of the article. The aim of this research is to develop the methodology and methodological tools of the analysis of internationalization processes in higher education in the country in the context of global competitiveness and innovative development.
   The result of the analysis. The modern worldview understanding of globalization and internationalization processes in the educational field gives reasons to distinguish the following linked manifestations.
   Firstly, it is an objective process of the state of cordial relations and integration of national educational systems and their institutions in the global educational environment. Its main characteristic is the intensification of international activity in the implementation of the main functions of high school - research and teaching, and the emergence of educational hubs as innovative forms of institutionalization of these processes.
   Secondly, the policy and ideology of globalism and internationalism in education are manifested in the formation of cultural and spiritual values, socio- anthropological projects which in the future become a certain educational and cultural strategy of leading countries and aim to provide them with not only economic, but also socio- cultural dominance.
   Thirdly, the internationalization of higher education is manifested in the formation of new context/content of educational, scientific and other products, the content of which is based on recognized and accepted in the world international standards and knowledge of international, intercultural and global scale.
   The understanding of these interrelated and simultaneously contradictory manifestations of higher education internationalization is a necessary condition for defining basic methodological approaches to their analysis. Such approaches should take into account different levels (individual, institutional, national), aims and analysis objects (individual behavior, internationalization policy, academic mobility, institutional mobility environment), and respectively - provide setting of certain types of research and applied tasks. Their overall objective at the national level is improving the quality and competitiveness of higher education in the international education market. The investigation of the complex of key factors that form the directions and intensity of the flows of international academic mobility is important in the formation of an effective policy of higher education internationalization and appropriate strategies for their implementation. As a result of empirical research and usage of correlation and regression analysis methods the authors revealed the dependence of flows of foreign students in the country on universities' international reputation, the attractiveness in the travel and tourism area, as well as on the country's economic development. A corresponding multifactor econometric model that describes this dependence and provides analytical support for decisions in the field of strategic management of internationalization processes in the country is built.
   Conclusions and directions of further research. In globalization conditions the internationalization of educational content and its cross-border nature are becoming necessary conditions to ensure the competitiveness of the national education system, its institutions and individual participants. The complexity and ambiguity of internationalization processes cause the necessity of setting and implementation of various types of analytical tasks, the ultimate goal of which at the national level is identifying the factors of increasing higher education competitiveness due to its internationalization. The methodological tools of analysis of internationalization processes and higher education mobility in view of analysis levels and its main components are systematized in the article. International student mobility is one of the efficiency indicators of internationalization processes of higher education in the country, and hence - its competitiveness in the international educational market.
   The international reputation of country's universities and its attractiveness in the travel and tourism area and the economic development level are crucial factors that provide increased flows of foreign students in the world, and in the long run - the development of their intellectual and social capital. The development of tourist attractiveness of the country, its regions and cities can be used as a special marketing innovation in the global competition in the educational services industry.
   The development of methods and tools for monitoring the processes of higher education internationalization in Ukraine aiming to assess their socio-economic efficiency is a promising direction for further research on the issues considered in the article.

AB  - Morphologically diverse organo-sedimentary structures (including microbial mats and stromatolites) provide a palaeobiological record through more than three billion years of Earth history. Since understanding much of the Archaean fossil record is contingent upon proving the biogenicity of such structures, mechanistic interpretations of well-preserved fossil microbialites can reinforce our understanding of their biogeochemistry and distinguish unambiguous biological characteristics in these structures, which represent some of the earliest records of life. Mechanistic morphogenetic understanding relies upon the analysis of geomicrobiological experiments. Herein, we report morphological-biogeochemical comparisons between micromorphologies observed in growth experiments using photosynthetic mats built by the cyanobacterium Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes (formerly Microcoleus) and green anoxygenic phototrophic Chloroflexus spp. (i.e., Coleofasciculus-Chloroflexus mats), and Precambrian organo-sedimentary structures, demonstrating parallels between them. In elevated ambient concentrations of Cu (toxic to Coleofasciculus), Coleofasciculus-Chloroflexus mats respond by forming centimetre-scale pinnacle-like structures (supra-lamina complexities) associated with large quantities of EPS at their surfaces. mu PIXE mapping shows that Cu and other metals become concentrated within surficial sheath-EPS-Chloroflexus-rich layers, producing density-differential micromorphologies with distinct fabric orientations that are detectable using X-ray computed micro-tomography (X-ray mu CT). Similar micromorphologies are also detectable in stromatolites from the 3.481 Ga Dresser Formation (Pilbara, Western Australia). The cause and response link between the presence of toxic elements (geochemical stress) and the development of multi-layered topographical complexities in organo-sedimentary structures may thus be considered an indicator of biogenicity, being an indisputably biological and predictable morphogenetic response reflecting, in this case, the differential responses of Coleofasciculus and Chloroflexus to Cu. Growth models for microbialite morphogenesis rely upon linking morphology to intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) influences. Since the pinnacles of Coleofasciculus-Chloroflexus mats have an unambiguously biological origin linked to extrinsic geochemistry, we suggest that similar micromorphologies observed in ancient organo-sedimentary structures are indicative of biogenesis. An identical Coleofasciculus-Chloroflexus community subjected to salinity stress also produced supra-lamina complexities (tufts) but did not produce identifiable micromorphologies in three dimensions since salinity seems not to negatively impact either organism, and therefore cannot be used as a morphogenetic tool for the interpretation of density-homogeneous micro-tufted mats-for example, those of the 3.472 Ga Middle Marker horizon. Thus, although correlative microscopy is the keystone to confirming the biogenicity of certain Precambrian stromatolites, it remains crucial to separately interrogate each putative trace of ancient life, ideally using three-dimensional analyses, to determine, where possible, palaeoenvironmental influences on morphologies. Widespread volcanism and hydrothermal effusion into the early oceans likely concentrated toxic elements in early biomes.
   Morphological diversity in fossil microbialites could, therefore, reflect either (or both of) differential exposure to ambient fluids enriched in toxic elements and/or changing ecosystem structure and tolerance to elements through evolutionary time-for example, after incorporation into enzymes. Proof of biogenicity by deducing morphogenesis (i.e., a process preserved in the fossil record) overcomes many of the shortcomings inherent to the proof of biogenicity by descriptions of morphology alone.

AB  - Peru is one of the megadiverse countries worldwide, displaying a great diversity of ecosystems due to its tropical location, marine currents, and complex relief, which jointly define environments differentiated by altitude and climatic conditions. The arid and semi-arid ecosystems comprising xeric and Andean shrublands, coastal deserts, and coastal hills, illustrate this diversity of ecosystems; these stretch over 177 358 km(2), representing 13.8% of the Peruvian territory. Several studies on aquatic macroinvertebrates are being conducted in these ecosystems; although not so numerous yet, have shown a rise in recent years. The objective of this work was to determine the composition and distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems of Peru. To this end, we conducted a literature survey; the articles and theses found were reviewed and analyzed. The following keywords were used: macroinvertebrates, macrozoobenthos, bioindicators, diversity of aquatic organisms, and water quality; we used the Google Academic search engine, Scopus, Web of Science, ResearchGate and the thesis repositories of Peruvian universities, additionally a thesis from the University of Barcelona. Of a total of 53 sources of information, 38 are theses and 15 are scientific articles conducted from 1992 to 2020, referring to studies conducted at elevations ranging from 0 to 3,831 m asl. Most studies were conducted at the Lima and La Libertad departments, resulting in 20 and 10 publications, respectively. The topics addressed most frequently were bioindication, biodiversity, taxonomy, and distribution. Most theses were carried in the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo and the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, with 12 and 10 theses, respectively. The period 2011-2020 records the largest number of publications (40). According to the type of aquatic ecosystem, rivers (38) were the systems most intensively studied, followed by coastal wetlands (14) and lagoons (2); to note, one thesis studied two types of ecosystems. Specimens were collected mainly with the Surber and D nets; as a result, seven phyla, 10 classes, 39 orders, and 118 families were reported. The highest richness of families corresponds to rivers (110), followed by coastal wetlands (57), and lagoons (12). The western hydrographic slope recorded the highest richness at phylum, class, order, and family levels, likely because most investigations were conducted in this slope. On the other hand, the phyla Cnidaria, Nematoda, and Nematomorpha were not recorded in the eastern slope, which showed fewer orders (19) relative to the western slope (39). A similar trend is observed at the family level: of the 118 families recorded, 59 were reported for the eastern slope. The most common families at both sides were Chironomidae, Baetidae, Simuliidae, Elmidae, Hydrophilidae, Libellulidae, Physidae, Dytiscidae, Ceratopogonidae, Coenagrionidae, Hydroptilidae, Hydropsychidae, and Tipulidae. Separately, the most common families in all types of aquatic ecosystems were Chironomidae, Baetidae, and Dytiscidae. It is recommended to further promote studies on macroinvertebrates living in the eastern slope, addressing taxonomic, and ecological topics, as well as broadening the approach to an integral ecosystem view. Finally, the biotic indices should be calibrated and validated for the main hydrographic basins.
   This work is an initial effort to review, systematize, analyze, and gather the results of studies on aquatic macroinvertebrates in Peru, particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

AB  - Phytoplankton, the dominant marine primary producers, are considered to be highly sensitive indicators of ecosystem condition and change. The southwest area off the Iberian Peninsula (SWIP, NE Atlantic) is located in a biogeographical transition zone between temperate and subtropical waters, and classified as being very vulnerable to climate change. SWIP includes a variety of oceanic and coastal domains, under the influence of topographic irregularities, coastal upwelling and continental freshwater outflows, that collectively challenge the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics and controls. This study aimed to evaluate patterns in seasonal and interannual variability in phytoplankton and underlying environmental determinants within specific regions of SWIP, during a 15-year period (1997-2012), and to assess whether climate variability affects the regions in different ways. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of satellite-retrieved sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), acquired from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), 4-Icm, 16-day resolution, was used to regionalize the study area. Region-specific Chl-a variability patterns and their linkages with environmental determinants were explored using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM). A set of local physical-chemical variables, derived from satellite and model data, and large-scale climate indices, were used as environmental variables. EOF analysis of Chl-a variability over the heterogeneous SWIP area identified nine coherent regions, with distinctive variability patterns (4 coastals, 2 slopes and 3 open-ocean regions). Region specific GAMM models explained between 32% and 82% of Chl-a variance, with higher explanatory power (>61%) for open ocean regions and coastal regions under increased riverine influence. Chl-a model predictors, as well as their effects, varied markedly among SWIP regions. However, climate-sensitive local environmental variables (sea surface temperature SST and photosynthetically available radiation) emerged as the most influential general predictors overall, and large-scale climate indices showed significant but minor effects. Over oceanic SWIP regions, Chl-a (0.08-1.50 pg L-1) showed a uni-modal annual cycle, with increases during the mixed layer deepening and late-winter maxima, reflecting seasonal changes in SST and ocean stratification, and probably related to increased nutrient availability and/or decreased mortality. Over coastal regions south of 37 N, Chl-a (0.23-10 pg L-1) also benefited from riverine discharges, mostly during winter, and upwelling induced by zonal westerly winds, stronger during summer. Over the Portuguese west coast region, Chl-a (0.26-2.20 pg L-1) showed a uni-modal annual cycle, with summer maxima, associated with the stimulatory effects of meridional northerly winds and coastal upwelling that partially extended into slope waters. Chl-a interannual variability showed zonal differences within SWIP, with significant interannual patterns only for regions south of 37 N. Nonetheless, contrasting trends were detected in coastal (decline) and oceanic (increase) regions, possibly a consequence of between-region differences in the relative roles of nutrient and light limitation, corresponding to significant interannual increases in wind speed and mixed layer depth. Our study used a biologically-relevant objective regionalization of a heterogeneous area, to elucidate phytoplankton dynamics and controls.
   The region -specific associations observed between phytoplankton and multiple climate-sensitive environmental drivers over the SWIP area reinforce the role of phytoplankton as a strategic element for evaluating ecosystem responses to climate variability and change.

AB  - Analysis of fifty-eight paleosol trace fossil assemblages, ranging from the Triassic to the Recent, allows refinement of continental ichnofacies models and the proposal of a Coprinisphaera ichnofacies. The Coprinisphaera ichnofacies consists of trace fossils of bees, wasps, ants, beetles, termites, and other unassigned insects. Meniscate burrows, mammal caves, and rhizoliths also may be present. This ichnofacies is named after the dung beetle nest Coprinisphaera, the most common component of this archetypal assemblage. In mature paleosols, the Coprinisphaera ichnofacies has moderate to relatively high trace fossil diversity and high abundance. Ethologically, this assemblage is dominated by nesting traces (calichnia) and exhibits a relatively complex tiering pattern, reflecting variable depths of emplacement of hymenopterous, termite, and dung beetle nests. Common components include the bee cells Celliforma, Uruguay, Ellipsoideichnus, Palmiraichnus, and Rosellichnus; the wasp nest Chubutolithes; the ant traces Attaichnus and Parowanichnus, and other beetle traces, such as Monesichnus, Fontanai, and Teisseirei. Termite nests may occur, but are less common components of the Coprinisphaera ichnofacies.
   The Coprinisphaera ichnofacies fulfills all the requirements to qualify as a Seilacherian or archetypal ichnofacies, namely recurrence in time anal space, and distinct paleoenvironmental implications. Proposal of the Coprinisphaera ichnofacies is based on the analysis of twenty-eight cases, ranging from the? Late Cretaceous to the Recent. The Coprinisphaera ichnofacies characterizes paleosols developed in paboecosystems of herbaceous communities. These herbaceous communities range from dry-and-cold to hum id-and-warm climates. More detailed paleoclimatological inferences can be obtained by evaluating the relative abundance of the various traces within the assemblage. A dominance of hymenopterous traces would indicate drier conditions, whereas the presence of termite nests would indicate more humid. The Coprinisphaera ichnofacies occurs in paleosols developed in various depositional systems subject to subaerial exposure, such as alluvial plains, desiccated floodplains, crevasse splays, levees, abandoned point bars, and vegetated eolian environments. This and other potential terrestrial ichnofacies are controlled by ecological parameters (e.g., vegetation, climate, and soil) rather than by depositional processes. The association of fossil insect nests indicates the extent of soil development and consequently, such ichnofossils are one of the best indicators of paleosols.
   The previously proposed Termitichnus ichnofacies was defined to include all paleosol trace fossil assemblages. However, the available information indicates that terrestrial environments are far more complex. Therefore, it is suggested that the Termitichnus ichnofacies as presently defined be abandoned because it does not reflect the diversity of paleosol settings and fails to provide significant paleoecologic information. Formal definition of a Termitichnus ichnofacies in a more restricted sense, to include assemblages dominated by termite nests in paleosols of closed forest ecosystems, should await documentation of additional studies to prove recurrence. Other fossil insect-nest associations in paleosols (e.g, halictid nests in calcareous soils) do not have enough recurrence in time and space to be considered Seilacherian ichnofacies, but do represent potential ichnofacies. The model proposed in this paper includes the paleoecologically defined Coprinisphaera ichnofacies plus a definite number of associations, each one possessing its own paleoenvironmental implications, which do not show the necessary recurrence to be considered ichnofacies, at present. Climate and vegetation are considered hey factors in the shaping of terrestrial ecosystems and should be taken into account for the definition of additional terrestrial ichnofacies.

AB  - Water pollution in China is severe and combined pollution with multiple stressors poses a great challenge to watershed risk management. Under the conditions of combined pollution, recognizing high-risk areas of concern, identifying key toxicants from multiple stressors and comprehensively assessing their ecological risk are the urgent and difficult tasks in watershed management. Traditional ecological risk assessment mainly focuses on single pollutant, which is difficult to obtain holistic information on the risk related to combined pollution. Based on the current research progress of combined pollution assessment, this review proposes a framework for ecological risk assessment of combined pollution in watersheds, including recognition of high-risk areas, identification of key toxicants and comprehensive assessment of ecological risk of the key toxicants. Firstly, high-risk areas are identified by weight of evidence analysis, which integrates information from both laboratory and in situ exposure and effect analyses. Most of exposure and effect data so far are based on chemical analyses and bioassays in the laboratories, yet bias may exist in extrapolating information from laboratory data to the field. Alternatively, in situ analysis serves an effective approach in reducing this extrapolation bias and, at the same time, more realistically recording biological effects under some field exposure scenarios, such as pulse exposure. Passive sampling devices have been applied for in situ exposure assessment. The integration of passive sampling with in situ organism exposure chambers successfully gains both chemical and toxicological lines of evidence for ecological risk assessment. Secondly, key toxicants in the high-risk areas are identified using toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) and effect-directed analysis (EDA) techniques. Conventional TIE is of environmental relevance by using whole organism bioassays; however, it is lack of effective methods in identifying major contributors to the toxicity because it merely focuses on analyzing the contaminants in target lists. Alternatively, EDA is a powerful tool in identifying key organic toxicants with a combination of chemical fractionation and analysis of targeted and non-targeted contaminants. Nevertheless, the common use of in vitro bioassays and exhaustive extraction make EDA lack of environmental relevance. Therefore, integrating TIE and EDA would provide an environmentally relevant method to effectively determine causality of sediment toxicity by combining the merits of the two methodologies. To improve the accuracy of toxicity identification, bioavailable extraction and dosing techniques are recommended to be incorporated into the integrated method. Thirdly, probabilistic ecological risk of the key toxicants in the high-risk areas is evaluated using tiered ecological risk assessment methods. Hazard quotient method has been widely used in providing conservative risk screening information, but uncertainties could not be quantified with this method. Therefore, a probabilistic assessment method, including distributions of exposure, response and hazard quotient levels, is proposed to achieve a holistic ecological risk assessment. At the end, recent developments and challenges in ecological risk assessment of combined pollution in watersheds are prospected.
   Overall, integrating the understanding of joint toxicity mechanisms in combined pollution risk assessment, improving the ability in non-targeted analysis and developing bioavailability-based sediment thresholds are important to assess ecological risk of combined pollution in watersheds.

AB  - In recent decades, the influence of anthropogenic impact on aquatic ecosystems has increased. This has led to a restructuring of aquatic ecosystems and affected the structural and functional organization of groups of aquatic organisms, causing qualitative and quantitative changes. Particular attention is drawn to the different types of water bodies of protected areas like Ichnyansky National Park, which is located in Ichnyansky district of Chernihiv region. This park is a newly created one, so the reduction in intensity of anthropogenic pressure can be traced within its waters. Zooplankton plays an important role in the functioning of trophic networks because it transfers energy from producers and primary consumers to young fish and planktonophagous fish. Therefore, three main groups of zooplankton were chosen as the object of study: rotifers (class Eurotatoria), cladocerans (class Branchiopoda, order Cladocera), different age stages of copepods (class Copepoda), and also ostracods (Class Ostracoda). The zooplankton used as research material was collected in the daytime in spring (April), summer (late July - early August) and autumn (late September early October) in the years 2015-2016 from ten experimental stations. During this period 81 species of zooplankton were recorded within heterogeneous reservoirs of Ichniansky National Park. Monogonont rotifers (subclass Monogononta) included 35 species (43% of all species) and bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea), cladocerns, comprised 28 species (35%), and copepods included 18 species (22%). The faunal range of zooplankton over different years and seasons was characterized by the predominance of the rotator complex in spring, rotator-cladocerans and cladocerans in summer, and of the cladocerans complex in autumn. This was due to the formation during spring and summer of favourable conditions in the waters for filter feeders, which consist generally of rotifers and cladocerans. In autumn the water released large amounts of organic matter that caused a reduction in the species diversity of rotifers. Zooplankton also is characterized by the considerable ecological diversity. The range of environmental groups of zooplankton over two years was characterized by a predominance of the pelagic and benthic group of phytophiles. Pelagic representatives included 35 (43%) of 81 species, the bottom group - 20 (25%), phytophiles - 26 (32%). Rotifers dominated in the pelagic group - 18 (51%) species out of 35, and cladocerans - among the bottom group - 10 (50%) species out of 20. Zooplankton species also are distinguished by their feeding type. They represented three trophic groups: peaceful - 64 (79%) out of 81 species, omnivorous - 6 (7%) and predators - 11 (14%). Quantitative indicators of zooplankton at most stations in different seasons were defined as "very low" (less than 5,000 ind./m(3) and less than 0.3 g/m(3)), "low" (5,000-50,000 ind./m(3) and 0.3-1.0 g/m(3)), "below average" (5,000-50,000 ind./m(3) and 0.3-1.0 g/m(3)) rates, occasionally - "average" (51-250,000 ind./m(3) and 1.1-5.0 g/m(3)), "medium high" (501,000-1,000,000 ind./m(3) and 1.1-5.0 g/m3). High densities of zooplankton densities were recorded in spring for a temporary reservoir and amounted to 3,016,000 ind./m3.

AB  - Eutrophication alters coastal aquatic food web structure and function through effects of organic enrichment and hypoxia. Macrobenthic communities provide good ecological indicators of impacts on ecosystem function induced by eutrophication. However, effective resource management requires validation of ecological indicators through mechanistic links to specific stressors of concern. Organic enrichment along with subsequent hypoxia typically engenders depauperate macrobenthic communities consisting of small short-lived surface-dwelling organisms. Metabolic ecology theory offers great promise for understanding the role of body size within the context of the trophic dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. Body size is a fundamental ecological trait because it underpins vital rates, which can be scaled up to the ecosystem level through allometric laws. Thus, body size-dependent mechanisms can potentially be used to link macrobenthic indicators to ecosystem consequences of organic enrichment and hypoxia. The Peters mass balance model (PMBM) [Peters, R.H., 1983. The Ecological implications of Body Size. Cambridge University Press, New York, 329 pp.] provides a platform for projecting stress-induced changes in the distribution of biomass among discrete size classes of organisms. In the PMBM, changes in the distribution of biomass ensue over time from differences between gains due to ingestion and losses due to egestion, respiration, and mortality. Production of biomass results when ingestion exceeds combined losses. In the present study, the PMBM was modified to envisage an inhibitory effect of hypoxia on ingestion by: (1) using unique size-specific mortality coefficients in order to realize target inverted biomass-size distributions during model initialization: (2) linking ingestion rate to the hyperbolic relationship between oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ambient dissolved oxygen (DO); (3) hypothesizing how oxygen regulation ability follows an allometric scaling rule relative to the supply of DO. If food is unlimited, the most straightforward hypothetical connection between the oxygen consumption rate and ingestion assumes a direct proportional relationship under oxygen limitation. Although small organisms can attain much higher mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption than large ones, previous limited research on oxygen consumption relative to oxygen supply implies that large organisms regulate oxygen intake better than small individuals as ambient DO declines. Counterintuitively, linked ingestion deficits would be accordingly higher for small organisms than large organisms under hypoxia. In pilot simulations incorporating hypothetical ingestion deficits due to oxygen limitation within a modified PMBM, contrasting scenarios emulated continuous DO and water temperature conditions experienced at two shallow subtidal sites for 32 d in summer. Resulting ingestion deficits reduced total biomass and favored large size classes. Effects were stronger under the more hypoxic scenario: total biomass was lower and the biomass-size distribution was more uneven among the size classes. Differences were even more evident in terms of an integrative macrobenthic process indicator, the normalized biomass-size spectrum (NBSS). A realistic hypoxia mass balance model (HMBM) must incorporate various allometric effects that are not necessarily expressed in the same direction relative to body size.
   A useful resource management tool for anticipating effects of environmental stress on aquatic ecosystem function could be developed from the quantification of trophic transer potential within a refined PMBM. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Steel slag is an industrial by product of steel manufacturing processes and has been widely utilized within civil and construction materials for road materials and environmental remediation in countries like Japan, USA, and European Union nations. However, the current utilization of steel slag in Vietnam is very low mainly because of lack of quality control of slag treatment and chances for reuse of treated steel slag. This paper presents the up to date steel slag production status in Vietnam through the extensive survey and sampling at seven large steel factories. The paper also highlights the environmental and quality control issues of these steel slags to use as road construction aggregates by assessing the heavy metals concentration in the leachate. The basic oxygen furnace (BOF) and electric arc furnace (EAF) slag samples were collected to evaluate leaching properties of metals leached from the slags. The two standardized batch leaching tests of steel slag roadbed material in Japan (JIS K 0058-1) and toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP-EPA method 1311) were performed to the evaluated the hazardous metals. The results of the leaching test show that almost all of the concentration of the metals in the leached solution does not exceed the National Standard for Industrial Wastewater Discharge (QCVN 40-2011). The pH and parameters such as total chromium, nickel, copper, lead, arsenic, and manganese differ from the two test methods. The acidic conditions employed in the EPA 1311 were not representative of condition excepted during slag reuse in road constructions because in the operation condition of the road, acidic liquid is absent. The leaching test results confirmed that JIS test which uses deionized water with gentle mixing prevents the slag sample from size degradation is suitable for the environmental assessment of steel slag use for roadbed material. This research suggests that the adjustment of pH value prior to disposal or reuse as base materials and official guideline should be promulgate by the authorities to ensure the leachate meet the surface water quality standard.

AB  - QuestionsWe investigated the effects of grassland management intensity and temporary conversion to other land uses on abiotic and biotic properties of subtropical grasslands. We used species-rich permanent grasslands of medium management intensity (PG-M) as a reference, and asked the following questions: (1) do permanent grasslands with low and high management intensities (PG-L and PG-H, respectively) have different plant diversity and species composition than reference grasslands; and (2) do secondary grasslands recovering from conversion to arable fields (SG-A) or pine plantations (SG-P) differ from permanent grasslands in their plant species composition and abiotic conditions?
   LocationHighland grasslands, Campos de Cima da Serra, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil.
   MethodsWe analysed variation in plant species composition and diversity among 80 grassland sites, including three types of permanent grassland and two types of secondary grassland. An indicator species analysis was used to identify characteristic species for the different land-use types. We used a linear discriminant analysis to investigate differences in soil conditions among land-use types.
   ResultsBoth PG-L and PG-H differed from PG-M regarding plant species composition. Although PG-L shared many typical grassland species with PG-M, their communities were generally less diverse. PG-H, on the other hand, not only had fewer species but also deviated from PG-M in species composition. Secondary grasslands on former arable fields and plantations differed from PG-M in species composition and showed lower diversity. Soil conditions of SG-P were similar to those of PG-L and PG-M, but they were distinct from those of PG-H and SG-A.
   ConclusionsAll land-use types showed deviations from reference grasslands (PG-M). The decrease in the number of species in PG-L may be reversed if traditional management intensity is re-introduced, whereas strong compositional changes in SG-P may require the re-introduction of grassland species. This is also true for PG-H and SG-A: both showed marked deviations from reference grasslands in biotic and abiotic components. Overall, restoration of altered land-use types to near-natural subtropical grassland seems feasible, but suitable techniques have to be developed.

AB  - Knowledge on quantitative faunal distribution patterns of hydrothermal communities in slow-spreading vent fields is particularly scarce, despite the importance of these ridges in the global mid-ocean system. This study assessed the composition, abundance and diversity of 12 benthic faunal assemblages from various locations on the Eiffel Tower edifice (Lucky Strike vent field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and investigated the role of key environmental conditions (temperature, total dissolved iron (TdFe), sulfide (TdS), copper (TdCu) and pH) on the distribution of macro- and meiofaunal species at small spatial scales ( < 1 m). There were differences in macro- and meiofaunal community structure between the different sampling locations, separating the hydrothermal community of the Eiffel Tower edifice into three types of microhabitats: (1) cold microhabitats characterized by low temperatures ( < 6 degrees C), high TdCu (up to 2.4 +/- 1.37 mu mol l(-1)), high pH (up to 7.34 +/- 0.13) but low TdS concentrations ( < 6.98 +/- 5.01 mu mol l(-1)); (2) warm microhabitats characterized by warmer temperatures ( > 6 degrees C), low pH ( < 6.5) and high TdS/TdFe concentrations ( > 12.8 mu mol l(-1)/ > 1.1 mu mol l(-1) respectively); and (3) the third microhabitat characterized by intermediate abiotic conditions. Environmental conditions showed more variation in the warm microhabitats than in the cold microhabitats. In terms of fauna, the warm microhabitats had lower macro- and meiofaunal densities, and lower richness and Shannon diversity than the cold microhabitats. Six macrofaunal species (Branchipolynoe seepensis, Amathys lutzi, Bathymodiolus azoricus, Lepetodrilus fucensis, Protolira valvatoides and Chorocaris chacei) and three meiofaunal taxa (Paracanthonchus, Cephalochaetosoma and Microlaimus) were identified as being significant indicator species/taxa of particular microhabitats. Our results also highlight very specific niche separation for copepod juveniles among the different hydrothermal microhabitats. Some sampling units showed unique faunal composition and increased beta diversity on the Eiffel Tower edifice. Contrary to what was expected, the highest beta diversity was not associated with a particular microhabitat type, but rather with location on the central part of the edifice where other structuring factors may predominate.

AB  - The present investigation aims to study the diversity of ciliates from different habitats in and around Delhi, India, and the correlation of this diversity with soil quality {agricultural lands (site 1 and 2), dump yards (site 3 and 4), sewage treatment plant (site 5), residential land (site 6), landfill (site 7) and barren land (site 8)}. Various physicochemical parameters of the different soil samples were studied and analysed for soil texture, interstitial water, pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, total organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous content, using standard protocols. Seventeen ciliate taxa belonging to four classes, seven orders, ten families, and 17 genera were recorded, with the maximum number of species (eleven) belonging to the class Spirotrichea. Ciliate diversity was highest at sites 5 and 6 and lowest at sites 1 and 2. Spathidium sp. was the dominant species in the conditioned land (site 8), while the ciliate Colpoda sp. was present in all the sites examined, showing the highest population density in the sewage treatment plant site (site 5). Statistical analysis showed that ciliate diversity was positively correlated to physicochemical parameters such as interstitial water, total organic matter and organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorous content. Analyses of spirotrichs/colpodids (S/C) ratio and diversity indices implied that the habitat conditions of sites 1, 2, 3 and 8 are relatively unfavourable for soil ciliates to flourish; while sites 4, 5, 6 and 7 provided more favourable conditions. The ubiquity of ciliate distribution suggests their important role in the soil food webs and nutrient cycling, and their community structure and specific characteristics appear to be of major importance for soil formation.

AB  - We present studies on ruthenium-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) focusing on conditions supporting signal enhancement and low oxidation potentials. Low oxidation potentials (LOPs) are especially attractive for miniaturized ECL biosensors, as microfabricated electrodes tend to detach from their support when used with high currents and operated at high potentials. Furthermore, high potentials or current densities can lead to damage of typical biosensor surface coatings and biological probes. The possibility of generating LOP ECL signals at a potential below 900 mV was therefore studied for Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) with two typical coreactants, i.e. 2-(dibutylamino) ethanol (DBAE) and tripropylamine (TPA), as well as with the tertiary amine N-butyldiethanolamine (NBEA). Furthermore, the effect of buffer components and pH values on ECL signal generation was investigated. We could show a significant LOP ECL signal for NBEA. We found that Tris buffer, with its ability to form complexes with transition metal ions, has a positive influence on this ECL signal in terms of signal strength and LOP capabilities. Specifically, at basic pH values significant increases in ECL signals were observed at 900 mV and at 1.2 V. In fact, the ECL signal at 1.2 V was three times higher than the signal observed in phosphate buffer at a pH of 7, and it was thirty times higher than the ECL signal for TPA under these conditions. The LOP signal for NBEA in Tris buffer at pH 8.5 was similar to the signal obtained for TPA in phosphate buffer at pH 8.5 but three times higher than for TPA at pH 7.0. Interestingly, the coreactant DBAE was neither significantly influenced by the buffer system or pH nor did it present a valuable LOP ECL signal. Finally, it was found that high peak currents in cyclic voltammograms are not the indicators for high ECL signals, which should be obvious because the ECL mechanism requires more complex electron transfers. Overall, the standard TPA ECL at 1.2 V in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 can successfully be replaced by NBEA ECL at 900 mV in Tris at pH 8.5 providing significantly higher signals accompanied by more gentle electrochemical conditions.

AB  - The major processes responsible for the interplay of hydrothermal influence and paleo-depositional environments (paleoproductivity and plaeoredox condition) on the accumulation of organic matters can be better understood by integrating lithological and geochemical characteristics of samples from the well exposed Late Permian sediments in the Dalong Formation of the Shangsi Section, Northwest Sichuan Basin, South China: 1) The content of total organic carbon (TOC) ranging from 0.16% to 14.6% is closely related with the host lithology and high TOC contents prone to occur in intervals of siliceous rocks, dark shales, and laminated limestones that developed in deepwater intra-basin environments: 2) Non-detrital component elements and ratios (after Ti-normalized), e.g. Cu-xs, V-xs/(V-xs + Ni-xs), for all samples and their correlations with TOC contents imprint the control of paleoproductivity level and paleoredox condition on the accumulation of TOC contents: 3) Characteristics such as original contents of Al, Fe, Mn, Th, U and their non-detrital origin values, non-biogenic contribution values (TiO2-normalized) of various elements, and the North America Shale Composite (NASC)-normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) Patterns of chert and shale samples are analyzed and compared to that of world average shales, classic hydrothermal and biogenic cherts, indicating hydrothermal contribution to siliceous rocks formation in the Dalong Formation of the Shangsi Section. Together with the discovery of volcanic ashes and bentonites in the Dalong Formation of the Shangsi Section, a new model has been proposed to explain the relationships of the hydrothermal activities and the organic matter accumulation process in the siliceous rocks in the Dalong Formation of the Shangsi Section: Hydrothermal contribution could cause a bio-thriving in surface water by providing nutrient elements and lead to a high primary productivity: With the organic matters sinking down, the anaerobic and anoxic conditions would control the organic matter accumulation during deposition and early diagenesis stage, which can imprint the organic carbon-rich siliceous rocks formation and the origin of high quality marine source rocks for hydrocarbon.

AB  - Non-nutritive oral behaviors, especially tongue rolling, are prevalent in the stabled cow population. These behaviors mean that the environment or management process might not suit the cows, suggesting low welfare. However, few researches have reported the physiological indicators or production performance of dairy cows with the stereotyped behavior. This study aimed to determine physical conditions, daily activity, rumen fermentation, and milk production of cows with tongue-rolling behavior. Three hundred and fifty nine Holstein cows in the same barn and lactation stage were subjected to scan sampling behavior observations 126 times for 7 days. Ten cows with high-frequency tongue-rolling behavior (TON) and 10 cows without abnormal oral behavior (CON) were selected for further study. Serum sample, ruminal fluid, milk sample, and behavior record video of TON and CON cows were collected. TON cows had more drinking behavior and more stable lying behavior than the CON cows during the daytime. The body condition score of the TON cows decreased, while the milk yield, yield of milk fat, protein, and lactose in the study period increased. The TON cows had lower ruminal fluid pH, acetate/propionate ratio, and total volatile acid. The bacterial diversity in the ruminal fluid was not different between the two groups. Compared to CON cows, the TON cows had a higher level of serum stress indicators, such as cortisol, thyroid hormone, and norepinephrine, which positively correlated to the frequency of tongue-rolling behavior. Meanwhile, the TON cows had a higher level of lactate dehydrogenase, serum glucose, total triglyceride, total cholesterol, and Interleukin 6. Overall, it means they suffer from higher levels of stress and have higher energy metabolism for a long time when cows show tongue-rolling behavior. TON cows had suffered a higher stress level and had higher energy metabolic status for a long time. The TON cows might have better heat tolerance to the thermal environment by more lying and drinking time. Our data revealed the changes in milk production, physiological stress indicators of dairy cows with high-frequency tongue rolling behavior, which will provide essential knowledge for the in-depth understanding of tongue rolling behavior in dairy cows.

AB  - As a vital role in the processes of the energy balance and hydrological cycles, actual evapotranspiration (ET) is relevant to many agricultural, ecological and water resource management studies. The available global or regional ET products provide ET estimations with various temporal ranges, spatial resolutions and calculation methods (algorithms, inputs and parameterization, etc.), leading to varying degrees of introduced uncertainty. Northern China is the main agriculturally productive region supporting the whole country; thus, understanding the spatial and temporal changes in ET is essential to ensure water resource and food security. We developed a synthesis ET dataset for Northern China at a 1000 m spatial resolution, with a monthly temporal resolution covering a period ranging from 1982 to 2017, using an in-depth assessment of several ET products. Specifically, assessments were performed using in situ measured ET from eddy covariance (EC) observation towers at the site-pixel scale over interannual months under the conditions of different land cover types, climatic zones and elevation levels to select the most optimally performing ET products to be used in the synthesized ET dataset. Eight indicators under 21 conditions were involved in the assessment sheet, while the statistics of the different ET product occurrences and corresponding ratios were analyzed to select the best-performing ET products to build the synthesis ET dataset using the weighted mean method. The weights were determined by the Taylor skill score (TSS), calculated with ET products and EC ET observation data. Based on the assessment results, the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML_v2), ETWatch and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) datasets were selected for implementation in the synthesis ET dataset from 2003 to 2017, while Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) v3.3a, complementary relationship (CR) ET, and Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) datasets were chosen for the synthesis ET dataset from 1982 to 2002. The weighted mean synthesized results from 2003 to 2017 performed well when compared to the in situ measured EC ET values produced under all of the above conditions, while the synthesized results from 1982 to 2002 performed well through the water balance method in Heihe River Basin. These results can provide more stable ET estimations for Northern China, which can contribute to relevant agricultural, ecological and hydrological studies.

AB  - Successful operation of recirculating aquaculture systems is dependent on frequent monitoring of the optimal function of water treatment processes in order to maintain environmental conditions for optimal growth and welfare of the fish. Real time monitoring of fish status is however usually not an integrated part of automatized systems within RAS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of implanted acoustic acceleration transmitters to monitor Atlantic salmon swimming activity. Twelve salmon post-smolts were individually tagged and distributed in three tanks containing salmon at start density of 50 kg m(-3). The tagging did not cause any mortality and all individuals increased their body weight during this study. Following initial recovery, acceleration data were continuously logged for one month, including treatment periods with exposure to hyperoxic (170% O-2 saturation) and hypoxic (60% O-2 saturation) conditions, and different tank hydraulic retention times (HRT; 23 and 58 min). Changes in-tank dissolved oxygen levels to hyperoxic and hypoxic conditions reduced the total activity of Atlantic salmon in this study. On the contrary, increased and reduced tank HRT increased the total activity levels. Feeding periods induced a sharp increase in the Atlantic salmon swimming activity, while irregular feeding caused larger oscillations in activity and also lead to increased swimming activity of the tagged fish. Atlantic salmon responded with a maximum recorded total activity to stress caused by technical problems within the system and consequent changes in the RAS environment. The results of this study indicate that Atlantic salmon respond quickly with changed swimming activity to changes in the water quality and acute stress caused by normal management routines within RAS. The use of acoustic acceleration transmitters for real time monitoring of swimming activity within aquaculture production systems may allow for rapid detection of changes in species-specific behavioural welfare indicators and assist in the refinement of best management practices. In addition, acceleration tag could potentially serve as a valuable research tool for behavioural studies, studies on stress and welfare and could allow for better understanding of interaction between fish and RAS environment.

AB  - Drought is a complex phenomenon that impacts a multitude of sectors globally and is difficult to characterize due to the variation in defining conditions. With over 2.5 billion people dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, agricultural drought impacts are particularly acute. Specific indicators based on different aspects of the hydrologic cycle can be used to better characterize drought and mitigate its impacts. The overall objective of this study is to develop a monthly Composite Drought Index (CDI) using Earth observation datasets to provide an assessment of droughts in Pakistan. Further, district level wheat production data was used to optimize variables to create a customized composite drought index (CCDI) specifically for agriculture and evaluate the two indices. Pakistans economy and communities rely heavily on the agricultural sector and many areas are at high risk of crop failure due to the dependence on precipitation and other environmental conditions. A total of 10 environmental variables are considered that account for supply and demand of water, soil moisture, and vegetative conditions. Statistically important variables are chosen for each district with respect to wheat production, creating a subset of the original inputs. Weights for each dataset are calculated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), identifying what variables contribute the most to the index. The CDI and CCDI are evaluated with nationally reported, district level, wheat production data, for the harvest years 2005-2017, carried out specifically for the Rabi season, October -March. The CCDI, on average used 5 variables, as compared to the full 10 in the CDI. Overall, the two composite indices were highly correlated and both captured well known climatological events. When compared to production trends, the CDI has the ability to identify agricultural droughts with a true negative rate of 0.742 in rainfed districts, while irrigated districts have a true negative rate of 0.568. For the CCDI the true negative rates in rainfed and irrigated districts were 0.667 and 0.602, respectively. The results distinguished the importance of each variable in the contribution to the CDI and CCDI. The findings from this study demonstrate the potential of using the methodology for the CDI to enhance pre-existing drought monitoring and forecasting systems in the region.

AB  - A continuously cored well covering the Carboniferous-Permian Benxi, Taiyuan, and Shanxi formations in the eastern Ordos Basin provides a rare window into environmental conditions of the marine-continental transitional strata. Integration of petrographic, mineralogical, and high-resolution geochemical data allows marine-continental investigating the depositional environment, organic abundance, detrital influx, paleoclimate, paleo-water salinity, and paleoredox conditions of transitional facies. The marine-continental transitional strata in the Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian consist of complex interbedding of sandstone, shale, coal and limestone. TOC contents display a considerable change in the vertical direction, with high TOC content in coal, moderate TOC in shale, low TOC content in limestone and no noticeable TOC enrichment in sandstone. The Upper Carboniferous Benxi Formation is dominated by marine facies then changing into transitional facies. The Lower Permian Taiyuan Formation is characterized by multiple alternation of marine and transitional facies. Marine limestones are characterized by low detrital influx proxies, whereas transitional shales show high detrital influx input and oxic environment. The Lower Permian Shanxi Formation is a typical marine-continental transitional depositional system, which is characterized by complex interbedding of shales, sandstones and coals. Sandy intervals were deposited in deltaic and tidal flat environment and characterized by high Ti and Al content, low TOC (0.09-0.97%, avg. 0.31%), relatively low U/Th (0.11-0.32, avg. 0.17), showing limited influence of seawater. Shale intervals were deposited in a lagoonal environment with high TOC (0.94-40.64%, avg. 5.43%), Sr/Ba and trace elemental proxies values (U/Th, 0.18-3.27%, avg. 0.44%; MoEF, 0.95-32.3, avg. 8.56; UEF, 0.67-15.17, avg. 2.53). This study shows that high-resolution geochemical characteristics of elements could be reliable indicators for sedimentary facies analysis, and hence could provide broader implications for utilizing trace element geochemistry from marine-continental transitional periods in which sedimentary environment changes frequently and organic-rich sediment accumulated under varied conditions.

AB  - 1. A field experiment was conducted with commercial broiler breeder females to assess the hypothesis that the provision of bunches of string and bales of wood shavings would provide attractive environmental enrichment and improve welfare by decreasing aggression and feather damage.
   2. The experiment was a randomised block factorial design conducted in a commercial flock of 21 600 female broiler breeders in 12 pens of 1800 chicks. Treatments were environmental enrichment ( 4 plastic coated bales of wood shavings and 50 bunches of string) from hatch ( EE1) or 8 weeks of age ( EE2) and a control treatment with no environmental enrichment. There were 4 replicates ( rooms).
   3. Bird activity was videotaped at 5, 10 and 16 weeks of age and subsequently scored for the number of birds using the perch or pecking at a bale, drinker, litter and section of the wall at 10-min intervals for 4 h throughout the photoperiod ( 24 times/d). Aggression was assessed by determining the number of aggressive acts in 2-min intervals during 8 periods of the day. The skin and feather condition of 25 birds in each pen were scored at 6, 12 and 18 weeks and the condition of the string bunches was scored at the end of the experiment.
   4. The proportion of birds pecking the bales, wall and litter declined and the proportion pecking at the drinker and using the perch increased with age. The number of birds pecking at the bale was similar in EE1 and EE2 at 10 and 16 weeks of age.
   5. The string bunches were not extensively used. The condition of the bunches of string in EE2 was worse than in EE1 at the end of the experiment.
   6. The number of aggressive acts increased with age and there was no consistent difference between treatments.
   7. There was an increase with age in the damage score for feathers over the back and wings and around the tail and vent but no differences between treatments.
   8. Provision of litter in the form of unopened bales of wood shavings was a commercially acceptable form of environmental enrichment, but there was no evidence that behavioural changes associated with feed restriction, including the prevalence of aggression, were improved.

AB  - With the ever increasing demand for food, global aquaculture practices have intensified enormously over the last years. Due to this intensification, (inadequate) management strategies can cause (chronic) stress in cultured fish, hereby affecting fish performance and welfare. In Southeast Asia milkfish (Chanos chanos) is an important aquaculture species. Traditionally, milkfish are cultured in pond systems with extensive culture practices, however, as culture practices intensified, other systems such as marine cages were introduced.
   Here we aimed to identify potential environmental and/or commercial management related chronic stressors for milkfish kept in marine cage systems using ontogenetic (OG) scale cortisol. We quantified OG scale cortisol as indicator for chronic stress levels in juvenile milkfish (average TL between 20 and 30 cm) from four cage systems (F1-F4; culture time: 2.5-3 months) with different geographic locations and management strategies within the mariculture area (approx. 2.2 x 0.6 km) of the Guiguiwanen Channel in Bolinao (Philippines). The sites were chosen along the mariculture area, with F1 located in the mouth of the channel, F2 at the beginning, F3 midway, and F4 at the end of the mariculture area. Each site was sampled twice (I, II) with a time interval of 15 days between both samplings. OG scale cortisol increased significantly between sampling I and II at all four sites, indicating that milkfish at all sites experienced to a certain extent stressful conditions within their cage system. At both samplings OG scale cortisol was highest at F4, where also the highest stocking density was observed. Taking into account the existing culture conditions, OG scale cortisol levels showed that different aspects of typically applied management strategies (e.g. stocking density, feeding strategy) as well as the location might have an effect on the stress level of cultured milkfish and therefore should be considered as potentially severe stressors in milkfish mariculture. To our knowledge this is the first study quantifying OG scale cortisol as indicator for chronic stress in commercial milkfish aquaculture settings, hereby contributing to overall more sustainable aquaculture practices.

AB  - The article is aimed at the enhancement of the stereometric approach to analysing economic categories and processes and investigating directions of its application in the science of security and taxation. Methodology. The methodological basis of the study consists of general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, a comparative study of existing models of economic categories, which are based on the stereometric approach. The empirical method is used to describe the problem of using a stereometric approach to determining the economic security of an enterprise. The results of the study. The article demonstrates that modern realities increasingly require spatial thinking from economists, thus conditioning the appearance of 3D models of some economic categories in economic research papers. A number of stereometric elements have been applied by both foreign and Ukrainian scholars in the economic sphere for several decades. The article points out that no current model could claim the complete realization of the stereometric approach as an independent unidirectional array of the content of principles and methods of analysing economic categories and processes.There are also determined regularities not considered by other scientists, as well as current problems and omissions. Practical implications. There are substantiated differences between the stereometric and graphical methods of economic analysis. The stereometric approach is suggested to be meant as one of the economic analysis approaches based on visualization of economic categories and processes on the basis of geometric solids allowing qualitative and quantitative assessment of the level and dynamics of the selected array of indicators put into a single graphical model. There is revealed essence and principles of the stereometric approach use in the economy and in the science of security in particular. Economic security is treated as one of the ternary nature being resources, processes and a condition simultaneously. The article suggests a pyramid to determine economic security and proves that changes of quality, speed, and quantity of business processes expressed by changes of corresponding angles of the pyramid impact both the condition and the general level of economic security. Relevance/originality. The presented proposals on enhancing the stereometric approach create a theoretical foundation for applied research in various industries. The enhanced stereometric approach enables building a general-theoretical concept of economic security considering its connections with such notions as competitiveness and development.

AB  - Many workers have noted the presence of contorted cross-strata in the Navajo Sandstone and other ancient eolianites, and have recognized their significance as indicators of sediment saturation during the accumulation history. Horowitz (1982) proposed a general model for the production of such features in ancient ergs by episodic, seismically induced liquefaction of accumulated sand. A key feature of that popular model is the prevalence of a flat water table, characteristic of a hyper-arid climatic regime, during deformation. Under arid climatic conditions, the water table is established by regional flow and liquefaction is limited to the saturated regions below the level of interdune troughs. However, various paleohydrological indicators from Navajo Sandstone outcrops point toward a broader range of water table configurations during the deformation history of that eolianite.
   Some outcrops reveal extensive deformation complexes that do not appear to have extended to the contemporary depositional surface. These km-scale zones of deformation, affecting multiple sets of cross-strata, and grading upward into undeformed crossbeds may represent deep water table conditions, coupled with high intensity triggers, which produced exclusively intrastratal deformation. Such occurrences contrast with smaller-scale complexes formed within the zone of interaction between the products of soft-sediment deformation and surface processes of deposition and erosion. The Horowitz model targets the smaller-scale deformation morphologies produced in this near-surface environment.
   This study examines the implications of a wet climatic regime for the Horowitz deformation model. It demonstrates how a contoured water table, characteristic of humid climates, may have facilitated deformation within active bedforms, as well as in the accumulation. Intra-dune deformation would enable deflation of deformation features during the normal course of dune migration, more parsimoniously accounting for: the frequent occurrence of erosionally truncated deformation structures in the Navajo Sandstone; the production of such erosional truncations during bedform climb and aggradation of the accumulation; and the dramatic fluctuations in the water table required to deposit dry eolian sand, deform those deposits under saturated conditions, and then dry the deformed sand to enable deflation.

AB  - Isolation causes important changes in the behavioral reactivity of rats to environmental stimuli. These changes include deficit in sensorimotor gating and altered fear-like responses to aversive stimuli. Measures of ultrasound vocalizations at 20 - 22 kHz when rats are exposed to threatening conditions, such as novelty, have been taken as a good measure of fear. The fear-potentiated startle to loud sounds and the prepulse inhibition tests have been considered reliable indicators of anxiety and attention impairments, respectively. Rats reared under conditions of isolation from weaning display clear deficits in prepulse inhibition. Taking into account that housing condition changes the emotional state of the animals, we evaluated in this work the performance of rats in the fear-potentiated startle test, prepulse inhibition and emission of ultrasound vocalizations to novelty when isolated for 10 days and after resocialization for 1 week in comparison to grouped rats. Isolated rats showed greater reactivity to loud sounds in the fear-potentiated startle test than grouped animals. They also emitted less ultrasound vocalizations at 20 - 22 kHz than grouped animals when exposed to a novel environment. In contrast to the well-known deficit in prepulse inhibition displayed by isolation-reared animals, in the present study isolation for 10 days caused a significant increase in prepulse inhibition. Resocialization was not able to counteract the effects of isolation in all three tests. The results suggest that the emotional state of the animals is altered by 10 days of isolation; they do not vocalize characteristically as grouped rats when submitted to novelty; unconditioned responses to loud sounds are enhanced and increased prepulse inhibition is shown rather than a deficit as largely documented in studies with isolation-reared animals. It is suggested that the assessment of the emotional state of the animals is a prerequisite in the evaluation of prepulse inhibition. The level of defensive reactivity displayed by isolated animals is crucial for the functioning of sensory gating and, by extension, to the expression of prepulse inhibition. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

AB  - The natural emissions of ozone precursors (NOx and VOCs) are sensitive to climate. Future climate change can impact 03 concentrations by perturbing these emissions. To better estimate the variation of natural emissions under different climate conditions and understand its effect on surface 03, we model the present and the future air quality over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region by running different simulations with the aid of the WRF-CALGRID model system that contains a natural emission module. Firstly, we estimate the natural emissions at present and in IPCC A1B scenario. The results show that biogenic VOC emission and soil NOx emission over YRD in 2008 is 657 Gg C and 19.1 Gg N, respectively. According to climate change, these emissions in 2050 will increase by 25.5% and 11.5%, respectively. Secondly, the effects of future natural emissions and meteorology on surface 03 are investigated and compared. It is found that the variations in meteorological fields can significantly alter the spatial distribution of O-3 over YRD, with the increases of 5-15 ppb in the north and the decreases of -5 to -15 ppb in the south. However, only approximately 20% of the surface 03 increases caused by climate change can be attributed to the natural emissions, with the highest increment up to 2.4 ppb. Finally, Ra (the ratio of impacts from NOx and VOCs on O-3 formation) and H2O2/HNO3 (the ratio between the concentrations of H2O2 and HNO3) are applied to study the 03 sensitivity in YRD. The results show that the transition value of H2O2/HNO3 will turn from 0.3 to 0.5 in 2008 to 0.4-0.8 in 2050. 03 formation in the YRD region will be insensitive to VOCs under future climate condition, implying more NOx need to be cut down. Our findings can help us understand O-3 variation trend and put forward the reasonable and effective pollution control policies in these famous polluted areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Eight Murciano-Granadina dairy goats in late lactation were exposed to different ambient conditions, using metabolic cages in a climatic chamber. The experimental design was a crossover (2 periods of 35 d and 4 goats each) and conditions were (1) thermal neutral (TN; 15 to 20 degrees C day-night) and (2) heat stress (HS; 12-h day at 37 degrees C and 12-h night at 30.5 degrees C). Humidity was maintained at 40% and light-dark was constant (12-12 h). The forage:concentrate ratio was adjusted daily for maintaining similar value in TN and HS goats (70:30). Water was freely available at ambient temperature. Rectal temperature and respiratory rate (0800, 1200 and 1700 h) and milk yield were recorded daily, whereas milk composition, nonesterified fatty acids and haptoglobin in blood were analyzed weekly. At d 25, additional blood samples were taken for analysis of metabolites and indicators of the acid-base balance. Digestibility coefficients and N balance were determined (d 31 to 35) and body weight was recorded (d 35). Compared with TN goats, HS goats experienced greater rectal temperature (+0.58 degrees C), respiratory rate (+48 breaths/min), water intake (+77%) and water evaporation (+207%). Intake of HS goats rapidly declined until d 7 (-40%), partially recovered from d 7 to 19, and steadied thereafter (-14%). No changes in digestibility or N balance were detected. Blood nonesterified fatty acids and haptoglobin peaked at d 7 in HS goats but did not vary thereafter. Although milk yield did not vary by treatment, milk of HS goats contained -12.5% protein and -11.5% casein than TN goats. Panting reduced concentration and pressure of CO2 in the blood of HS goats, but they were able to maintain their blood pH similar to the TN group by lowering HCO3- and increasing Cl- concentrations in their blood. In conclusion, HS dairy goats showed dramatic physiological changes during the first Week of treatment and partially recovered thereafter. They were able to maintain milk yield by losing body mass, but milk protein content and protein yield were depressed. Further research is needed to assess the response of dairy goats to HS at earlier stages of lactation.

AB  - Different hydraulic parameters, including the hydraulic shear stress, unit length shear force, steam power, unit steam power, and effective stream power were used to quantify flow detachment. Most former studies were conducted for flow detachment under uniform slope surface conditions, while a few studies compared different slope surface conditions. The uniform bare loess was prepared in laboratory experiments. Natural fallowed soil loess with stone covers was prepared in field experiments. The objective of this study was to assess the differences in hydraulic parameters and sediment detachment under these different soil surface conditions. Our results show that the unit sediment load (R-s) has a good linear relationship with the unit runoff rate (R-r) for the flume and field experiments, and the relationship can be expressed as the function: R-s = 0.262R(r) - 0.802 (R-2 = 0.947). The rate of Manning roughness coefficient to mean flow depth (n/h) is a good hydraulic indicator like as the stream power and Reynolds number for predicting the sediment load. Hydraulic parameters n/h, Re, and to are good indicators for the unit area sediment load for both the flume and field experiments, while Fr, f, and 7 are good indicators for the unit area sediment load only when the flume experiments and field experiments are individually analyzed. Among the three good indicators (omega, R-e, and n/h), n/h is better than the other two for predicting sediment load in rill erosion for both flume and field experiments, as well as for the unit solute transport rate (M-Br). The parameter of n/h probably is not only a good hydraulic parameter as an indicator for both sediment and solute transport, but also a good hydraulic parameter which link with runoff energies. The parameter n/h represents the flow wave of runoff and is an important factor to represent the energy for water and sediment transport, and the flow wave celerity (v(w)) is related to n/h by: v(w) = 1.585(n/h)(-0.527) (R-2 = 0.978).

AB  - The increasing degree of mechanization in agriculture has resulted in the use of more powerful and heavier tractors and machines. Consequently, mechanical burden to soils has increased, too, which can lead to persistent subsoil compaction at depths below 30cm. In soils damaged by compaction soil functions like transportation of water and air decrease. Because of that, conditions for plant growth are getting worse and the soils' natural regulation functions could be impaired. In order to take counteractive measures, it is necessary to get information about the status of soil compaction. Up to now, the status of soil compaction can only be determined at single points in laboratory measurements or with less accuracy in field measurements. Therefore, the demand for an efficient planar-mapping system arises. The applicability of different geophysical prospecting methods with regard to this problem has been examined. For this purpose, geophysical and soil measurements were performed in a field with conventional agricultural land use in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) on a young moraine site. We applied GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) with main frequencies 500 MHz and 900 MHz, supplemented by inductive electromagnetic technique (EM) using the Ground Conductivity Meter EM38 and high-resolution refraction seismic using compressional and shear waves. Differences in soil type were found by all these geophysical methods and confirmed by soil measurements, therefore, locations with higher risk for compaction (loamy soils) could be distinguished from locations with lower risk (sandy soils). Under humid conditions, radar data showed strong reflections at a depth of approx. 30cm. During summer, under dry conditions, these reflections did not occur. This temporal variation of radar reflections can be explained by variable water layers inside the soil, which can be regarded as an indicator for compacted soil. The seismic investigation was performed along short (12 m) profiles with dense (20cm) sensor spacing. Excellent data quality showed that this sort of measurement, known from engineering geophysics, is also feasible for soil investigations. We performed both compressional- (P-) and shear- (SH-) wave refraction studies. Differences in soil type of subsoil affected especially seismic velocities of P-waves. Whether or not areas of compacted soil can be detected is still unknown, because deeper soil horizons of our test area showed only uniformly strong compaction with little contrasts.

AB  - West African land use systems have been experiencing one of the fastest transformations in the world over recent decades. The Sudanian savanna is an interesting example, as it hosts the cultivation of some crops typical of the Guinean savanna as well as some of the Sahel. Therefore, this region is likely to experience further changes in its crop portfolio over the next decades due to crop migration processes responding to environmental change. Simulation approaches can guide the development of agricultural production strategies that contribute to sustainably optimize both food and fuel production. This study used crop models already available in the APSIM platform to simulate plant production and the soil water and nutrient cycles of plots cultivated with groundnut, millet, sorghum, maize, and rice on three (two upland and one lowland) soil fertility classes and subjected to five levels of management (conventional tillage without residue incorporated to the soil and nor fertilizer application; conventional tillage without residue incorporated to the soil and 5 kg N ha(-1); conventional tillage with residue incorporated to the soil 20 kg N ha(-1), and no-till herbicide treated with 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1)). Simulation outputs were contrasted against data reported in the literature and converted into nutritional, fuel and feed yields based on the qualities and uses of their different plant comparments. Groundnut yields outperformed all of the cereals across most growing conditions, nutritional and feed indicators. Maize and rice provided the highest caloric yields, with the least fertile growing conditions. Sorghum provided average to high caloric and iron yields across all of the treatments. Millet provided the highest iron yields and high fuel yields across most treatments. Some simulated treatments could not be compared against literature review data because of their absence in actual cropping systems and the lack of experimental data. Plant production was simulated with higher accuracy than the other components of the simulation. In particular, there is a need to better parameterize and validate the rice, groundnut and millet models under Sudanian savanna conditions in order to perform more accurate comparative assessments among species.

AB  - Clear cut harvest simplifies and eliminates old growth forest structure, negatively impacting biodiversity. Partial cut harvest has been hypothesized (1) to have less impact on biodiversity than clear cut harvest, and (2) to encourage old growth forest structures. Long-term studies are required to test this hypothesis as most studies are conducted soon after harvest. Using epixylic bryophytes as indicators, this study addresses this knowledge gap. Fourteen years after harvest, we examined changes in epixylic bryophyte community composition richness and traits, and their microhabitats (coarse woody debris characteristics and microclimate) along an unharvested, partial cuts and clear cuts harvest treatment in 30 permanent plots established in the boreal black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of northwestern Quebec, Canada. Our results were compared to those of an initial post-harvest study (year 5) and to a chronosequence of old growth forests to examine species changes over time and the similarity of bryophyte communities in partial cut and old growth forests. Coarse woody debris (CWD) volume by decay class varied among harvest treatments with partial cuts and clear cuts recording lower volumes of early decay CWD. The epixylic community was richer in partial cuts than in mature unharvested forests and clear cuts. In addition, species richness and overall abundance doubled in partial and clear cuts between years 5 and 14. Species composition also differed among treatments between years 5 and 14. Furthermore, conditions in partial cut stands supported small, drought sensitive, and old growth confined species that are threatened by conditions in clear cut stands. Lastly, over time, species composition in partial cuts became more similar to old growth forests. Partial cuts reduced harvest impacts by continuing to provide favorable microhabitat conditions that support epixylic bryophytes. Also, partial cut harvest has the potential to encourage old growth species assemblages, which has been a major concern for biodiversity conservation in managed forest landscapes. Our findings support the promotion of partial cut harvest as an effective strategy to achieve species and habitat conservation goals.

AB  - Attenuation processes of chlorinated ethenes in complex near-stream systems result in site-specific outcomes of great importance for risk assessment of contaminated sites. Additional interdisciplinary and comprehensive field research is required to enhance process understanding in these systems. In this study, several methods were combined in a multi-scale interdisciplinary in-situ approach to assess and quantify the near-stream attenuation of a chlorinated ethene plume, mainly consisting of cisdichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), discharging to a lowland stream (Grindsted stream, Den mark) over a monitoring period of seven years. The approach included: hydrogeological characterisation, reach scale contaminant mass balance analysis, quantification of contaminant mass discharge, streambed fluxes of chlorinated ethenes quantified using Sediment Bed Passive Flux Meters (SBPFMs), assessment of redox conditions, temporal assessment of contaminant concentrations, microbial analysis, and compoundspecific isotope analysis (CSIA). This study site exhibits a special attenuation behaviour not commonly encountered in field studies: the conversion from an initially limited degradation case (2012-16), despite seemingly optimal conditions, to one presenting notable levels of degradation (2019). Hence, this study site provides a new piece to the puzzle, as sites with different attenuation behaviours are required in order to acquire the full picture of the role groundwater-surface water interfaces have in risk mitigation. In spite of the increased degradation in the near-stream plume core, the contaminant attenuation was still incomplete in the discharging plume. A conceptualization of flow, transport and processes clarified that hydrogeology was the main control on the natural attenuation, as short residence times of 0.5-37 days restricted the time in which dechlorination could occur. This study reveals the importance of: taking an integrated approach to understand the influence of all attenuation processes in groundwater - surface water interactions; considering the scale and domain of interest when determining the main processes; and monitoring sufficiently both spatially and temporally to cover the transient conditions.

AB  - Sweet cherries are attractive fruits due to their taste, color, nutritional value, and beneficial health effects. Sweet cherry is a highly perishable fruit and all quality attributes and the level of health promoting compounds are affected by growth conditions, picking, packing, transport, and storage. During production, the correct combination of scion x rootstock will produce fruits with higher firmness, weight, sugars, vitamins, and phenolic compounds that boost the fruit antioxidant activity. Orchard management, such as applying drip irrigation and summer pruning, will increase fruit sugar levels and total phenolic content, while application of growth regulators can result in improved storability, increased red coloring, increased fruit size, and reduced cracking. Salicylic acid, oxalic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, and methyl salicylate are promising growth regulators as they also increase total phenolics, anthocyanins, and induce higher activity of antioxidant enzymes. These growth regulators are now also applied as fruit coatings that improve shelf-life with higher antioxidant enzyme activities and total phenolics. Optimizing storage and transport conditions, such as hydro cooling with added CaCl2, chain temperature and relative humidity control, are crucial for slowing down decay of quality attributes and increasing the antioxidant capacity. Application of controlled atmosphere during storage is successful in delaying quality attributes, but lowers ascorbic acid levels. The combination of low temperature storage in combination with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is successful in reducing the incidence of fruit decay, while preserving taste attributes and stem color with a higher antioxidant capacity. A new trend in MAP is the use of biodegradable films such as micro-perforated polylactic acid film that combine significant retention of quality attributes, high consumer acceptability, and a reduced environmental footprint. Another trend is to replace MAP with fruit edible coatings. Edible coatings, such as various lipid composite coatings, have advantages in retaining quality attributes and increasing the antioxidant activity (chitosan) and are regarded as approved food additives, although studies regarding consumer acceptance are needed. The recent publication of the sweet cherry genome will likely increase the identification of more candidate genes involved in growing and maintaining health related compounds and quality attributes.

AB  - Rivers and river lakes, i.e., lakes that are part of river systems, provide distinctive geomorphic and hydrologic conditions for riparian plants. This variation between lotic and lentic water bodies results in various environments for establishment and growth of plants, but also presents a range of conditions under which plant propagules are transported and deposited along riverbanks and lakeshores. Propagules may be differentially deposited in specific types of fluvial settings depending on their buoyancy. Among riverbanks and lakeshores, we predicted that lakeshores would capture the highest proportion of long-floating seeds, because short floaters will sink before reaching the shoreline. We also predicted that turbulent reaches would receive the highest proportion of short-floating seeds, because these are the sections where buoyancy is least important. Tranquil reaches of rivers were predicted to be intermediate between turbulent reaches and lakes with respect to their efficiency in capturing of long- and short-floating seeds. We tested whether these differences were mirrored in the floras of the different reach types, using reaches of a range of current velocities in 67 sites along a free-flowing river system in northern Sweden. We also related floristic differences to environmental conditions in each of the three reach types (turbulent sections, tranquil sections, and river lakes).
   The proportions of species with long-floating propagules, herbs, and aquatic species were higher along river lakeshores and tranquil reaches than along turbulent reaches, and the opposite was, true for species with short-floating propagules, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, and terrestrial species. The patterns remained when the largest species groups (herbs and graminoids) were tested for floating ability, i.e., the highest proportions of long-floating herbs and graminoids were found in lakes, and the lowest in turbulent reaches; tranquil reaches were intermediate or similar to lakes. Exposure to waves and currents and peat cover explained most of the variation in proportions of species with different floating abilities. We suggest that reach type is a good indicator for predicting the composition of riparian vegetation, especially the proportionate representation of species with various dispersal traits. These results suggest that there is a functional relationship between dispersal traits, channel characteristics, and plant community composition.

AB  - Lactation has been negatively associated with fertility because pregnancy rates in maiden heifers exceed those obtained after first or subsequent calvings. The extent of this difference is less in pasture-fed dairy cows (< 10%) than in American Holsteins (> 20%) fed grain and conserved forages. The latter cows have pregnancy rates to first insemination and oestrus detection rates of only 40 to 45%. This suggests that the subsequent fertility of inherently fertile Holstein heifers may be severely compromised by high levels of milk production. International comparisons show that pasture-fed dairy cows may experience extended periods of anovulatory anoestrum but have normal fertility (60% pregnancy rate to first insemination) once cycling, The high-producing American Holstein may ovulate within 4 weeks postpartum but is more likely to continue ovulating without being detected in oestrus.
   Both situations are associated with negative energy balances (NEB) during early lactation. The severity and duration of this NEB may vary with body condition at calving, age or parity, ration formulation, production level and environmental factors. Relative daily milk yield is not an absolute indicator of NEB, because some lower producing cows within a herd have lower feed intakes and more severe energy deficits. NEB is not simple to measure; nonetheless, it is correlated with genetic improvement for milk yield.
   A positive energy balance, greater weight gain and higher body condition score have all been shown to be positively correlated with plasma progesterone concentrations in early lactation. No studies have investigated the possibility that the rapid increase in metabolic rate at this time may also alter steroid concentrations with consequent effects on oestrous behaviour and fertility.
   Studies to more precisely define the effects of increasing milk yields in early lactation, especially in Holsteins, may need to be completed in Australia and New Zealand. Oestrus detection rates and pregnancy rates for American Holsteins of less than 50% are accepted widely in the USA. Such low detection rates confound studies on fertility. The objective should be to increase these 2 rates to at least 80% and 60% respectively. This may involve the use of controlled breeding, especially if oestrous behaviour is less overt in high-producing Holstein cows.

AB  - Medicine is still very inadequate in forecasting recovery of tipping points in health and disease, especially in older adults. However, increasingly, diseases and invasive treatments unexpectedly push older patients with low resilience over their tipping points (TPs). These TPs are the points in human physiology that separate more healthy conditions from disease conditions or malfunctioning of the older human's subsystems or organs, such as delirium, syncope and falls in old age, which threaten the functioning of the older person as a whole. Either the person may recover from the perturbation induced by such a subsystem TP and the balance of the whole system is restored, or the TP may set in motion a cascade of events driving the system down to a state of more decline, ultimately leading to death. A main unanswered question here is how to predict whether these older persons will recover or not. To improve this TP-recovery-forecasting, intriguing findings on measures of resilience found in other complex biological systems may be translated to humans. New dynamic resilience biomarkers for resilience can enrich clinical prediction for pathophysiological recovery and could test interventions for their effectiveness in improving resilience. Therefore, we hypothesize that dynamic, stimulus-response measures of recovery rate over time, observed after having received a minor stressor in a healthy condition, can be used to quantify recovery potential following subsystem TPs in disease and following invasive treatments in humans and thus the person's resilience. Current static frailty prognostics can predict risks for death, institutionalization, delirium, falls, and other TP transitions, but it has not been proven that they can predict recovery. Our hypothesis on dynamic indicators of recovery is logical and timely, as it can now be studied with sensor technology to create a fundamentally different approach of variables that may be validated to forecast recovery potential. By generating dynamic measures of systemic resilience over various organ systems, we may subsequently model resilience generically across many chronic diseases, affecting different organ systems. Next, quantifying systemic resilience may reroute scientific and clinical pathways by predicting and preventing irreversible tipping points and by improving recovery by older adults.

AB  - The study of the degradation of the properties of subsiding soils under the conditions of technogenesis led to the need for searching the relationship between changes in the soil physical properties, deformability, strength and its dispersity. Many researchers focus on the influence of the soil microstructure and its changes on the processes of deformation and collapse. Current models of the distribution of particles and pores in various soil media, cavities of various origin and cracks are based on the theory of fractals. Techniques for a practical application of the theory to estimating the scope of work, calculating the indicators, and engineering-geological forecasting are being developed. The previous studies showed that the theory of fractals, applied to the investigation of subsidence degradation, allowed an assessment of deformations arising from the decomposition of microaggregates in loess deposits of the city of Dnipro. A long period analysis of changes in the properties of loess deposits on the territory of the city of Kryvyi Rih showed that the changes in physical properties and conditions had a regional character. The paper presents the results of experimental studies of the microaggregate composition of loess samples taken in the depth interval of 1 - 7 m in the zone of influence of Kryvyi Rih. The microaggregate composition was determined by the new method, which we tested while studying the loess of the city of Dnipro. The total number of particle size analyses performed was 128. The results of the analyses were used to estimate the fractal dimension of the function of particle distribution by volume. The values of the function vary slightly, but the nature of the changes differs depending on the method of sample preparation for the analysis and its dispersity. Strength indexes have been determined with Physical. It has been shown that there is a correlation between the content of fine particles and the values of limiting tangential stresses Indicators of the physical condition are the repressors of tangential stress values. According to the results of the correlation analysis, the values of the soil density, the upper and lower limits of plasticity, and the content of particles with a size of 0.05-0.001 mm and less than 0.001 mm were selected as repressors.

AB  - A major challenge for the global avocado industry is to provide a homogenous product in terms of fruit ripening behavior, especially considering the significant variability in quality that can be found within a box or pallet of the fruit. The broad range of conditions under which trees are grown, particularly with regard to climate, soil and agronomical management, can influence this ripening variability. The aims of this study were (i) to determine the variability in fruit ripening among 'Hass' avocado grown under different conditions in Chile and (ii) to understand the postharvest fruit-ripening behavior of 'Hass' avocado due to the combined effect of several preharvest variables. Preharvest variables were evaluated at 42 experimental sites in Chile during three consecutive seasons. In addition, avocados with over 21% dry matter were collected at each site during each season and stored for 35 d at 5 degrees C under normal atmospheric conditions before being ripened at 20 degrees C. Indicators of ripening behavior, such as the softening rate (SOFTRATE), change in peel color (COLO35) and days at 20 degrees C necessary to reach the ready to-eat stage (RTE35), were evaluated. As expected, high fruit variability in terms of ripening behavior was observed among the experimental sites and seasons. MultiVariate analysis showed that the seasonal mean minimum air temperature, seasonal degree-days, trunk diameter and fruit firmness at harvest had a proportional relationship with postharvest SOFTRATE and COLOR35 during storage and a significant inverse relationship with RTE35. Conversely, the leaf area index, number of plants per hectare, and irrigation management at the bloom stage had a proportional relationship with RTE35 and an inverse relationship with SOFTRATE and COLOR35. Moreover, all of the three postharvest ripening behavior indicators were significantly (p < 0.05) estimated by predictive models considering preharvest variables. Therefore, attempting to predict postharvest behavior by considering only a single preharvest variable could be a misleading simplification of reality because several factors, including climate/environmental, agronomic management and physiological variables, influence the ripening behavior of 'Hass' avocado fruit.

AB  - To effectively meet growing food demands, the global agronomic community will require a better understanding of factors that are currently limiting crop yields and where production can be viably expanded with minimal environmental consequences. Remote sensing can inform these analyses, providing valuable spatiotemporal information about yield-limiting moisture conditions and crop response under current climate conditions. In this paper we study correlations for the period 2003-2013 between yield estimates for major crops grown in Brazil and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) - an indicator of agricultural drought that describes anomalies in the actual/reference evapotranspiration (ET) ratio, retrieved using remotely sensed inputs of land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI). The strength and timing of peak ESI-yield correlations are compared with results using remotely sensed anomalies in water supply (rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission; TRMM) and biomass accumulation (LAI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS). Correlation patterns were generally similar between all indices, both spatially and temporally, with the strongest correlations found in the south and northeast where severe flash droughts have occurred over the past decade, and where yield variability was the highest. Peak correlations tended to occur during sensitive crop growth stages. At the state scale, the ESI provided higher yield correlations for most crops and regions in comparison with TRMM and LAI anomalies. Using finer scale yield estimates reported at the municipality level, ESI correlations with soybean yields peaked higher and earlier by 10 to 25 days in comparison to TRMM and LAI, respectively. In most states, TRMM peak correlations were marginally higher on average with municipality-level annual corn yield estimates, although these estimates do not distinguish between primary and late season harvests. A notable exception occurred in the northeastern state of Bahia, where the ESI better captured effects of rapid cycling of moisture conditions on corn yields during a series of flash drought events. The results demonstrate that for monitoring agricultural drought in Brazil, value is added by combining LAI with LST indicators within a physically based model of crop water use.

AB  - Background Population-based studies have found that black patients with congestive heart failure have a higher mortality rate than white patients with the same condition. This finding has been attributed to differences in the severity, causes, and management of heart failure, the prevalence of coexisting conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Although these factors probably account for some of the higher mortality due to congestive heart failure among blacks, we hypothesized that racial differences in the natural history of left ventricular dysfunction might also have a role.
   Methods Using data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) prevention and treatment trials, in which all patients received standardized therapy and follow-up, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction among black and white participants. The mean (+/-SD) follow-up was 34.2+/-14.0 months in the prevention trial and 32.3+/-14.8 months in the treatment trial among the black and white participants.
   Results The overall mortality rates in the prevention trial were 8.1 per 100 person-years for blacks and 5.1 per 100 person years for whites. In the treatment trial, the rates were 16.7 per 100 person-years and 13.4 per 100 person-years, respectively. After adjustment for age, coexisting conditions, severity and causes of heart failure, and use of medications, blacks had a higher risk of death from all causes in both the SOLVD prevention trial (relative risk, 1.36; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.74; P=0.02) and the treatment trial (relative risk, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.50; P=0.02). In both trials blacks were also at higher risk for death due to pump failure and for the combined end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure, our two predefined indicators of the progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
   Conclusions Blacks with mild-to-moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction appear to be at higher risk for progression of heart failure and death from any cause than similarly treated whites. These results suggest that there may be racial differences in the outcome of asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. (N Engl J Med 1999;340:609-16.)

AB  - Wetland sediments are considered as prominent documents for studying climate change and sedimentary environments globally. Environmental changes (whether in climate, terrain, or in both) affect the process of sedimentation. The sediment changes are also reflected in the physical and chemical properties of sediments through which the process and the environment of sedimentation in the ancient times can be tracked. There are several methods for identifying climatic conditions in the past, such as isotopic studies, vegetation identification, sedimentology, and geochemistry of elements. In this research, after the registration of the sediments, to reconstruct the past climatic conditions of the Hoor-Al-Azim wetland, the changes in manganese, calcium, iron, and aluminum elements along with three sedimentary cores at three stations were studied, and age determination with carbon-14 isotope in Core 3 was applied to determine the sedimentation rate. The depth of the cores taken was 50 cm and the number of specimens in each core was 11; a total of 132 samples were sent to the steel company of Khuzestan, so that the concentration of metals could be measured by ICP-OES. To determine the age of the 15, 30, and 45 cm depths taken from the southernmost core, sediment samples were sent to the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory in Poland. The average sedimentation rate in Hoor-Al-Azim wetland is around 0.3 mm per year and the core covers about 1500 years. As calcium, manganese, iron, and aluminum are the important indicators for determining the chronic climatic conditions and are sensitive to the climatic changes, and due to the anomalies of these elements along the cores, about 700 years ago, with decreasing calcium and elevated iron, alumina and manganese elements are the wet climates that have led to the introduction of continental cessation deposits into the basin. After this period, the increase in calcium levels, which indicates an increase in sediment in the basin is considered as the beginning period of dry climate in the region. Of course, the effects of the changes of Karkheh River and the impact of human factors on these changes should not be neglected.

AB  - Background Florida's Everglades is a vast freshwater peatland that has been impacted by the alterations of hydrological pattern and water quality which led to changes in plant species composition and biodiversity. In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in cattail (Typha domingensis) are evaluated as indicators of environmental changes in the Everglades wetlands along nutrient and hydrological gradients represented by reference sites with total phosphorus (TP) < 10 mu g L-1, transition sites with TP >= 10 mu g L-1 < 20 mu g L-1 and impacted sites with TP >= 20 mu g L-1 which differed in hydrology or habitats (marsh and canal). Results Cattail delta C-13 values decreased significantly from reference (-24.1 parts per thousand), transition (-26.8 parts per thousand) to the impacted sites (-28.2 parts per thousand). In contrast, delta N-15 values increased significantly from reference (-5.2 parts per thousand), transition (2.4 parts per thousand) to the impacted site (5.9 parts per thousand). In response to a poor hydrological condition, cattail in marsh area displayed C-13 enrichment (-26.0 parts per thousand) and N-15 depletion (0.2 parts per thousand). By contrast, cattail grown in the canal sites with favorable hydropattern displayed C-13 depletion (-27.6 parts per thousand) and N-15 enrichment (5.9 parts per thousand) from the canal sites with more favorable hydrological condition. Conclusions The different patterns for the changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 in cattail suggested that increased nutrients led to increased stomatal conductance and C-13 fractionation during carbon uptake and decreased N-15 fractionation with increasing nitrogen demand while poor hydrological condition coupled with low nutrients led to reduced plant growth indicated by higher delta C-13 and lower delta N-15 values. Findings from this study suggested that delta C-13 in emerged macrophytes such as cattail can be used as an indicator for environmental stress while delta N-15 is a robust indicator for wetland eutrophication.

AB  - There was an increase and intensification of droughts in connection with global climate change in recent decades. Not all plant organisms are able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, the question of stress-resistant (drought-resistant) genotypes selection for breeding is quite urgent. This problem also concerns forest tree plants, including Scots pine, which is one of the main foresters in the Voronezh region.The results of vegetative and generative sphere analysis of individual Scotch pine trees with the help of biotechnology, molecular-genetic and cytogenetic method are given in this study. The possibility of applying the tissue culture method in vitro for testing initial plants for stress resistance, including drought resistance, is explained by the interconnection of cells, tissues and the whole plant properties. It is shown that the cytogenetic characteristics of the seed progeny and the indicators of callusogenic reactions do not always coincide in different genotypes: in some cases energy resources are spent on ontogeny protection, while, in other cases, to reproductive function maintain. There are trees, in which the state the generative sphere in arid years is at the level of optimal years, and their callus cultures reaction remains unchanged even under simulated conditions of drought. Based on the results obtained for the selection of Scots pine drought-resistant genotypes we suggest applying a system of criteria characterizing both the ability of the vegetative sphere to survive in drought conditions on the basis of the tissue culture method in vitro (callus tissue formation speed, its viability, frequency of callusogenesis), and the state of the generative sphere with the help of cytogenetic analysis of seed progeny (frequency of mitosis pathologies, the proportion of cells with micronuclei, mitotic activity). The expediency of applying the biotechnological approach was proved by analysis of the gene expression level of stress proteins: the level of AbaH gene expression correlates greatly with the indicator of the viability of callus cultures, including ones on a nutrient medium with an additional stress agent (NaCl). Trees that can be assigned to drought-resistant ones, according to the results of the analysis, should be recommended for use in breeding.

AB  - As a result of a rapidly changing climate the resilience of forests is an increasingly important property for ecosystem management. Recent efforts have improved the theoretical understanding of resilience, yet its operational quantification remains challenging. Furthermore, there is growing awareness that resilience is not only a means to addressing the consequences of climate change but is also affected by it, necessitating a better understanding of the climate sensitivity of resilience. Quantifying current and future resilience is thus an important step towards mainstreaming resilience thinking into ecosystem management. Here, we present a novel approach for quantifying forest resilience from thinning trials, and assess the climate sensitivity of resilience using process-based ecosystem modeling. We reinterpret the wide range of removal intensities and frequencies in thinning trials as an experimental gradient of perturbation, and estimate resilience as the recovery rate after perturbation. Our specific objectives were (i) to determine how resilience varies with stand and site conditions, (ii) to assess the climate sensitivity of resilience across a range of potential future climate scenarios, and (iii) to evaluate the robustness of resilience estimates to different focal indicators and assessment methodologies. We analyzed three long-term thinning trials in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests across an elevation gradient in Austria, evaluating and applying the individual-based process model iLand. The resilience of Norway spruce was highest at the montane site, and decreased at lower elevations. Resilience also decreased with increasing stand age and basal area. The effects of climate change were strongly context-dependent: At the montane site, where precipitation levels were ample even under climate change, warming increased resilience in all scenarios. At lower elevations, however, rising temperatures decreased resilience, particularly at precipitation levels below 750800 mm. Our results were largely robust to different focal variables and resilience definitions. Based on our findings management can improve the capacity to recover from partial disturbances by avoiding overmature and overstocked conditions. At increasingly water limited sites a strongly decreasing resilience of Norway spruce will require a shift towards tree species better adapted to the expected future conditions.

AB  - Understanding the physical and biogeochemical processes that control the exchange of biogenic carbon within and between the arctic shelves. slopes, and deep basins is a key objective of the Western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interaction program (SBI). Here, egg production (EP) of the dominant copepod Calanus glacialis/marshallae was used as an indicator of food limitation for the mesozooplankton community in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in spring and summer, 2002. Both C glacialis and C marshallae may occur in this region but the two cannot easily be differentiated visually. Four oceanographic regions were objectively identified that roughly corresponded to the different pathways in circulation of nutrient-rich Pacific water. A 'transition' region characterized by 'older' Pacific water was located at the shelfbreak and separated the nutrient-rich shelf water and the low-nutrient waters of the deep basin. The observed spatial pattern in EP in C. glacialis/marshallae in spring and summer resulted both from the different water mass environments and from the reproductive cycle of the species. EP was greater on the shelf than in the basin, corresponding to differences in body size and nitrogen condition factor (NCF) in females, while the egg viability was generally high throughout the study area. EP showed no relationship with low-chlorophyll a biomass under heavy ice-cover in spring, while a significant relationship was observed in the more open water in Summer. Adult female carbon condition factor (CCF) was much higher in summer, reflecting the accumulation of lipids during the growth season. Small animals with a markedly greater NCF dominated on the shelf. The shelfbreak region contained a mixture of females from the shelf and the basin with intermediate sizes, conditions. and EP rates. The occurrence of water typical of the 'transition' shelfbreak region and elevated EP in C glacialis/marshallae offshore on the Barrow Canyon and East Barrow sections indicated offshore transport of productive shelf water and the associated plankton community. The input of nutrient-rich Pacific water and accompanying elevated production to the northern Chukchi Sea and the Chukchi-Beaufort shelfbreak region may contribute to the reproductive Success of C glacialis/marshallae in this region.

AB  - The distribution of molybdenum, cadmium, zinc, vanadium and nickel, all redox-sensitive metals, was analyzed under a spatial (surface sediment samples) and temporal (core samples) perspective, in order to identify the potential of these metals for palcoxygenation interpretations in Mejillones bay, a hypoxic environment of northern Chile. Lithogenic supply (according to aluminum) was discarded. Biogenic flux is not the unique factor that controls the mechanism of metals preservation in sediments of this bay. Spatial variation of metals concentration was investigated in relation to the bottom water oxygenation in each sampling station. Results showed that only Ni and Cd present a strong correlation with dissolved oxygen, increasing their concentration toward the deepest area of the bay were an oxygen minimum zone prevails with values around 0.02 mL L-1. The temporal variation in redox-sensitive metals, recorded in three sediments core covering the last 2,000 years, showed that bottom oxygenation of the bay changed from a more oxygenated environment in the past to a less oxygenated environment at present. A biogenic flux across a very well developed oxycline. associated to an anoxic sediment-water interface, are proposed to be the principal factors to explain the metal concentrations preserved in Mejillones sediments during non-El Nino condition. When El Nino is present in the bay, the water column turn oxic, and the precipitation of redox-sensitive metals drops; so the concentration of metals decrease in the sediments. Thus, differences in concentration of metals in core top (sampled in 1996) and surface sediments (sampled in 2000) in the same area of the bay, were attributed to El Nino 1997-1998 that provoked a decrease in the flux of metals (principally nickel and cadmium) toward the sediments in a more oxygenated bottom environment. All these information show that among the five metals analyzed, only nickel and cadmium seem to record paleoxygenation conditions in Mejillones. However their use as proxy is limited to the cases when extreme changes from anoxic to oxic conditions occurred in bottom sediments of this bay.

AB  - Many terrestrial vertebrate species are exhibiting geographic distribution changes including poleward range limit shifts in response to increases in regional temperature. Bats are a highly mobile taxa capable of rapid responses to changes in abiotic or biotic conditions. In North America, recent extralimital records of the non-hibernating Lasiurus seminolus (Seminole bat) have been attributed to climate change, however such attributions remain speculative and potentially subject to sampling bias in the form of increased recent sampling efforts at latitudes north of the historical range. We used historical occurrence records and simple environmental variables within a Maxent modeling framework to model the historical distribution of suitable areas for this species. We transferred the model using near current environmental conditions and measured the ability of the model to capture the apparent expansion in distribution using recent extralimital occurrence records. Our model transferred well over time concluding that the distribution expansion may be largely attributed to increasing minimum temperatures. We used the model to forecast the expansion in distribution of suitable areas at three 20-year intervals and various climate change scenarios and provide extrapolation risk maps for each scenario. Although increasing temperatures may increase potentially occupiable areas, the species is associated with forests and often roosts in pines (Pinus spp.). This suitable habitat is more limited to the northwest of the species' range, which may constrain the future species expansion despite favorable temperatures. We demonstrated this effect by mapping limiting factors through future climate change scenarios. We discovered a broad shift of effects that constrained the distribution from minimum temperature to an abundance metric of evergreen cover type as time and climate change intensity increased. Although uncertainties exist, we predict further expansion of the Seminole bat widely over the next 60 years across the eastern United States where suitable habitat and climate conditions converge. Our results appear consistent with other bat species showing similar range extensions and in turn provide further evidence that bats may serve as bioindicators of global change.

AB  - Organic matter preservation and associated conditions during deposition, important in the context of fossil fuel exploration, are commonly determined by advanced geochemical analyses. However, the relation between organic matter preservation and magnetic mineral composition remains poorly constrained. The aim of the studies was to check the potential of magnetic mineral differentiation between facies containing various amounts of organic matter as a factor to better understand the processes which influence water chemistry at the bottom of sedimentary basins, and thus to better understand factors controlling the preservation of organic matter. To determine the composition and the properties of magnetic minerals, detailed low-temperature measurements of Saturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetization and hysteresis loops were performed on two types of rocks, Silurian shales from the Baltic Basin (northern Poland). The analysed shale facies are characterized by similar thermal evolution, but different amounts of organic matter: the Pelplin Formation, containing a modest content of organic matter, in which we also examined early diagenetic carbon concretions; and the Jantar Formation, which represents an organic-rich 'sweet spot' layer. In both facies, the results indicate the presence of multi-or pseudo-single domain magnetite, which is interpreted as detrital in origin. However, the main observation gained from this study is the relation between magnetic mineral assemblage in the studied shales and the amount of organic matter: in the rocks with modest amounts of organic matter we observed hematite, while in organic-rich layers hematite was absent. Hematite (mostly single-domain grains) preserved in the Pelplin Formation suggests that stable oxygen-rich conditions were present at the bottom of the sedimentary basin continuously during deposition, concretion cementation and compaction. In turn, its absence in the Jantar Formation suggests that during sedimentation and early diagenesis more anoxic conditions appeared. Generally, findings show that the presence of hematite is related to the significantly lower amount of organic matter in sedimentary rocks. Thus, presence of this mineral may be a useful indicator of organic matter preservation.

AB  - Bottom current-related bedforms, such as depositional and erosive features, are useful indicators of oceanographic circulation and sedimentary balance conditions in both modern and ancient marine environments. The Eocene-Oligocene transition in northern Santos Basin is seismically expressed as a prominent, high-amplitude reflector (horizon H8.1) that truncates Eocene prograding clinoforms and records a major transgression in the basin associated to global and local environmental changes. This surface is punctuated by circular depressions, elongated depressions, mounds and conic features, which, based on seismic interpretation, are associated with the escape of gas on the paleoseafloor. Elongated negative features with a head and an erosive tail (comet marks) are associated with the erosive action of bottom currents that, when encounters an obstacle or bottom irregularity such as pockmarks, create a downflow, linear furrow (tail). The occurrence of carbonate mounds and mud volcanoes may affect the erosive power of the flow by deflecting and/or focusing undercurrents. In the study area, parallel to subparallel comet marks occur abundantly on the former outer shelf and upper slope, being up to 1.2 km long, 200 m wide, and 30 m deep. These dimensions allow the classification of such bedforms as giant comet marks, which form as a result of erosion of the irregular sea floor by currents as fast as 0.6 m s(-1). The strong alignment of the comet tails indicates paleocurrents to the NE on the Oligocene outer shelf and upper slope. Conditions for comet mark formation include the development of pockmarks due to gas seeps, reworking of pockmarks by vigorous and long-lived bottom currents and low sediment supply during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, a period marked by the opening of the Drake Pass and the establishment of undercurrents through the connection of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Bottom-current related bedforms on H8.1 in Santos Basin may thus be related to such paleoenvironmental changes. Although no pre-Quaternary comet marks have been reported before, their identification and mapping through 3D seismic data is a unique opportunity to assess paleoenvironmental conditions and paleo-circulation on continental margins.

AB  - During the sea water phase, Atlantic salmon is exposed to shifting environmental conditions affecting the physiology and metabolism of the fish. Strategic dietary supplements may enable the fish to sustain a higher growth rate during particular periods. In this experiment, a combination of two amino acids (L-arginine and L-glutamate, with supplementation levels 1.1% and 0.75%, respectively) was used as dietary supplements since earlier observations have indicated that these amino acids have versatile functions, influencing growth, reproduction and the immune response in animals. In the case of arginine, the control diet was set at assumed requirement level, while the test diet was supplemented further. The effects of this supplementation on feed intake and growth parameters were studied, as well as selected organ weight, biochemical, molecular and hormonal indicators. During the first experimental period (May-July), few significant effects were found. However, in the second period of the experiment ( July-September), a higher specific feeding rate (SFR), thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and specific growth rate (SGR) (p<0.05) occurred in fish fed the supplemented diet, together with a trend (p<0.1) for increased final body weight. The measured gene expression levels of Insulinlike growth factor (IGF) and growth hormone receptor gene did not correlate with the increased growth observed during the second period in fish fed the supplemented diet. Furthermore, no difference in total plasma IGF-I concentrations was found after the first period. After the second period, fish fed the supplemented diet had in fact a significantly lower plasma IGF-I level. Additionally, we found a higher relative weight of gastrointestinal sections and elevated levels of plasma arginine, urea and ornithine after the second period in fish fed the supplemented diet. We conclude that dietary supplementation of L-arginine and L-glutamate significantly increased feeding rate and growth during the second feeding period in autumn. This response appeared to occur when the two conditions of rapidly decreasing day lengths and high feed intake, were met (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A non-destructive indicator of seed water content could significantly help crop scientists with assessment of the effects of environmental conditions during drying on grain qualities or on seed physiological quality. This is particularly important for grain legumes which simultaneously bear pods of different ages. Visual assessment of pod colour has so far been used to date grain legume stages, but now colour can be easily and accurately measured with a portable spectrophotometer. Relationships between the spectrophotometer measurements and the pod and seed water contents were tested in various climatic contexts (3 years: 2000, 2001, 2002; field or greenhouse, two or three sowing dates) for two bean cultivars (Booster and Calypso) and also for one pea cultivar (Baccara) in 2003 near Angers, France. Among the different spectrophotometer measurements, hue angle (h) clearly shows the transition from green (h = 180 degrees) to yellow (h = 90 degrees) and then to red (h = 0 degrees). In each context, h and seed water content (SWC) relationships showed the same pattern of three linear phases: first a steady state ; then a sharp decrease from green (h = 106-108 degrees) to yellow (h=85-93 degrees) just before the end of the seed filling stage for Booster or between the end of the seed filling phase and the beginning of seed drying for Calypso and pea; finally, a slow decrease from yellow to ochre (h=75-78 degrees) during seed drying. For each bean cultivar, the parameters of the linear relationships showed no differences between maturation conditions. Therefore, 6h classes matching six SWC classes could be defined over a wide range of SWC between 0..56 and 0.2 g/g for Booster. However for Calypso and pea, only 3 h classes could be defined because of the tight relationships between h and SWC during the end of seed drying, which can be explained by pod walls drying faster than seeds. Hence, spectrophotometer measurements, if calibrated for a given cultivar of a species, could now be used to select pods with seeds of the same water content and therefore to study environmental effects on quality criteria either in controlled conditions or in the field.

AB  - 1. Surface sediment samples of subfossil chironomid head capsules from 47 lakes in southern West Greenland were analysed using multivariate numerical methods in order to explore the relationship between chironomid assemblages and selected environmental variables. The study lakes are located along a climate gradient ranging from coastal maritime conditions near the Davis Strait to a continental climate near the margin of the Greenland ice sheet.
   2. High-resolution surface water temperatures were measured through the summer season using automatic data loggers in 21 of the study lakes. The mean July surface water temperature (1999) ranged from 7.3 to 16.5 degreesC in the data set.
   3. In all lakes, a total of 24 chironomid taxa were recorded; Micropsectra, Psectrocladius, Chironomus and Procladius were the dominant genera. There was a strong correlation between the trophic variables [total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TN, TP)] and temperature, and in redundancy analysis (RDA) the three variables explained almost equal significant amounts of variation in the chironomid data (19.8-22.3%). However, temperature lost significant explanatory power when the effect of TN was partialled out in RDA.
   4. The lakes were classified using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) into eight groups defined by temperature, trophic variables, salinity (conductivity) and lake-morphometric data. Fourteen chironomid taxa showed significant differences in percentage abundances among groups, with Heterotrissocladius, Micropsectra, Ablabesmyia and Chironomus as the most robust group-indicator taxa. Forward selection of taxa in multiple discriminant analysis was used to fit chironomid assemblages into lake groups. Using only eight taxa, 95% of lakes were correctly classified at a second TWINSPAN division level (four groups) and 85% of lakes at a third division level (eight groups).
   5. This study showed that there is considerable potential in using subfossil chironomid head capsules as paleoenvironmental indicators in both short- and long-term (down-core) studies of lake ontogeny and palaeoclimate conditions in West Greenland. However, because of the strong correlation between temperature and trophic variables, a quantitative reconstruction of lake- and habitat-type is recommended, in combination with direct reconstruction of single variables such as temperature.

AB  - Progressively more evidence reveals the abundant occurrence of the C-31 homohopane with a 17 alpha, 21 beta-configuration (C-31 alpha beta) in immature peats. This compound is commonly considered to be an indicator of thermal maturity in petroleum source rocks, but in peats it has also been interpreted to reflect the oxidation and subsequent decarboxylation reactions of bacteriohopanepolyols with microbially mediated epimerization at C-17 that is catalyzed by the acidic peat conditions. To learn more about the environmental factors that affect the low-temperature isomerization of homohopanes, we investigated the distribution patterns of homohopanes in a well-studied peat core from the Dajiuhu peatland, central China, together with data from modern surface peat samples from Dajiuhu and three other locations. From comparison with paleotemperature and paleohydrologic records in the peat core, we hypothesize that the ratio of C-31 alpha beta hopane relative to the beta beta isomer (C-31 alpha beta/beta beta) is mainly influenced on a centennial to millennial timescale by ambient temperature with a secondary effect from redox conditions that are defined by peatland water levels. The surface peat samples revealed that relatively high C-31 alpha beta/beta beta values occurred under pH < 6. These results suggest that pH is indeed an important factor in the low-temperature isomerization of C-31 homohopanes, although the magnitude of the pH effect may be less than those of ambient temperature and redox conditions. In both surface peat and peat horizons from the Dajiuhu peatland, the amount of the C-31 alpha beta compound with R configuration relative to that with S configuration (C-31 R/S) varied closely with C-31 alpha beta/beta beta, suggesting that the epimerization at both C-17 and C-22 may happen synchronously and at similar rates. This study reveals that the isomerization of homohopanes has the potential to reflect paleoenvironmental changes in acidic peat deposits. In addition, acidic peat samples investigated in this and previous studies commonly have relatively high values of C-31 alpha beta/beta beta and C-31 R/S, highlighting the potential of homohopane isomers to be tracers of the delivery and deposition of organic matter from acidic settings.

AB  - Spatial patterns of soil delta N-15 reflect variation in rates of N-cycling processes across landscapes. However, the manner in which soil delta N-15 is affected by vegetation and topoedaphic properties under non-steady state conditions is understood poorly. Here we propose and evaluate a conceptual model that explains how soil delta N-15 values will respond to changes in disturbance regimes (intensification of grazing and removal of fire) and the resultant invasion of a subtropical grassland by woody vegetation dominated by Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite), a N-fixing tree legume. Spatially-specific sampling along a catena (hill-slope) gradient where woody plants are known to have displaced grasses over the past 100 years revealed a positive relationship between soil delta N-15 and delta C-13, and a negative relationship between NDVI and soil delta N-15 on upland portions of the landscape, indicating that plant cover is a critical determinant of delta N-15 spatial patterns. Because the dominant woody invader is a N-fixer, its invasion has increased N input and reduced soil delta N-15. However, while honey mesquite also invaded and came to dominate lowland portions of the landscape, soil delta N-15 values in woodlands of intermittent drainages were significantly elevated relative to those in uplands. This is likely attributable to higher soil moisture, clay content, and total N in the lower portions of the catena gradient, which create conditions favoring more rapid N-transformation rates, higher preferential 14 N losses (e. g., gaseous), and thus enrichment of N-15. Thus, while spatial and temporal variation of soil delta N-15 has the potential to be an indicator of disturbance-induced changes in the net N balance, its sensitivity is compromised in topoedaphic settings with where rates of N-transformation are high. Continued improvements in our understanding of controls over the spatial variability of soil delta N-15 at the landscape-scale will enhance our ability to use delta N-15 as a diagnostic tool for inferring N dynamics under both steady-state and disturbed conditions.

AB  - We examined how implicit and explicit memories contribute to sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching. Twenty subjects grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot that rendered spring-like resistance to movement. Subjects made rapid "out-and-back" reaches to capture a remembered visual target at the point of maximal reach extent. The robot's resistance changed unpredictably between reaches, inducing target capture errors that subjects attempted to correct from one trial to the next. Each subject performed over 400 goal-directed reaching trials. Some trials were performed without concurrent visual cursor feedback of hand motion. Some trials required self-assessment of performance between trials, whereby subjects reported peak reach extent on the most recent trial. This was done by either moving a cursor on a horizontal display (visual self-assessment), or by moving the robot's handle back to the recalled location (proprioceptive self-assessment). Control condition trials performed either without or with concurrent visual cursor feedback of hand motion did not require self-assessments. We used step-wise linear regression analyses to quantify the extent to which prior reach errors and explicit memories of reach extent contribute to subsequent reach performance. Consistent with prior reports, providing concurrent visual feedback of hand motion increased reach accuracy and reduced the impact of past performance errors on future performance, relative to the corresponding no-vision control condition. By contrast, we found no impact of interposed self-assessment on subsequent reach performance or on how prior target capture errors influence subsequent reach performance. Self-assessments were biased toward the remembered target location and they spanned a compressed range of values relative to actual reach extents, demonstrating that declarative memories of reach performance systematically differed from actual performances. We found that multilinear regression could best account for observed data variability when the regression model included only implicit memories of prior reach performance; including explicit memories (self-assessments) in the model did not improve its predictive accuracy. We conclude therefore that explicit memories of prior reach performance do not contribute to implicit sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching under conditions of environmental uncertainty.

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is an emerging oilseed crop combining both industrial and agronomic advantages. Camelina seed yield, oil and protein contents, and fatty-acid composition, vary across genotypes, environments, and agricultural practices. However, no studies have been conducted to identify and rank major limiting factors explaining yield and quality variations under on-farm conditions. Camelina performance was measured on 39 experimental strips corresponding to five camelina crop management routes (grown as an intercrop or sole crop), implemented in nine farmers' fields across northern France in 2017 and 2018. The ranking of candidate limiting factors, defined a priori from scientific literature, was carried out using a model mixing method based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Main limiting factors of camelina yield (ranging from 62 to 2585 kg ha(-1)) were nitrogen crop status at flowering stage and downy mildew. Camelina yield was indeed positively correlated with the Nitrogen Nutrition Index at flowering stage (R-2 = 0.44, p = 0.007). Oil content varied from 36.6 to 46.5 % and was negatively correlated with protein content. Main indicators explaining oil content variations were grain filling duration and downy mildew. Both poly-unsaturated and linolenic acid contents were positively correlated to grain filling duration, and negatively correlated to temperature during grain filling period. Camelina nitrogen status at flowering stage was mainly explained by N uptake of the intercropped species (pea or barley), and the amount of available inorganic nitrogen in the soil between sowing and flowering. Downy mildew was influenced by both weather conditions and the amount of weed biomass.
   This study showed a large variability in camelina seed yield and quality under on-farm conditions. The identification of the major limiting factors made it possible to pinpoint ways of improving camelina performance namely choosing genotypes with high resistance to mildew, better managing nitrogen fertilization or delaying camelina sowing date. Finally we also identified major research topics to be addressed to support the adoption of this new crop by farmers as the elaboration of the critical nitrogen dilution curve.

AB  - Nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2, collectively NOx) derived from vehicle exhausts are critical pollutants with significant implications for urban air quality and human and environmental health. In this study, we investigate trends in measured ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and NOx mixing ratios at urban traffic - dominated monitoring sites in the UK for the period 2009-2016. We apply an oxidant analysis approach alongside a number of assumptions to the ambient data to determine trends in the inferred primary NO2/NOx ratio, and examine evidence for enhanced vehicle "cold start" effects upon these inferred emissions. Ambient NO2 and NOx mixing ratios have experienced an overall decrease of 17.2% and 11.3% respectively for the locations considered over this time period. The inferred primary NO2/NOx ratio for the majority of the study locations is found to have fallen by 29% (from 0.175 to 0.125) as a monthly mean from 2009 to 2016, with a statistically significant median decrease of 0.32 percentage points per year. However, during cold weather (temperatures less than or equal to 5 degrees C), the inferred primary NO2/NOx ratio averaged across all locations, when compared with normal conditions (temperatures higher than 5 degrees C) increased from 0.062 (+/- 0.004) to 0.102 (+/- 0.001) (64.5% higher) and from 0.056 (+/- 0.004) to 0.098 (+/- 0.001) (75% higher) for cold morning and evening rush hours, with substantially greater increases at some sites. This "cold start" result suggests that the combination of recent vehicle driving history and ambient weather conditions, in conjunction with technological constraints on the operating temperature range of emission control systems in some vehicles, affects NOx emissions and hence has a detrimental impact upon air quality in urban environments. Increased cold start emissions imply an increased NO2 - derived health burden from air pollution, under certain meteorological conditions, assessment of which should consider changes in vehicle use as a result of weather, and hence altered personal exposure.

AB  - In the present study we analyzed the responses of wheat to mild salinity and drought with special emphasis on the so far unclarified interaction of these important stress factors by using high-throughput phenotyping approaches. Measurements were performed on 14 genotypes of different geographic origin (Austria, Azerbaijan, and Serbia). The data obtained by non-invasive digital RGB imaging of leaf/shoot area reflect well the differences in total biomass measured at the end of the cultivation period demonstrating that leaf/shoot imaging can be reliably used to predict biomass differences among different cultivars and stress conditions. On the other hand, the leaf/shoot area has only a limited potential to predict grain yield. Comparison of gas exchange parameters with biomass accumulation showed that suppression of CO2 fixation due to stomatal closure is the principal cause behind decreased biomass accumulation under drought, salt and drought plus salt stresses. Correlation between grain yield and dry biomass is tighter when salt- and drought stress occur simultaneously than in the well-watered control, or in the presence of only salinity or drought, showing that natural variation of biomass partitioning to grains is suppressed by severe stress conditions. Comparison of yield data show that higher biomass and grain yield can be expected under salt (and salt plus drought) stress from those cultivars which have high yield parameters when exposed to drought stress alone. However, relative yield tolerance under drought stress is not a good indicator of yield tolerance under salt (and salt plus drought) drought stress. Harvest index of the studied cultivars ranged between 0.38 and 0.57 under well watered conditions and decreased only to a small extent (0.37-0.55) even when total biomass was decreased by 90% under the combined salt plus drought stress. It is concluded that the co-occurrence of mild salinity and drought can induce large biomass and grain yield losses in wheat due to synergistic interaction of these important stress factors. We could also identify wheat cultivars, which show high yield parameters under the combined effects of salinity and drought demonstrating the potential of complex plant phenotyping in breeding for drought and salinity stress tolerance in crop plants.

AB  - Background and Aims Sea level rise (SLR) associated with climate change is intensifying permanent submersion and salinity in salt marshes. In this scenario, hybridization between native and invasive species may result in hybrids having greater tolerance of abiotic stress factors than their parents. Thus, understanding the responses of native and invasive halophytes and their hybrids to interacting physiological stresses imposed by SLR is key to native species conservation. We analysed how salinity, inundation depth and their interaction impact the functional traits of native and invasive cordgrass species and their hybrid (genus Spartina; Poaceae).
   Methods In a mesocosm experiment, we evaluated interactive stress effects of three inundation depths (4.5, 35.5 and 55 cm) and four aqueous salinities (0.5, 10, 20 and 40 ppt) on 27 functional traits of native Spartina foliosa, invasive S. densiflora and their hybrid S. densiflora x S. foliosa from San Francisco Estuary.
   Key Results The combined effect of salinity and inundation led to synergistic effects on leaf biochemical stress indicators. Spartina foliosa behaved as a stress-tolerant species, with high leaf sodium exudation rate and glycine betaine concentrations that also increased with stress. Spartina foliosa was less sensitive to salinity than S. densiflora and the hybrid but was highly growth-limited in response to increased inundation and salinity. Spartina densiflora was fast-growing in low-stress conditions and tolerated moderate interactive stresses. The hybrid produced more biomass, rhizome reserves and tillers than its parents, even under the most stressful conditions. Transgressivity improved the hybrid's capacity to deal with flooding stress more so than its response to increasing salinity.
   Conclusions Based on our observations, we predict that established populations of both native and invasive cordgrasses will experience reduced vegetative and sexual fitness in response to SLR. In particular, the combined effects of high salinity and deep inundation may decrease floret production in S. densiflora, a key trait for the spread of its invasive populations. In contrast, the hybrid likely will be able to sustain its invasiveness under SLR based on its ability to maintain growth and biomass production under stressful conditions.

AB  - Music or other background sounds are often played in barns as environmental enrichment for animals on farms or to mask sudden disruptive noises. Previous studies looking at the effects of this practice on non-human animal well-being and productivity have found contradictory results. However, there is still a lack of discussion on whether piglets have the ability to distinguish different types of music. In this study, we exposed piglets to different music conditions to investigate whether the piglets preferred certain music types, in which case those types would have the potential to be used as environmental enrichment. In total, 30 piglets were tested for music type preference to determine whether growing pigs respond differently to different types of music. We used music from two families of instruments (S: string, W: wind) and with two tempos (S: slow, 65 beats/min (bpm); F: fast, 200 bpm), providing four music-type combinations (SS: string-slow; SF: string-fast; WS: wind-slow; WF: wind-fast). The piglets were given a choice between two chambers, one with no music and the other with one of the four types of music, and their behaviour was observed. The results showed that SS and WF music significantly increased residence time (P<0.01) compared with the other music conditions. Compared with the control group (with no music), the different music conditions led to different behavioural responses, where SS music significantly increased lying (P<0.01) and exploration behaviour (P<0.01); SF music significantly increased tail-wagging behaviour (P<0.01); WS music significantly increased exploration (P<0.01); and WF music significantly increased walking, lying, standing and exploration (all P<0.01). The results also showed that musical instruments and tempo had little effect on most of the behaviours. Fast-tempo music significantly increased walking (P=0.02), standing (P<0.01) and tail wagging (P=0.04) compared with slow-tempo music. In conclusion, the results of this experiment show that piglets are more sensitive to tempo than to musical instruments in their response to musical stimulation and seem to prefer SS and WF music to the other two types. The results also suggest a need for further research on the effect of music types on animals.

AB  - Urgency of the research. Ukraine has made a European choice as the main direction of its state policy, both internal and external, whose ultimate goal should be the full membership in the European Union. However, it is necessary to consider that the access to world markets and formation of an open economy also mean an internal stability of the economy and financial system of the state.
   Target setting. The financial system of Ukraine in modern conditions is influenced by a number of threats, that are negatively affecting the level of financial security.
   Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. Fundamental research focused on problems of financial security of Ukraine, which became the basis for the development of scientific theory of security in the field of public finance, have been done in writings of A. Baranovsky, M. Ermoshenko, V. Muntiyan, A. Sukhorukov. Today a large number of works is devoting to the study of particular aspects and components of the financial security of the state.
   Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. The variability of the external environment and recent events in the European Union require in-depth study of the influence of integration processes on the financial security of Ukraine.
   The research objective. The main aim of the article is to summarize the issues and systematize the ways of providing financial security of Ukraine in conditions of European integration processes.
   The statement of basic materials. Research conducted by the author showed that the domestic financial system is very vulnerable to external and internal threats. The author has analyzed the dynamics of key macroeconomic indicators and indicators of financial security of the state during 2007-015. The threats that are most significant for the financial security of the state have been highlighted. The author considered the possible implications of the European skepticism on the financial security of Ukraine, and the directions to increase the level of financial security in the modern world.
   Conclusions. The government of Ukraine should focus on domestic reforms, the creation of living standards, economics and politics in Ukraine, which are as close as possible to European. Only then it is possible to implement effective mechanisms aimed at neutralizing, minimizing the impact and eliminating the phenomena and factors leading to the creation of external and internal threats to the state's financial security.

AB  - Trace metals (Cd, U, Co, Ni, Cu, Ba, Fe, Mn), total organic carbon (TOC) and C and N stable isotope signatures (delta C-313 and delta N-15) were determined in short sediments cores from the inner and outer shelf off Concepcion, Chile (similar to 36 degrees S). The objectives were to establish the effect of environmental conditions on trace metal distributions at two shelf sites, one affected by seasonal oxygenation and the other by permanent low oxygen conditions due to the presence of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We evaluate trace metals as proxies of past changes in primary productivity and the bottom water oxygen regime. Concentrations of pore water sulfides and NH4+ were also measured as indicators of the main diagenetic pathways at each site. Our results for the inner shelf (seasonal suboxia) suggest that the oxidative state of the sediments responds to seasonal pulses of organic matter and that seasonal oxygenation develops during high and low primary productivity in the water column. Here, positive fluxes (to the water column) estimated from pore water concentrations of several elements were observed (Ba, Co, Ni, Fe and Mn). The less reduced environment at this site produces authigenic enrichment of Cu associated with the formation of oxides in the oxic surface sediment layer, and the reduction of U within deeper sediment sections occur consistently with negative estimated pore water fluxes. In the outer shelf sediments (permanent suboxia, OMZ site), negative fluxes (to the sediment) were estimated for all elements, but these sediments showed authigenic enrichments only for Cd, Cu and U. The short oxygenation period during the winter season did not affect the accumulation of these metals on the shelf. The distribution of Cu, Cd and U have been preserved within the sediments and the authigenic accumulation rates estimated showed a decrease from the deep sections of the core to the surface sediments. This could be explained by a gradual decrease in the strength of the OMZ in the last 100 years, in combination with periods of strong oxygenations during El Nino events. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tunnel construction at Monte Mario hill (Rome) facilitated detailed study of the Monte Mario historical succession. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on foraminiferal assemblages in order to define new stratigraphical and palaeoecological constraints for this historical site. From a chronostratigraphic point of view, micropalaeontological data assign the basal part of the succession (Monte Vatican Formation) to the Early Pliocene (Zanclean Stage, upper part of Globorotalia puncticulata Zone) based on the presence of the marker species Globorotalia puncticulata. The presence of Dentoglobigerina altispira altispira, a well-known indicator of the upper Zanclean Stage in the Latium area, confirms the age assignment in agreement with nannoplankton data. The upper part of the Monte Mario Formation is attributed entirely to the Earls' Pleistocene (Calabrian - Santernian substage) based on the presence of Bulimina etnea Palaeoecological reconstructions are based on quantitative proxies (percentages of single taxa, inbenthic and oxyphilic species, diversity indices, %P [(P/P+B)%]) that were used to evaluate important palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions.
   Pliocene deposits (Monte Vatican Formation) record an upper bathyal environment characterised by warm oligotrophic water and well-oxygenated bottom water Pleistocene sediments (Monte Mario Formation) record highly variable environments controlled by sea level oscillations caused by the combined effects of tectonics and climate change. The deepest environments are recorded in the Pleistocene Farneto silts and represent an upper circalittoral environments that are characterised by cold water with enriched organic matter content and nearly eutrophic conditions. A more oxygenated, shallow-water environment with widespread vegetated cover is recorded from the Grey sands with Arctica islandica Member to the basal part of the Yellow sands with "panchina" Member More marginal environments developed successively as a result of a shallowing trend. Lagoon/brackish lagoon environments characterised by oligospecific euryhaline foraminiferal assemblages develop to the Yellow sands with silty intercalations Member The last member Clays and Cerastoderma-bearing sands, is characterised by the re-establishment of of normal marine infralittoral conditions of nutrient input and fresh-water influence. The succession ends with a more confined brackish lagoon environment, which relates to the progradational step of the uppermost portion of the Monte Mario Formation.

AB  - The distribution, lithology, palaeontology (pollen and spores, foraminifera, molluscs and dinoflagellate cysts), heavy mineral content and palaeomagnetic properties of the Chillesford Clay Member of the Norwich Crag Formation are described, and compared with those of the Easton Bavents Clay that outcrops further north. The Chillesford Clay is a discrete unit forming the top of the marine Plio-Pleistocene sequence between Aldeburgh and Orford, Suffolk; it rests conformably on the Chillesford Sand. Pollen spectra are dominated by non-arboreal pollen. Two local pollen assemblage biozones are recognized; the lower is similar to that of the Baventian, and the upper to that of the Pre-Pastonian a. A deterioration in climate from cool oceanic to cold is indicated. Foraminifera assemblages preserved in one sequence suggest a decline from temperate to cool conditions. Restricted mollusc assemblages found in one sequence may signify low temperatures. Dinoflagellate cyst floras differ from those of the Chillesford Sand and Easton Bavents Clay, and in all these deposits suggest warmer conditions than the other biological indicators, although their absence from part of the Chillesford Clay may indicate low temperatures. Heavy mineral suites from the Chillesford Clay, Easton Bavents Clay, Chillesford Sand and Red Crag Formation are similar and are more diverse than those of the overlying fluviatile Middle Pleistocene Kesgrave Formation; thus, the earlier concept of a distinctive mineralogy of the Easton Bavents Clay is refuted. Palaeomagnetic measurements were inconclusive.
   The Chillesford Clay is interpreted as a temporal correlative of the Easton Bavents Clay. Both deposits are thought to have been deposited in high intertidal conditions during the major marine regression that accompanied transition from the Bramertonian Stage (warm) to the Baventian cold Stage and Pre-Pastonian a cold Substage. This suggests that these two cold stages/substages are more closely related in time than previously thought, and that the relative stratigraphical positions of the Bramertonian and Baventian stages are the reverse of those originally envisaged. The Baventian to Pre-Pastonian a interval probably correlates with the Tiglian C4c Substage of the Netherlands sequence, and should be considered as part of a single cold stage, for which the Baventian has nomenclatural priority.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is regarded as the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis around the world. Even though it is generally considered to be a sensitive microaerobic pathogen, it is able to survive in the environment outside of the intestinal tract of the host. This study aimed to assess the impact of selected environmental parameters on the survival of 14 C. jejuni isolates of different origins, including 12 water isolates. The isolates were tested for their antibiotic resistance, their ability to survive at low temperature (7 degrees C), develop aerotolerance, and to interact with the potential protozoan host Acanthamoeba polyphaga. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion according to EUCAST. Out of the 14 isolates, 8 were resistant to ciprofloxacin (CIP) and 5 to tetracycline (TET), while only one isolate was resistant to erythromycin (ERY). Five isolates were resistant to two different antibiotic classes. Tetracycline resistance was only observed in isolates isolated from wastewater and a clinical sample. Further, the isolates were tested for their survival at 7 degrees C under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions using standard culture methods. The results showed that under microaerobic conditions, all isolates maintained their cultivability for 4 weeks without a significant decrease in the numbers of bacteria and variation between the isolates. However, significant differences were observed under aerobic conditions (AC). The incubation led to a decrease in the number of cultivable cells, with complete loss of cultivability after 2 weeks (one water isolate), 3 weeks (7 isolates), or 4 weeks of incubation (6 isolates). Further, all isolates were studied for their ability to develop aerotolerance by repetitive subcultivation under microaerobic and subsequently AC. Surprisingly, all isolates were able to adapt and grow under AC. As the last step, 5 isolates were selected to evaluate a potential protective effect provided by A. polyphaga. The cocultivation of isolates with the amoeba resulted in the survival of about 40% of cells treated with an otherwise lethal dose of gentamicin. In summary, C. jejuni is able to adapt and survive in a potentially detrimental environment for a prolonged period of time, which emphasizes the role of the environmental transmission route in the spread of campylobacteriosis.

AB  - The article presents the results of the analysis of economic indicators of economic entities of the regions with raw materials specialization, from the perspective of the goals and capabilities of medium and small-sized businesses. In modern conditions, due to the achievements of scientific and technological progress, the goals of the activity, and the potential of small and mediumsized businesses, the authors identify and analyze possible directions of diversification and modernization of the economy of these regions. The towns of commodity regions are located mainly in areas of adverse environmental conditions away from large industrial and cultural centers and in many cases depend on the performance of one or two large town-forming companies. Thus, the prospects of maintaining the attractiveness of doing business for small and medium enterprises in the towns of these regions as well as the attractiveness of these towns for the population were revealed and analyzed. As measures to maintain this attractiveness, the authors consider the possibility of diversifying and modernizing the economy of such towns by supporting the activities and development of small and medium enterprises, as well as implementing measures aimed at introducing the technologies of the "Smart City" concept.
   It is assumed that to diversify and modernize the economy of the commodity regions, it is necessary to create conditions for the revitalization of many areas of activity. In particular, it can be achieved through the implementation of "Smart City" projects in these regions. This should stimulate the process of activating the most technologically advanced and innovative areas of activity and have a positive impact on the development of small and mediumsized businesses involved in these areas. In turn, the stable and efficient functioning of such enterprises is one of the most significant tools for such transformations and can speed and intensify the efficiency of the implementation of these processes.
   At the same time, the use of "smart" technologies for making "smart" decisions, in the process of modernizing the urban economy included, will increase both the efficiency of functioning of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the mechanisms for supporting their activities and development.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is used as a critical indicator for various environmental issues because it links land surface fluxes with the surface atmosphere. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) 1 km LSTs have been widely utilized but have the serious limitation of not being provided under cloudy weather conditions. In this study, we propose two schemes to estimate all-weather 1 km Aqua MODIS daytime (1:30 p.m.) and nighttime (1:30 a.m.) LSTs in South Korea for humid summer days. Scheme 1 (S1) is a two-step approach that first estimates 10 km LSTs and then conducts the spatial downscaling of LSTs from 10 km to 1 km. Scheme 2 (S2), a one-step algorithm, directly estimates the 1 km all-weather LSTs. Eight advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperatures, three MODIS-based annual cycle parameters, and six auxiliary variables were used for the LST estimation based on random forest machine learning. To confirm the effectiveness of each scheme, we have performed different validation experiments using clear-sky MODIS LSTs. Moreover, we have validated all-weather LSTs using bias-corrected LSTs from 10 in situ stations. In clear-sky daytime, the performance of S2 was better than S1. However, in cloudy sky daytime, S1 simulated low LSTs better than S2, with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.6 degrees C compared to an average RMSE of 3.8 degrees C over 10 stations. At nighttime, S1 and S2 demonstrated no significant difference in performance both under clear and cloudy sky conditions. When the two schemes were combined, the proposed all-weather LSTs resulted in an average R-2 of 0.82 and 0.74 and with RMSE of 2.5 degrees C and 1.4 degrees C for daytime and nighttime, respectively, compared to the in situ data. This paper demonstrates the ability of the two different schemes to produce all-weather dynamic LSTs. The strategy proposed in this study can improve the applicability of LSTs in a variety of research and practical fields, particularly for areas that are very frequently covered with clouds.

AB  - The patterns of the distribution of nutrients in kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta (Siebold & Zucc.) Planch. ex Miq.), family Actinidiaceae (Gilg & Werderm), leaves growing under different soil and climatic conditions (Ukraine and China) were studied. Using scanning electron microscopy, significant differences were shown in the distribution of assimilates and mineral nutrients in the leaves of kiwiberry cultivated under different climate and soil conditions (Kyiv city, Ukraine and Jiamusi, China). The leaves of plants grown in China have higher concentration of all of the studied nutrients exception for silicon. The differences found in the content of macro- and microelements in plant tissues are consistent with their total content in the soil, and depend on the synthesis of low molecular weight organic compounds, namely, hydroxybenzoic, benzoic and triterpene acids. An increase in the silicon content in the leaves of kiwiberry plants grown in Ukraine indicates the moisture deficit in the soil. This conclusion is confirmed by the anatomical differences viz. the presence of additional integumentary formations and fewer stomata number per 1 mm(2) of leaf surface. The specific feature of 'Perlyna sadu' cultivar was high concentrations of sodium and aluminum in the foliar tissues, regardless of the place of growth. The analysis of the distribution of nutrients in the leaves located along the stem showed remobilization of the former within the three layers: the lower one nourishes the roots, the upper one nourishes the leaves in the active growth phase and the middle one allocates the assimilates in both directions. A significant positive relationship was found between the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments and electrophysiological activity, especially for the leaves of the lower zone. The revealed differentiation into layers differing in polarity of bioelectric potentials and the distribution of assimilates suggests functional differentiation of the kiwiberry leaves. In particular, the leaves of the lower layer perform a storage function. The middle part is less conservative and characterized by higher sensitivity to environmental factors performs a mainly synthetic function. The upper layer performs an active growth function. The results of the comparative analysis of the indicators of the number of chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells proved that the obtained dependence can be used as a diagnostic criterion in assessing the predicted plant productivity at the early stages of their development.

AB  - The eastern Chenor Pahang area of the Penyu Basin contains an untapped potential, in part due to poor knowledge of its organic facies characteristics The sedimentary succession of eastern Chenor Pahang area is dominated by fine to coarse grained sandstone occurring in association with oil shale and mudstone in a predominantly fining upward sequence. Detailed geochemical and petrographic characterization was carried out on oil shale and mudstone samples to evaluate the origin and type of organic matter (OM), as well as the paleoenvironmental conditions and organic richness of the Paleogene sedimentary succession. The facies are only enriched in total organic carbon (TOC), potential hydrocarbon yield (S2) and extractible organic matter (EOM) the types of organic matter are important index reflecting the potential of the source rock(s). Based on elemental ratios, the analyzed samples are shown to contain Types I and II kerogens. This finding is supported by the high hydrogen index (HI) of > 300 mg HC/g TOC and the presence of abundant liptinitic materials. Biomarker signatures [n-alkanes > n-C-25, high C-29/C-30 17 alpha (H) hopane ratios (0.8-3.3) and high C-29 steranes (49-78%)]. Low total sulfur and V/(V + Ni) ratio] suggest a predominantly terrestrial source input with some contribution from aquatic microorganisms as indicated by the common occurrence of amorphous organic matter. Combining this results with n-alkane patterns, kerogen types and organic petrography, predominance of C-29 sterane probably indicates a contribution of aquatic organisms such as green and brown algae (consistent with Botrycoccus braunii race A and Pediastrum contribution) and some influence of higher plants OM. Integration of biomarker studies with bulk geochemical and petrographic analysis suggests that the analyzed samples were deposited under suboxic conditions in a fresh water lacustrine environment. This finding is corroborated by the ratios of pristane/phytane, V/Ni and Sr/Br. High bioproductivity and a stratified fresh water column with suboxic bottom water condition enhanced OM preservation in the analyzed mudstone and shale facies. The high OM content in these samples maybe related to the fine-grained matrix of the mud rocks and the paleoclimate in the area.

AB  - In this article, a robust output-only real-time damage detection technique for multi-degree-of-freedom degrading systems using recursive canonical correlation analysis is presented. It has been observed that the impact of damage to a vibrating system gradually advances with time that sustains until the system degrades up to a considerable extent. Of significant interest is the effect of sudden damage in presence of continuous degradation in real-time, which is studied in the form of a sudden stiffness reduction in a separate floor. The proposed recursive canonical correlation analysis algorithm estimates the iterative update of eigenspace at each instant from the response data, thereby capturing the features of a time varying degrading structure in an online framework. Furthermore, recursive canonical correlation analysis algorithm is shown to reduce the computational cost by updating the eigenspace at each instant of time. This article explores newly developed recursive condition indicators: recursive Mahalanobis distance and recursive Itakura distance that elicit damage information from the eigenspace. In order to model degradation, simulations aimed at successfully capturing the behavior of the process in real-time becomes imperative. A general stochastic formulation of the coupled response-degradation problem accounting for the evolution of degradation is presented in the light of stiffness degradation problems. The evolution of time varying system responses is generated using a newly proposed Ito-Taylor expansion-based stochastic numerical integration formulation. Numerically simulated structural vibrating systems, namely, 2-degree-of-freedom base-isolated and 4-degree-of-freedom linear systems, have been used to check the performance of the recursive canonical correlation analysis method. The spatial damage detectability of the algorithm in real-time is explored through identifying crack location on a beam traversed by a vehicle. Finally, an experimental case study has been carried out to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The identification results for both numerical and experimental cases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in identification of nonlinear and time varying behavior associated with degrading structural systems.

AB  - The pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) has been selected as an ecological indicator to assess ecological effects on estuaries of implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan that seeks to restore historical freshwater flows and nearshore salinity regimes in southern Florida. Concern over altered freshwater delivery impacts on pink shrimp productivity was expressed as early as the 1960s. The present review assessed pink shrimp scientific literature of the past 75+ years (> 500 publications) to glean information relevant to understanding potential influence of freshwater management on pink shrimp productivity. The review was organized around "Essential Fish Habitat" metrics concerning abundance, growth, survival, distribution, productivity, and behavior. It summarizes previous pink shrimp field, laboratory, and modeling studies. Where possible, statistical analyses and meta-analyses of previously published data were performed to investigate consistency among independent findings. Pink shrimp occur in a wide range of salinities (0.5-67 ppt). A majority of studies (53.3%) reported maximal abundance between 20 to 35 ppt salinities. One laboratory study reported maximal growth at 30 ppt. Meta-analysis of reported growth rates did not yield results due to non-convergence of regression models. Reported survival was maximal at 30 ppt and remained high (> 80% survival) across salinities of 15 to 40 ppt. A regression model that combined survival data across studies confirmed a previously reported parabolic relationship between salinity and survival; in this regression, 35 ppt maximized survival. Productivity, conditional upon survival and growth, was maximized at polyhaline (18-30 ppt) conditions. Inshore hypersalinity (> 40 ppt) may elicit young pink shrimp behavioral cues counterproductive to settlement in nearshore areas. Virtually no information exists regarding postlarval pink shrimp movement or preference relative to salinity gradients. Realization and preservation of nearshore polyhaline conditions and elimination of hypersalinity should maximize growth, survival, and density, thus improving pink shrimp productivity. New and updated statistical models predicting pink shrimp distribution, abundance, growth, survival, and productivity relative to salinity conditions are needed to better guide freshwater management decisions.

AB  - Tolerance to desiccation is a highly desirable attribute for Rhizobium spp., which are widely used as symbionts of pasture legumes. Poor survival of Rhizobium spp. is of particular concern during the commercial formulation and seed application phase, but also when sown into dry fields and during saprophytic survival. Efforts have been made to protect Rhizobium spp. from desiccation, either by use of desiccation protectants in formulations, or by triggering generalised mechanisms of cellular stress tolerance. This study looked at the potential to isolate desiccation tolerant strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii that are intrinsically tolerant to desiccation. We investigated the influence of long term exposure to dry soil conditions, and rapid soil drying, as factors in selection of desiccation tolerance. Pasture soils were collected from 26 sites in New Zealand that ranged in soil moisture deficits (SMD) from 149 days per year (very dry) to 0 (wet). Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii populations were quantified (most probable number; MPN) in the field-fresh and dried (48 h forced air) samples from each site, and the percentage population survival determined. Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii survival after soil drying was strongly correlated to SMD (P < 0.001; R-2 = 0.42), providing evidence for strong selection for desiccation tolerant phenotypes in dry environments. Desiccation tolerance of R. leguminosarum by. trifolii isolated from nodules taken from white clover plants grown in fresh and dried soils from three sites was compared in a micro-droplet assay. Strains from plants grown in the dried soils were more tolerant to rapid drying under in vitro conditions (P < 0.001). Screening of a subset of strains on a range of osmolytes (phenotype microarray), showed desiccation tolerance was associated with tolerance to the salts sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, and ammonium sulphate, and ethylene glycol. Growth in the presence of ethylene glycol maybe useful surrogate indicators of desiccation tolerance in R. leguminosarum by. trifolii. Overall, these results show that environmental conditions can provide a basis for selection of populations with desiccation tolerance, and plant-based baiting can be used to recover strains with improved characteristics.

AB  - Since 1998, the genus Pseudochattonella has formed massive blooms off the coasts of Norway, Sweden and Denmark, causing comprehensive kills of cultured and wild fish. Isolates from a bloom of Pseudochattonella sp. in 2001 were found to be a new heterokont flagellate Pseudochattonella farcimen (Dictyochophyceae). Since then recurrent blooms of Pseudochattonella sp. have appeared both in the early and late spring in Scandinavian waters. P. farcimen is the only species of Pseudochattonella documented to bloom in the cold waters and low light conditions characterizing winter and early spring. This study aims at determining why P. farcimen is able to bloom under these environmental regimes. The effect of temperature and irradiance on the growth of P. farcimen cells, isolated from a bloom in 2009, was examined. Furthermore a possible allelopathic effect of P. farcimen on the growth of coexisting algae (i.e. Heterocapsa triquetra, Chaetoceros decipiens and Chaetoceros diadema) was examined. Growth of P. farcimen was observed at irradiances as low as 2 mu E m(-2) s(-1). Growth rates increased with temperature from 1 to 6 degrees C, while a further increase in growth was not seen when the temperature was elevated from 6 to 10 degrees C. At the highest tested temperature (10 degrees C), dense cultures of P. farcimen were observed to develop large multinucleate cells. Highest growth rates were observed at the pH range 7.7-8.4, while growth rates decreased above pH 8.4, until cultures stopped growing at pH 8.9-9.0. As pH increased and growth declined, the average shape of P. farcimen cells changed from elongated to round. This shape could serve as an indicator on the growth condition of the alga. P. farcimen did not affect the growth of any of the tested phytoplankton in the present experiment but the growth rate of P. farcimen was in the same range as the diatoms. Thus, this study has shown that P. farcimen is adapted to successfully compete and grow in a low light and temperature regime that it is exposed to in the late winter and early spring, making it able to form blooms under these conditions.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increased concern for the risk of non-target impacts of pesticides. It has been widely acknowledged that weight and volume measures are not adequate proxies for assessing this risk, and many pesticide risk indicator models have been developed and are in use throughout the world. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and here we have evaluated the Norwegian Environmental Risk Indicator (NERI) in relation to the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ), both models weighting potential effects on the environment in relation to risk of exposure, and the leaching model Surface Water Attenuation (SWAT). We have utilized reported use of pesticides within two catchments in Norway to be able to compare the model outputs under realistic pest management regimes. In general, the NERI-model gives much weight to substances of long persistence in soil and/or high risk of bioaccumulation, while the EIQ-model risk estimates are largely governed by amount of pesticide used. As the general focus when considering pesticide use and the environment has shifted from purely focusing on reducing amounts to risk reduction, the NERI-model might deliver a more up-to-date output with the more toxic and persistent compounds dominating. However, the absence of mobile pesticides like MCPA from the top of the ranking raises some concern, and points out some of the lacks in such simple models when it comes to use for farmer guidance. They do not include any site specific data on soil characteristics and weather conditions, factors of great importance for pesticide leaching and, hence, governing the risk of exposure. The SWAT-model focuses on the risk of exposure due to leaching, and does not include an effect factor (e.g. toxicity to terrestrial and aquatic organisms). However, for the purpose of farmer guidance, presentations of leaching risk of individual pesticides based on pre-simulated model results under some representative environmental conditions, give the opportunity for an initial screening of the more suitable pesticides regarding risk of exposure.

AB  - Organic-rich mudstones in the Lower Permian Zhanjin Formation may be primary source rocks in the Qiangtang Basin. However, the factors controlling organic matter accumulation remain unclear. Based on total organic carbon (TOC), geochemical, and mineral data, the paleoclimate, redox conditions, paleosalinity, hydrothermal activity, and primary productivity of the Zhanjin Formation mudstones (well QZ-5) were studied to discuss the organic matter accumulation mechanism. The Zhanjin Formation mudstones at 688-675 m and 672-622.8 m have higher TOC contents (avg. 1.52%) than those (avg. 0.94%) at 674-673 m and 662-659.5 m. Medium chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of samples at 688-675 m and 672-668 m indicate a warm and humid climate, whereas those at 674-673 m and 666-659.5 m indicate rapid cooling due to low CIA values. High Sr/Ba and S/TOC ratios indicate a high-salinity water column during the Zhanjin Formation mudstones deposition. Fluctuating U-EF and Mo-EF values and low to medium Th/U, V/Cr, and C-org/P ratios suggest that these studied mudstones formed in an oxic to dysoxic environment. Relatively low Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) ratios, positive Eu anomalies, and Fe-Mn-(Cu + Co + Ni) x 10 and Co-Zn-Ni ternary diagrams indicate that these mudstones were influenced by atypical (weak) hydrothermal activity associated with relatively high femic terrigenous detrital influx. Relatively high P/Al ratios reveal that the level of primary productivity in the surficial water column was relatively high, but high Ni/Al and Cu/Al ratios may be influenced by paleoclimate and hydrothermal activity. Good correlations among the TOC concentrations and paleoclimate, detrital influx, and hydrothermal activity indicators combined with poor correlations between TOC and primary productivity, paleosalinity and redox proxies demonstrate that organic matter accumulation in the Zhanjin Formation mudstones was mainly controlled by detrital influx (adsorption of clay minerals) and hydrothermal activity, but not by primary productivity levels and preservation conditions such as paleosalinity and redox conditions.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature by introducing a novel index that measures ease of doing business (EDB) at the sub-national level. The authors provide a comprehensive assessment of both de jure and de facto business conditions in 21 sub-national economies of India, with the help of a holistic framework that encompasses indicators capturing Attractiveness to Investors, Business Friendliness and Competitive Policies (ABC), the three broad environments that constitute the EDB-ABC index.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors' index EDB-ABC index is constructed using 81 indicators. The index values reported are standardized scores and the framework is applied to 21 Indian sub-national economies. The bottom-up approach takes into account the various operational issues that firms face at the ground level, with the emphasis being on de facto issues. A unique feature of the index is its emphasis on collecting extensive survey data at the sub-national level, given that several constraints that businesses face lie under the purview of the sub-national governments. It also combines publicly available macroeconomic data through formal statistical publications.
   Findings The findings suggest a positive association between the proposed EDB-ABC index and competitiveness of as well as investments into Indian sub-national economies. In terms of explanatory power, the authors find that indicators capturing attractiveness to investors and business friendliness which are representative of de facto implementation issues at the sub-national matter more than de jure competitive policies. It is also striking that the results are in stark contrast to the existing doing business studies highlighting the importance of the comprehensiveness of the index.
   Originality/value Easing the impediments to doing business is a pre-requisite to enhance both domestic as well as foreign investments. Existing indicators on doing business provide an incomplete picture about the prevailing business conditions as the basis for such rankings are de jure regulations and not de facto. The authors depart from this tradition by dealing with both de jure and de facto business conditions using a combination of primary and secondary data at the sub-national level in India.

AB  - Animal welfare has been defined as the balance between positive and negative experiences or affective states. Despite the growing evidence of complex cognitive abilities and the expression of affective states such as pain and fear, very little is known about ability to experience memory based affective states in non-mammalian animal models. The goal of this study was to validate conditioned place preference/avoidance (CPP/CPA) tests as a method to assess the affective valence of environmental stimuli in teleost fishes. Physiological and behavioural indicators of affective state were used to characterise the response to a priori appetitive and aversive stimuli in CPP/CPA tests in gilthead sea bream (Spanis aurata). Fish were tested individually in a CPP/CPA tank divided into two halves, with one half uniformly white and one half marked by dotted wall patterns. During an initial habituation phase fish were placed in a central alley for 10 min and afterwards allowed to swim freely throughout the whole tank during 20 min in order to determine their initial preferred and non-preferred side (IPS/INPS). During the training phase, fish were presented either with a single aversive stimulus in the IPS (chasing with a dip net) or with a repeated appetitive stimulus (release of pellets) in the INPS. The test phase consisted of the same procedure as the habituation phase. The behaviour of each individual was video-recorded and analysed with video-tracking software. Fish submitted to appetitive stimulus increased significantly the time spent and the distance moved in the stimulation side, while fish exposed to aversive stimulus decreased significantly the time spent in the stimulation side, increased the distance moved in the non-stimulation side and showed an increase in cortisol level. Therefore, the use of behavioural (individual swimming activity) and physiological (plasma cortisol concentration) indicators of affective state during the CPP/CPA test allowed to validate the use of this test as a way to assess the affective valence attributed by fish to different environmental stimuli. Finally, this study also shows that fish are able to retain memories of events with positive/negative valence which are retrieved by environmental cues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The developmental histories of a wetland and the surrounding upland vegetation in the southern boreal region of western Canada are traced through microfossil, macrofossil, physico-chemical and radiometric analyses of a 425 cm deep core consisting of sandy gyttja and peat. Microfossil analysis includes algal, fungal and zoological 'Types' which are illustrated and described, with notes on their occurrence as observed in several peat sequences of western boreal Canada. Local wetland development started in the central area of a 65 ha closed depression at c. 5000 BP, due to a rise in the groundwater table related to a gradual increase in effective precipitation in the region. Initial stages were characterised by Typha-dominated marsh communities that suggest marked seasonal fluctuations in local water levels. The accumulation of organic matter could not keep pace with the ever-rising groundwater table, and a shallow eutrophic pond with aquatic macrophytes developed locally. The body of open water was surrounded by marsh vegetation that was gradually being displaced towards the margins of the depression. At 4330 BP moist conditions became prevalent throughout the growing season. A brown-moss dominated treed rich fen replaced the shore marsh community and gradually began to encroach on the small pond. The basin completely terrestrialised at 3260 BP. Autogenic processes caused by peat accumulation resulted in a transition towards a Sphagnum-dominated treed poor fen. At 2790 BP a treed bog became established, firstly dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium and S. magellanicum indicating moist local conditions. After 1870 BP S. fuscum became dominant, indicating drier conditions locally. The upland vegetation just before local wetland formation was characterised by Picea in relatively wet depressions and by Populus in drier areas. Some grassland patches were present, most probably on the more southerly exposed slopes of the hills. Picea was locally displaced by wetland vegetation at c. 5000 BP, whereas deciduous forest and some grassland stands continued to dominate the surrounding hills. The coniferous taxa Pinus and Picea began to invade the uplands after 4330 BP, contemporaneously with the development of the local peatland. This marks the time at which the modern southern boreal ecosystem dominated by peatlands in lowlands apd mixed wood forest in uplands became established in the area.

AB  - Molecular hydrogen produced through iron oxidation during formation of serpentine and magnetite can sustain terrestrial subsurface ecosystems. The Fe3+ in serpentine partitions into octahedral and tetrahedral sites differently as serpentinization proceeds, and tetrahedral Fe3+ is present toward the end of serpentinization. We map Fe oxidation states in a serpentinite to determine the degree to which serpentinization progressed and where hydrogen production has been maximized to assess habitability at an abandoned chrysotile mine in Norbestos, Quebec, in association with the Canadian Space Agency's Mars Methane Analogue Mission. We also analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen in carbonates to constrain the conditions of water-rock interaction during serpentinization. Iron oxidation and coordination was determined through field imaging of rock walls with a visible hyperspectral imager (420-720 nm), and samples collected from imaged rocks and elsewhere in the mine were imaged in the laboratory (420-1100 nm). Sample chemistry, mineralogy, and oxidation state were determined with laboratory measurements of visible through mid-infrared reflectance spectra, major element chemistry, mineralogy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Mapping with hyperspectral imaging of outcrops and hand samples shows that tetrahedral Fe3+ is common in serpentinites at this site, and results are confirmed through other measurements. Major element chemistry and mineralogy are consistent with serpentine plus minor carbonate. Carbonate samples show an exceptional range in delta C-13 (-13.14 to +16.12 parts per thousand VPDB) and 8180 (-15.48 to -3.20 parts per thousand VPDB) that vary with location in the mine. Carbonates south of a shear zone (delta C-13 more positive) likely formed during periods of serpentinization in a carbon-limited reservoir closed to carbon addition but open to methane escape. Carbonates in a shear zone (delta C-13 more negative) probably formed later at low temperatures through CO2-metasomatism or atmospheric weathering, and isotopic trends are consistent with kinetic fractionation. The extensive presence of tetrahedral Fe3+ in serpentine shows the system liberally produced H-2 while the isotope systematics have implications for preservation of indicators of the aqueous conditions that formed serpentinites on Mars and their habitability.

AB  - Mussel dredging causes resuspension of sediment particles that reduce water clarity and potentially leads to reduced eelgrass growth. In order to study the impact of resuspension from mussel dredging on light conditions in the water column, field experiments were conducted at two sites in the Limfjorden. Light loggers were placed in two circular arrays around the dredge area. Vertical profiles of current velocity were measured by an ADCP and the sediment particle size composition was obtained from sediment core samples. The field data was used to force, calibrate and validate a sediment transport model developed in the RexSem model system. Changes in sediment concentrations during and after mussel dredging were modeled for the two sites and for seven scenarios. We found that the distance and direction of the plume in the model was in good agreement with light logger data. The plume duration was less than 1 h, and the impact range was between 260-540 m. The scenarios showed that fishing intensity and current speeds were most important for shaping the sediment plumes. Changes in suspended sediment concentrations were 0.62-1.79 mg l(-1) on median average and 1.22-11.61 mg l(-1) for the upper quantile of the plume, which were on the same order of magnitude as background values in the Limfjorden. The amount of fishing days during the eelgrass growth season was 6-8% in Lovns Bredning and 16-35% in Legstor Bredning and less than 1-2% of the total area was dredged per season. Even though there are substantial changes in the light conditions from the sediment plumes, the overall spatio-temporal impact in the study area is considered low. We recommend that management plans in other areas could sustain a shellfish fishery by limiting fishing intensity and frequency near eelgrass beds. The presented approach combines observational data, sediment transport modeling and reported fishing activity. It is a step forward within sediment transport modeling and could be incorporated into environmental impact assessments. The results have recently been used as scientific background for recommendations to improve the management plans according to the Danish Mussel Policy and relevant EU Directives.

AB  - The study investigates economic and institutional conditions for reproduction of economic relations and implementation of economic interests in the countries of the world. A new methodological approach to their estimation has been proposed; it is based on Ko-honen's self-organising maps and allows processing a large amount of data, revealing system relationships between them, visualizing the results, grouping the countries of the world and comparing their economic and institutional capacities in the implementation of economic interests of the entities. The study applies both the indicators of the effectiveness of the economic and institutional environment and the entities' perception of the level of protection of their property rights and interests and economic and institutional conditions in the country for the reproduction of economic relations. The analysis is based on macroeconomic statistics, which ensures the relevance and comparability of indicators in the countries of the world. The construction of a neural network has made it possible to identify groups of countries with an extremely low, low, middle and high level of economic and institutional opportunities for the reproduction of economic relations and implementation of entities' interests. The approach is relevant as it provides for a thorough analysis, enables identifying the weak and strong points of the selected groups of countries and relationships between the macroeconomic situation and the economic activity, legal environment and government efficiency. It has been revealed that Ukraine belongs to the group of countries with extremely low potential for the reproduction of economic relations and implementation of entities' interests; these countries are characterized by a low degree of economic freedom, low efficiency of government and regulatory sphere, weak innovation-investment orientation, high inflation rate and governance level, significant barriers to starting a business, problems in protecting property interests and rights. Recommendations for improving (maintaining) the efficiency of the economic and institutional environment for each group of countries have been given. The proposed model can be used to assess the opportunities for implementing the economic interests of entities in countries of the world and for decision-making on foreign direct investment by potential investors.

AB  - Background and Purpose: In Zagreb, the forests have assumed the characteristics of forest parks, of which the most famous and the most visited is Maksimir Park. The health condition of many trees has deteriorated due to environmental changes and the forest's age. The tree health status can be monitored by direct observation in the field using the terrestrial method, or by remote sensing methods. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to use high-resolution satellite imagery to monitor the damage.
   Materials and Methods: In order to estimate the health status of trees, the research area - Maksimir Forest Park - was visually interpreted by means of the WorldView 2 (WV2) satellite image, color composite (8, 5, 3). Such color composite was also used to delineate the strata. After delineation, a systematic sample of 25x25 m was laid over the stratum to help interpret the tree health status. Differences in tree damage were observed by comparing the WV2 images and other satellite images (Google Earth images from 2014 and 2016) recorded at different points in time. Field research was then conducted in order to inventory the current situation.
   Results: The main results of the research in Maksimir Forest Park include the calculation of damage indicators by tree species, as well as thematic maps with the spatial distribution of the mean damage (SO) and damage index (IO) for those tree species which are most represented in a particular stratum. Mean and significant damage of the most represented tree species and overall is also presented spatially in the form of thematic maps. A comparison of the results of WV2 satellite imagery and satellite images taken from Google Earth denoted a change in the tree health status, which confirms that satellite imagery can serve to inventory and track the condition in an area over a number of years. Field investigations and the assessment of tree health status confirmed the results obtained by satellite imagery interpretation.
   Conclusions: Since quality forest monitoring is based on systematic collection of forest data in any area or at any point in time, the obtained results not only represent the current health status, but also provide a basis for monitoring and predicting the future conditions.

AB  - The importance of scaling initiatives that promote environmental protection and conservation is almost universally recognized. But how is scaling best achieved? We empirically evaluated the relationship of a list of factors that have been postulated to facilitate successful scaling to the degree of scaling success achieved in 56 case studies from a variety of sectors. We identified 23 factors that are significantly associated with successful scaling, defined as self-replication: an innovation that is congruent with local sociocultural patterns, takes advantage of existing scaled infrastructure, and facilitates a paradigm shift; adequate resources and constituencies for scaling, secured from the start, drawn from both within and outside the system; pilot sites that reflect conditions at future sites rather than ideal conditions; clear and deliberate scaling expectations and strategy; capitalization on economies of scale; a project team that has a unifying vision, includes both individuals who helped design the innovation and members of the target audience, and empowers users with the requisite skills; target audiences that take ownership of the project; the provision of long-term support systems; ongoing learning about the factors influencing scaling; direct management of relevant supply and demand streams; targeted marketing and dissemination efforts; and the evaluation of scaling success indicators. We also explored correlations between these principles, and identified a group of principles that together explain nearly 40% of the variance in success: the provision of long-term support systems (or one of its surrogates: turning users into partners, a user organization with wide reach, and the empowerment of the target audience with requisite skills); resources mobilized from within and outside the system; user organizations that have the capacity to implement the innovation; innovations that are platform solutions and that provide rapid feedback; and pilot sites that have realistic conditions relative to future sites. Our results suggest that for scaling to be successful: (1) scaling must be considered at all stages of a project; (2) the context must be managed and barriers to scaling must be identified and removed and (3) deliberate attention must be paid to scaling methods, marketing and dissemination efforts, and long-term monitoring of scaling progress.

AB  - The pine needle length is characterized by strong volatility due to various external and internal factors. The needles are very responsive to the changes of environmental conditions, to any human impact. On the branches the needles have different length in dependence of the year. Moreover, the abnormally long and short needles are marked in different years. The coincidence of dynamics peaks of needle length does not depend on the forest type, age (for example, pine trees in the southern taiga subzone), stand density and drainage intensity (for example, drained shrub-sphagnum pine forests). Comparing our study data with the literature information we can state, that the dynamics of needle length according to years is not dependent on growing conditions, area, and the researcher. The years of anomalously large needle length are in the analyzed series: 1963, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2004; the years of abnormally low values of needle length are in the analyzed series: 1965, 1994, 1997, 2003, 2006. Consequently, a global factor, which is equivalent in the southern and northern taiga, which does not dependent on the climate indicators, age of crops, competition in it, affects on the abnormal needle length. That factor is the solar activity. To mitigate the effects of exposure of microclimatic and edaphic factors, the needle length index is calculated by the smoothing method using the 3-6 years (depending on the needle lifetime) average value. We carried out the sampling of average monthly values of solar activity, expressed by the Wolf number, for years with synchronous abnormally long and short needle length. A more complete understanding of the significance of the factors we observed in their analysis for 24 months: before and during the anomalistic years. The biggest difference between the indices of the Wolf numbers is typical for the period of formation of abnormal needle length, compared with a year preceding the needles development. During the development of abnormally long needle length the Wolf numbers exceed the average value by 1.7 times; in the years of abnormally short needles the Wolf number is by 2-5 times lower than the average in the analyzed series. Consequently, the solar activity affects the growth of needles and causes the synchronization of peaks in the needle length dynamics.

AB  - Although higher microbial concentrations have been reported in sediments than in the overlying water column, most quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) studies have not clearly indicated the contribution of sediment- borne pathogens to estimated risks. Thus, the present study aimed at determining the public health risk associated with exposure to pathogenic bacteria in polluted river water under undisturbed conditions and conditions of sediment resuspension in the Apies River, Gauteng, South Africa. Microbial pathogens were isolated and identified using culture and molecular methods. The beta-Poisson dose-response model was used to estimate the probability of infection (Pi) with the various pathogens, following accidental/intentional ingestion of 1 mL or 100 mL (or 50 mL) of untreated river water. Mean wet season Escherichia coli counts ranged between 5.8E + 01 and 8.8E + 04 MPN/100 mL (water column) and between 2.40E + 03 and 1.28E + 05 MPN/100 mL (sediments). Mean dry season E. coli counts ranged between 5.11E + 00 and 3.40E + 03 MPN/100 mL (water column) and between 5.09E+ 00 and 6.30E+ 03 MPN/100mL (sediments). Overall (water and sediments) Vibrio cholerae was the most detected pathogen (58.8%) followed by Salmonella spp. (23.9%) and Shigella (10.1%). Ingestion of 1 mL of river water could lead to 0%-4% and 1%-74% Pi with E. coli during the dry and wet season, respectively. During the dry season, the Pi with V. cholerae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were 0%-1.39%, 0%-4.11% and 0%-0.16% respectively, depending on volume of water ingested. The risks of infections with all microorganisms increased during the wet season. A 2-log increase in water E. coli count following sediments disturbance led to approximately 10 times higher Pi with E. coli than when sediments were undisturbed. Therefore, the use of the untreated water from the Apies River for drinking, household purposes or recreational activities poses a potential health risk to the users of the river.

AB  - Turbulent flames are utilised in almost all applications employing combustion. Thus, better understanding of the combustion process is the key for increasing the efficiency of fuel consumption and reducing the environmental footprint of future combustors. As the turbulent flame velocity depends on the laminar burning velocity and intensity of the turbulence, the laminar burning velocity can be considered as a crucial parameter for fuel characterisation. Since turbulent flame can be considered basically as wrinkled laminar flame (flamelet approach), the effect of stretch (caused by turbulence) on the flame propagation must also be considered. The Markstein number, which quantifies the response of a laminar flame to the stretch, can be employed for this purpose. Additionally, the Markstein number can be utilised as an indicator for laminar and turbulent flame front stability. The experimental data of the conventional liquid fuel - kerosene Jet A-1 - are scarce, especially at elevated pressure conditions. Identification of the parameters for elevated pressures is very important as such conditions are closer to real operational ones. Additionally, as the laminar velocity embodies fundamental information on the diffusivity, reactivity and exothermicity of a given mixture, it is often utilized for the validation of fuel reaction mechanisms.
   The combustion characteristics laminar burning velocity and Markstein number of kerosene Jet A-1 are investigated experimentally in an explosion vessel. For this purpose an optical laser method is employed based on the Mie-scattering of the laser light by smoke particles. Within this experimental study the influence of three crucial parameters: initial temperature, initial pressure and mixture composition on the burning velocity and Markstein number are investigated. The experiments are performed at five different pressures: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 MPa; three different temperatures: 373, 423 and 473 K; and for a range of equivalence ratios of 0.67-1.43. Along with the experiments, two different reaction mechanisms are used to evaluate their ability to predict the experimentally observed laminar burning velocities. The observed results are compared and discussed in detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Beach sediment and sand are recognized as nonpoint fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) sources capable of causing water quality and health risks for beach-goers. A comprehensive understanding of the key factors and mechanisms governing the migration and exchange of FIB between beach water column and sediment is desired to better predict FIB concentration variations and assess the associated risk. The transport and retention behavior of two model FIB Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was examined using packed-bed columns in both saturated and unsaturated porous media to evaluate FIB migration potentials at conditions simulating the coastal aquatic environment. Additionally, complementary cell characterization techniques were conducted to better understand the migration behaviors of both FIB strains observed in the column experiments. The mobility of the gram-positive species E. faecalis was much more sensitive to solution chemistry and column saturation level than that of the gram-negative species E. coli. Interaction energy calculations suggest that E. faecalis retention was largely governed by the combination of DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) and non-DLVO (most likely hydrophobic and/or polymer bridging) interactions in saturated porous media, while the combination of DLVO and steric interactions controlled the deposition of E. coli cells. The measured surface properties of the two FIB strains supported the distinct bacteria transport behaviors and the differences of the identified mechanisms for each strain. As a result, E. faecalis showed the least affinity to sand in freshwater and appeared to be irreversibly attached in primary energy minima at elevated salt conditions; whereas the retained E. coli cells were reversibly attached and mostly associated with the secondary energy minima at both freshwater and seawater conditions. In unsaturated porous media, E. faecalis cells seemed to prefer to attachment at air/water interface rather than sand surface, while E. coli showed a similar affinity to the two interfaces. It was proposed that the different surface characteristics of the two FIB strains resulted in the distinct transport and retention behavior in porous media. These results highlight the need for FIB management to consider variations in transport behavior between model FIB when assessing water quality and associated risks.

AB  - Changing climate conditions may impact the short-term ability of forest tree species to regenerate in many locations. In the longer term, tree species may be unable to persist in some locations while they become established in new places. Over both time frames, forest tree biodiversity may change in unexpected ways. Using repeated inventory measurements five years apart from more than 7000 forested plots in the eastern United States, we tested three hypotheses: phylogenetic diversity is substantially different from species richness as a measure of biodiversity; forest communities have undergone recent changes in phylogenetic diversity that differ by size class, region, and seed dispersal strategy; and these patterns :Are consistent with expected early effects of climate change. Specifically, the magnitude of diversity change across broad regions should be greater among seedlings than in trees., should be associated with latitude and elevation, and should be greater among species with high dispersal capacity. Our analyses demonstrated that phylogenetic diversity and species richness are decoupled at small and medium scales and are imperfectly associated at large scales. This suggests that it is appropriate to apply indicators of biodiversity change based on phylogenetic diversity, which account for evolutionary relationships among species and may better represent community functional diversity. Our results also detected broadscale patterns of forest biodiversity change that are consistent with expected early effects of climate change. First, the statistically significant increase over time in seedling diversity in the South suggests that conditions there have become more favorable for the reproduction and dispersal of a wider variety of species, whereas the significant decrease in northern seedling diversity indicates that northern conditions have become less favorable. Second, we found weak correlations between seedling diversity change and latitude in both zones, with stronger relationships apparent in some ecoregions. Finally, we detected broadscale seedling diversity increases among species with longer-distance dispersal capacity, even in the northern zone, where overall seedling diversity declined. The statistical power and geographic extent of such analyses will increase as data become available over larger areas and as plot measurements are repeated at regular intervals over a longer period of time.

AB  - Tropical forest condition has important implications for biodiversity, climate change and human needs. Structural features of forests can serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area (p<0.01) while there were weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=-0.69, p<0.01) when using a subset of the data, which represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, p<0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, p<0.01). The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semi-quantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.

AB  - Despite use of GPS, lighthouses remain critical infrastructure for preserving safety of mariners and maritime trade, and the most dramatic examples are probably the Victorian era masonry towers located on remote offshore reefs around the British Isles and exposed to extreme weather conditions. Due to their age and likely increasing future loading, dynamic field investigations were undertaken for condition assessment.
   The field investigations of a sample of seven lighthouses had focused on experimental modal analysis (EMA) of shaker force and acceleration response data in order to identify sets of modal parameters (MPs) specifically including modal mass, which is useful for linking loading and response. However, the EMA missed significant useful information, which could be recovered from operational modal analysis (OMA) of additional ambient vibration data recorded during the field measurements, as well as from subsequent long-term monitoring of Wolf Rock lighthouse.
   Horizontal vibration modes of the towers appear as pairs of modes of similar shape and with close natural frequency due to the quasi-axisymmetric structural form(s), and the lowest frequency pairs are most important to identify since they contribute most to response to breaking wave impact loads. Reliably identifying both the close natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shape orientations was impossible with EMA. Bayesian OMA (BAYOMA) provided the most insight into the modal behaviour, while at the same time providing insight into the fundamental limitations for identifying close modes.
   Specific conclusions from the OMA described in this paper are:
   Due to varying degree of asymmetry in the 'concave elliptic frustum' lighthouse shapes, mode frequencies in a pair were found to differ by between 0.75% and 3.8%.
   Unlike EMA, OMA was able to identify (or estimate) the horizontal directions of the mode pairs corresponding to the very close natural frequencies.
   Visually apparent structural symmetry may not be strongly linked to mode shape orientations.
   Mode frequency variation over time may exceed-but is not accounted for in-the calculated identification uncertainty of MPs.
   There is a trade-off between mode shape orientation uncertainty and closeness of frequencies in a close-mode pair. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) from agricultural soils is a key indicator of soil degradation associated with reductions in net primary productivity in crop production systems worldwide. Technically simple and locally appropriate solutions are required for farmers to increase SOC and to improve cropland management. In the last 30 years, straw incorporation (SI) has gradually been implemented across China in the context of agricultural intensification and rural livelihood improvement. A meta-analysis of data published before the end of 2016 was undertaken to investigate the effects of SI on crop production and SOC sequestration. The results of 68 experimental studies throughout China in different edaphic conditions, climate regions and farming regimes were analyzed. Compared with straw removal (SR), SI significantly sequestered SOC (0-20 cm depth) at the rate of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.31-0.40) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), increased crop grain yield by 13.4% (9.3-18.4 %) and had a conversion efficiency of the incorporated straw C of 16% +/- 2% across China. The combined SI at the rate of 3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) with mineral fertilizer of 200-400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was demonstrated to be the best farming practice, where crop yield increased by 32.7% (17.9-56.4 %) and SOC sequestrated by the rate of 0.85 (0.54-1.15) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). SI achieved a higher SOC sequestration rate and crop yield increment when applied to clay soils under high cropping intensities, and in areas such as northeast China where the soil is being degraded. The SOC responses were highest in the initial starting phase of SI, then subsequently declined and finally became negligible after 28-62 years. However, crop yield responses were initially low and then increased, reaching their highest level at 11-15 years after SI. Overall, our study confirmed that SI created a positive feedback loop of SOC enhancement together with increased crop production, and this is of great practical importance to straw management as agriculture intensifies both in China and other regions with different climate conditions.

AB  - Petrographic recognition of layer-bounding surfaces in stalagmites offers an important tool in constructing paleoclimate records. Previous petrographic efforts have examined thickness of layers (a possible proxy for annual rainfall) and alternation of layers in couplets (a possible indicator of seasonality). Layer-bounding surfaces, in contrast, delimit series of layers and represent periods of non-deposition, either because of exceptionally wet or exceptionally dry conditions.
   Two types of layer-bounding surfaces can be recognized according to explicitly defined petrographic criteria. Type E layer-bounding surfaces are surfaces at which layers have been truncated or eroded at the crest of a stalagmite. Keys to their recognition include irregular termination of layers otherwise present on the stalagmite's flank, dissolutional cavities, and coatings of non-carbonate detrital materials. Type E surfaces are interpreted to represent wet periods during which drip water became so undersaturated as to dissolve pre-existing stalagmite layers, and thus they necessarily represent hiatuses in the stalagmite record.
   Type L layer-bounding surfaces are surfaces below which layers become thinner upward and/or layers have lesser lateral extent upward, so that the stalagmite's layer-specific width decreases. They are thus surfaces of lessened deposition and are interpreted to represent drier conditions in which drip rate slowed so much that little deposition occurred. A Type L surface may, but does not necessarily, represent a hiatus in deposition. However, radiometric age data show that Type L surfaces commonly represent significant hiatuses.
   These surfaces are significant to paleoclimate research both for their implications regarding climate change (exceptionally wet or dry conditions) and in construction of chronologies in which other data, such as stable isotope ratios, are placed. With regard to climate change, recognition of these surfaces provides paleoclimatological information that can complement or even substitute for geochemical proxies. With regard to chronologies, recognition of layer-bounding surfaces allows correct placement of hiatuses in chronologies and thus correct placement of geochemical data in time series. Attention to changing thickness of annual layers and thus to accumulation rate can also refine a chronology. A chronology constructed with attention to layer-bounding surfaces and to changing layer thickness is much more accurate than a chronology in which hiatuses are not recognized at such surfaces.

AB  - P> Loss of plant species induced by adverse human influence and habitat fragmentation might be delayed due to a slow response to changed environmental conditions. This phenomenon is known as extinction debt, which can lead to the underestimation of actual threats to biodiversity. To adequately estimate the condition of recently fragmented plant communities and avoid future loss of species, good indicators of forthcoming extinctions are needed.
   We studied the behaviour of genetic diversity of a relatively common habitat specialist grass Briza media in fragmented calcareous grasslands in which the extinction debt has been previously documented. Species richness in this system is shown to be determined by historical landscape patterns and human population densities prevailing centuries ago. We hypothesize that genetic diversity in this grassland system is related to current landscape patterns and contemporary human impact since genetic diversity might react more quickly to environmental changes than species diversity.
   In contrast to species diversity, genetic diversity was indeed best described by current connectivity of grasslands. Additionally, genetic diversity was negatively related to current human population density, indicating an adverse effect of contemporary human settlements on studied species. The faster response of genetic diversity to changed environmental conditions compared to species richness was further supported by the absence of an expected correlation between species richness and genetic diversity.
   Human population density a century ago had a positive effect on genetic diversity. A similar effect has been demonstrated for species richness in these grasslands, indicating that traditional land use in the past has supported the development of both genetic and species diversity.
   Synthesis. Genetic diversity of Briza media in fragmented communities is reacting quickly to changes in landscape structure and anthropogenic pressure. Our results confirm that plant species can be prone to genetic deterioration due to habitat fragmentation and negative anthropogenic impact even if the decline in species richness has been delayed by extinction debt. Thus, a decrease of population genetic diversity in fragmented communities can be taken as the first indication of future species losses.

AB  - Water-quality standards requiring simultaneous low level effluent N and P concentrations are increasingly common in Europe and the United States of America. Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) and biologically active filters (BAFs) have been used as post-denitrification biofilm reactors in processes designed and operated for this purpose (Boltz et al., 2010a). There is a paucity of information describing systematic design and operational protocols that will minimize the potential for phosphorus rate-limited conditions as well as a lack of information describing the interaction between these post-denitrification biofilm reactors and unit processes that substantially alter phosphorus speciation (e.g., chemically enhanced clarification). In this paper, a simple mathematical model for estimating the threshold below which P becomes rate-limiting, and the model is presented and evaluated by comparing its predictions with operational data from post-denitrification MBBRs and BAFs. Ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P), which is the dissolved reactive component of total phosphorus, was a primary indicator of P rate-limiting conditions in the evaluated post-denitrification biofilm reactors. The threshold below which PO4-P becomes the rate-limiting substrate is defined: SPO4-P: SNOx-N = 0.0086 g P/g N and SPO4-P: S-M = 0.0013 g P/g COD. Additional analyses indicate J(NOx)(avg)-N = 0.48 g/m(2)/d when SPO4-P: S-NOx-N > 0.0086, and J(NOx)(avg)-N = 0.06 g/m(2)/d when SPO4-P: S-NOx-N < 0.0086. Effluent nitrate-nitrogen plus nitrite-nitrogen concentration (S-NOx-N) from the evaluated post-denitrification biofilm reactors began to rapidly increase when SPO4-P: S-NOx-N was 0.01, approximately (consistent with the rate-limitation threshold of SPO4-P: S-NOx-N < 0.0086 predicted by the mathematical model described in this paper). Depending on the processes used at a given WWTP, optimizing chemically enhanced clarification to increase the amount of PO4-P that remains in the clarifiers effluent stream, dosing phosphoric acid in the MBBR or BAF influent stream, and/or optimizing secondary process EBPR may overcome phosphorus rate-limitations in the biofilm-based post-denitrification process.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of land surface processes from local to global scales, and it is one of the indicators of environmental quality. Evaluation of the surface temperature distribution and its relation to existing land use types are very important to the investigation of the urban microclimate. In arid and semi-arid regions, understanding the role of land use changes in the formation of urban heat islands is necessary for urban planning to control or reduce surface temperature. The internal factors and environmental conditions of Yazd city have important roles in the formation of special thermal conditions in Iran. In this paper, we used the temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for LST retrieving from the TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) data of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were used for validation of retrieved LST values. The RMSE of 0.9 and 0.87 degrees C and R-2 of 0.98 and 0.99 were obtained for the 1998 and 2009 images, respectively. Land use types for the city of Yazd were identified and relationships between land use types, land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were analyzed. The Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy were calculated for accuracy assessment of land use classification. The Kappa coefficient values are 0.96 and 0.95 and the overall accuracy values are 0.97 and 0.95 for the 1998 and 2009 classified images, respectively. The results showed an increase of 1.45 degrees C in the average surface temperature. The results of this study showed that optical and thermal remote sensing methodologies can be used to research urban environmental parameters. Finally, it was found that special thermal conditions in Yazd were formed by land use changes. Increasing the area of asphalt roads, residential, commercial and industrial land use types and decreasing the area of the parks, green spaces and fallow lands in Yazd caused a rise in surface temperature during the 11-year period.

AB  - Background: Volatile fatty acid intoxication (acidosis), a common process failure recorded in anaerobic reactors, leads to drastic losses in methane production. Unfortunately, little is known about the microbial mechanisms underlining acidosis and the potential to recover the process. In this study, triplicate mesophilic anaerobic reactors of 100 L were exposed to acidosis resulting from an excessive feeding with sugar beet pulp and were compared to a steady-state reactor.
   Results: Stable operational conditions at the beginning of the experiment initially led to similar microbial populations in the four reactors, as revealed by 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the two dominant phyla, and although they were represented by a high number of operational taxonomic units, only a few were dominant. Once the environment became deterministic (selective pressure from an increased substrate feeding), microbial populations started to diverge between the overfed reactors. Interestingly, most of bacteria and archaea showed redundant functional adaptation to the changing environmental conditions. However, the dominant Bacteroidales were resistant to high volatile fatty acids content and low pH. The severe acidosis did not eradicate archaea and a clear shift in archaeal populations from acetotrophic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurred in the overfed reactors. After 11 days of severe acidosis (pH 5.2 +/- 0.4), the process was quickly recovered (restoration of the biogas production with methane content above 50 %) in the overfed reactors, by adjusting the pH to around 7 using NaOH and NaHCO3.
   Conclusions: In this study we show that once the replicate reactors are confronted with sub-optimal conditions, their microbial populations start to evolve differentially. Furthermore the alterations of commonly used microbial parameters to monitor the process, such as richness, evenness and diversity indices were unsuccessful to predict the process failure. At the same time, we tentatively propose the replacement of the dominant Methanosaeta sp. in this case by Methanoculleus sp., to be a potential warning indicator of acidosis.

AB  - A study was conducted using 360 broiler chickens to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin E (0, 125 and 250 mg/kg), selenium (Se, 0, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg), or their different combinations on immune response and blood biological parameters of broilers raised under either thermoneutral (TN, 23.9 A degrees C constant) or heat stress (HS, 23.9 to 37 A degrees C cycling) conditions. Humoral immunity was assessed by intravenous injection of 7 % sheep red blood cell (SRBC) followed by evaluation of serum for antibody titers in primary and secondary responses. Heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio also determined as an indicator of stress. Furthermore, at the end of the experiment, birds were bled for determination of some biological parameters. There was a significant reduction in body weight and feed intake, but the feed conversion ratio increased when the birds were exposed to HS (P < 0.05). Body weight and feed intake were not influenced significantly by dietary vitamin E and Se (P > 0.05), whereas feed conversion was improved significantly by 125 mg/kg vitamin E (P < 0.05). The liver and lymphoid organ weights as well as IgM and IgG, antibody titers for primary and secondary antibody responses to SRBC were reduced significantly under HS (P < 0.05). Heat stress also resulted in a significant increase in H/L ratio (P < 0.05). Dietary vitamin E resulted in improvement of primary and secondary antibody responses both in TN and HS broilers (P < 0.05). The HS birds also showed an improved antibody titer in secondary response with high concentration of Se (P < 0.05). Vitamin E and Se had interactive effects on anti-SRBC titers; however, no consistent differences were found between dietary levels during the study. The H/L ratio decreased by feeding vitamin E at both levels either under HS or TN conditions (P < 0.05). The serum concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were increased but serum HDL-cholesterol decreased in HS broilers (P < 0.05).

AB  - The Bay of Brest (BB) is a mixed, tide-dominated estuarine system. The shore terraces of this bay are occupied by modern free-living (calcareous) coralline algae locally termed "maerl", organized in bed-like morphologies (rhodolith deposits). Cores retrieved from around the bay reveal fossilized primitive maerl beds of Holocene age, interbedded in sandy-silt sedimentation. The alternation between biogenic constructions and estuarine sedimentation may provide evidence of varying environmental conditions of the late-Holocene period. This paper mainly focuses on the results of chronostratigraphic and bio-sedimentological interpretations of coring data collected in less than 15 m of water depth in an attempt to decipher the main stages of maerl colonization in the bay. In particular, this study raises several significant points allowing to draw links between centennial to millennial-scale climatic changes in marine estuary sedimentation and episodes within the development of maerl biocenoses. The paleo-bathymetry of the coastal terraces has not changed significantly over the last 5000 years. Yet, the first maerl occurrence only appeared around 2000 cal yr B.P., likely showing that the environmental conditions were not favorable for their emergence prior to that time. Pioneer maerl beds developed on coarse shell deposits inherited from the paleostorms affecting the Atlantic coasts during the colder climatic period of the Iron Age (3100-1950 cal yr B.P.). The accumulations then aggraded at various and discontinuous rates, sometimes reaching up to 2.1 m/kyr. Maerl beds temporarily disappeared in the southern part of the Bay of Brest when sedimentation rates increased throughout the bay during the Dark-Age cold period (1375-1250 cal yr B. P.), suggesting that maerl formations could not keep up with sedimentation rate exceeded a certain threshold. Muddy sedimentation conditions also dramatically changed on two occasions, with the establishment of coarse storm levels, set at the intervals 825-600 cal yr B.P. (MWP) and 113-0 cal yr B.P. But maerl deposits reseed the environment as a result of each new cold period, demonstrating the persistence of such coralline algae against drastic palaeoenvironmental changes in coastal areas.

AB  - Canada is one of the world's largest nations, with a land area of nearly one billion hectares. This vast area is home to a number of unique ecosystems, comprised of different climate, land cover, topography, and disturbance characteristics. Depiction of forest composition, based on satellite-derived land cover, is a common means to characterize and identify trends in forest conditions and land use. Forest pattern analyses that consider the size, distribution, and connectivity of forest patches can provide insights to land use, habitat, and biodiversity. In this communication, we present the pattern characteristics of Canada's forests as determined by the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) product, a new land cover classification of the forested area of Canada. The EOSD product (EOSD LC 2000) represents conditions circa the year 2000, mapping each 25 m x 25 m pixel into one of 23 categories. We used the EOSD data to assess forest patterns nationally at four spatial extents: level 1, 13 000 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 250 000 scale National Topographic System (NTS) map sheet); level 2, 800 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 50 000 scale NTS map sheet); level 3, 1 km(2); and level 4, 1 ha. For levels 1-3, a total of 95 landscape pattern metrics were calculated; for the 1 ha units, a subset of eight metrics were calculated. The results of this analysis indicate that Canada's forest pattern varies by ecozone, with some ecozones characterized by large areas of contiguous forest (i.e., Boreal Shield, Atlantic Maritime, and Montane Cordillera), while other ecozones have less forest and are characterized by large numbers of small forest patches, reflecting the complex mosaic of land cover types present (Taiga Shield, Taiga Cordillera). Trends for the subset of metrics used to characterize national conditions are relatively consistent across levels 1-3. Level 4 metrics, where the analysis extent is 1 ha, are well-suited to regional or local analyses. As the first regional assessments of the patterns contained in the EOSD LC 2000, these measures of Canada's forest landscape patterns add value to the national land cover baseline.

AB  - Different methods of logging slash management (LSM) and methods of soil preparation (MSP) can create different conditions for the growth of forest trees. This occurs through variation in soil aeration, tree nutrition or microbial conditions. These factors are modified by climate, soil fertility, treats from insects or fungal pathogens and renewed species. The aim of this study was to compare effects of three LSM methods: 1) crushing and mixing with the soil by Mery Crusher, 2) chopping and leaving on the soil surface, and 3) removal from the clear-cut, and three MSP: 1) double-mouldboard forest plough LPz-75, 2) active plough U-162, and 3) forest mill FAO-FAR FV 4088 on biometric parameters, density and survival of six-years old Scots pine seedlings. Field research was conducted in Narol Forest District (south-eastern Poland). The soil in the study area was classified as brown podzolic, formed on loose sands with typical mor humus.The experiment was established by planting 10 000 one-year-old pine seedlings per hectare, after clear cut and followed by a two-factor block design consisting of nine variants distinguished on the basis of LSM and MSP randomly assigned to each of the three blocks. Tree height and root collar diameter were measured three times, at the end of 1st, 3rd and 6th growing season. The results showed no statistically significant differences in the size of the analyzed parameters of planted seedlings. Seedlings in the variant with site preparation by crusher and forest mill were slightly higher and thicker. This indicates the better trophic conditions in that variant. LSM did not affect either seedlings density or their survival. A slightly higher survival rate and tree density occurred in variants with crusher regardless of soil preparation method. It follows that, all presented experimental variants give similar results. Therefore, selection of the most appropriate methods of site and soil preparation should primarily respect ecological and economic indicators, and such local factors as microclimate, mainly precipitation, site fertility and threats from pests and fungal diseases.

AB  - Maize production trials carried out in eastern middle of Germany from 1999-2008 were used for statistical analysis of the optimum date for silage maize ripeness. The Knowledge about difference in ripeness between grain and residual plants at the harvest were used for exactly choice of cultivar under drought conditions for silage and energy maize.
   The Silage maize Ripeness Index (the ratio of dry matter content of maize grains to dry matter content of residual plants) is more suitable for the leading of plant development, the determination of harvest date and the choice of cultivar as the dry matter content of the plant. The analysis is cheaper as well as not so material and time-consuming with a better financially results in food-, milk- and methane production in comparison to the dry matter content of the silage maize of different hybrid maize populations and environments.
   Ensilage optimum and yield maximum correspond with the physiological ripeness of silage maize and are close to the grain dry matter content of 64%, to the dry matter content of starch of 33% and a ripeness index from 2.55 to 2.9 for parameter of quality and quantity. Only under these conditions it is possible to reach the optimal ripeness of 33 to 35% in the whole plant silage maize.
   But under suboptimal conditions the harvest is carried out, if SRI had a maximal value. In dependence on the Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRZ) and (SRI) parameters of silage and energy maize were predicted differential development of ripeness and yield. The aims of silage and energy maize are similar.
   The Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI) is, for whole plant maize, better than the Whole Plant Maize Ripeness Index (SRZ) for the choice of a hybrid in Germany. The dry matter content of grain in interaction with the dry matter of residual plants are better than dry matter content of the whole plant maize as ripeness indicator in the production of silage and energy maize at the harvesting time. SRI is also universal suitable for use as a standard in scientific trials and for better characteristic of cultivar types and environmental influence.

AB  - Soil microbial biomass C, the metabolic quotient ([qCO(2)] respiration rate to biomass ratio) and growth characteristics, such as lag period and specific respiration increment after the addition of glucose to the soil, were determined for 19 surface soils varying widely in pH and land use under different climatic conditions in Asia. The soil samples included natural undisturbed forest and grassland soils, and disturbed soils affected by cultivation or slash and burn agricultural practices. Although chloroform labile C was significantly correlated with the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) rate, the ratio of chloroform labile C to SIR was negatively correlated with soil pH. The SIR-biomass C to organic C ratio was significantly correlated with soil pH, but this correlation was not observed between pH and the biomass C to organic C ratio using the fumigation-extraction (FE) method. Similarly, the qCO(2) measured using SIR-biomass C (SIR-qCO(2)) was negatively correlated with soil pH, whereas the qCO(2) measured using FE-biomass C (FE-qCO(2)) was not correlated with pH. These results were in contrast to several reports on the significant correlations between soil pH and FE-biomass C to organic C ratio and FE-qCO(2) using soil samples collected from a relatively narrow range of climatic conditions. Therefore, it could be concluded that soil pH can indirectly affect the FE-biomass C to organic C ratio and FE-qCO(2) by affecting the quality and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter, but has a more direct effect on the SIR-biomass C to organic C ratio and SIR-qCO(2) by inhibiting the mineralization of glucose in acid soils. Although the lag period and the specific respiration increment were not well correlated with any measured variables, the lag period was significantly lower in the disturbed soils than in the natural undisturbed soils. This suggests that the lag period after glucose addition could be used as a good indicator of disturbance.

AB  - Simple Summary: Agonistic behavioural interactions play a decisive role in the competition for food, space, mating opportunities, and establishing social rank. We propose the use of the number of bites on the pelt of red deer as an index of agonistic interactions between group members. Using behavioural data from a 14-year time series of a captive population of Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus), we found that deer that were of higher social rank, heavier, living in smaller groups, or under no heat stress conditions suffer less pelt bites than those of lower social rank, lighter, living in bigger groups, or under heat stressing conditions. Hinds that gave birth earlier in the parturition period suffered less pelt biting than those that gave birth around the peak of the parturition season. Pelt biting is useful to identify management situations in which deer welfare could be at stake.Agonistic behavioural interactions play a decisive role in the competition for food, space, mating opportunities, and establishing social rank. We used pelt biting (number of bites on an animal's body) as a proxy for assessing the intensity of agonistic animal interactions and how it responded to social, population, and heat stress factors. We modelled a 14-year time series of pelt biting records and observational data of agonistic interactions on a population of captive Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus). We found that (i) the higher the social rank of deer, the lower the number of pelt bites received; (ii) increasing heat stress conditions caused deer to suffer more pelt bites; (iii) males received more bites than females; (iv) the heavier the deer, the lower the number of bites on their bodies; (v) the bigger the group, the more bites exhibited on its members; (vi) deer 5-6 years old suffered greater rate of pelt biting than younger or older deer; and (vii) hinds that gave birth earlier in the parturition period suffered less pelt biting than those that gave birth around the peak of the parturition season (p < 0.01 for all effects). Pelt biting is useful to predict management situations in which deer welfare could be at stake.

AB  - Naturally dense soils have been commonly managed for coffee plantations in Vertentes Fields physiographic zone of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Such dense soils in association with the irregular rainfall in recent years have increased risks for crop productivity. Therefore, management practices aiming at improving subsoil root exploration have been recommended for enhancing absorption of water and nutrient uptake, thus mitigating the edaphic drought process and ensuring the development, productivity, and longevity of the coffee crop. A field experiment was carried out in an area of dense Inceptisols through the planting of the coffee crop to investigate the effect of deep furrowing with additional liming on soil quality indexes and as a function of normalized pore distribution by volume [S*(h)]. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 5 treatments: 40 (conventional soil preparation with furrows at 0.40 m of depth); 60 (soil preparation with furrow to 0.60 m of depth with conventional (60S) and complementary liming application (60C)); 80 (soil preparation with furrow to 0.80 m of depth with conventional (80S) and complementary liming application (80C)). These treatments were compared to an area under native Cerrado vegetation. Undisturbed soil samples were collected at different depths in each treatment. On these samples, water content was measured at different matrix potentials, and physical quality indicators along with the S*(h) were calculated. The results indicated that soil management practices, compared to the native condition, promoted a better distribution of water and air (P-AWC, RFC, P-MAC and S index) as well S*(h) up to 0.40 m. Below this depth, none of the management practices were able to promote significant improvements (p < 0.05) of these variables in relation to the soil native condition. The 80C treatment had the best air and water availability, with increased of pore size class having functions of drainage and aeration. Moreover, this treatment stood out in comparison to the conventional management (40) for all measured variables, maintaining the adequate conditions of the native area in depth. For the managed areas, the depth of 0.60 m gave the best improved growth and vegetative vigor of the coffee plants.

AB  - The Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model forms the basis of the European Space Agency's GlobSnow snow water equivalent (SWE) product (Takala et al., 2011). The model applies a semi-empirical radiative transfer calculation to account for the interaction of the snow medium with microwaves; separate components are applied to account for vegetation, the atmosphere, and emission from the ground surface. For the retrieval of SWE, an innovative method is used to account for spatial and temporal variability in snow conditions by retrieving an effective parameter describing the scattering behavior of microwaves in the snow (a proxy indicator of the microwave effective snow grain size). In this study, the influence of differing snow conditions, as well as varying land cover, on the retrieved microwave effective snow grain size was analyzed. Passive microwave measurements were acquired using tower-based, mobile sled-based and airborne radiometers in a mixed forest environment near Sodankyla, Finland. Forward simulations at the tower site over an entire winter period showed that the use of an empirical relation to modify the classical in situ measured grain size produced HUT model bias errors less than 6 K on average at 19 and 37 GHz from a similar to 20-80 cm deep boreal snowpack. Model simulations for airborne and sled-based observations showed that using a simplified 2-layer representation of the snowpack improves simulation biases and RMSE, although modification of the measured grain size was again necessary to achieve these results, regardless of the layering configuration. The microwave effective grain size retrieved from HUT predictions was closely related to a simple average grain size measured in situ, both in terms of magnitude and temporal trend. This is an important finding as the retrieval scheme of Takala et al. (2011) relies on the microwave effective grain size to retain a degree of physical basis for values to be generally applicable over larger areas, which is challenging because this free parameter also accounts for errors unrelated to the effective snow grain size (i.e. vegetation, soil conditions, scene heterogeneity, etc.).

AB  - On the Petten research-site ECN and the ECN-daughter NRG(1) employ respectively about 600 and 300 employees most of whom are well educated Beta-scientists and engineers that work in over a 100 laboratories, with several pilot plants and NRG operates a 48 MW nuclear reactor. Both companies perform energy-research and NRG also produces radiopharmaceuticals. ECN is under the jurisdiction of the Seveso-Directive.
   In 1996, when a major change occurred in the Board, the companies started quality (Q)- and SHE-improvement activities. From 2000 onwards the aim of the SHE-policy has been a level with a LTIF2 < 1. This level was reached for the first time in the year 2005; the 5-year-average value of the LTIF however is still above 1.
   Over the last 10 years various "learning drivers" like performance indicators and audits were active and have resulted in improvements. This article is a retrospective study of this development over the last 10 years by the Head of the Department of Quality, Safety and Environment of ECN.
   Various SHE-improvements have demonstrated between "the chemical and nuclear world" an interesting mutual influencing with respect to best SHE-practices. All of the learning drivers and their results are discussed in this paper. It is also concluded that, for the learning drivers to be effective, prior conditions must be met. All learning drivers are evaluated against these three prior conditions (a systems approach with both "hard" (1) and "soft" (2) elements and management-commitment (3)). From this evaluation it is concluded that that the prior conditions are indeed met. For further development of ECN towards pro-activity management-commitment has to be broadened as well as deepened (so more managers - others than the chairman of the Board - have to set examples and the number of activities of the managers and their visibility has to grow).
   In the end it is concluded that SHE-improvements in an environment with R&D-scientists and engineers can be obtained once involvement of the scientists and engineers is established; this involvement is the result of co-working with SHE-experts. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Activities of daily living often require us to negotiate several obstacles in the travel path. To date, there is little work investigating how adults accomplish such tasks, and there is even less known about multiple obstacle avoidance strategies used by children. The current work will expand our knowledge about the role of vision in adults and children when avoiding two obstacles placed in their travel path under altered ambient lighting. Healthy 7-year old children (n=10; aged 7.51 +/- 0.2 years) and adults (n=10; aged 22.76 +/- 1.7 years) were instrumented with infrared markers (Optotrak, NDI) placed on anatomical landmarks and asked to walk along a ten meter path under three conditions: unobstructed, single obstacle, or double obstacle. These trials were performed under two lighting conditions: Full (simulating standard office lighting) and Low (simulating a dark hallway lit by nightlights). Data analyses included lead and trail clearance values, step length, step width and step velocity, take-off distance and Horizontal toe Displacement at Apex (HDA) which was defined as the distance between the horizontal position of the toe to the leading edge of the obstacle when the toe reaches its peak height. Adults were able to maintain consistent behaviour regardless of the number of obstacles in the travel path. Children, however, adjusted their foot placement for the second obstacle. This indicates that having multiple obstacles in the travel path is a more challenging task for 7-year old, and suggests that children at this age may not have fully developed anticipatory locomotor strategies. Children had larger clearance values than adults for the lead foot crossing the obstacle under all obstacle and lighting conditions, and consistently used larger HDA values than adults. Together, these findings suggest that children adopt more cautious strategies than adults in complex environments. Additionally, children decreased walking velocity, increased step width and decreased their step length in a Low light environment. These changes are all indicators of a more careful avoidance strategy, which implies that children at this age rely heavily on visual information to guide foot placements in a complex environment.

AB  - Simple Summary The study aims to compare physiological and productive responses of five Mediterranean heritage goat breeds with a high production breed, spread worldwide, the Saanen breed. The overall objective of the paper was to highlight that in difficult environmental conditions, although not so extreme, a high production breed does not actually represent the best solution, both from animals' welfare conditions and for production. Mediterranean breeds showed better milk quality than Saanen, and tended to recover earlier from negative energy balance. However, no differences were observed on long-term oxidative stress markers. This paper contributes to increase interest towards animal biodiversity and valorization of local breeds, which are characterized by a long selective pressure linked to the environmental adaptation and less selected for productive traits.
   Abstract This study aimed to describe metabolic, oxidative, and mineral blood profiles of Saanen does through lactation compared with Mediterranean breed clusters (Maltese and Rossa Mediterranea, and Jonica, Garganica, and Girgentana). Milk and blood samples of 57 dairy goats (9-10 goats per breed) were collected from the 2nd to the 30th week of lactation every 2-3 weeks. Saanen showed greater milk yield and somatic cell score, and lower fat and protein percentage through lactation (p < 0.05) than the Mediterranean breed clusters. Blood analysis revealed that stage of lactation had a greater impact than breed cluster, except for uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Plasmatic non-esterified fatty acids indicated a greater negative energy balance in Saanen than the other breed clusters during early and medium lactation stages (p < 0.05). Serum Cl, Mg, and Ca increased in all the breed clusters from early to the following stages of lactation (p < 0.05). No significant prooxidant/antioxidant imbalances were detected in any of the three clusters during the entire lactation. In conclusion, Mediterranean breeds tended to recover earlier from negative energy balance than Saanen, but effects of breed or stage of lactation on long-term oxidative stress indicators were not evident.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of two air stirring systems (ceiling fans vs. axial fans) on environment, performance, rumination and activity of beef cattle during the first period after the arrival to the fattening unit. One group of 106 charolais bulls was raised from August to October in a roofed, loose housing facility with straw bedding. Animals were randomly assigned to pens equipped with one of two types of fans: ceiling fans and axial fans. The trial lasted 70 days, and was divided into 3 periods. In the first and third periods fans were in operation, whereas in the second they were switched off. Animals were evaluated for average daily weight gain, cleanliness, dry matter intake, rumination time, activity level and health condition. The temperature-humidity index and the comprehensive climate index were continuously calculated and pens were periodically checked for the dry matter of the bedding.
   The average temperature-humidity index was lower in the third period (65.5) compared to the first (74.4) and second (75.3) periods (P < 0.001), but was not affected by the air stirring system, while on the contrary the comprehensive climate index was higher in AF than in CF during the first period (27.1 vs. 24.9 degrees C; P < 0.05). Ceiling fans led to higher dry matter of the bedding in the first (30.6 vs. 45.1%; P < 0.01), second (29.4 vs. 34.3%; P < 0.05) and third periods (22.2 vs. 31.3%; P < 0.05) and to cleaner bulls at the end of the trial. Animals raised with ceiling fans showed higher average daily weight gain (1.20 vs. 1.36 kg/day; P = 0.039), higher daily rumination time in the first period (431 vs. 475 m; P < 0.01) and patterns of rumination and activity compatible with a lower level of heat stress. Based on these results, it appears that ceiling fans are promising tools to be used to reduce heat stress and optimize performance of beef cattle.

AB  - The specific climatic and geographical conditions of the northern territories of Russia, the relatively small workforce, as well as intensive migration processes require a specific approach with regard to northern regions and, particularly, to the healthcare of the young generation residing in the territory. This study was aimed at exploring the body functionality of the young inhabitants of Russia's Northeast considered as a human rescource for the future in relation to their period of residence in Magadan oblast. Based on the study of cardiovascular, biochemical, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, psychophysiological characteristics, as well as respiratory system and gas exchange parameters, a comparative examination was carried which involved 1,560 male students aged 17-21. Depending on their period of residence in Magadan oblast, the examined subjects were divided into three groups. Group 1 was presented by newcoming settlers, whites by origin (adaptants), who had migrated from the Central-European or Asian areas of Russia and lived in the northern region for at least 5 years (the zero generation). Group 2 was made up of those young males born and living in Magadan oblast (the 1st generation), whites by origin, who were children of immigrants to the area. Finally, group 3 was representatives of the 2nd generation born and living in Magadan oblast, whose parents were representatives of the 1st generation. We found that people with a longer term of residency in the north had become more optimized in cardiovascular functioning (demonstrate decrease in arterial pressure and more effective myocardial performance), less stressed in external respiration with simultaneous decrease in exhaled heat loss, had normalised lipid metabolism shown through a reduced percentage of deviations in lipidograms as well as the index of atherogenicity and higher functioning of the central nervous system. Besides, having experienced severe climatic conditions they have formed their specific region-related metabolic profile featuring lowered lipid metabolism values and high blood glucose which can be caused by changes in nutrition of city residents. It should be concluded that discovered tendency of adaptive changes demonstrated by north-born young white males enables us to consider it as formation of a new population of inhabitants of the North having the best functional abilities for optimal adaptation to the specific ecological and climatic conditions.

AB  - In tropical forest ecosystems, highly weathered soils are often considered as relatively nitrogen-rich but phosphorus-poor. Nutrient availability greatly regulates ecosystem processes and functions of tropical forests. However, little is known about how nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions affect the conditions of soil food web which is an important component of belowground ecosystems. In the present study, soil nematode communities were monitored and served as indicators of soil food web conditions under experimental nitrogen and phosphorus additions in a secondary forest in tropical China. The principal response curves of soil nematode community structure revealed same tendency of changes under nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions compared with control, in terms of nematode functional guild compositions: apparent successions from communities dominated by He-3 and Ba-1 to communities dominated by Ba-2 and Fu(2) occurred after nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions. The diversity of soil nematode genera was not sensitive to either nitrogen or phosphorus addition. Phosphorus addition significantly suppressed total nematode density, density of omnivore-predators, and four nematode faunal indices (i.e. MI25, El, SI, and SFI), but increased two faunal indices (i.e. Cl and BaI). However, nitrogen addition did not induce remarkable changes of these variables in the present study. Our results suggest that nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions suppress soil nematodes in tropical secondary forests, which was inconsistent with our expectation that nitrogen addition was detrimental to and phosphorus addition was conducive to soil nematodes in this nitrogen-rich but phosphorus-poor soil. Furthermore, the effects of phosphorus addition are more powerful than the effects of nitrogen addition. Moreover, phosphorus addition degrades the structure and trophic links of the soil food web, reduces the carbon utilization of soil nematodes, and leads to a more fungal dominated decomposition pathway. The alterations of soil food web conditions might result in altered ecosystem functioning. Our findings could provide a better understanding of the responses of soil food web to nitrogen and phosphorus additions in nitrogen-rich but phosphorus-poor soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrologic conditions, especially changes in freshwater input, play an important, and at times dominant, role in determining the structure and function of phytoplankton communities and resultant water quality of estuaries. This is particularly true for microtidal, shallow water, lagoonal estuaries, where water flushing and residence times show large variations in response to changes in freshwater inputs. In coastal North Carolina, there has been an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme climatic (hydrologic) events over the past 15 years, including eight hurricanes, six tropical storms, and several record droughts; these events are forecast to continue in the foreseeable future. Each of the past storms exhibited unique hydrologic and nutrient loading scenarios for two representative and proximate coastal plain lagoonal estuaries, the Neuse and New River estuaries. In this synthesis, we used a 13-year (1998-2011) data set from the Neuse River Estuary, and more recent 4-year (2007-2011) data set from the nearby New River Estuary to examine the effects of these hydrologic events on phytoplankton community biomass and composition. We focused on the ability of specific taxonomic groups to optimize growth under hydrologically variable conditions, including seasonal wet/dry periods, episodic storms, and droughts. Changes in phytoplankton community composition and biomass were strongly modulated by the amounts, duration, and seasonality of freshwater discharge. In both estuaries, phytoplankton total and specific taxonomic group biomass exhibited a distinctive unimodal response to varying flushing rates resulting from both event-scale (i.e., major storms, hurricanes) and more chronic seasonal changes in freshwater input. However, unlike the net negative growth seen at long flushing times for nano-/microphytoplankton, the pigments specific to picophytoplankton (zeaxanthin) still showed positive net growth due to their competitive advantage under nutrient-limited conditions. Along with considerations of seasonality (temperature regimes), these relationships can be used to predict relative changes in phytoplankton community composition in response to hydrologic events and changes therein. Freshwater inputs and droughts, while not manageable in the short term, must be incorporated in water quality management strategies for these and other estuarine and coastal ecosystems faced with increasing frequencies and intensities of tropical cyclones, flooding, and droughts.

AB  - Analyses performed on 26 surface sediment samples collected with a box corer at 17 stations throughout the North Water and northern Baffin Bay (75-79degreesN; 68-80degreesW) revealed abundant organic-walled microfossils, mostly dinoflagellate cysts (10(3)-10(4) cysts g(-1)) and organic linings of benthic foraminifers (10(2)-10(3) OLg(-1)), as well as high organic carbon concentrations (0.87-2.81% dry weight). These data indicate high productivity in both the pelagic and benthic environments of the North Water and slightly lower productivity in northern Baffin Bay. The data also showed calcium carbonate and biogenic silica dissolution throughout the study area. The dinocyst assemblages were relatively uniform in the North Water and dominated by heterotrophic taxa (Algidasphaeridium? minutum and Brigantedinium spp.), whereas northern Baffin Bay assemblages were dominated by autotrophic taxa, notably Operculodinium centrocarpum and Spiniferites elongatus. The difference between these two assemblages may be related to higher diatomaceous primary production in the North Water than in northern Baffin Bay, since diatoms constitute the principal food source of heterotrophic dinoflagellates. The biogeographical boundary between the North Water and northern Baffin Bay has been maintained for at least the last few centuries as shown by analyses of microfossils and geochemical tracers in two sediment cores, one taken in the southeastern part of the North Water (76degrees17'N, 72degrees02'W) and the other in northeastern Baffin Bay (75degrees35'N, 70degrees48'W). The analyses of the North Water core revealed relatively uniform microfossil assemblages and organic carbon fluxes ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 mg C-org cm(-2) yr(-1) for the last few centuries, which corresponded to 4-6% of the present annual primary production in the euphotic zone. These data suggest high productivity and relatively stable conditions in the polynya on a decadal time scale. In the northeastern Baffin Bay core, the analyses indicated generally lower organic carbon fluxes, ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 mg C-org cm(-2) yr(-1), and (from the microfossil data) significant variations in sea-surface conditions at this lower latitude over the last centuries.

AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the Northern Great Plains is the most important breeding area for waterfowl in North America. Historically, the size of breeding duck populations in the PPR has been highly correlated with spring wetland conditions. We show that one indicator of climate conditions, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), is strongly correlated with annual counts (from 1955 to 1996) of both May ponds (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.0001) and breeding duck populations (R-2 = 0.69, p < 0.0001) in the Northcentral U.S., suggesting the utility of PDSI as an index for climatic factors important to wetlands and ducks. We then use this relationship to project future pond and duck numbers based on PDSI values generated from sensitivity analyses and two general circulation model (GCM) scenarios. We investigate the sensitivity of PDSI to axed changes in temperature of 0 degrees C, +1.5 degrees C, +2.5 degrees C, and +4.0 degrees C in combination with fixed changes in precipitation of -10%, +0%, +7%, and +15%, changes spanning the range of typically-projected values for this region from human-induced climatic change. Most (11 of 12) increased temperature scenarios tested result in increased drought (due to greater evapotranspiration under wanner temperatures) and declining numbers of both wetlands and ducks. Assuming a doubling of CO2 by 2060, both the equilibrium and transient GCM scenarios we use suggest a major increase in drought conditions. Under these scenarios, Northcentral U.S. breeding duck populations would fluctuate around means of 2.1 or 2.7 million ducks based on the two GCMs, respectively, instead of the present long-term mean of 5.0 million. May pond numbers would fluctuate around means of 0.6 or 0.8 million ponds instead of the present mean of 1.3 million. The results suggest that the ecologically and economically important PPR could be significantly damaged by climate changes typically projected. We make several recommendations for policy and research to help mitigate potential effects.

AB  - A study was undertaken to develop methods for extensive inventory and analysis of wildlife habitats. The objective was to provide information about amounts and conditions of wildlife habitats from extensive, sample-based inventories so that wildlife can be better considered in forest planning and policy decisions at the regional scale. The new analytical approach involves identifying habitats present on field plots, estimating area present in each habitat condition, and linking the habitat classifications with wildlife-habitat relationship models to describe habitat suitability for wildlife species. The habitat classification system and wildlife-habitat relationship models of the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship Program are used in a case study of the north coast region of California. Tree vegetation types occupy 93 percent of all forest land, and shrub habitats occupy 5 percent. Redwood and Douglas-fir are the most abundant tree habitats; chamise-redshank chaparral is the predominant shrub habitat. Outside parks and National Forests, midsuccessional stages dominate the forest landscape in occupying two-thirds of the timberland area. Two-thirds of forest stands have moderate or dense canopy closure. The suitability of available habitats for reproduction and feeding for eight wildlife species are presented. The estimates of habitat area indicate the availability and patterns of occurrence of these vegetation conditions at a broad scale and should be useful in evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions affecting broad-scale alterations of habitat. The estimates of habitat suitability are used appropriately in regional-level predictions of species occurrence and habitat suitability. Extensive inventory data on special habitat elements such as snags, nontree vegetation, and spatial features of habitat also can be used in resource assessments and ecological research; for example, only 9 percent of the habitat area rated as being of high or medium suitability for reproduction for pileated woodpeckers supports snag habitat required by the species. Large snags are most abundant in dense, pole-sized and larger stands in the redwood type and in large-treed stand's of all densities in the Douglas-fir type. Data from continuing forest inventories also are useful for regionallevel monitoring of wildlife habitats and in habitat simulations.

AB  - Understanding the variations and leading atmospheric mechanisms causing wet and dry episodes are very important for the water management strategies. For this purpose, this study investigates the spatiotemporal variation and background environmental conditions for wet and dry spell lengths in Turkey. With this aim, Mann-Kendall rank statistic test and fitted ordinary least squares regression method are implemented to the 92 meteorology stations, which are homogenously distributed over Turkey, for the period 1966-2018. In terms of atmospheric circulation mechanisms, synoptic composites of NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data (sea level pressure, air temperature at 850-hPa level, geopotential height at 500-hPa level) and sea surface temperature from NOAA High Resolution data are applied to the five years of highest frequency long dry/wet spells. According to the results, both the increasing frequencies of wet spells and their highest contribution to the precipitation are mainly found in the eastern Black Sea Region (BSR) of Turkey during all seasons, especially in spring. In this sub -region, statistically significant increasing (decreasing) springtime wet (dry) spell lengths in the neighboring five stations (i.e. Ardahan, Artvin, Bayburt, Hopa, Rize) indicated that the majority of wet spells (almost 30%) appear to occur between 3 and 5 days and the maximum number of the wet spell days are shown in the last two decades of the eastern BSR. Local quasi-stationary surface high located over eastern Black Sea (1016-hPa core) and associated weak northerly winds transfer relatively warm moist air from the sea surface (11.8 C in average). This air mass meets with cold-land and low level (6 C at 850 hPa) air masses, developing instability conditions and resulting in low precipitation rates in wet spells for the eastern BSR. On the other hand, by the extension of the south-west Asian Monsoon to the inner parts of Turkey, relatively hot dry air is transferred to the eastern BSR via southerly winds. As a result of this long-staying Asiatic monsoon characteristics, more dry days are shown in the region due to insufficient moisture and associated lack of precipitation.

AB  - Atmospheric dispersion calculation of radiological releases can be done for different purposes such as deterministic or probabilistic safety analysis, environmental impact assessment, emergency preparedness and response. The characteristics of the weather conditions used in such assessments have a significant effect on the results, thus it is vital to select appropriate meteorological data for the calculation. In this paper, we conduct a study on deterministic safety analysis of radiological releases and investigate the effects of using different subsets of a meteorological database for such assessments.
   We demonstrate that conducting deterministic dose assessment with a large site specific dataset of meteorological measurements and the use of a dose percentile is more beneficial than using one set of meteorological parameters. This is because variations in the meteorological condition have considerable effect on the dose results when using one set of meteorological parameters (e.g. worst case scenario) and less when a large meteorological database is used. We show that there can be a significant difference in the maximum dose computed with a large (at least annual with hourly resolution) meteorological database when there is a lack of data points or conversion of the parameters is needed, thus the 100th dose percentile is not optimal for verification of safety criteria fulfillment. It is better to use a relatively high percentile (e.g. from 80th to 99th), partly because it behaves more robustly and also because the use of the maximum dose (100th percentile) would be overly conservative. In case of meteorological data not being available for a sufficient temporal domain (e.g. data available for only one year or less), a multiplication factor - determined based on conservative assumptions and extensive studies on the possible spread of meteorological conditions and their effect at a given location - can be used for the comparison of a selected dose percentile with the safety limit.
   A 5-years long meteorological database provided by a meteorological measurement system was used in this study as an example to demonstrate and calibrate the methodology on a real database. The methods presented in this work are universal, they can be used in deterministic safety analysis of other nuclear facilities, and the results can facilitate the development of optimal meteorological databases.

AB  - Under unfavourable conditions, clonal plants benefit from physiological integration among ramets, sharing resources and information. Clonal integration can buffer against environmental changes and lets the plant clone work as a 'macro' organism. Molecular signals that regulate this phenomenon are completely unknown in marine plants. Here we present a first comprehensive study providing insights into the metabolic role of different types of ramets (i.e. apical vs. vertical) in the foundation speciesPosidonia oceanica. Plants were exposed to 80% diminishing irradiance level (LL) in a controlled mesocosm system. Subsequent multiscale variations in whole transcriptome expression, global DNA methylation level, photo-physiology, morphology and fitness-related traits, were explored at different exposure times. We tested the hypothesis that vertical shoots (the 'vassals') can provide vital resources to apical shoots (the 'kings') under energy shortage, thus safeguarding the whole clone survival. Whole transcriptome analysis of leaves and shoot-apical meristems (SAMs) emphasized signatures of molecular integration among ramets, which strongly correlated with higher organization-level responses. In both shoots types, the exposure to LL resulted in a growth slowdown throughout the experiment, which started from immediate signals in SAMs. In apical shoots, this was linked to an acclimative response, where they were suffering a mild stress condition, while in vertical ones it fell in a more severe stress response. Yet, they suffered from sugar starvation and showed a clear cellular stress response in terms of protein refolding and DNA repair mechanisms. Several epigenetic mechanisms modulated the observed gene-expression patterns and the cross-talk between DNA methylation and the cellular energetic status appeared to regulate shoot metabolism under LL. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate a high level of specialization of integrated ramets within seagrass clones and a 'division of labour' under adverse conditions. Vertical shoots appear to do 'most of the job' especially in terms of resource providing, whereas activated functions in apical shoots were restricted to few important processes, according to an 'energy-saving' strategy. The response of vertical shoots could be seen as a 'sacrificing response' allowing the survival of 'the king' that is key for ensuring propagation and population maintenance, and for the colonization of new environments.

AB  - This paper presents a biostratigraphic study of upper Miocene to lower Pliocene sedimentary successions from SE Romania based on palynological and micropalaeontological analyses integrated with geophysical wireline log profiles. The data derive from five wells drilled in an area of the Dacian Basin where no previous biostratigraphic data are available. A detailed correlative framework of palynological datums for the studied interval is proposed, which complements and supplements the ostracod and mollusc-based biostratigraphy traditionally used for age determination in the Neogene of the Dacian Basin. Interpretation of the microfossil assemblages in terms of depositional environments enables correlation of the recorded bioevents with regional palaeoenvironmental changes recognised in more marginal areas of the Dacian Basin. Two major marine incursions into the basin are represented by influxes of the benthonic foraminifer Ammonia beccarii and used to define the Khersonian - Meotian and the Mcotian Pontian boundaries. Between these two transgressions, the Meotian is interpreted as a period with at least a certain degree of marine influence. The occurrence of dinocyst taxa usually found in Mediterranean and Atlantic records suggests a connection between Paratethys and the Mediterranean, which probably occurred via the Black Sea. After the Meotian-Pontian marine flooding, a diverse endemic microflora derived from the Pannonian Basin is first recorded in the lower Pontian succession. The signature of a reduction in water level during the middle Pontian within the study area is interpreted to be represented in the successions by an interval dominated by distinctive sand units. The endemic Pannonian dinocysts experienced a significant increase in abundance in the late Pontian, indicating the development of brackish conditions and a water level rise during this period. Due to the absence of foraminifera, or any other indicator of marine conditions, it is probable that this water level rise was related to a positive hydrological balance, as suggested in the Focsani region. The Pontian-Dacian boundary is determined by a transition from brackish to fresh depositional environments, which is associated with a change in the microfloras and the first occurrence of coal layers.

AB  - Plant disease and pests influence the physiological state and restricts the healthy growth of crops. Physiological measurements are considered the most accurate way of assessing plant health status. In this paper, we researched the use of an in situ hyperspectral remote sensor to detect plant water status in winter wheat infected with powdery mildew. Using a diseased nursery field and artificially inoculated open field experiments, we detected the canopy spectra of wheat at different developmental stages and under different degrees of disease severity. At the same time, destructive sampling was carried out for physical tests to investigate the change of physiological parameters under the condition of disease. Selected vegetation indices (VIs) were mostly comprised of green bands, and correlation coefficients between these common VIs and plant water content (PWC) were generally 0.784-0.902 (p < 0.001), indicating the green waveband may have great potential in the evaluation of water content of winter wheat under powdery mildew stress. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) was sensitive to physiological response influenced by powdery mildew, and the relationships of PRI with chlorophyll content, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), and the potential activity of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fo) were good with R-2 = 0.639, 0.833, 0.808, respectively. Linear regressions showed PRI demonstrated a steady relationship with PWC across different growth conditions, with R-2 = 0.817 and RMSE = 2.17. The acquired PRI model of wheat under the powdery mildew stress has a good compatibility to different experimental fields from booting stage to filling stage compared with the traditional water signal vegetation indices, WBI, FWBI1, and FWBI2. The verification results with independent data showed that PRI still performed better with R-2 = 0.819 between measured and predicted, and corresponding RE = 8.26%. Thus, PRI is recommended as a potentially reliable indicator of PWC in winter wheat with powdery mildew stress. The results will help to understand the physical state of the plant, and provide technical support for disease control using remote sensing during wheat production.

AB  - This study focuses on Holocene monsoon dynamics on the central Tibetan Plateau (TP) inferred using a sediment record from Lake Nam Co. A high-resolution (decadal) multi-proxy approach, using geochemical, micropaleontological, and sedimentological methods was applied. Fifteen AMS-C-14 ages were used to establish the chronology, assuming a reservoir effect of 1,420 years. Our results point to a first strong monsoonal pulse at Lake Nam Co similar to 11.3 cal ka BP, followed by colder and drier conditions until similar to 10.8 cal ka BP. A warm and humid climate from similar to 10.8 to similar to 9.5 cal ka BP is related to a strong summer monsoon on the central TP, triggering a lake-level highstand at similar to 9.5 cal ka BP. Declining minerogenic input after similar to 9.5 cal ka BP indicates less moisture availability until similar to 7.7 cal ka BP. Following stable conditions between similar to 7.7 and similar to 6.6 cal ka BP, a warm and wet climate is inferred for the time span from similar to 6.6 to similar to 4.8 cal ka BP. A change towards drier conditions after similar to 4.8 cal ka BP points to a weakening of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon on the central TP, further diminished after similar to 2.0 cal ka BP. A short-term wet spell occurred from similar to 1.5 to similar to 1.3 cal ka BP. By comparing the results derived from Lake Nam Co with several lacustrine records from the central, northern, and eastern TP, a similar but not synchronous pattern of monsoon-driven paleoenvironmental change is observed. Although the general trend of lake and catchment evolution on the TP during the Holocene is also reproduced in this record, pronounced spatial and temporal offsets with respect to distinct climate events were detected, suggesting periods of non-uniform moisture and temperature evolution.

TI  - COLLAGEN QUALITY INDICATORS FOR RADIOCARBON DATING OF BONES: NEW DATA ON BRONZE AGE CYPRUS
T2  - RADIOCARBON
LA  - English
CP  - 21st International Radiocarbon Conference
KW  - PRESERVATION
KW  - AMS
AB  - Radiocarbon dating of bones can be very useful in archaeological contexts, especially when dealing with funerary deposits lacking material culture, e. g. pottery vessels. C-14 measurements of bone samples are usually performed on the extracted collagen residue. The content and the quality of collagen can vary significantly, mainly depending on bone preservation and diagenesis. Generally speaking, environmental conditions such as low pH level of soils, high temperatures, and percolating groundwaters, typical of arid and tropical zones, can affect the preservation of collagen; at the same time, bones recovered in such environments are more likely to be contaminated with carbon from the surrounding environment. Possible contamination of samples can also occur in temperate zones. While low collagen content is a condition we cannot overcome, we can use several chemical and elemental indicators in order to assess collagen quality. Among these, the C/N atomic ratio is considered a good parameter for detecting low-quality collagen and possibly contaminated samples. In a combustion and graphitization setup like that installed at INFN-LABEC, Florence, measurement can be easily performed using an elemental analyzer when combusting the sample prior to graphitization, thus requiring no extra effort (or extra amount of sample) during the preparation procedure. Bone samples recently C-14 dated at INFN-LABEC have confirmed that the measurement of C/N atomic ratios can give some indications of the collagen quality. The bone material was collected from 3 necropoles of the Bronze Age period in Cyprus (Erimi-Laonin tou Porakou, Lophou-Kolaouzou, and Erimi-Kafkalla&Pitharka, along the Kouris Valley), an area characterized by environmental conditions that do not favor bone preservation. Samples were treated to extract collagen and measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). C-14 results have been compared with the archaeological evidence, showing some relationship between measured C/N atomic ratios and collagen quality. In particular, when grouping the measured samples according to their C/N ratio, the agreement between C-14 dates and archaeological evidence is good or inconsistent when the C/N ratio clearly falls inside or outside the "recommended" range, respectively, with a still reasonable agreement also when it is slightly above the upper limit of that range.

AB  - Aiming to identify efficient indicators for reservoir water quality, the abundance of cyclopoid copepods, 11 limnological variables, and a modified trophic state index (TSI) for tropical/subtropical reservoir systems were studied in 30 different reservoirs in South America. A total of 331 fieldwork campaigns, originated from six different studies on a wide spatial-temporal scale were analyzed. Samplings included small to large reservoirs (varying between 6 and 2250 km(2) area) with oligo, meso and eutrophic conditions, and places with punctual eutrophication from fish cage farms. Spatial scale ordination was relevant for variables and reservoirs, but the temporal scale was also important in all analyses, positioning the same reservoir sampled in different years contrasting correlations in terms of species and variables. Principal component analysis consistently indicated the importance of chlorophyll, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), turbidity, transparency, and depth for proper ordination of reservoirs according to their trophy. Of all the 13 cyclopoid species identified, ten were planktonic and at the end, after conclusive statistical correlation analysis, five species were selected as efficient water quality indicators. Redundancy analysis related different species with different trophic aspects: Acanthocyclops robustus, Microcyclops anceps and Tropocyclops prasinus were positively associated with chlorophyll and inversely associated with water transparency, Thermocyclops decipiens and T. inversus with electrical conductivity, and slightly associated with chlorophyll and total nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), and finally Thermocyclops minutus was positively correlated with transparency. Spearman correlations indicated that only T. inversus abundance was correlated with water temperature, but T. decipiens was not correlated with TSI, which is intriguing because this species has been commonly associated with eutrophic waters. Despite tolerate a wide range of trophic conditions, as pointed in RDA, T. decipiens seems to be replaced by other more resistant species when trophic conditions become too high - hypereutrophic environments. Four other selected species were correlated with TSI, and T. minutus was negatively correlated, confirming its association with oligotrophic waters. From all species found, we conclude that A. robustus, M. anceps, T. prasinus, T. decipiens and T. minutus are good indicators of trophic state level in South American reservoirs.

AB  - Blooms of the Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC) consist of mixtures of toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing populations, but the environmental conditions that determine their relative abundance and shift are not clear. Morphological traits reflect the responses of MAC organisms to environmental changes, thus they could be useful to improve the predictability of the abundance of both toxic and nontoxic populations. In this work, the response of MAC toxic populations to environmental conditions and their relationship with morphology (size of organisms) were investigated in different water bodies (reservoir, river, and estuary) covering wide salinity (0-33) and temperature (10-36 degrees C) gradients. Sub-surface water samples were collected and divided into 4 size classes (mesh size <20 mu m, 20-60 mu m, 60-150 mu m and> 150 mu m) and three toxicity proxies were assessed (mcyE gene and transcripts copy numbers and microcystin concentration) for each size-class. For all the size-classes, the logarithm of the number of mcyE gene copies per sample was proportional to the logarithm of the corresponding biovolume fraction, showing that MAC biovolume is a good indicator of toxicity potential. When toxicity was analyzed through mcyE transcript abundance and microcystin concentration, the largest size fraction (>150 mu m) showed the highest toxicity values of both proxies. Nevertheless, mcyE transcription and toxin production per cell were higher in the colonies retained in the 60 to 150 mu m size fractions, followed by single cells (<20 mu m). At the reservoir, where environmental variability is low, the total abundance of mcyE gene copies was significantly explained by MAC biovolume, regardless of the environmental conditions. However, when data from the reservoir to the estuary were modeled, biovolume and temperature (with a minor contribution of salinity and wind intensity) were selected in the best models. According to these results, the size distribution of MAC biovolume appears as a good predictor of active toxin production, being the colonies in the 60-150 mu m size fraction good indicators of higher toxicity. These results can be used to predict MAC toxicity based on the size structure of the community.

AB  - The design and evaluation of solutions for integrated surface water quality management requires an integrated modelling approach. Integrated models have to be comprehensive enough to cover the aspects relevant for management decisions, allowing for mapping of larger-scale processes such as climate change to the regional and local contexts. Besides this, models have to be sufficiently simple and fast to apply proper methods of uncertainty analysis, covering model structure deficits and error propagation through the chain of sub-models. Here, we present a new integrated catchment model satisfying both conditions. The conceptual "iWaQa" model was developed to support the integrated management of small streams. It can be used to predict traditional water quality parameters, such as nutrients and a wide set of organic micropollutants (plant and material protection products), by considering all major pollutant pathways in urban and agricultural environments. Due to its simplicity, the model allows for a full, propagative analysis of predictive uncertainty, including certain structural and input errors. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by predicting future surface water quality in a small catchment with mixed land use in the Swiss Plateau. We consider climate change, population growth or decline, socio-economic development, and the implementation of management strategies to tackle urban and agricultural point and non-point sources of pollution. Our results indicate that input and model structure uncertainties are the most influential factors for certain water quality parameters. In these cases model uncertainty is already high for present conditions. Nevertheless, accounting for today's uncertainty makes management fairly robust to the foreseen range of potential changes in the next decades. The assessment of total predictive uncertainty allows for selecting management strategies that show small sensitivity to poorly known boundary conditions. The identification of important sources of uncertainty helps to guide future monitoring efforts and pinpoints key indicators, whose evolution should be closely followed to adapt management. The possible impact of climate change is clearly demonstrated by water quality substantially changing depending on single climate model chains. However, when all climate trajectories are combined, the human land use and management decisions have a larger influence on water quality against a time horizon of 2050 in the study.

AB  - Despite increased attention to spatial considerations in catchments, the importance of both environmental factors and spatial context in understanding stream fish assemblages is not fully resolved. This study explored the relative influences and spatial relationships of environmental factors at landscape (i.e., catchment) and local (i.e., reach) scales on characteristics of stream fish assemblages including species richness (S), diversity (H', even-ness, and 1/D), density and biomass, and composition (% top carnivores and % benthic insectivores). We conducted this research in two geographic regions (northern Idaho and Ohio, USA) characterized by distinct environmental attributes. Using a partial constrained ordination approach, we found that pure spatial factors explained 26 % of fish assemblage variation in Ohio (OH) and 18 % in Idaho (ID). Shared (spatially-structured) environmental variables explained more variation in fish assemblages in ID (28.6 %) than in OH (20.7 %). The influence of pure (non-spatial) environmental characteristics accounted for nearly 24 % of the variation observed in fish assemblages in OH catchments, whereas pure environmental factors accounted for 31 % of assemblage variation in ID. Within the pure environmental component, the influence of local, landscape, and joint (i.e., combined effects of environmental variables from both spatial scales) effects accounted for relatively equal amounts of assemblage variation for both study regions. However, local-scale variables were slightly more important in ID, whereas joint influences were more important in OH. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that a complex suite of spatial and environmental factors influenced fish assemblages but that the relative importance of these components differed in each of our study areas. The strong influence of spatial patterns in our results reveals the importance of integrating spatial context into studies predicting fish assemblage characteristics. The contrasting findings between geographic regions encourage additional research efforts that address regional variability in multi-scale environmental influences on fish assemblages.

AB  - Spoil heaps, resulting from open-pit mining, are deprived of soil cover. A common method of reclamation for such sites is afforestation aimed at creating whole forest ecosystems. Forest stands planted on soilless areas make it possible to determine the effects of different tree taxa on the species composition of flora. The study focused on the vascular species of herb layers in young forest stands formed by Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus petraea and Robinia pseudoacacia, and mixed stands dominated by Acer pseudoplatanus or Betide pendula. The study included 227 randomly selected plots across the afforested Belchatow Brown Coal Mine spoil heap. Species composition of the herb layer was composed mainly of synanthropic species (over 70%), and was clearly related to the overstory tree species composition of forest stands. TWINSPAN divided sample plots into two groups that developed under the canopy of stands formed by: (1) Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris or Quercus petraea, or mixed stands with Betula pendula, or (2) Alms glutinosa or Robinia pseudoacacia, or mixed stands dominated by Acer pseudoplatanus. The first group was dominated by meadow species (25.8%), while the second had higher richness of ruderal (18.6%) and forest-edge species (14.1%). Plant species associated with fertile and moist forest habitats were more frequent in the second group (Alnus-Robinia), whereas species of acidic and dry forests occurred only in the first group (Betula-Pinus). Non-parametric tests on Ellenberg's indicator values showed that forest stands of Betula-Pinus group created habitat conditions for light-demanding species with low fertility requirements, whereas forest stands of Alnus-Robinia group created habitat conditions for nitrophilous and shade-tolerant plant species. Our data revealed that tree species composition of forest stands is a key factor shaping herb layer conditions and - as a consequence - herb layer species composition despite of initial habitat variability on the spoil heap. These results highlight a key role of forest stand composition in the development of herb layer richness on post-industrial habitats.

AB  - The environmental impact of exposure to 3D-printed plastics as well as potential migration of toxic chemicals from 3D-printed plastics remains largely unexplored. In this work we applied leachates from plastics fabricated using a stereolithography (SLA) process to early developmental stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity. Migration of unpolymerized photoinitiator, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (1 - HCHPK) from a plastic solid phase to aqueous media at up to 200 mg/L in the first 24 h was detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both plastic extracts (LC50 22.25% v/v) and 1 - HCHPK (LC50 60 mg/L) induced mortality and teratogenicity within 48 h of exposure. Developmental toxicity correlated with in situ generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation markers and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in embryos exposed to concentrations as low as 20% v/v for plastic extracts and 16 mg/L for 1 - HCHPK. ROS-induced cellular damage led to induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis which could be pharmacologically inhibited with both antioxidant ascorbic acid and a pan-caspase inhibitor. Neuro-behavioral analysis showed that exposure to plastic leachates reduced spontaneous embryonic movement in 24-36 hpf embryos. Plastic extracts in concentrations above 20% v/v induced rapid retardation of locomotion, changes in photomotor response and habituation to photic stimuli with progressive paralysis in 120 hpf larvae. Significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity with lack of any CNS-specific apoptotic phenotypes as well as lack of changes in motor neuron density, axonal growth, muscle segment integrity or presence of myoseptal defects were detected upon exposure to plastic extracts during embryogenesis. Considering implications of the results for environmental risk assessment and the growing usage of 3D-printing technologies, we speculate that some 3D-printed plastic waste may represent a significant and yet very poorly uncharacterized environmental hazard that merits further investigation on a range of aquatic and terrestrial species.

AB  - Parental full life-cycle exposure to ethinylestradiol (EE2) significantly affects embryo development and survival. One of the possible mechanisms of action of EE2 may involve the impairment of an organism's ability to repair DNA damage. DNA repair mechanisms have sophistically evolved to overcome DNA damaging hazards that threaten the integrity of the genome. In the present study, changes in the transcription levels of key genes involved in two of the most thoroughly studied DNA repair systems in mammals were evaluated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) gonad upon full life-cycle exposure to chronic environmentally low levels of EE2 (i.e., 0.5, 1 and 2 ng/L EE2). Real time PCR was used to analyse the expression levels of nucleotide excision repair genes (NER) as well as the tumor suppressor p53 and downstream selected effectors, i.e., p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), GADD45 alpha (growth arrest and DNA damage induced 45, alpha), bax (bcl2-associated X protein) and p53 key regulator MDM2 (murine double minute 2 protein). NER genes transcription levels in gonads did not differ significantly among treatments. In contrast, the number of transcripts of p53 gene was significantly increased in male gonads at all EE2 exposure concentrations and in females at 1 ng/L EE2. Despite the increase in p53 transcripts, transcription levels of p21, GADD45 alpha and bax genes were not affected upon EE2 treatment, whereas MDM2 gene expression significantly increased in females at the intermediate EE2 dose (1 ng/L). Overall, the present study indicate that chronic low levels of EE2 significantly modulates the transcription of p53, a key gene involved in DNA repair, particularly in male zebrafish gonads, which supports the hypothesis of an impact of EE2 in male gonad DNA repair pathways.

AB  - Water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) are very sensitive to environmental stimulus before and during milking, and this explains why disrupted milk ejections due to blood oxytocin level instability are frequent in this species. According to the literature, the manual stimulation (MS) of teats before milking promotes oxytocin release and allows milk ejection to start within 2-3 min. However, the pre-milking stimulation of teats is not always part of the milking routine in Italian buffalo farms; moreover, buffaloes with unstable milk let-down are sometimes treated with exogenous oxytocin (OX). Different types of pre-milking stimulation can impact differently on the mammary gland epithelium and structures and, therefore, on milk yield. In this study, we observed the changes in teat morphological traits before and after the application of three types of stimuli, i.e., no manual stimulation (NS), MS, and OX, in buffaloes reared in an Italian dairy farm. In particular, measurements were available for 23 and 21 buffaloes for front and rear teats, respectively. Subsequently, the effect of the pre-milking stimulation type was estimated on teat morphological characteristics and on milk traits recorded after the application of stimuli. The results showed that the teat canal length was shorter (P < 0.05) after stimulation in the case of MS and OX compared to NS. Cistern diameter was overall greater for MS and lower for OX. On the contrary, teat wall thickness was greater and lower for OX and MS, respectively. Milk yield and quality (fat, protein, and somatic cell score) were similar across the three types of pre-milking stimulation. In perspective, the impact of these types of pre-milking stimulation should be evaluated on a large scale, and the focus might be put on mammary gland epithelium integrity, mastitis incidence, and other udder health indicators in milk, e.g., electrical conductivity, differential somatic cell count, lactose content, and sodium and chloride concentration.

AB  - Aim Large and ecologically functioning steppe complexes have been lost historically across the globe, but recent land-use changes may allow the reversal of this trend in some regions. We aimed to develop and map indicators of changing human influence using satellite imagery and historical maps, and to use these indicators to identify areas for broad-scale steppe rewilding. Location Eurasian steppes of Kazakhstan. Methods We mapped decreasing human influence indicated by cropland abandonment, declining grazing pressure and rural outmigration in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan. We did this by processing similar to 5,500 Landsat scenes to map changes in cropland between 1990 and 2015, and by digitizing Soviet topographic maps and examining recent high-resolution satellite imagery to assess the degree of abandonment of >2,000 settlements and >1,300 livestock stations. We combined this information into ahuman influence index(HI), mapped changes in HI to highlight where rewilding might take place and assessed how this affected the connectivity of steppe habitat. Results Across our study area, about 6.2 million ha of cropland were abandoned (30.5%), 14% of all settlements were fully and 81% partly abandoned, and 76% of livestock stations were completely dismantled between 1990 and 2015, suggesting substantially decreasing human pressure across vast areas. This resulted in increased connectivity of steppe habitat. Main conclusions The steppes of Eurasia are experiencing massively declining human influence, suggesting large-scale passive rewilding is taking place. Many of these areas are now important for the connectivity of the wider steppe landscape and can provide habitat for endangered megafauna such as the critically endangered saiga antelope. Yet, this window of opportunity may soon close, as recultivation of abandoned cropland is gaining momentum. Our aggregate human influence index captures key components of rewilding and can help to devise strategies for fostering large, connected networks of protected areas in the steppe.

AB  - Water deficit stress is an abiotic stress that causes reductions in growth and yield of many field crops around the world. The present research was aimed to elucidate the mitigating efficiency of exogenous application of select osmoregulators and biostimulants, i.e., potassium dihydrogen phosphate, actosol (R) (humic acid), Amino more (amino acids), and Compound fertilizer, applied as a spray that reached both foliage and the soil, on growth characteristics, antioxidant capacity, and productivity of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. Giza123) under water deficit stress during two successive growing seasons of field experiments in Egypt. Water deficit resulted in stress as estimated by stress indicators and decreased growth and poor health and development as reflected in statistically significant decreases in chlorophyll a and b and major nutrient (NPK) levels in tissues, stem length, number of leaves, and fresh and dry mass as well as yield components such as spike length, grains per spike, biological yield, grain yield, and 1000-grain weight. As a response to water deficit stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) levels increased significantly resulting in lipid peroxidation and decreased membrane integrity and significant increases in antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POX). All four treatments alleviated the detrimental impacts of water deficit stress as evidenced by statistically significantly increased photosynthetic pigment concentration, tissue NPK levels, growth, and yield parameters compared to the water deficit-stressed control, while the stress responses were significantly reduced. The osmoregulators used either partially restored the growth and yield of osmotic-stressed barley plants or certain treatments enhanced them. All osmoregulators tested mitigated the adverse impacts of water deficit stress on barley plants, but the highest induction was found when plants were treated with actosol (R). The beneficial effects of the osmoregulators tested were the strongest overall in the order actosol (R) ? potassium dihydrogen phosphate ? Amino more ? Compound fertilizer.

AB  - Rivers and their associated floodplains are among the world's most highly altered ecosystems, resulting in billions of dollars in restoration expenditures. Successful restoration of these systems requires information at multiple spatial scales (from localized reaches to broader-scale watersheds), as well as information spanning long time frames. Here, we develop a suite of historical landscape indicators of riverine status, primarily from the perspective of salmonid management, using a case study in the Interior Columbia Basin, Washington, USA. We use a combination of historical and modern aerial photography to quantify changes in land cover and reach type, as well as potential fish habitat within channel and off-channel floodplain areas. As of 1949,; 55% of the Wenatchee River floodplain had been converted to agriculture. By 2006, 62% had been modified by anthropogenic development, of which 20% was due to urban expansion. The historical percentage of agricultural land in the watershed and the contemporary percentage of urban area surpass thresholds in land cover associated with deleterious impacts on river systems. In addition, the abundance of reach types associated with the highest quality salmonid habitat (island braided and meandering reaches) has declined due to conversion to straight reach types. The area occupied by fish habitats associated with channel migration (slow/stagnant channels and dry channels) has declined approximately 25-30%. Along highly modified rivers, these habitats have also become increasingly fragmented. Caveats related to visual quality and seasonal timing of historical photographs were important considerations in the interpretation of changes witnessed for headwater island braided systems, as well as for floodplain ponds. Development of rigorous, long-term, multi-scale monitoring techniques is necessary to guide the management and restoration of river-floodplain systems for the diversity of ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - Pipelines can be exposed to a wide variety of loads, depending on the environments and the area of application. These loads may impose large longitudinal plastic strain on pipelines, which could constitute a significant threat to the structural capacity of the pipeline. Reliable calibration of the strain capacity of pipelines plays an important role in the strain-based design (SBD) method. In this paper, a tensile strain capacity (TSC) predictive model (an equation) for welded X42 vintage pipes has been developed by conducting nonlinear parametric analysis followed by nonlinear regression analysis. First, our previously validated extended finite element method (XFEM) model was used to demonstrate the applicability of the XFEM in simulating full-scale ductile fracture response of pipelines subjected to biaxial loading, using pressurized American Petroleum Institute (API) 5L X42 vintage pipes subjected to four-point bending. Second, a parametric study investigating the effects of pipe and defect geometries as well as loading on the pipe TSC is presented. The nonlinear parameterization using XFEM was conducted in abaqus/standard. The TSC trends obtained for the various parameters considered were examined to derive appropriate individual variable functions for each parameter while taking any significant interactions between the parameters into consideration. Also, a nonlinear regression analysis is employed to develop a nonlinear semi-empirical model for predicting the TSC. The results obtained from the developed TSC predictive model (TSCvin.) was compared with those evaluated using the validated XFEM models. The results showed good agreement. Finally, statistical analysis was conducted to ensure the model is unbiased and predicts conservative TSCs by modifying the model using probabilistic error analysis. The modified model is capable of increasing the confidence level in the predicted TSC hence becoming a practical tool for reliable prediction of TSC of X42 vintage pipes needed for conducting pipeline integrity assessment. This modified predictive model is useful in practical applications because it provides a quantifiable degree of conservatism and reliability to the predicted TSCs.

AB  - Eucalyptus plantations have a short rotation cycle and harvesting occurs every 12-15 years, with the potential to modify the ecological integrity of the small streams draining the harvested areas through the reduction of litterfall inputs. We studied litterfall inputs and benthic coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) storage in a small headwater stream draining a eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) plantation before and after clear felling of the plantation. We hypothesized that wood harvesting will result in a reduction of CPOM inputs and storage in the stream. Litterfall inputs ranged 530-700 g m(-2) y(-1) and were approximately halved (200-320 g m(-2) y(-1)) after the harvesting of the eucalyptus trees. Bark and woody materials showed the largest reduction. Leaf inputs were initially reduced sharply, but, during the second year after the harvest, they recovered to about 90% of the values observed before the harvesting. Harvesting of the eucalyptus plantation caused an increase of benthic CPOM storage to 535 g m(-2) but this was a temporary effect and these materials were washed downstream of the study reach. One year after the harvesting, benthic CPOM was reduced below 15 g m(-2). Bark, twigs and other woody residues generated during the preparation of the logs for transportation were retained within the study site and represented the main component (>90%) of the benthic CPOM after timber harvesting. However, 2 years after the harvesting, low inputs of these materials caused an overall reduction of in-stream retention and residence time of benthic CPOM. Amount and composition of benthic CPOM changed quickly in response to alterations of the riparian forest, so we propose the use of CPOM as an indicator of the impact of forestry activities on the ecological functioning of small streams.

AB  - The study presents investigations of epicuticular wax morphology on spruce needles (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) performed by ambient temperature scanning electron microscopy. To use alterations to epicuticular wax morphology as a successful tool in forest damage research, it is necessary to distinguish environmental influences and artefacts from common pollution effects. The present paper summarizes observations of alterations to epicuticular waxes independent of pollution effects, recorded in various field studies. These observations are supplemented by controlled experiments to investigate wax alterations owing to solvents and mechanical injury. Fissures in the antechamber wax were the result of needle shrinkage during drying. Wax alterations, where only the antechamber wax was affected by a continuous loss of the structural integrity of wax tubes, were classified as storage artefacts since they occurred exclusively on needles stored in air-tight glass vials and were unrelated to needle age, sampling site or pollution influence. Such wax alterations were never observed in needles stored in air-permeable paper bags. Mechanical injury also resulted in severe morphological alterations to epicuticular wax structures. The wax tubes on the surface as well as in the antechamber were squashed and flattened. On smoothed and squashed wax layers a significant regrowth of wax tubes was occasionally observed, unrelated to needle age. Though the tubular form of the re-crystallized waxes was similar to those originally present on the surface, the tube diameters were much wider. Since redeveloped wax tubes also occurred on dead needles which had been artificially injured, this process could be classified as re-crystallization analogous to wax re-crystallization out of solvent extracts. The re-crystallization took place within 48 h after the mechanical injury occurred. The implications of the reported wax alterations for a successful use of epicuticular wax morphology as a bioindicator are discussed.

AB  - Long-term monitoring is integral to assessing ecological trends, but fluctuations in funding, available resources, and institutional priorities present challenges to the sustainability of monitoring programs. Incorporating community science has the potential to increase the spatial and temporal extent of monitoring efforts while minimizing cost and may be particularly useful for monitoring under-funded species such as amphibians. Concern over the reliability and integrity of data collected by volunteers, however, hampers broader use of community science in ecological monitoring. We assessed the quality of data collected by and the reliability of community scientists participating in a collaborative amphibian monitoring project requiring strict adherence to data collection protocols. Community scientists' ability to correctly identify and detect species was on par with that of professional biologists. Agreement in species detected by community scientists and biologists ranged from 77% to 99% at sites surveyed by both surveyor types in the same season and modeled detection probabilities were similar for all but one species. Follow-through within a season was high. Since 2014, community scientists (n = 328) completed 75% of surveys to which they had committed. However, retention of community scientists across years was low, with 81% of participants only involved for one season. Community scientists offset agency resource limitations by conducting 32% of surveys and substantially contributed to meeting sample size goals. Furthermore, although time invested in project management and coordination increased with community science involvement, cost savings from field surveys and centralized coordination offset this increase. Our results suggest that with careful project planning and volunteer training, community scientists can contribute robust data to rigorous scientific studies, but project and participants' goals must align to improve retention across years. Successful programs will require substantial investment by personnel for volunteer recruitment, training, data validation, and dissemination of results, however, involvement of community scientists can improve the sustainability of long-term monitoring programs through collaboration and cost savings. Our results support an increasing body of evidence that community science can contribute significantly to ecological monitoring even when considerable commitment and scientific rigor are essential.

AB  - Purpose Biodiversity loss has become widespread since current rates are potentially catastrophic for species and habitat integrity, and the Dachigam National Park in Jammu and Kashmir (India) is not a distinctive case. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to elicit the willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity conservation of the Park. Design/methodology/approach A survey-based choice experiment method was carried out at the Dachigam National Park, an area that is threatened by several anthropogenic pressures. Attributes selected for analysis through choice experiments were endangered species, national park area, research and education opportunities the park withholds. To estimate WTP, a monetary variable involving an increase in entry fee was also incorporated. To obtain the estimates, the authors use the augmented conditional logit model. Findings WTP for the selected attributes per visitor turned out to be (sic)302.07 for enhancing the population of endangered species, (sic)121.91 for improvement in the park area and (sic)171.64 for increasing research and education opportunities the park withholds. Research limitations/implications Though the study uncovers very important aspects of evaluating the biological resources, albeit with some limitations. The study estimates WTP for biodiversity conservation using a conditional logit model, which is based on a specific area and population sample. It would be better if a broader sample is considered to trace out the findings for meaningful generalization. Besides, the results can be replicated for similar kinds of samples. Practical implications With the use of benefits transfer method, this study aims to provide policymakers with useful information to manage biodiversity attributes across the Himalayan region. Originality/value The main contribution of this study is to provide a critical understanding of the valuation to facilitate the concerned body for better planning and management of biological resources. The findings of the present study can be used as an indicator of the inherent economic importance of biological resources across the Himalayan range for their better management and conservation that can help in ensuring sustainable utilization of these resources.

AB  - The hematological effects of chronic radiation exposure in males of the pygmy wood mouse (Apodemus uralensis Pall., 1811) from the East Urals radioactive trace (EURT) area were assessed, taking into account population abundance and reproductive status (immature, ripening, and mature yearlings). For this purpose, we analyzed the morpho-functional characteristics of erythrocytes (red cell indices [MCV, MCH, MCHC], red cell count, activity of antioxidant enzymes [GSH-Px, CAT], lipid peroxidation, glycolysis, osmotic resistance, methaemoglobin content) and blood plasma components (free hemoglobin, total lipids, total cholesterol, and glucose) in the background territory and the EURT area; these areas have a density of soil contamination with Sr-90 of 12,851 and 198 kBq x m(-2) , respectively (four and two order of magnitude higher than the background value). The data indicate the "hyperfunctional" state of the erythrocyte, aimed at activation of the gas transport function of blood in the radioactive environment. This, as a consequence, determines the insufficiency of energy supply of the cell defense system necessary to maintain the structural integrity of the membrane. Intensification of membrane lipid peroxidation, reduction of osmotic resistance and GSH-Px activity in red cells, an increase in the degree of intravascular hemolysis, and tendency towards erythropenia indicate the processes of accelerated aging of erythrocytes and their more pronounced destruction in the circulatory bed. The level of the hematological response increased with increasing radiation burden and was more pronounced with a large population size. The interaction effect of "overpopulation" and "radioactive pollution" was observed to a lesser degree for ripening males, and was very small for sexually mature animals. Immature males from the EURT head part with internal whole-body radiation doses of 0.0045-0.35 mGy/day can be considered as the most sensitive group to the factors synergy, including radiation damage and overabundance population.

AB  - Research on the degree to which carbon (C) availability limits growth in trees, as well as recent trends in climate change and concurrent increases in drought-related tree mortality, have led to a renewed focus on the physiological mechanisms associated with tree growth responses to current and future climate. This has led to some dispute over the role of stored non-structural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze-thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.

AB  - From a subjective point of view, we take the existence of integrated entities, i.e., ourselves as the most unproblematic given, and blithely project such integrity onto untold many "entities" far and wide. However, from a naturalistic perspective, accounting for anything more integral than the attachments and attractions that are explicable in terms of the four fundamental forces of physics has been anything but straightforward. If we take it that the universe begins as an integral unity (the singularity referred to as "the cosmic egg") and explodes into progressive stages of internal detachment, then we can also fathom the idea that eddies of relative detachment becoming increasingly integral. Helmuth Plessner made a powerful case for the onset of "positionality" constituting one of the major transitions in nature. Surely, the emergence of "entities" (i.e., life-forms) that position themselves in relation to their surround marks a decisive transition in relative levels of detachment and some would say "autonomy." It would follow, with no less force, that where and when entities can be seen to be normatively integrated, and indeed to be the agents of their own normativity, that another threshold of detachment has been crossed. The paper introduces and explores the idea that normativity, embedded in a wide-ranging theory of natural detachment, can be considered an emergent force of nature that is requisite to accounting for levels of integration beyond that which is explicable in terms of the four fundamental forces of physics. Following this line of enquiry, we argue that the first expression of a fully, normatively-integrated life-form is neither a spoken language user nor for that matter an individual but rather the neoteny-based, Homo erectus Group. In so doing we claim to have made an inroad into embedding the force of normativity into a wide-ranging naturalist framework, to have provided philosophical anthropology with a new (post-individualist) point of departure, and at least playfully, to have given some naturalistic grist to Hegel's proclamation that spirit (Geist) is the truth of nature.

AB  - Background. Some studies in the Neotropical ecozone evaluated the correlation between the ichthyofauna and the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. This study aimed to estimate the environmental quality of Neotropical streams through quality protocols and diversity indexes. The hypothesis is that it is possible to identify fish species indicators of variables and streams quality associated to environmental conservation and degradation.
   Materials and methods. Sampling occurred quarterly from October 2012 to July 2013, totalling four phases of field surveys in three sample units on each stream (Agua dos Anjos Stream, Monjolinho Stream, and Uba Stream, upper Parana River basin) in southern Brazil. The Indicator Value Method (IndVal) was used to relate the ichthyofauna (abundance and relative frequency of fish species) to physical and chemical variables and streams and their respective environmental characteristics.
   Results. A total of 33 species were analysed as possible indicators by the IndVal method, and 21 species showed a significant relation (P < 0.05) to one or more environmental variables. The exotic Poecilia reticulata Peters, 1859 was best linked to low-oxygen water. Bryconamericus iheringii (Boulenger, 1887) was an indicator of the stream with the worst environmental quality among the analysed streams, and also indicated significantly lower extent of riparian vegetation (< 6 m) and unstable substrate. Geophagus brasiliensis (Quoy et Gaimard, 1824) was also indicator of the stream with inferior environmental quality and low of riparian vegetation (< 6 m). On the other hand, Trichomycterus diabolus Bockmann, Casatti et de Pinna, 2004 was indicator of diverse habitat environments, as it was linked to higher extent of riparian vegetation (> 18 m) and high water oxygenation.
   Conclusion. The fish species: P. reticulata, B. iheringii, and G. brasiliensis were indicators of inferior environmental quality, and T. diabolus was an indicator of superior quality, and its abundance can characterize as important bio-indicators of environmental characteristics of Neotropical streams.

AB  - The growing emphasis on ensuring the sustainability of animal agriculture is providing an impetus for the adoption of new approaches to structuring and conducting research. Sustainability is a complex topic involving many considerations related to the economic, social, and environmental impacts of production systems. Successfully addressing this topic requires multidisciplinary research as well as a high degree of communication with food system stakeholders to ensure that the research results contribute to informed decision making. In this paper, we provide an overview of a public-private partnership, the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES), which was formed to support research evaluating the sustainability of laying hen housing systems. Because of increasing public concerns about the behavioral restriction imposed on laying hens housed in conventional cages, the U.S. egg industry is faced with a need to transition to alternative systems. However, before the CSES project, there was limited information available about how this transition might affect trade-offs related to the sustainability of egg production. The goal of the CSES project was to provide this information by conducting holistic research on a commercial farm that had 3 different hen housing systems. The CSES members represented a variety of stakeholders, including food retailers and distributors, egg producers, universities, and governmental (USDA ARS) and nongovernmental organizations. The CSES was facilitated by a not-for-profit intermediary, the Center for Food Integrity, which was also responsible for communicating the research results to food system stakeholders, including via quantitative and qualitative consumer research. In this paper, we describe the structural aspects of the CSES that were responsible for the successful completion and dissemination of the research as well as the insights that were gained regarding multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration, conducting commercial-scale research, fostering and maintaining stakeholder interaction, and communicating research results. Although not without limitations, this project demonstrates that public-private partnerships can be effective strategies for addressing sustainability questions related to animal agriculture and, thus, serves as a useful model for the other animal industries.

AB  - In the global debate on environmental integrity, land system is one of the nine planetary boundaries. Bangladesh being one of the top densely populated but rapidly developing countries, lacking in statistical inventories, has a gloomy history of agricultural and infrastructural intensification at the expense of forest cover loss. However, to what extent its land has lost productivity due to land use changes is yet to be calculated for Bangladesh which this study explores for 400 years (1700-2100) through the lens of human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP). It shows an increase in both spatial HANPP from 1700 (275.94 gC/m(2)) to 1992 (594.38 gC/m(2)) and non-spatial HANPP from 1961 (1169.37 gC/m(2)) to 2016 (1318.14 gC/m(2)) based on which future projections have been made. Population is a reliable predictor of HANPP which indicated the expected HANPP of 1458.20 gC/m(2) by 2100. Bangladesh shows much higher HANPP compared to its peers and hence the approaches and methodologies of this research may help countries with poor statistical database to calculate HANPP. This study rendered where and to what degree the net primary productivity was appropriated in Bangladesh, suggesting region specific policy and programme interventions necessary to reduce HANPP, The GDP-HANPP regression model indicates a loss of approximately 8.62 million 2018 US$ GDP for reduction of HANPP by 1 kt C/year which can be used as a guiding value in seeking fund from carbon financing mechanisms to pursue the gross HANPP reduction threshold of 926.675 gC/m(2)/year corresponding to the achievement of 25% forest cover in Bangladesh. The HANPP case of Bangladesh provides clue to countries witnessing rapid population and economic growth and associated with large-scale land use changes to expand agriculture and infrastructure, indicating that inaction on their part in harmonizing development planning based on HANPP indicators may jeopardize the attainment of SDGs.

AB  - This study assesses the seabed pressure of towed fishing gears and models the physical impact (area and depth of seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed at the level of the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear "footprints". The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size-gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by metier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of similar to 1.6 km(2) h(-1) of which 0.08 km(2) has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration >= 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0.19 km(2)h(-1)). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

AB  - The usefulness of surrogates to estimate complex variables describing community structure, such as the various components of biodiversity, is long established. Most attention has been given to surrogates of species richness and species diversity and has focused on identifying a subset of taxa as a surrogate of total community richness or diversity. In adopting a surrogate measure, it is assumed that the relationship between the surrogate(s) and total richness or diversity is consistent in both space and time. These assumptions are rarely examined explicitly. We examined the robustness of potential surrogates of familial richness and multivariate community structure for macrofauna communities inhabiting artificial kelp holdfasts by comparing among communities of dissimilar ages and among communities established at different times of the year. This is important because most benthic "landscapes" will be a mosaic of patches reflecting different intensities, frequencies, and timing of disturbances. The total abundance of organisms and familial richness of crustaceans or polychaetes were all good predictors of total familial richness (R-2 > 0.68). In contrast, while the familial richness of other groups, such as mollusks and echinoderms, were well correlated with total familial richness for communities at an early stage of development, the strength of these relationships declined with community age. For multivariate community structure, carefully selected subsets of similar to 10% of the total taxa yielded similar patterns to the total suite of taxa, irrespective of the age of the community. Thus, useful surrogates of both familial richness and multivariate community structure can be identified for this type of community. However, the choice of technique for selecting surrogate taxa largely depends on the nature of the pilot data available, and careful selection is required to ensure that surrogates perform consistently across different-aged communities. While the specific taxa selected as surrogates will vary among different communities, and possibly even among similar communities at different sites, the techniques and the concepts we address are applicable to any community type.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of long term natural feeding in the subsequent reproductive status of 4 years old cultured Solea senegalensis, and to determine if the potential changes were structural or feeding dependent. To this aim, two different feeding regimes were used from one year after weaning and during the following 3 years; 1) a commercial dry food diet and 2) a natural feeding regime. After this period, the proportion of fluent males and the evolution of maturity stages of females over a breeding season were studied. A complete sperm quality analysis assessment was carried out, including individual volumes, motility, density and curvilinear, rectilinear and mean velocities of spermatozoa. Moreover, viability and apoptosis indexes were analyzed as indicator of molecular sperm membrane integrity. Additionally, a morphological characterization of the testes during the spawning season was conducted. Finally, both groups were fed with the same commercial pellets during one year to evaluate the effect of the diet of previous years on sperm quality. The results of this study showed how feeding can improve not only sperm quality and quantity, but also the proportion of fluent males and females in advanced maturity stages. All the sperm quality parameters resulted significantly higher in the group fed with a natural diet. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the group fed with a commercial diet. According to the morphological features of the testes, the animals fed with a natural diet presented more basal position, less protuberances and irregular edges when compared with the animals fed with commercial diet. Interestingly, the progression of the spermatogenesis determined by the proportion of germ cells and the production of spermatozoa determined by the wider of the ducts system was also significantly larger in the natural diet group.
   After the standardization of the diets, mean volume per male and production of total motile cells were significantly higher in the group that was previously fed a natural diet, confirming structural improvements.

AB  - The article examines the evolution of the formation of cities and urban agglomerations in the North of Russia. The aim is to identify cities that meet the criteria of "northern urban agglomeration" from the large cities in the North of Russia. We propose criteria and indicators that make it possible to distinguish urban agglomerations in the urban space; it is noted that for northern urban agglomerations the evaluation criteria can be applied less strictly and indicators less important. We analyze the urban settlement of northern Russia, focusing on northern cities, their structure and the average density of settlements; we consider separately urban-type settlements that contribute to the population density of northern territories, increasing the density of settlements. The focus is on 18 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and four cities with a population of a hundred thousand in different years, the core cities have at least two satellite settlements, according to the criteria proposed, they correspond to the concept of an urban agglomeration core city. We consider and group the selected urban agglomerations according to the structure of satellite settlements and the population living in the zones located within 50, 100 and 150 km from the core. With the help of a review of domestic and foreign literature, we have revealed the essence and content of the category "agglomeration effect". The article identifies three types of agglomeration effects: local objects sharing; cost reduction; and labor pooling. There are two types of effects: localization (clustering) and urbanization effects; the localization effect is the result of enterprises working together in a common area, the urbanization effect is the concentration of organizations in one area, regardless of whether there is thematic proximity between them. Along with the advantages, urban agglomerations cause environmental, economic, political and social problems and pose threats to the stability of small and medium-sized cities; increasing rural deprivation; which will cause further depopulation of large parts of the country, putting the security and integrity of the country at risk.

AB  - In Bangladesh, the approach of water sector emphasises on the agenda like infrastructural development to meet the needs, neglecting governance issues in the water management institutions (WMIs) to achieve their sustainable development. However, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) is committed to work for SDG 2030 by addressing good governance issues in all sphere of its activities. In this context, present study is undertaken to assess the existing water governance status of the WMIs like the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA); the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB); the Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE); and the Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED) as government agencies; and Development Association for Self-reliance, Communication and Health (DASCOH) is a non-government and non-profit organization selected purposively based on their activities in water sector in the drought-prone water scarce Barind Tract in the north-western part of country. The methodology for governance status assessment includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches; and eight indicators like institutions, transparency, accountability, participation, social equity, environmental integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness are taken into consideration where each indicator includes five sub-indicators. Considering individual performance, the assessment indicated that DASCOH Foundation performs 'good', BMDA and LGED show 'moderate', while BWDB and DPHE exhibited 'bad' performance. However, the overall governance status of WMIs falls under 'moderate' category. This result indicates that BWDB and DPHE should look into the governance issue seriously and take a rigorous action plan for its scaling up. On the other hand, BMDA and LGED should be careful about the indicators like transparency, accountability, participation, and social equity. The DASCOH Foundation is performing well by introducing noble concepts to institutionalise the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) under BWA (2013). Finally, there exist gap in governance issues of WMIs in coordination, technical capacity, and transparency in project selection, implementation, and citizen's participation which should be considered seriously in managing water resources in sustainable manner.

AB  - Land use changes can strongly influence stream ecosystems, yet these effects remain poorly documented in many hotspots of deforestation such as tropical Africa. The few studies conducted in this region have mostly focused on structural aspects of stream integrity; sparse data are available for key ecosystem processes such as ecosystem metabolism and litter decomposition. To address this knowledge gap, we measured multiple ecosystem functions in rainforest and nearby agricultural (farm) streams located in an afrotropical deforestation hotspot. In two farm and forest stream pairs, we quantified the standing stock biomass of basal resources and invertebrate functional feeding groups, measured rates of litter decomposition (microbial and shredder-mediated) and modelled invertebrate secondary production. We also calculated whole-stream metabolic parameters over multiple weeks. To test the regional generality of our results, we then reanalysed a published dataset and assessed the functional composition of invertebrate communities from many local streams. We found that farm streams had greater algal standing stocks, gross primary production (GPP) and production-to-respiration ratios than forest streams, although they remained strongly heterotrophic with relatively low GPP values. Agricultural land use also led to the almost complete extirpation of invertebrate shredders, resulting in much slower litter decomposition rates at farm than forest sites despite comparable rates of microbial decomposition. Finally, farm streams had lower invertebrate biomass despite abundant basal resources, leading to a 41%-66% reduction in estimated invertebrate production. We speculate that the functional response of our streams to agricultural land use (i.e., a modest increase in GPP but large declines in invertebrate production and shredder-mediated litter decomposition rates) could be common across the afrotropics due to low fertiliser usage in this region and/or features of the local fauna. Although our study focuses a small number of streams, the large effect sizes that we report suggest that afrotropical streams could be strongly affected by rapid land use changes in the region, highlighting the need for additional research, monitoring, and conservation efforts in this poorly studied area of the world that is under increasing human pressures.

AB  - 1. With the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, the need for studies on European lake fish communities has increased to include lake type-specific fish community features. Although several standardized fish sampling methodologies are available, most previous fish community studies lack a simultaneous consideration of the littoral, benthic and pelagic habitats of lakes.
   2. To compare habitat-specific fish communities, we sampled 67 lakes in the north-eastern German lowlands using Norden multimesh gillnets in the benthic and pelagic habitats, and electrofishing in the littoral zone.
   3. Standardized catches and diversity of the fish community differed among the three habitats sampled. Species richness and Shannon diversity were higher in benthic and littoral habitats compared with pelagic habitats. Overall, the benthic habitat had the most homogeneous catches and contained the most diverse fish community.
   4. Cluster analysis and subsequent indicator value analyses produced substantially different optimum cluster numbers for the three habitat-specific fish communities. Based on the significant differences in fish community composition among the habitats, a simultaneous consideration of numerical fish catches from all habitats was performed using standardized fish abundances.
   5. The cluster analysis of the combined abundances resulted in three groups of lakes that were indicated by three fish species. Morphological descriptors (volume, area, maximum depth, mean depth) and descriptors related to the trophic situation (conductivity, total phosphorus) clearly distinguished the three lake groups.
   6. All three habitats showed distinct characteristics with respect to either species diversity or relative species' abundances. Our results do not support a conceptual model for all lakes of a gradual succession of fish communities as a result of eutrophication.
   7. Synthesis and applications. Only simultaneous consideration of all lake habitats will fulfil the requirements of the Water Framework Directive for evaluating the ecological integrity of lakes. A pre-separation into at least two community types according to lake morphology is necessary before the deviation of the present fish community relative to a reference state can be determined.

AB  - There is a need within marine research areas for more rapid techniques to assess the health of sperm from marine invertebrates. Originating in medical research, flow cytometry has been applied to rapidly measure a range of cellular processes within a plethora of different cell types. To date, the transfer of that knowledge to marine research has been limited. A method has been developed to assess mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii) sperm using the stain 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'3,3'-tetrathylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) and flow cytometry. MMP is a useful indicator of sperm health as the mitochondrion is the single source of ATP production, and the driver of apoptosis. The method was carefully optimised and validated with the use of positive controls. There were strong correlations between MMP measurements and sperm swimming speed and motility (R values of 0.8-0.9, p < 0.001). JC-1 successfully differentiated between sperm with low and high MMP. However, in sperm that were treated with the mitochondrial inhibitor, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), JC-1 fluorescence in stained sperm did not conform to that usually seen for other cell types. Using fluorescence microscopy, it was confirmed that this was due to the formation of J-aggregates in the acrosome vesicle following MMP collapse. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of J-aggregates forming in an organelle other than the mitochondria. This unexpected fluorescence response necessitated the use of a quadrant approach (% high MMP) instead of the usual ratiometric approach (FL2/FL1) to quantify MMP changes. Difficulties overcome during method development are described, many of which were likely related to the required use of seawater as a test medium. The developed method will enable rapid measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential of sea urchin sperm for application in reproductive biology, aquaculture research, and the impact of environmental stressors such as ocean acidification and pollution on sperm development and function.

AB  - The objective of the paper was to evaluate hybrid pig meatiness by using carcass detailed dissection as well as instrumentally (Fat-O-Meater) in the conditions of packing plants. Hybrids (n = 92) SLOVHYB-1 and SLOVHYB-2 were used to comply with the goals of the first part of experiments. The former cross combination has been most frequently used in Slovakia until now; it consists of domestic breeds Large White and White Meaty and of so called synthetic line in the terminal position (Belgian Landrace x Duroc cross). Newly produced cross combination SLOVHYB-2 is based on a domestic and imported gene pool while the main breeds contributing to its creation are White Meaty, Landrace, Duroc and Yorkshire. Hybrid pigs were fattened in identical conditions, receiving feed mixture with the content of digestible substances 15.33%, energy 12.73 MJ ME, lysine 0.92% and fiber max. 5.0%. Their slaughter at average live weight of 105 kg was followed by detailed dissection of dressed carcasses while the per cent of lean meat, fat, skin and bones in the parts of the side of pork were determined. Thirty-five pigs with live weight of 100 kg were selected out of the evaluated set in order to determine the observed indicators in this weight category (Tab. I). The analyzed set was also divided by the sex into gilts - barrows (Tab. III) and by genotype constitution (Tab. IV). In the second part of study (Tab. V) the lean meat in slaughter pigs (n = 14 011) with average dead weight of 97.57 kg was estimated instrumentally in operating conditions of slaughterhouses using the instrument Fat-O-Meater (FOM). The per cent of valuable lean cuts and/or lean meat content (LMC) made 50.35 and 54.38%, respectively, in the analyzed set while 46.7% of animals were included in classification grades S and E. The pigs under evaluation were divided into final hybrids SLOVHYB 1 and 2 on the basis of cross combination (Tab. IV). SLOVHYB-1 has recently represented a major part of carcass pig production in Slovakia. The other cross combination has beed bred for increased per cent of LMC in keeping with the prepared grading of slaughter hybrids pursuant to EU regulations. Differences in the observed indicators of the cross combinations concerned are statistically significant for all analyzed carcass parts, with better values for the newly produced hybrid combination, in which 71.9% of animals against 5.7% were included in grades S and E. In the conditions of packing plants (Tab. V) the group of 14,011 carcass hybrids showed the LMC at the value of 46.51 while about 22% of pigs were included in grades E and U. Increasing dead weight was accompanied by a decrease in the relative LMC in the specific weight categories. In the largest subgroup (95.18 kg, n = 3 933) the LMC determined instrumentally was 46.87% while grades E and U involved 22.2% of animals. The meatiness of slaughter pigs in operating conditions, estimated instrumentally, did not reach such a level as in the EU countries with advanced breeding programs. It was also lower in the cross combination SLOVHYB-1. We believe that besides the worse factors of external environment (low-quality nutrition, level of management and breeding work, lack of long run breeding of produced types for an increased portion of LMC) an unsuitable regression equation of the instrument for our hybrids could be a cause of lower meatiness. One of the producers' tasks will be to decrease variability of this trait substantially since the present slaughter weight ranges from 90 to 150 kg in many cases.
   It is expected to examine both in theoretical and practical terms the problems of an all-in all-out system of filling and unloading the fattening facility with respect to balanced live weights, separate fattening of gilts and barrows to various slaughter weights and possible substantial increase in the LMC in dressed carcasses.

AB  - The role of agriculture and its future development is a highlighted topic of CAP, which focuses on the sustainability. The key question of sustainable development is, how the agriculture can react to the external social, economic and environmental changes. Change of external conditions in an economic system influences the productivity and it has effect to individual and/or social welfare as well. The vulnerability assessment may help the future formulation of agricultural and rural policy meeting more public concern and less transition cost. This paper focuses on vulnerability indicators of farm sector and rural economy of CEECs.

AB  - Toxaphene, a mixture of chlorinated bornanes and camphenes with a high proportion of enantiomers, can be used as indicator for the investigation of environmental conditions which lead to the compositional pattern of toxaphene in environmental samples. Due to its persistence and long range transport, toxaphene is distributed throughout the world. The changes in composition after biotic or abiotic transformation are visible in the gas chromatograms of different environmental samples. These are important clues to translocation and degradation pathways.

This paper presents a practical procedure for the generation of such maps. The method includes multiple indicator kriging, where the estimation of the structural architecture is conditioned on ground penetrating radar data. Physical core samples are used as tie points. This study utilizes data obtained from the unsaturated zone of a highly heterogeneous, glaciofluvial delta formation in Norway.

Differences in the mechanism of protein sorption by sorbents depending on the chemical nature of the surface and the texture of the initial matrix were found. Optimum conditions for protein immobilization on thin-layer sorbents were determined. The reversibility of protein adsorption was studied by the radioactive indicator technique. The extent of reversibility of protein adsorption by thin-layer titanium hydroxide coatings was shown to depend significantly on the texture of the initial matrix.

AB  - We construct a dynamic competitive model with a stock of human-made capital and several stocks of natural resources and ask under what conditions consumption will be constant if infinitesimal households with heterogeneous preferences and endowments discount their utility at an endogenous rate that depends on some macroeconomic variables. We show that for consumption to be constant, this function must be the marginal product of capital function. We demonstrate that Hartwick's rule holds in a modified form that takes account of natural growth of resource stocks.

AB  - "Opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity" - from this basic definition, the authors derive ten characteristics of work that make a job decent. Within this framework, they identify 30 readily usable indicators with which to measure those characteristics and the conduciveness of the socio-economic environment. Other indicators, requiring preliminary statistical groundwork, are also suggested for future development. While stressing that the 30-indicator set is by no means intended to be definitive, the authors conclude with recommendations aimed at getting the systematic measurement of decent work under way.

We found no relationship between incubation temperature or water potential and the level of asymmetry in two cranial traits, although previous research showed profound effects of incubation temperature, on gross morphology and hatching success. Our results suggest that fluctuating asymmetry is not a reliable indicator of developmental stress in this species.

AB  - Early liberal theories about the feasibility of moral progress were premised on empirically ungrounded assumptions about human psychology and society. In this article, we develop a richer naturalistic account of the conditions under which one important form of moral progress-the emergence of more "inclusive" moralities- is likely to arise and be sustained. Drawing upon work in evolutionary psychology and social moral epistemology, we argue that "exclusivist" morality is the result of an adaptively plastic response that is sensitive to cues of out-group threat that are detected during development. We conclude with a blueprint for reinforcing and extending inclusivist progress.

Planktonic rotifer communities of the reservoirs are characterized by high species diversity, presence of rare species as well as high abundance of periphytic and benthic-periphytic forms. Low nutrients concentrations of studied reservoirs confirmed low total rotifers density, presence of indicatory species and high ratio of algaevorous to detritivorous species. The analysis of domination structure of planktonic rotifers showed very low stability of their community and high vulnerability for changes of habitat conditions.

AB  - Oxygen consumption as a measure of metabolic processes in the soil, maintained in a bare fallow state, was considered as an indicator of soil degradation under the influence of acid rain. This paper summarizes the results of experiments, both field and laboratory, with simulated acid precipitations. The reaction of soil aerobic metabolism proved as sensitive to the impact of acid introduction as the change in soil pH which had appeared earlier. The lowering of the metabolic rate is however not directly proportional to progressive soil acidity.

AB  - This study aimed to identify lacustrine or marine sediments based on biogenic opals (also known as spicules). The layers and horizons of a Humic Gley Thiomorphic soil in the Riacho catchment area, Aracruz, state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, were analyzed. Each soil sample was specifically treated to isolate the spicules, which were then identified by an electronic microscope. It was possible to verify the presence of lacustrine as well as marine spicules. Moreover, the shape of the opals provided information on the conditions of the geochemical environment and transport distance of the sediments.

AB  - To understand brain circuits of cognitive behaviors under natural conditions, we developed techniques for imaging neuronal activities from large neuronal populations in the deep layer cortex of the naturally behaving common marmoset. Animals retrieved food pellets or climbed ladders as a miniature fluorescence microscope monitored hundreds of calcium indicator-expressing cortical neurons in the right primary motor cortex. This technique, which can be adapted to other brain regions, can deepen our understanding of brain circuits by facilitating longitudinal population analyses of neuronal representation associated with cognitive naturalistic behaviors and their pathophysiological processes.

AB  - One of the important environmental issues is the quality of surface waters in the world. Poland belongs to countries with a low quality of the inland waters. The sanitary condition of the five water reservoirs of south-east Poland was analyzed. Water and sediment samples were incubated on the selective and/or differential media. High concentrations of many common and pathogenic microbial indicators were shown in those samples. Those reservoirs are used by people, especially during summer. Because of the high epidemiological risk, detailed analysis of all inland waters should be performed routinely.

AB  - To optimise the performance of a recombinant fermentation under realistic conditions, it is important to understand how it is affected by non-idealities. This study proposes a fractal approach. From the time-domain profiles of key concentrations in a feed-batch fermentation, fractal dimensions have been computed. They serve as indicators of the effects of imperfect mixing and disturbances. Fractal dimensions are applicable to both intra- and extra-cellular variables, and include information on the internal metabolism and its interactions with the extra-cellular environment.

AB  - Upland and gullied areas, the potential indicators of desertification. can be identified and mapped reasonably and reliably within +/- 10% accuracy through Landsat TM false colour composite images in conjunction with ground truth.  Due to increased biotic activity, the areal extent of uplands in the Jodhpur district decreased by 20% over a period of 28 years (1958-86).  On the other hand, the areal extent of gullied areas, due to increased fluvial activity increased from 198.5 to 242.0 ha during the same period.  These temporal changes indicate that the desertic environmental conditions are deteriorating in the region.

AB  - Almost three-quarters of known volcanic activity on Earth occurs in underwater locations. The presence of active hydrothermal vent fields in such environments is a potential natural hazard for the environment, society, and economy. Despite its importance for risk assessment and risk mitigation, the monitoring of volcanic activity is impeded by the remoteness and the extreme conditions of many underwater volcanoes. The morphology and the activity of the submarine caldera, Avyssos, at the northern part of Nisyros volcano in the South Aegean Sea (Greece), were studied using a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The recorded time series of temperature and conductivity over the submarine volcano have been analyzed in terms of the Generalized Moments Method. This type of analysis can be used as an indicator for the state of activity of a submarine volcano. Here, we expand the work conducted for the first time in 2018. We present the findings of the geological exploration and the mathematical analysis, obtained from the data collected in October 2010. The temperature and conductivity time series show minor fluctuations in a rather stable environment. Based on these results, the impact of developing appropriate mechanisms and policies to avoid the associated natural hazard is expected to be important.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the characterization of mining residues, both for environmental assessments and critical raw materials recovery. The lack of sufficient in situ samples hampers an effective geostatistical modelling of material concentrations variability. This paper proposes a method to characterize the aluminum spatial variability in a mine residue from remote sensing data and imprecise information from daily dumping procedures. The method is proposed for the mapping of aluminum within a Greek bauxite residue, using Sentinel-2 imagery. The spatial correlation between metal concentrations and remote sensing indicators (e.g., spectral band ratios) is the premise for mapping aluminum varieties. The proposed method is based on Conditional Gaussian Co-Simulation, where Sentinel-2 images can be used as auxiliary variables. Simulation results are compared with the Co-kriging estimation method. To perform the Co-kriging estimation, the same conditions as simulation are used (same inputs, models, and neighborhoods). Simulation results quantified the metals variability in mining residues, presenting the metal concentration of piled materials in two time periods. For results validation and selecting the best map, fourteen validation samples were used. For the best representative maps of aluminum concentration, a correlation coefficient of about 0.7 between the validation data and obtained aluminum concentration map was obtained.

AB  - For the selection of tolerant species in shelter belt development and sensitive species as bio-indicator of air pollution in a polluted environment, air pollution tolerance index (APTI) is a very important tool. APTI is based on four biochemical parameters of the plants; total chlorophyll content, relative water content, pH of leaf extract and ascorbic acid. Anticipated performance index (API) is based on combining APTI values with other socio-economic and biological parameters. In the present study, eighteen plant species were selected from three different sites of Santiniketan, West Bengal, India and APTI and API were calculated. Anchored in these two indices, the most appropriate plant species were identified and recommended for the development of shelter belt. Two-way ANOVA analysis depicted a significant difference in APTI of all plant species and also among different sites. Among all the plants, it is revealed that Mangifera indica L. is the best performer and Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites, Saraca asoka (Roxb.) Willd., Ficus benghalensis L. are excellent performers. The present study will be helpful to recommend the plant species for shelter belt development in urban industrial areas of tropical countries, with related plant composition, climatic condition and levels of air pollution.

AB  - Breeding waterbird communities have suffered globally from the effects of anthropogenic changes in water quality (especially nutrient enrichment) in recent decades, but few studies have demonstrated the positive effects of restorative actions. Annual breeding waterbird surveys in the period 1977-2005 at two restored southern Danish lake basins (combining nutrient load reduction and biomanipulation) showed an up to five-fold increase in abundance, and considerable changes in species richness and diversity, following restoration to clear water status in both lakes. Parallel surveys at a third lake, which retained clear water quality throughout, offering a form of natural 'control', showed no such changes over the same time period. Consistent relationships between breeding waterbird abundance, species richness, and diversity with measures of water clarity (Secchi disc depth, chlorophyll a, and suspended matter) suggest that water clarity mainly drives the relationship; inverse relationships between these measures and total nitrogen and phosphorus were less consistent than for water clarity. The results suggest that an improvement in water clarity plays a key role in restoring breeding waterbird communities and suggest that breeding waterbirds can be indicators of the success of lake restoration projects, but more studies are needed to confirm their wider utility under a variety of conditions.

AB  - The distance between theory and practice in the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) process is particularly noticeable. The development of an integrated, comprehensive and systematic approach guided by the related literature is considered to be an ideal condition for enhancing the value of SEA and increasing its effectiveness. The aim of the present paper was to develop a methodological approach of the most technical and critical stages of SEA for onshore wind farm (OWF) siting. The methodological framework included the proposal of the SEA objectives along with the indicators' development, the identification of alternatives, the selection of a 'most viable or sustainable' alternative, the identification of potential impacts, their assessment, and finally, the proposal of a SEA monitoring system using both qualitative and quantitative methods, tools, and techniques. OWF siting within low and/or moderate sensitivity areas was considered as the most viable/sustainable alternative. SEA highlighted that OWF siting caused moderately to highly significant negative impacts on the thematic section of biodiversity and extremely significant positive impacts on the thematic sections of renewable energy sources, economy, and society. Although the proposed methodology was applied on SEA of OWF siting in Greece, it can be used universally to identify the impacts of OWF siting planning.

AB  - In this research, the feeding guild composition of the polychaete community was described and analysed in the northern Yellow Sea, China. The polychaete feeding guilds also showed a distinct seasonal abundance fluctuation that was similar to that observed for macrofauna. Burrowers were the most predominant feeding guild, whereas filter feeders and herbivores only constituted a negligible proportion of the total abundance. A Spearman rank correlation was performed to analyse the relationships between the feeding guilds and the environmental parameters. Surface deposit feeders and carnivores appeared to be vulnerable to variations of environmental conditions. However, burrowers and filter feeders were not susceptible to the natural or anthropogenic disturbances, with grain size determined to be the only conclusive factor. These results revealed that the feeding guild of polychaetes showed significant spatial and temporal changes, and spatial heterogeneity was a stronger predictor than temporal variation. The feeding guilds of polychaetes can be applied alone to discern the environmental change, which would be faster and more cost-effective with best equilibrium between the precision of the results and a decrease in taxonomic effort. Furthermore, bimonthly sampling was proved to be unessential and reduction of the sampling frequency was necessary to save expense and effort.

AB  - The progressive application of new biodegradable plastics in agriculture calls for improved testing approaches to assure their environmental safety. Full biodegradation (>= 90%) prevents accumulation in soil, which is the first tier of testing. The application of specific ecotoxicity tests is the second tier of testing needed to show safety for the soil ecosystem. Soil microbial nitrification is widely used as a bioindicator for evaluating the impact of chemicals on soil but it is not applied for evaluating the impact of biodegradable plastics. In this work the International Standard test for biodegradation of plastics in soil (ISO 17556, 2012) was applied both to measure biodegradation and to prepare soil samples needed for a subsequent nitrification test based on another International Standard (ISO 14238, 2012).The plastic mulch film tested in this work showed full biodegradability and no inhibition of the nitrification potential of the soil in comparison with the controls. The laboratory approach suggested in this Technology Report enables (i) to follow the course of biodegradation, (ii) a strict control of variables and environmental conditions, (iii) the application of very high concentrations of test material (to maximize the possible effects). This testing approach could be taken into consideration in improved testing schemes aimed at defining the biodegradability of plastics in soil.

AB  - The efficiency of a remediation strategy was evaluated in a mine soil highly contaminated with trace elements (TEs) by microbiological, ecotoxicological and physicochemical parameters of the soil and soil solution (extracted in situ), as a novel and integrative methodology for assessing recovery of soil health. A 2.5-year field phytostabilisation experiment was carried out using olive mill-waste compost, pig slurry and hydrated lime as amendments, and a native halophytic shrub (Atriplex halimus L). Comparing with non-treated soil, the addition of the amendments increased soil pH and reduced TEs availability, favoured the development of a sustainable vegetation cover (especially the organic materials), stimulated soil microorganisms (increasing microbial biomass, activity and functional diversity, and reducing stress) and reduced direct and indirect soil toxicity (i.e., its potential associated risks). Therefore, under semi-arid conditions, the use of compost and pig slurry with A. halimus is an effective phytostabilisation strategy to improve soil health of nutrient-poor soils with high TEs concentrations, by improving the habitat function of the soil ecosystem, the reactivation of the biogeochemical cycles of essential nutrients, and the reduction of TEs dissemination and their environmental impact.

AB  - Natura 2000 is a coherent ecological network of special areas, designated under the Habitat and Birds EEC Directives, to assist in the maintenance of biodiversity in the European territory. It is now widely recognised that one of the most effective ways to maintain biodiversity is to preserve habitats in a favourable conservation status as required of Member States by the Habitat Directive. As a consequence, approaches are needed to define when habitats are of favourable conservation status and to assess the maintenance or the restoration of this condition. This could be partly achieved through the selection of appropriate indicators of favourable conservation status. Once such indicators have been identified and tested, they could be used for monitoring the impact of managing Natura 2000 sites, and could assist in achieving policy goals. Although many indicators have been proposed, particularly for forested habitats, few have been adequately field tested. Little research has been undertaken to identify indicators that are cost-effective, a key characteristic given that resources for habitat assessment and monitoring are often limited. Therefore, this research aims both to identify appropriate indicators to maintain favourable conservation status, and to evaluate their relative cost-effectiveness for two selected Natura 2000 sites: the Cansiglio Forest (North Italy) and the New Forest (South England). The following will highlight the results of the preliminary research.

AB  - Body burden is often used as an indicator of the toxic impact of metals such as silver. Natural organic matter (NOM) is reported to reduce silver toxicity to the highly sensitive freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. However, the effect of NOM on silver burden in these organisms has not been investigated, and literature reports from other aquatic animals suggest that NOM can actually promote silver accumulation. In 24h accumulation trials NOM exhibited a general trend of reducing whole body silver accumulation. Differences in accumulation profiles between NOM samples were attributed to chloride content stimulating uptake by the formation of diffusible silver chloride complexes. Silver accumulation assayed over 1 h exhibited considerable heterogeneity. Subsequent experiments conducted with varying light conditions during exposure and utilising gut dissection, suggested that these differences were in part due to variable gut silver accumulation. In addition to a general reduction in silver accumulation, NOM also facilitated enhanced elimination of silver from the animals. Rapid elimination of silver from Daphnia, coupled with speciation-, body compartment- and time of day-dependent accumulation suggests that silver body burden may be a poor indicator of silver toxicity in natural environments.

AB  - As a major epigenetic modification, DNA methylation plays an important role in coordinating plant responses to environmental changes. Methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technology was used in this study to investigate the epigenetic diversity of fifty japonica rice samples from five regions in Heilongjiang Province, China. In addition, the phenotypic indicators of japonica rice samples and the environmental conditions of the sampling sites were investigated and analysed. Based on the MSAP analysis technique, using eight pairs of selective primers, we identified a total of 551 amplified loci, of which 267 (48.5%) were classified as methylation loci. The methylation status and levels of the japonica rice genome in different regions differed significantly (p < 0.05). The results of the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that most of the molecular variation (91%) came from within the groups (regions) and was caused by individual variation within the region. Furthermore, the results of principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), cluster analysis, and population structure analysis indicated that there was no obvious correlation between the epigenetic differences and geographical locations, which may have been due to the limited range of sampling sites. When environmental factors, phenotypic indicators, and epigenetic data analysis are combined, it is easy to conclude that japonica rice grown in the same latitudinal region has increased epigenetic and phenotypic similarities due to similar climatic conditions and production practices.

AB  - Behavioural and blood-based physiological responses of Nguni (NG) and Boran (BR) steers, following relocation to a new environment and herd regrouping were examined. Ten steers of each genotype aged 9 months and reared under similar conditions were studied over 16 weeks: 1 for acclimatization and baseline measurements in original groups, 15 for post regrouping measurements. Each sampling week, direct visual observations and durations of aggressive and affiliative interactions were recorded between 0500-1900h for 3 conservative days. Blood samples were drawn fortnightly by jugular venipuncture for plasma cortisol, glucose, creatine kinase (CK) and haematological analysis. In weeks 1-5, BR had higher instances of head-butting (P=0.0311), mounts (P=0.0142) and threats (P=0.0241) compared to NG (P<0.0001, P=0.0412 and P=0.0241, respectively). However, these significantly declined from weeks 7-15 in both genotypes. Grooming increased consistently over the weeks in both genotypes (P=0.0214). Head-butting correlated with cortisol (r=-0.116), CK (r=-0.295) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (r=-0.144). Grooming correlated (r=0.137) with white-blood-cell-count. Herd regrouping temporarily disrupted social behaviour, with BR showing more aggression towards NG steers. Nevertheless, the two genotypes established some stability within five weeks of social mixing.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L) i s a valuable cash crop which plays an imperative role in the worldwide economy. However, high temperature has significantly retarded the crop growth and yield by alteration of biochemical pathways. Therefore, the biochemical activities of two sugarcane varieties were explored under heat stress condition. The sugarcane cultivars S2003-US-633 (high sucrose accumulation) and SPF-238 (low sucrose accumulation) were cultivated and subjected to different temperature regimes i.e. control at 30 +/- 2 degrees C, heat stress at 45 +/- 2 degrees C and recovery at 30 +/- 2 degrees C for 24, 48 and 72 hours at formative stage. Detailed profiling of physiochemical attributes, sugar analysis linked with sucrose metabolism enzymes and thermotolerance indicators were investigated. S2003-US-633 exhibited better response in terms of sugar accumulation regulated by sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase and invertase activities along with more proline accumulation, total soluble protein contents with response to high temperature exposure. While 52003-US-633 is ranked as tolerant variety due to less MDA, H2O2 content and electrolytes leakage exhibiting its efficient tolerance mechanism, giving high sugar recovery rate despite harsh environmental conditions. Thus, these findings can be helpful in providing information for engineering sugar improvement along with thermotolerance in sugarcane varieties and providing new avenues towards the economic development of the country.

AB  - After the implementation of the SECA regulation in BSR in 2015, one other step towards cleaner shipping will be the NECA regulation from 2021. Thus, green shipping is an important highlight on the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) environmental agenda. It is well known that shipping is one of the most international industries but it also represents one of the most dangerous businesses since maritime sector workers are often exposed to a number of occupational hazards such as difficult and uncontrolled climate conditions, emissions, noise, vibration, chemicals, and long hours of work in combination with rigid organisational structures, isolation and high levels of psychological stress. Maritime workers are often confronted with health problems, occupational diseases, incidents and occupational accidents. This sends a strong pointer that green shipping should also imply greener maritime jobs so that the work becomes safer for workers and corresponds to the global challenges of environmental protection, economic development and social inclusion. The presented research analyses the health and safety aspects of green shipping in the context of occupational health and safety (OSH) to identify set of indicators that are essential to be applied in green shipping. The central research question evaluates health and OSH risks of BSR inhabitants and seafarers to determine the extent to which the SECA regulations have helped to improve health and work related conditions in the BSR.

AB  - Production capacity evaluation and environmental sustainability assessment allow defining both the most appropriate fertilization strategies and the agricultural systems management. The aims of this study were to investigate the following, in a cauliflower-lettuce rotation: (i) agricultural system agronomic performance, (ii) fertilization treatments environmental sustainability through the energy inputs/outputs analysis, and (iii) carbon footprint through the GHG emissions and carbon sequestration analyses. Three fertilization strategies were compared: (i) CM, compost from municipal solid waste; ii) MIN, mineral fertilizers; iii) MIX, the CM compost plus a mineral fertilizer. Cauliflower and lettuce responses to fertilization were influenced by climatic conditions from year to year, and among the fertilizer treatments, the CM demonstrated a better resilience to the extreme weather events. It also showed the highest renewable energy (44.3%), suggesting that the substitution of mineral fertilizers with organic ones may help to reduce the non-renewable energy depletion, thus promoting the sustainability in horticultural systems. The CM was the most efficient treatment, since the energy stocked as C in the soil (145,889MJha(-1)) and the net energy and the energy efficiency for cauliflower and lettuce (113,106MJha(-1) and 3.1, respectively) were the highest. Our results suggest that the application of the tested sustainable practices makes the farm a sink for the atmospheric CO2.

AB  - The presence of feacal-derived pathogens in water is responsible for several infectious diseases and deaths worldwide. As a solution, sources of fecal pollution in waters must be accurately assessed, properly determined and strictly controlled. However, the exercise has remained challenging due to the existing overlapping characteristics by different members of faecal coliform bacteria and the inadequacy of information pertaining to the contribution of seasonality and weather condition on tracking the possible sources of pollution. There are continued efforts to improve the Faecal Contamination Source Tracking (FCST) techniques such as Microbial Source Tracking (MST). This study aimed to make contribution to MST by evaluating the efficacy of combining site specific quantification of faecal contamination indicator bacteria and detection of DNA markers while accounting for seasonality and weather conditions' effects in tracking the major sources of faecal contamination in a freshwater system (Donghu Lake, China). The results showed that the use of cyd gene in addition to lacZ and uidA genes differentiates E. coli from other closely related faecal bacteria. The use of selective media increases the pollution source tracking accuracy. BSA addition boosts PCR detection and increases FCST efficiency. Seasonality and weather variability also influence the detection limit for DNA markers.

AB  - The trend of global energy demand forecasts a continuous increase in the forthcoming years together with a diversification and differentiation of energy sources. In order to ensure the energy systems transition towards a sustainable functioning mode while avoiding early depletion of energy resources, industrial activities need to foster process improvement. Among energy efficient process design methodologies, pinch analysis and exergy analysis are two powerful methods but each one shows drawbacks. This paper introduces a new methodology that uses the Jacobian Matrix of exergy destruction as a mathematical indicator to couple the Pinch and the exergy analysis and overcome their individual limitations. In the proposed approach, exergy analysis is used not only to assess the exergy losses but also to guide the changes needed in industrial processes structures and operating conditions. And while the pinch analysis considers only heat integration, the proposed methodology allows including other recoverable exergy in a process through thermodynamic conversion. In this paper, the guidelines of the methodology are first detailed. When applied on a basic natural gas liquefaction process, the proposed approach will numerically result in a new improved process comparable to the existing, most widely used natural gas liquefaction process. The main advantage of the methodology is time saving compared to holistic operating conditions improvement as in the traditional process design methods and automatic process structure modification leading to better heat integration.

AB  - This article considers the issues related to research on the LED lighting efficiency in the industrial premises, the need to use the methodology to obtain meaningful scientific results. The LED lighting efficiency should be determined, primarily, based on the creation of conditions that are optimal for visual activity and safe from a hygienic standpoint. We showed the main problem in substantiating the areas of LED lighting application, which is related to the specific character of spectral emission structure of the white LEDs and the photo biological effects of its individual sections. We specified the need for an integrated approach for the efficiency assessment. Luminescent lighting is suggested as a basis for comparison, as the most studied from the position of influence on various indicators that determine hygienic effectiveness, as well as the visual working capacity of a person. We highlighted the need for carrying out studies of a reasonable choice of illumination indices - the ranges of illumination and color temperatures. We considered the approaches to the choice of research methodology. We proposed to evaluate the main functional indicators of the state of the organ of vision and the human body as a whole, the dynamics of visual performance and visual fatigue in the conditions of LED lighting. We showed the practical significance of the experimental material for lighting implementation with LED light sources in the industrial premises.

AB  - The seasonal variability of inorganic and organic nutrients and stable isotopes and their relations with plankton and environmental conditions were monitored in Lake Chasico. Principal component analysis evidenced the strong influence of the river runoff on several biogeochemical variables. Silicate concentrations were controlled by diatom biomass and river discharge. Higher values of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) indicated agricultural uses in the river basin. Elevated pH values (similar to 9) inhibiting nitrification in the lake explained partially the dominance of ammonium: similar to 83 % of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The low DIN/SRP ratio inferred nitrogen limitation, although the hypotheses of iron and CO2 limitation are relevant in alkaline lakes. Particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were mainly of autochthonous origin. The main allochthonous input was imported by the river as POM owning to the arid conditions. Dissolved organic carbon was likely top-down regulated by the bacterioplankton grazer Brachionus plicatilis. The delta C-13 signature was a good indicator of primary production and its values were influenced probably by CO2 limitation. The delta N-15 did not evidence nitrogen fixation and suggested the effects of anthropogenic activities. The preservation of a good water quality in the lake is crucial for resource management.

AB  - Hydroxyls in clinopyroxene and supersilicic titantite in diamond-free garnet-clinopyroxene rock from the Kumdy-Kol area of the Kokchetav Massif were characterized using micro-FT-IR spectroscopy. The presence of supersilicic titanite is evidence of ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic conditions of at least 6GPa. Significant amounts of hydroxyls were detected suggesting that supersilicic titanite crystallized in an H2O-rich environment at a depth of >200km. Clinopyroxenes coexisting with supersilicic titanite contain exsolved K-feldspar and phengite lamellae and were classified into three types on the basis of exsolved lamellae texture. Hydroxyl was identified in types A and B, but was not present in type C. The variety of reintegrated hydroxyl contents in clinopyroxenes reflected the differences of H2O activities when they crystallized: type C formed at extremely low H2O activities; type B crystallized at high H2O activities; and type A formed under a range of conditions from high (pyroxene cores) to low (pyroxene mantles) H2O activities. Clinopyroxenes recorded local heterogeneity of H2O activity on the scale of individual grains during UHP metamorphism and represent the best indicator of H2O activity. The fluid environment is an important factor attending petrogenesis during UHP metamorphism. Variations in abundance of hydroxyl in UHP clinopyroxene can be used to clarify fluid environments at great depths.

AB  - A sediment core from Lake Arapisto, Finland, was examined for fossil diatom assemblages to reconstruct changes in Holocene nutrient availability. Our aim was to investigate the long-term relationship between lake trophic status and climate by comparing the diatom-based phosphorus reconstruction with paleoclimatic proxies. Our results showed that the cold early Holocene was characterized by elevated nutrient conditions concurrent with newly exposed fertile ground. As the climate rapidly warmed and ice sheet further retreated, the catchment vegetation developed, which resulted in decreased nutrient flux into the lake. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), between -8000 and 4000 cal yr BP, was characterized by oligotrophic conditions, which may have been caused by low effective precipitation and stable watershed vegetation. After the HTM, the lake became more productive. There was no particular increase in the trophic state that could be connected to more recent human influence. Although lake productivity has been shown to be affected by temperature, our record indicated that the nutrient dynamics were driven by complex interactions between changes in temperature, precipitation, catchment, and in-lake processes. Understanding of long-term nutrient dynamics and the associated processes can help in resolving relationships between lake productivity and climate during past and present climate changes.

AB  - The leaching of a substance is influenced by its physico-chemical characteristics as well as environmental conditions. In spatially distributed modelling the influence of soil properties on the half-life and the sorption constant of the substance might become important and can be taken into account. The GeoPEARL model includes options to account for sorption and transformation being dependent on soil characteristics.
   Using some of these options in calculations for a herbicide with both sorption and transformation dependent on the pH of the soil, the calculated leaching from an application in spring appeared to be higher than anticipated from calculations according to the so-called paired parameter approach, in which the leaching is assessed for pairs of sorption and transformation parameters at regular pH intervals. The reason for the higher leaching was that the most critical leaching conditions were not covered by the selected pH values. A 'paired approach' might however be useful as a first tier assessment of the leaching potential. The maximum leaching is expected with the highest DegT(50)/K-om ratio, which might be obtained from plotting this ratio against the characteristic soil property.
   The leaching potential of the parent was more important for the leaching of the metabolite than the leaching potential of the metabolite itself. This should be accounted for in the evaluation procedure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Laboratory experimentation forms the basis for most of our knowledge of the biology of many organisms, in particular insects. However, the accuracy with which laboratory-derived estimates of insect life history and behaviour can predict their fitness and population dynamics in the wild is rarely validated. Such comparison is especially important in cases where laboratory-derived information is used to formulate and implement strategies for the genetic control of insects in nature. We have conducted a comparative study of the reproductive potential and life history of male Anopheles gambiae Gilies sensu lato mosquitoes from both standardized laboratory conditions and from natural field settings. We measured three indirect indicators of male mosquito fitness: energetic reserves, body size and survival, in a bid to determine whether the demographics and energetic limitations of wild males can be correctly predicted from their laboratory counterparts. Crucially, the body size and lipid reserves of wild males were substantially greater than those reared under standard laboratory conditions. We caution that the energetic limitations of insects as identified in the laboratory may underestimate their resilience in the wild, and discuss the implications of this phenomenon with respect to vector-borne disease control programmes based on genetic control of mosquitoes.

AB  - Multivariate numerical analyses (DCA, CCA) were used to study the distribution of chironomids from surface sediments of 100 lakes spanning broad eco-climatic conditions in northern Swedish Lapland. The study sites range from boreal forest to alpine tundra and are located in a region of relatively low human impact. Of the 19 environmental variables measured, ordination by CCA identified mean July air temperature as one of the most significant variables explaining the distribution and the abundance of chironomids. Loss-on-ignition (LOI), maximum lake depth and mean January air temperature also accounted for significant variation in chironomid assemblages. A quantitative transfer function was created to estimate mean July air temperature from sedimentary chironomid assemblages using weighted-averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS). The coefficient of determination was relatively high (r(2) = 0.65) with root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP, based on jack-knifing) of 1.13 degreesC and maximum bias of 2.1 degreesC, indicating that chironomids can provide useful quantitative estimates of past changes in mean July air temperature. The paper focuses mainly on the relationship between chironomid composition and July air temperature, but the relationship to LOI and depth are also discussed.

AB  - Wheel sinkage is an important indicator of mobile robot mobility in natural outdoor terrains. This paper presents a vision-based method to measure the sinkage of a rigid robot wheel in rigid or deformable terrain. The method is based on detecting the difference in intensity between the wheel rim and the terrain. The method uses a single grayscale camera and is computationally efficient, making it suitable for systems with limited computational resources such as planetary rovers. Experimental results under various terrain and lighting conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.

AB  - The process of prescribing changes as children move into adulthood. For some medicines, such as psychotropic drugs, safety and efficacy are less well understood in adolescents.
   As adolescents mature they attain the capacity to consent to their own medical treatment. An assessment of their competency will need to take into account the nature of the treatment being proposed.
   Parental involvement is usually beneficial particularly for adolescents with chronic or complex conditions, but increasing adolescent autonomy needs to be respected.
   Adherence to treatment can be supported by understanding adolescent development and involving adolescents in management plans.

AB  - Population growth has determined two different types of urban development: the vertical growth, tending to compactness, and the horizontal one which privileges a more dispersed and sprawled expansion. Those two urban forms have different impacts on environmental sustainability influencing, among others, the microclimate conditions of a city, the energy demand and its economic cost, and the provision of Ecosystem Services. European policies are oriented towards sustainable development of urban areas reducing the environmental footprint and restoring degraded ecosystem through a Green infrastructure deployment. Understanding the urban form, and specifically, the typology of the building form is crucial for policymakers and urban planners to define strategies for a higher degree of sustainability. The lack of data and the heterogeneity of information across Europe on the built form have hindered the operationalisation of European strategies and their downscaling into national or regional policies. The paper aims to fill this gap proposing a methodology based on a cluster analysis that estimates the built form of Belgium at LAU2 level for addressing single specific actions towards environmental sustainability goals. The cluster analysis uses data traditionally surveyed by national censuses, ensuring the replicability of the method for the upcoming 2021 census, and also the opportunity to update it continuously.

AB  - The atmospheric release and fallouts of radionuclides have produced the radioactive contamination over wide area in the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP). They still affect the environment around the Fukushima Prefecture, such as resident area, fields, mountainous area, river and stream, and reservoir. In JAEA (Japan Atomic Energy Agency), diverse monitoring platforms have been developing and successfully applying to the assessment of environmental radiation and deposited nuclides. Especially, there are about 3,700 irrigation reservoirs around the Fukushima Prefecture, which can be effected from direct fallouts in reservoirs as well as dispersions of the contamination in the other sites, depending on weather conditions. Underwater survey system is an important tool to assess the radioactive contamination in the river, stream and reservoir, including the bottom sediments. In this study, underwater gamma-ray spectrometry, named as MARK-U1, was developed to rapidly estimate the underwater radioactivity for the emergency preparedness, according to the lesson learned from the nuclear accident of FDNPP. A 3"phi x3" NaI(Tl) detector is equipped in this underwater system and the lateral shielding around a detector was also designed using lead with a thickness of 1 cm to confine the field of view. Finally, its performance test was conducted by evaluating the natural radioactivity of Bi-214, Tl-208, and K-40 in the riverbed of reservoir.

AB  - Tourism is one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy in Slovakia. With the orientation of localities to tourism, the landscape transformation is reflected in several positive and negative changes in the landscape. The aim of the contribution is to highlight the transformation processes leading to the creation of a tourist landscape in six selected localities in Slovakia. When selecting sites, we applied criteria such as the diversity of the original use, size or attractiveness. The environmental, socio-cultural and economic impacts of tourism on the landscape of localities were valuable in terms of sustainable development principles. From the methodological point of view, the primary methodology was the drivers-pressures-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model, used for integrated environmental assessment and the life cycle methodology of a tourism center with integrated sustainable development indicators. In the work results, based on the analysis of the historical development and the current state of localities, we evaluate their phase of the life cycle and the effects of tourism on the environment. We also present the possibilities of further development and heading direction of localities from point of view of tourism while pointing out the benefits and risks connected with the planned development.

AB  - Ore processing is a source of soil heavy metal pollution. Vegetation traits (structural characteristics such as spatial cover and repartition; biochemical parameters-pigment and water contents, growth rate, phenological cycle horizontal ellipsis ) and plant species identity are indirect and powerful indicators of residual contamination detection in soil. Multi-temporal multispectral satellite imagery, such as the Sentinel-2 time series, is an operational environment monitoring system widely used to access vegetation traits and ensure vegetation surveillance across large areas. For this purpose, methodology based on a multi-temporal fusion method at the feature level is applied to vegetation monitoring for several years from the closure and revegetation of an ore processing site. Features are defined by 26 spectral indices from the literature and seasonal and annual change detection maps are inferred. Three indices-CIred-edge(CIREDEDGE), IRECI (Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index) and PSRI (Plant Senescence Reflectance Index)-are particularly suitable for detecting changes spatially and temporally across the study area. The analysis is conducted separately for phyto-stabilized vegetation zones and natural vegetation zones. Global and specific changes are emphasized and explained by information provided by the site operator or meteorological conditions.

AB  - The present study analyzed the Peruvian scallop Argopecten purpuratus and its food sources for metal and fatty acid concentrations in order to determine spatial and temporal differences. Metals such as copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) in gills and iron (Fe) and Zn in sediments were the most significant explaining factors for spatial differentiations (degree of contamination), while for fatty acids, it was C14:0, C15:0, C16:0 and C18:0 in A. purpuratus' muscle and in its food sources, which explained more temporal differences (El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect). Gills, digestive gland and intestine were the tissues where metal accumulation was the highest in A. purpuratus. Cd in digestive gland was always high, up to similar to 250-fold higher than in other tissues, as previously reported in other bioindicator species for metal pollution. Fatty acids were good biomarkers when annual comparisons were performed, while metals when locations were compared. ENSO 2017 played an important role to disentangle A. purpuratus' biological conditions and food sources. A. purpuratus from Paracas locations mostly showed higher metal concentrations in gills and digestive glands, and lower fatty acid concentrations in muscle than those from Sechura and Illescas Reserved Zone.

AB  - According to the main chemical indicators, the soils of the city differ significantly from their natural analogue. A significant part of the territory of cities is affected by negative processes that affect the ecological functions of soils. Due to the intensification of the anthropogenic impact, surface air pollution increases, soil profiles are disturbed, acidity and alkalinity change, and the biodiversity of soil microflora is reduced. This paper presents the results of a study of alluvial urban soils of parks and the industrial zone located in Saint Petersburg in Russia. A morphological description and the basic physical parameters of soils are determined. The content of priority toxicants (heavy metals, benzo[a]pyrene, petroleum products) was conducted, as well as an epidemiological study of soils for the presence of pathogenic organisms. The data obtained show that heavy metals accumulate in alluvial soils, about 35% of the studied soils exceeded permissible concentrations. The content of PAHs in soils also exceeded up to 34 of the maximum permissible concentration. We observe differences in the sanitary and hygienic conditions of alluvial territories specially designated for recreational area. According to the results of microbiological studies, pathogenic organisms are present in soils, but their content varies within acceptable limits of Russian Federation.

AB  - Seasonal changes in rainfall might have an impact on the decomposition of mangrove leaf litter. This study analyzed the influence of weather conditions (season) on the decay rate, nitrogen, and phosphorus content as a decomposition indicator of leaf litter of Rhizophora racemosa. These measurements were taken at two sites in the Terraba-Sierpe National Wetland (TSNW) South Pacific, Coasta Rica, in 2013. The dry and wet season decay constants were similar and fast (k = 0.012 day(-1)). Decay constants were positively associated with salinity and water temperature (p < 0.10). Moreover, season had an effect on the leaf litter nitrogen (high in dry season) and phosphorus content (high in rainy season). The effect of decomposition time on nitrogen and phosphorus content varies between sites. Leaf litter from R. racemosa acts as a substrate that releases nutrients to the ecosystem, contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets. The similar and fast decay constants among seasons is possibly because of the small difference in seasonal rainfall in TSNW, while seasonal variation in nitrogen and phosphorus is possibly a result of changes in microbial activity. This study highlights the need for an integral approach to research on nutrient cycling in mangrove forests because of its complex decay patterns.

AB  - The article proposes to consider the ecological framework of cities as a set of undeveloped and unsealed green areas providing ecosystem services, so-called green infrastructure. General features of the ecological framework of the 15 largest cities of Russia are analyzed on the base of statistical and remote sensing data, the main problems of its territorial planning are identified, and possible mechanisms for their solution are proposed. The basic indicators of the structure evaluation of the framework are proposed and calculated, the protection status of its elements is estimated, on the basis of which the cities with unfavorable conditions for its preservation are identified. It is defined that in the largest cities the share of a tree cover from the city square fluctuates from 16 (Volgograd) to 61% (Perm), and in three cities from 15 (Omsk, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk) less than 1 % of the area of a tree cover is protected. The mapping models of the framework for each of the cities are presented and three typical configurations are identified. The obtained results are compared with various domestic and international regulatory indicators of greening, which leads to the conclusion about the individual features of the structure of the ecological framework of each city.

AB  - To address the ecological health of Barnegat Bay in New Jersey, a comprehensive water monitoring program has been conducted within the Barnegat Bay watershed by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and multiple partners since June 2011. Barnegat Bay and its tributaries were evaluated for multiple water quality metrics and from various perspectives. The nutrient concentrations and loadings from the tributaries in the northern watershed are higher than those from the tributaries in the southern portion of the watershed. Within Barnegat Bay, higher nitrogen concentrations were observed in the northern portion, while higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations occurred in the southern portion. Daily variability of water quality at certain locations was observed from the results of intensive sampling events (six samples per day over 4 consecutive days of sampling). Analysis of multiple years of data suggests that water quality has not varied significantly year to year from 2011 to 2015. Violation of the existing applicable numeric criterion was identified for dissolved oxygen, TP, and turbidity within some assessment units in Barnegat Bay and its watershed. A comparison made between these data and the targets used by other estuaries in the NE United States related to nutrient criteria found that portions of the bay would not achieve the water quality thresholds used by these other estuaries.

AB  - Phytoliths represent one of the few available altitudinal vegetation proxies for mountain ecosystems. This study analyzed 41 topsoil phytolith samples collected from five altitudinal zones in the southern Himalaya as far as, and beyond, the timberline, from tropical forest (up to 1,000 m a.s.l.) to subtropical forest (1,000-2,000 m a.s.l.), to temperate forest (2,000-3,000 m a.s.l.), to subalpine forest (3,000-4,100 m a.s.l.) and finally to alpine scrub (4,100-5,200 m a.s.l.). The statistical results show a good correlation between phytolith assemblages and these five altitudinal vegetation zones: the five phytolith assemblages identified effectively differentiated these five altitudinal vegetation zones. In particular, coniferous phytoliths accurately indicated the timberline. Additionally, we tested the phytolith index Ic (a proxy for estimating the percentage of Pooideae vis-alpha-vis the total grass content) as a quantifier of phytolith variety versus altitude. Ic increased along altitude, as expected. An investigation of phytoliths provided an initial basis for the analysis of the composition of gramineous vegetation. Furthermore, redundancy analysis and discriminant analysis also suggested a significant correlation between phytolith assemblages and altitude. Our research therefore provides an up-to-date analogue for the reconstruction of changes to palaeovegetation and palaeoaltitude in mountainous areas.

AB  - Much remains to be learned about biological diversity, which constitutes a valuable natural resource. Due to the pressure that human activity has put on natural resources, biodiversity has been reduced, often unbeknownst to those responsible for that activity. Therefore, we aimed to perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of periphytic algae in the Itupararanga reservoir, correlating the results with the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, as well as with climatic conditions. To that end, five samples were collected at four sampling stations in the Itupararanga reservoir during the year 2010. Aquatic macrophytes were collected with a 156-cm(2) frame, and the periphytic algae were scraped free of the macrophytes with a brush. Samples were fixed in formaldehyde and Lugol's solution for the qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. We identified 156 taxa belonging to eight classes, and the overall density was 10,200-171,800 individuals/mm(2). The taxonomic composition and abundance of periphyton were found to be dependent on spatial and temporal factors, such as the type of substrate and the characteristics of the sampling site, as well as seasonal variations in the chemical and physical properties of the water.

AB  - Many pesticides in use are chiral compounds containing stereoisomers. However, the environmental behavior and fate of such compounds with respect to enantioselectivity so far has received little attention. In this study, the degradation of lactofen and its main metabolites (acifluorfen, an achiral compound; desethyl lactofen, a chiral compound) in sediment were investigated under laboratory conditions using enantioselective HPLC, and the enantioselectivities of individual enantiomers of lactofen and desethyl lactofen in acute toxicity to Daphnia magna were studied. The calculated LC50 values of S(+)-, rac-, and R-(-)-lactofen were 17.689, 4.308, and 0.378 mu g/mL, respectively, and the calculated LC50 values of S-(+)-, rac-, and R-(-)-desethyl lactofen were 21.327, 13.684, and 2.568 mu g/mL, respectively. Therefore, the acute toxicities of lactofen and desethyl lactofen enantiomers were enantioselective. In sediments, S-(+)-lactofen or S-(+)-desethyl lactofen was preferentially degraded, resulting in relative enrichment of the R-(-)-form. Lactofen and desethyl lactofen were both configurationally stable in sediment, showing no interconversion of S- to R-enantiomers or vice versa. Furthermore, the conversion of lactofen to desethyl lactofen proceeded with retention of configuration. These results for major differences in acute toxicity and degradation of the enantiomers may have some implications for better environmental and ecological risk assessment for chiral pesticides.

AB  - In North African countries, irrigation considerably increases production. Given the run-down condition of irrigation equipment, the rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation schemes is a topical question. In addition, some irrigation projects are currently being implemented thus requiring investments, and judicious decisions have to be taken. At the same time farms in North Africa are increasingly confronted with environmental constraints and held accountable for environmental practices. This article proposes an approach to simultaneously take into account the technical, agricultural, economic and environmental objectives at the farm level, considered to be a relevant decision unit. Such indicators enable pertinent comparisons of different water management strategies in private, public and mixed systems. A method is proposed for the calculation of performance indicators from the plot to the farm level. The indicators enable the performance of irrigated systems to be compared in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. A graphic representation of the indicators enables the synthetic analysis of the results for a given farm thereby making it possible to highlight the weakness of the production system. The method is applied to two farms in the Gharb area in Morocco and two farms in the Mitidja plain in Algeria. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability is a laudable goal, but difficult to define and to implement because of the complexity of interlinked human and natural systems, and the uncertainty inherent in such complex systems. Resilience shows promise as a relevant and measurable attribute of sustainability, which itself defies measurement. Identification and assessment of conditions that are desirable, as well as those that are undesirable, are necessary in order to determine both the degree of progress toward sustainability and the removal of impediments to Such progress. Communications incident to the identification and selection of indicators of resilience and sustainability are of potentially greater value than the indicators themselves and so should be given explicit consideration in the design of the indicators development process. Moving towards sustainability requires an iterative, continuing (open-ended), collaborative process. Academic institutions can assist in this process through activities that connect across political, social and discipline boundaries. Boundary organizations are those that have achieved a level of trust among the relevant constituents to management of sustainability and can help convert academic findings that are objectively neutral into options and alternatives that may be politically and economically feasible. The Sustainable Pennsylvania Program is developing demonstration projects with both state and local governmental agencies with the objective of building both capacity and will for moving towards sustainability.

AB  - Approximately 21 million tons of steel industry slag are produced each year in the United States, and many productive commercial uses of slag have been developed (e.g., road bed, fill material). However, because slag contains heavy metals at concentrations that are higher than in most soil, questions have been raised regarding the need to evaluate the potential human health and environmental hazards associated with current applications. To enhance general understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics of this material, slag samples from 58 active mills with blast furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and/or electric are furnaces were examined. This study profiles the major and minor constituents of slag from each furnace type and reports the leachability of metals from slag under neutral and acidic conditions. Particle size distributions and partitioning coefficients (K-d) are also reported. Although concentrations of metals in slag are elevated relative to concentrations in soil, the metals in slag are tightly bound to the slag matrix and not readily leached. This study represents the most complete characterization of steel industry slag currently produced in North America, encompassing mills that collectively produce over 47% of steel industry slag. These data provide insights that may be useful for evaluating the marketability of steel industry slag and for human and ecological health risk assessment of environmental applications.

AB  - Precommissioning studies of proposed outfalls along the north coast of Spain included in situ and laboratory determinations of T-90 values directed at the development of a local-specific inactivation model.
   The effect of salinity, light intensity, temperature and depredation on inactivation (T-90) of Escherichia coli, was studied in unifactorial experiments carried out in the laboratory. The values of T-90 obtained fitted the exponential model of die-off for the first three variables (salinity, light temperature: R > 0.93). Light intensity showed the greatest bactericidal effect, with T-90 values near or lower than 1 hour, when light radiation was greater than 120 Wm(-2). The logarithm of T-90 showed a linear relationship with each one of these three factors. Nevertheless, the global relationship which best fits the values obtained was not linear in its coefficients.
   The values of T-90 estimated from experiments in situ, carried out in summer (33.6 min) and winter (116.8 min), reflected the seasonal differences in the environmental conditions in this zone, mainly from light intensity. Differences between these values and those obtained applying the model pointed out the need to study in depth the effect of light on the bacterial die-off in natural systems.

AB  - The effects and consequences of climate change have been extensively considered in the urban design qualities. The climatic factors directly affect human activities in urban spaces, particularly in the pedestrian environment. The global issues on climate change could be well understood by understanding the contributions of climatic conditions towards thermal environmental discomforts. So, the roles and processes in urban design can be enhanced to reduce the impacts of extreme urban climate on pedestrian experiences. This current article focused on the systematic review of thermal comfort through urban designing, detailing the objectives, methods used, and the body of knowledge to deal with this issue. This paper also summarizes the current understanding and challenges in addressing the microclimatic analysis roles in human life by discussing the thermal comfort studies and literature regarding human, building, and city levels. Finally, this systemic study demonstrated the needs and potential assessments based on the quality and standardization of human-centric data collection and interpretation. It specifically addressed an urban planner's structure that could be used as an empirical method during the urban planning processes. In conclusion, the applications of the recommended methods identified in this study aid in the design decisions to shift towards climate comfort in urban spaces.

AB  - Infestations by the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis Kroyer) represents the major fish health problem that the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) industry has to face. Sea lice infestation has a large impact on the economy of fish farmers, which are looking for a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable alternative to chemical or mechanical treatments to delouse fish. The biological control of sea lice using the so-called cleaner fish has been individuated as a feasible delousing approach of Atlantic salmons. In particular, in recent years the lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) has been extensively farmed to be used as a 'biological weapon' in salmon farming because of its effectiveness in delousing also in harsh environmental conditions. However, the environmental impact of lumpfish farming is still largely unknown. Thus, the present study aimed at assessing the potential environmental impact of lumpfish production through a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Feed and electricity consumption, both for 8 of the 18 evaluated midpoint indicators, are the main responsible of the environmental load while for the Freshwater and Marine eutrophication about 90% of the impact is related to the emission of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds by fishes. These data lay the foundation for further, sustainable improvement of lumpfish farming.

AB  - Green environmental protection concept has been gradually reflected in all aspects of life. For gymnasts, the formation and improvement of competitive ability need to follow the principle of systematic training, that is, uninterrupted training, but inevitably encountering haze weather. In order to study the impact of PM2.5 weather conditions on gymnastics' outdoor training health and sports performance, a study on the impact of atmospheric fine particle pollution on gymnastics' outdoor training physical fitness was proposed. Taking gymnasts in Y Academy as the research object, through literature data method, testing method and mathematical statistics method, we analyze the influence of different atmospheric fine particle pollution on gymnastics outdoor training physical fitness, so as to provide training basis for gymnasts to conduct reasonable training. At the same time, we put forward corresponding suggestions. The results of the study show that: after the heavy load exercise, FEF25 measured under high concentration of PM2.5 and medium concentration of PM2.5 are both lower than 80%, but FEV1.0% is higher than 80%. In addition, the impact of different PM2.5 concentrations on various indicators of gymnast's airway function has a certain short-term and lagging nature, and has a greater impact after exercise.

AB  - In this study, the digestive tract of three freshwater fish species (Capoeta capoeta, Alburnus mossulensis and Squalius cephalus) was examined using a morpo-histopathological technique. Sediment and fish samples were taken from selected four stations in the Karasu River (Erzurum, Turkey) between June and September in 2015-2016. In water and sediment samples, the concentrations of some metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Sr and Pb) were determined. Histopathological changes in digestive tract were determined by histopathological alterations index (HAI). Intestinal coefficient (IC) and condition factor (CF), which are general indicators of exposure to environmental stress, were calculated for each fish. The highest CF was observed at the least contaminated site of the gradient. C. capoeta showed the highest values of IC among species. The detected abnormalities were infiltration, swelling, gastric degenerations, vacuolization, congestion, epithelial degenerations, hyperplasia, fibrosis and fusion at polluted site fish. It was also observed that the HAI and IC values in fish varied significantly from site to site. The results showed that the content of heavy metals in the river water and sediment may affect the health status of the fish species. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic invertebrate communities are reliable indicators of environmental conditions, and thus often assessed during ecological studies. However, when identifying all specimens to the same taxonomic unit is not possible, the common practice of identifying each specimen to the lowest possible taxonomic level may introduce enough taxonomic noise into datasets to obscure important trends. Using an infaunal-invertebrate community from the Cassiar Cannery mudflat (British Columbia, Canada), we tested if identifying specimens to different taxonomic levels (order, family, genus, species, and lowest possible) produced different statistical interpretations, or observed magnitude of differences in community structure and density between microhabitats. When taxonomic level was varied, statistical interpretations and magnitude of observed differences did not differ. Given the resources required to train taxonomists, and the time required to identify all specimens to species, identifying invertebrates to broader levels may represent an efficient trade-off between taxonomic resolution and resources. This study also showed no difference in conclusions between identifying specimens to species or to the lowest possible taxonomic unit, a mixture of taxonomic resolutions (phylum, class, order, species, etc.). In situations where it is not possible to identify all specimens to species, identifying specimens to the lowest possible unit may offer a similar resolution as would have been achieved with species level investigations.

AB  - Soil contamination is a worldwide crisis, which diminishes food and agricultural production. Alterations in the soil environment due to soil contamination cause biophysical and biochemical changes in vegetation. Due to dynamic nature of these changes, early monitoring can permit for preventive interferences before intense and sometimes inevitable vegetation and soil problems occur. As plants are rooted in soil substrate, vegetation changes can be used as bio-indicators of soil conditions. Traditionally, vegetation changes have been usually determined by visual analysis or detected after major destructive sampling during the growth period. As the characteristics of vegetation influence its spectral properties, effective remote and non-contact detection methods offer an alternative and near real-time way for detecting plant changes, even prior to visual symptoms and negative effects appearance. The aim of the current study is to review the potential of optical proximal and remote sensing techniques at different platforms for indirect assessment of plant-soil interactions via monitoring vegetation anomalies related to soil contamination. It is strongly felt that this rapidly progressing technological direction will permit extending the use of the techniques to geology, soil science and precision agriculture and an overall broad range of applications.

AB  - Tailings from bauxite washing produced in Porto Trombetas, Para state, a Brazilian Amazon region, have chemical and physical characteristics limiting the development of plants, which hinders to revegetate the tanks where they are deposited. This study was carried out under field conditions, and aimed to assess the physical quality of these tailings after a decade of recovery practices. Three treatments were assessed: no application of inputs and planting of seedlings (T1) and two levels of fertilization, one with lower (T2) and other with higher (T3) doses of limestone and fertilizers associated with planting tree seedlings. After ten years of experimentation, penetration resistance (PR) and substrate moisture up to 60 cm depth were assessed and the least limiting water range (LLWR), water retention curve (WRC), and pore size distribution were determined and calculated. After a decade of environmental recovery, differences in physical characteristics were observed in the tailings due to different revegetation modes. Moisture in the substrate profile, LLWR, WRC, and pore size distribution were sensitive indicators to variations in substrate physical quality. Liming, fertilization, and planting of seedlings are necessary for revegetation and improvement of the physical quality of tailings. Treatment T3 was the best intervention identified so far for tank revegetation. The absence of fertilization and planting precludes revegetation even with sources of propagules nearby.

AB  - Potential exposures are those that may occur as a result of unanticipated operational performance or accidents. Potential exposure situations are probabilistic in nature because they depend on uncertain events such as equipment failure, operator errors or external initiators beyond the control of the operator. Consequently, there may exist a range of possible radiological impacts that need to be considered. In this paper a Level 3 Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for a hypothetical scenario relevant to Innovative Nuclear Energy Systems (INS) was conducted using computer code MACCS (MELCOR Accident Consequence Code Systems). The acceptability of an INS was analyzed taking into account the general requirement that relocation or evacuation measures must not be necessary beyond the site boundary. In addition, deterministic modeling of the accident consequences for the critical meteorological conditions was carried out using the JRODOS decision support system (Real-time On-line Decision Support system for off-site emergency management in Europe). The approach used for dose and risk assessment from potential exposure of accidental releases and their comparison with acceptance criteria are presented. The methodology described can be used as input to the licensing procedure and engineering design considerations to help satisfy relevant health and environmental impact criteria for fission or fusion nuclear installations.

AB  - The article reviews in its first part literature on the development of forests in the lowland region Dubener Heide (Saxony, Central Germany). The Dubener Heide acts as example for regions in Central and Eastern Europe, which are undergoing a dramatic transformation from heavily to moderately affected by air pollution. Main on- and off-site factors and their influence on forest vegetation and processes are described. In the following, regional approaches for dealing with spatial influence of deposition in forest management planning are introduced and a concept for integrating ongoing processes into a process-oriented forest management is described. Additionally, the special suitability of the presented approach compared to classic forest management planning is discussed. Requirements and research needs for an application of the presented approach are noted. The article is based on an approach, which is pursued in the regional research project "Environment and Forests under Changing Conditions" (ENFORCHANGE). ENFORCHANGE is running in two regions in former Eastern Germany: "Dubener Heide" (Saxony/Saxony-Anhalt) and Upper Lusatian region (Saxony). Major aim of the project is the development of improved forest management planning concepts including landscape management and land-use optimization in former industrial hotspots.

AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) is presently widely accepted as the overriding objective for forest policy and practice. Regional processes are in progress all over the world to develop and implement criteria and indicators of SFM. In continental Europe, a set of 35 Pan-European indicators has been endorsed under the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (MCPFE) to measure progress towards SFM in the 44 countries of the region. The formulation of seven indicators (forest area, growing stock, age structure/diameter distribution, deadwood, tree species composition, damaging agents, naturalness) requires national data to be reported by forest types. Within the vast European forest area the values taken by these indicators show a considerable range of variation, due to variable natural conditions and anthropogenic influences. Given this variability, it is very difficult to grasp the meaning of these indicators when taken out of their ecological background. The paper discusses the concepts behind, and the requirements of, a classification more soundly ecologically framed and suitable for MCPFE reporting than the three (un-informative) classes adopted so far: broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, mixed broadleaved and coniferous forest. We propose a European Forest Types scheme structured into a reasonably higher number of classes, that would improve the specificity of the indicators reported under the MCPFE process and its understanding.

AB  - There are seven stable isotopes of Hg that can be fractionated as a result of inorganic and organic interactions. Important inorganic reactions involve speciation changes resulting from variations in environmental redox conditions, and phase changes resulting from variations in temperature and/or atmospheric pressure. Important organic reactions include methylation and demethylation, reactions that are bacterially mediated, and complexing with organic anions in soils. The measurement of Hg isotopes by multi-collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) is now sufficiently precise and sensitive that it is potentially possible to develop the systematics of Hg isotopic fractionation. This provides an opportunity to evaluate the utility of Hg isotopes in identifying source processes, transport mechanisms, and sinks. New values are provided for, Hg-201/Hg-198, Hg-200/Hg-198, Hg-199/Hg-198 for three standard materials (IRMM-AE639, SRM 1641c, SRM 3133) that can be used to make inter-laboratory data comparisons, and these values are tabulated with published isotopic information.

AB  - This study reports results from a first analysis of vegetation dynamics in permanent plots in Swedish boreal forests. The plots are a part of the international cooperative programme on integrated monitoring of air pollution effects on ecosystems (lCP IM), which is part of the long-range transboundary air pollution convention (LRTAP) of the united nation's economic commission for Europe. In Sweden, there are four ICP IM monitoring sites, established 1982-1999. Vegetation measurements are made about every second year to be able to detect and follow possible changes in species composition.
   Ellenberg indices for light, moisture, pH and nitrogen were used as indirect metrics of environmental conditions. Vegetational gradients were explored by multivariate ordination methods. All gradients were short, less than 1.5 units in detrended correspondence analyses. Despite the short gradients, all sites showed spatial variation that could be related to different Ellenberg indices. A temporal trend in species composition was detected only at one site. At this site time accounted for 8% of the variation in the data set and a spatial variable accounted for 13%. Correlations between ordination plot scores and Ellenberg indices indicated that the temporal trend was partly caused by increasing light regime and decreasing soil moisture. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluates causal relationships between chronic exposure of fish to metals and effects at different levels of biological organization based on a weight-of-evidence approach. Criteria for evaluation of causality were strength, consistency, and specificity of the association, as well as biological gradient and plausibility. Field sampling was conducted three times between 1998 and 2000, in Furnas Stream, impacted by an abandoned lead mine, and in three other locations, including two reference and one impacted sites. Levels of Pb, Zn, Cd, and Ag in sediments from the Furnas Stream exceeded background levels, and their concentrations were above sediment quality guidelines. Residual levels of metals in fish tissue were high enough to indicate reduced growth, reproduction and/or survival according to toxicological benchmarks. Lead-induced biochemical changes (ALA-D activity depletion) were observed in two species of siluriform catfish. The condition factor of a predatory catfish was reduced, and the percentage of prey generalists was higher in Furnas than at the noncontaminated sites. Reduction in fish community diversity and density was observed. Integration of data provided supporting evidence that observed effects on fish from the Furnas Stream resulted from long-term exposure to metals, however influences from other stressors cannot be ruled out.

AB  - Soils, subsoils, and aquifer materials can be modified with hydrophobic cationic surfactants to increase their sorption capabilities for organic contaminants. The objective of this study was to examine in detail the sorptive characteristics of the natural loess soil and the resultant organo-modified soils for aqueous-phase neutral organic compounds (NOCs) in an attempt to define the operative sorptive mechanisms. Under the laboratory conditions, a series of modified loess soils in this study were prepared by replacing the cations of loess soil with both cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) and anionic surfactant sodium dodethylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS). Toluene was selected as an indicator to study the sorption behavior of the NOCs in loess soils. The sorption isotherms of toluene in soil samples obtained using the batch equilibration method. The results indicated that natural loess had a poor sorption capability for NOCs, and sorption isotherms of toluene appeared likely nonlinear and fit the Freundlich equation very well. When the soils were coated with large alkyl surfactants such as HDTMA-Br, sorption isotherms correspondingly became linear and the sorptive capability was prominently dependent on the quantity of hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) and SDBS added into the soils. The study could provide an essential basis on attenuation of organic contaminants in the subsurface environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The labile concentration and toxicity of Cu as influenced by alkalinity and different concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and naturally derived fulvic acid (FA) were determined by bioassays carried out in the culture media for Daphnia magna (D. magna). The labile concentration of Cu was obtained by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry with a double-acidification method (DAM-DPASV). Changes in water alkalinity did not affect the labile concentration of Cu, but increase in alkalinity did reduce the mortality of D. magna. In the presence of EDTA and FA, both labile concentration of Cu and mortality were reduced. By excluding Cu-carbonate complexes from the labile concentration, a bioavailable concentration of Cu ([Cu*]) was obtained and was used to predict the acute toxicity of Cu on D. magna. For natural waters, the labile concentration of Cu was measured by DAM-DPASV, and [Cu*] was calculated using MINTEQ A2 software (developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) based on the anion composition of waters. This procedure was tested for waters and sediment elutriates sampled from the Le An River (Jiangxi Province, China) that were severely polluted by the discharges from a copper mine. The results showed that [Cu*] was a good indicator for Cu toxicity and could be used under field conditions.

AB  - Alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) was measured in two species of Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile and Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson, under different nutritional conditions, both natural and experimental.
   The levels of APA were higher in old leaves, partially due to massive epiphytic overgrowth, and low but detectable in roots; APA decreased with increasing nutrient levels, and a good correlation was found between the rise of P content in vegetative tissues following nutrient addition and the concomitant decrease in APA values. We conclude that APA may be a good indicator of seagrass nutritional status.

AB  - Sustainability indices for countries provide a one-dimensional metric to valuate country specific information on the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, environmental, and social conditions. At the policy level, they suggest an unambiguous yardstick against which a country's development can be measured and even a cross-country comparison can be performed. This article reviews the explanatory power of various sustainability indices applied in policy practice. We show that these indices fail to fulfill fundamental scientific requirements making them rather useless if not misleading with respect to policy advice. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The uses of bivalve molluscs in environmental biomonitoring have recently gained momentum due to their ability to indicate and concentrate human pathogenic microorganisms. In the context of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, the objective of this study was to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid genome can be detected in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters from two separate plants to support its interest as bioindicator of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contamination in water. The zebra mussels were exposed to treated wastewater through caging at the outlet of two plants located in France, as well as to raw wastewater in controlled conditions. Within their digestive tissues, our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 genome was detected in zebra mussels, whether in raw and treated wastewaters. Moreover, the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in such bivalve molluscans appeared even with low concentrations in raw wastewaters. This is the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the tissues of a sentinel species exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters. Despite the need for development for quantitative approaches, these results support the importance of such invertebrate organisms, especially zebra mussel, for the active surveillance of pathogenic microorganisms and their indicators in environmental waters.

AB  - This paper aims to propose a procedure for calculating the energy performance indexes of buildings considering the seasonality of internal gains due to artificial lighting with a monthly quasi-steady-state energy balance. The proposed methodology evaluates the heat gains due to the integrated natural-artificial lighting system with the Lighting Energy Numerical Indicator (LENI). For the evaluation of buildings' global energy performance and for some energy services, this contribution cannot be considered constant annually as depend strongly by climate conditions. The effect of daylighting, type of light sourcesluminaires, building orientation and shading devices could influence lighting contribution of the internal heat gains. Then, the proposed methodology evaluates the internal heat gains with monthly energy balances. This methodology was applied to the case study of the "Brancaccio" retirement home in Matera (IT) for which the values of the energy performance indexes were compared with the standard normative approach using constant internal heat gains. The results of this work underline the importance of performing a detailed analysis that considers the availability of natural light in the different months of the year, the efficiency of the different lighting systems and their power installed per unit of area as a function of the lighting comfort requirements in the different types of environments.

AB  - Ponds are a typical feature of many villages in the subtropics, and have been widely used as important sources of water for agriculture, aquaculture and groundwater recharge, as well as enhancing village resilience to floods and drought. Currently many village ponds are in a very poor state and in dire need of rejuvenation. This paper assesses the current water quality status and ecological health of twelve sub-tropical village ponds, situated in western Uttar Pradesh, India. This assessment is used to evaluate their wastewater treatment needs in relation to potential village uses of the water. Physico-chemical (Secchi depth, Total phosphorus and Total nitrogen) and biological (Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a) indicators highlight hypertrophic conditions in all the ponds. The study indicates that the status of village ponds requires significant investments in wastewater treatment to restore their use for many purposes, including aquaculture, although some may still be acceptable for irrigation purposes, as long as pathogenic bacteria are not abundant. We propose increased implementation of decentralised systems for wastewater treatment, such as septic tanks and constructed wetlands, to reduce the organic and nutrient loads entering village ponds and allow their use for a wider range of purposes.

AB  - Elephant interaction programs, specifically ones that provide elephant back riding, have come under public scrutiny, and little information exists to show whether these activities affect animal welfare. This study examined the impact of human interactions and ride-based activities on physiological stress-related indicators in African elephants. Fifteen trained semi-captive elephants, as well as free-ranging elephants roaming under the same ecological conditions, were monitored. Faecal samples were collected over a nine-month period from both groups and these were analysed using an enzyme immunoassay detecting faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) with a 5 beta-alpha-ol-11-one structure. Elephants that participated in elephant-back-safari (EBS) activities showed significant decreases in fGCM concentrations when EBS were discontinued. Similarly, fGCM concentrations of the trained semi-captive individuals that did not participate in EBS showed decreased steroid concentrations over the same time. Overall, fGCM concentrations of the trained semi-captive herd and the free-ranging herd did not differ significantly. The collected data will help to better understand the physiological and behavioural requirements of semi-captive elephants with frequent exposure to humans. The findings will also help to optimise management strategies for wild elephant populations and elephants living in controlled environments on reserves exposed to wildlife tourism.

AB  - The development of biodegradable waste recycling leads to increased amounts of decaying organic materials handled, and encourages the conditions in which workers, households and neighbouring communities are potentially exposed to bioaerosols, The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and gaps regarding the health risks associated to bioaerosols in the field of municipal solid waste (MS1N) and commercial and industrial waste (C&IW) management. Additional objective was to identify priority issues for research in order to improve knowledge and prevention. Overall, 368 studies have been selected. Strong qualitative evidence links occupational exposure to bioaerosols in the waste industry to adverse effects on health including long-term respiratory disease, notably in the fields of composting, mechanical biological treatment (MBT) and materials recovery facilities (MRF). The literature review highlighted numerous gaps in knowledge about exposure and health effects of bioaerosols that need to be addressed to assess the risk. Most importantly, valid and standardized methods for quantitative exposure assessment are needed. Identification of environmental indicators, estimate of factors influencing the level of bioaerosol exposure at the workplace, well-designed epidemiological studies and validation of dispersion models are other priority issues,

AB  - This study was performed in order to establish new parameters to recognize the depositional microfacies using grain size distribution (GSD) data from laser diffraction analysis. A total of 938 samples were collected from five sedimentary microfacies, and 18 characteristic parameters of these samples were developed by statistical analysis, fractal theory, fingerprint methods, and variogram function. The samples were divided into a training data set and testing data set. The training data set was used to establish a discriminative database with five depositional microfacies; the testing data set was used to verify whether these characteristic parameters can identify their depositional microfacies according to the discriminative database. Out of the 50 samples in the testing data set, 47 samples were correctly recognized within their depositional environment and only three samples of point bar were shared with natural levee using the random forest (RF) method. The analysis results indicate the fine grain size and general characteristic of GSD have more significant influences on depositional environment classification than other parameters. The flood plain and fan- between depression environments had the most similar hydrodynamic conditions among the five considered depositional microfacies. Therefore, the 18 characteristic parameters of GSD are useful tools to identify depositional microfacies for hydrogeological parameter studies.

AB  - Forest management plans and Criteria and Indicators are the most important tools to support sustainable forest management. Due to the important role of forests in contributing to humans' well being through the numerous ecosystem services they provide, in the last two decades many efforts have been made to develop new forest management tools at different scale levels. Territorial Forest Plan and Criteria and Indicators for SFM are considered as the innovative tools to support forest management. A participatory approach, providing a better knowledge of social framework conditions and trends on local markets, is considered the focus of new forest management tools. Territorial Forest Plan allows to identify the main function of forest stands at territorial level, based on both forest type and stakeholders' opinions. On the other hand, the Indicators Network can be helpful to support forest management because it allows to identify the main causal paths and crucial linkages involving the indicators and to offer decision makers the opportunity to manage the forest ecosystem in a more holistic way. In this work, an application of indicators network analysis to support Territorial Forest Plan development in the Nature 2000 site has been studied. Based on the results obtained, an integrated use of both approaches may provide an added value to sustainable forest management.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the toxicity effectiveness of berries crude extract of Endod [vernacular name (local native language, Amharic); Phytolacca dodecandra] against aquatic macroinvertebrates Baetidae (Mayflies) and Hydropsychidae (Caddisflies), under laboratory conditions. In Ethiopia, toxic plant, berries of Phytolacca dodecandra are being commonly used for washing clothes and to control fresh water snails. Macroinvertebrates are useful biological indicators of change in the aquatic ecosystems. The present study clearly revealed that the LC50, and LC90 values for berries crude extract of Phytolacca dodecandra against Baetidae were 181.94 and 525.78 mg/I and lethal doses (LC50 and LC90,) required for Hydropsychidae were 1060.69 and 4120.4 mg/I respectively. The present investigation demonstrated that Baetidae was more susceptible than Hydropsychidae, even at shorter exposure period of 2 h. From our preliminary investigation the toxicity effectiveness of crude extracts of Phytolacca dodecandra has been clearly shown. In addition, it requires further explorations which address both the toxicity activity and the active principles that are responsible for its toxicity effectiveness. Ultimately, the release/introduction of Phytolacca dodecandra plant berries extracts into the river/streams leads to disruption of food chain in the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, at this moment preserving the aquatic ecosystem is extremely essential and inevitable.

AB  - Interactions between environmental conditions and management practices can significantly affect soil function. Soil quality assessments may improve our understanding of how soils interact with the hydrosphere and atmosphere. This information can then be used to develop management practices that improve the capacity of the soil to perform its various functions and help identify physical, chemical, and biological soil attributes to quantify the present state of a soil and detect changes resulting from management. In protocols established by the Great Plains cropping system network, sampling and testing procedures were selected to identify physical, chemical, and biological soil attributes responsive to management that may serve as useful indicators in assessing the effects of management on the soil resource. Eight existing long-term studies from throughout the Great Plains in the central USA were used to make these assessments because, (1) many years are required for certain soil properties to change measurably; (2) annual weather causes variation in system performance; and (3) the soil pools of interest are spatially variable. This paper includes detailed descriptions of the treatments and sites, and both long-term and short-term (1999-2002) data on precipitation, temperature, and yields for each location.

AB  - Heat shock proteins ( hsps) are involved in multiple cellular processes during normal and stress conditions, particularly in the folding of polypeptides. A newly recognized property of the members of the Hsp70 family is their ability to interact with lipids, opening ion conductance pathways in artificial membranes, and integrating into natural membranes. The formation of Hsp70 channels in biological membranes and their function is still elusive. In this study, we showed that Hsp70 and Hsc70 display a highly selective interaction with phosphatidylserine moieties on membranes, followed by rapid incorporation into the lipid bilayer. Addition of Hsp70 or Hsc70 into the extracellular medium resulted in a viability decrease of cells beading PS on the exterior surface, such as PC12 cells. This toxic effect is modulated by the presence of ATP or ADP and can be blocked by screening PS moieties with annexin 5. These observations suggest that the presence of Hsp70 in the extracellular medium may be an accelerator of apoptosis since the presence of PS on the surface is an early indicator of this process. These findings may also explain the toxicity observed in cells overexpressing Hsp70s and provide a rational for the tight regulation of Hsp70 expression.

AB  - Ketamine, a multimodal anesthetic drug, has become increasingly popular in the treatment of pain following traumatic injury as well as treatment-resistant major depressive disorders. However, the psychological impact of this dissociative medication on the development of stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains controversial. To address these concerns, preclinical studies have investigated the effects of ketamine administration on fear memory and stress-related behaviors in laboratory animals. Despite a well-documented line of research examining the effects of ketamine on fear memory, there is a lack of literature reviews on this important topic. Therefore, this review article summarizes the current preclinical literature on ketamine and fear memory with a particular emphasis on the route, dose, and timing of ketamine administration in rodent fear conditioning studies. Additionally, this review describes the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine may impact fear memory and stress-related behaviors. Overall, findings from previous studies are inconsistent in that fear memory may be increased, decreased, or unaltered following ketamine administration in rodents. These conflicting results can be explained by factors such as the route, dose, and timing of ketamine administration; the interaction between ketamine and stress; and individual variability in the rodent response to ketamine. This review also recommends that future preclinical studies utilize a clinically relevant route of administration and account for biological sex differences to improve translation between preclinical and clinical investigations.

AB  - In this study, the contamination levels of hygienic indicators and foodborne pathogens in retail meat products were investigated in relation to the various market factors including processing temperature, processing area, and market type. Ground beef samples (n=80) were purchased from 40 meat markets and investigated for microbiological quality. Beefs processed below 20 degrees C had significantly lower numbers of total coliforms (TC) than these processed over 20 degrees C (2.01 vs. 2.79 log CFU/g; p<0.05). Interestingly, separation of processing area did not affect the contamination levels. Remarkably, the contamination levels of hygienic indicator differ among market types, indicating that not only processing condition but distribution structure that is directly related with storage period could affect the final microbiological loads of the meat products. In addition, the prevalences of Listeria monocytogenes (a psychrotroph), Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis were 7.5% (6/80), 10.0% (8/80), and 20.0% (16/80), respectively, which is irrelevant to market factors except meat products from wholesale markets where no L. monocytogenes were found among 30 samples. The results of this study indicate that the contamination level of hygiene indicator and foodborne pathogens in retail beef is more related with processing temperature and storage period than other environmental factors.

AB  - The main objective of the paper is to examine the natural and anthropogenic conditions for soil erosion by water in agricultural catchment in southern Poland. The Dworski Potok catchment is situated on the edge of the Carpathian Foothills, in the northern part of the Wisnicz Foothills (the Brzesko Foreland). It covers the area of 0.29 km(2), the ranges of altitude being 223 - 278 m a.s.l. The dominant lithology in the area consists of flysch series belonging to the sub-Silesian overthrust, and the Miocene clays and sandstones, which are covered with the Quaternary loess-like formations. The soil cover is weakly differentiated with Stagnic Luvisols. Low hills are typical in the morphology of the area.. The ridges and the slopes are covered with thick, loess-like formations. Soil erosion by water in this catchment is determined mainly by catchment area, relief, climate, bedrock and land use. It has been established that slope wash is an occasional process. The morphological effectiveness of soil erosion by water is variable during the year and differentiated along the slope in the catchment. The amount of the sediment depends mainly on the type of vegetation cover and the crop structure. Only sporadic short-duration and high-intensity rainfall events may trigger overland flow and soil erosion causing serious loss of topsoil and significant damage to agriculture.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between fine resolution, local-scale biophysical and socioeconomic contexts within which land degradation occurs, and the human responses to it. The research draws on experimental data collected under different territorial and socioeconomic conditions at 586 field sites in five Mediterranean countries (Spain, Greece, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco). We assess the level of desertification risk under various land management practices (terracing, grazing control, prevention of wildland fires, soil erosion control measures, soil water conservation measures, sustainable farming practices, land protection measures and financial subsidies) taken as possible responses to land degradation. A data mining approach, incorporating principal component analysis, non-parametric correlations, multiple regression and canonical analysis, was developed to identify the spatial relationship between land management conditions, the socioeconomic and environmental context (described using 40 biophysical and socioeconomic indicators) and desertification risk. Our analysis identified a number of distinct relationships between the level of desertification experienced and the underlying socioeconomic context, suggesting that the effectiveness of responses to land degradation is strictly dependent on the local biophysical and socioeconomic context. Assessing the latent relationship between land management practices and the biophysical/socioeconomic attributes characterizing areas exposed to different levels of desertification risk proved to be an indirect measure of the effectiveness of field actions contrasting land degradation.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms can adversely affect fish communities, though their impacts are highly context-dependent and typically differ between fish species. Various approaches, comprising univariate and multivariate analyses and multimetric Fish Community Indices (FCI), were employed to characterise the perceived impacts of a Karlodinium veneficum bloom on the fish communities and ecological condition of the Swan Canning Estuary, Western Australia. The combined evidence suggests that a large proportion of the more mobile fish species in the offshore waters of the bloom-affected area relocated to other regions during the bloom. This was indicated by marked declines in mean species richness, catch rates and FCI scores in the bloom region but concomitant increases in these characteristics in more distal regions, and by pronounced and atypical shifts in the pattern of inter-regional similarities in fish community composition during the bloom. The lack of any significant changes among the nearshore fish communities revealed that bloom impacts were less severe there than in deeper, offshore waters. Nearshore habitats, which generally are in better ecological condition than adjacent offshore waters in this system, may provide refuges for fish during algal blooms and other perturbations, mirroring similar observations of fish avoidance responses to such stressors in estuaries worldwide.

AB  - We investigated the structure and width of the dormant cambium and of the increments of phloem and xylem of Quercus robur to estimate their potential as indicators for tree vitality. The samples were taken from three woodlands, two in Slovenia [Krakovo forest (KRA) and Murska Suma (MUS)] and one in Croatia [Kobiljak (KOB)], with reported tree decline. The number of dormant cells seems to reflect the initial capacity of the cambium to accomplish cell division. With the exception of two trees at KRA, cell production was always higher on the xylem side than on the phloem side. The annual phloem increments were narrower, less variable among trees and with clear lower and upper limits. With increased cambial cell productivity, the share of the xylem in the total annual radial increment increased following a curvilinear function. In trees with an annual radial increment > 3.5 mm, the xylem size represented more than 90 % of the total radial growth. The anatomical variables analyzed show that the most limiting environmental conditions seem to prevail at KRA, whereas the conditions at MUS seem to be most favorable in terms of radial growth. Analysis of the width and structure of xylem and phloem increments, the number of dormant cambial cells and their inter-relationships can provide additional information on the vitality of oaks.

AB  - Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) is a high production volume flame retardant. To date, regulation and control of its environmental release have been minimal. Once in the environment, BDE-209 may encounter conditions favoring debromination, potentially forming congeners with greater toxicity, bioaccumulation potential, and persistence. However, (photolytic and in vivo) debromination has only been demonstrated under laboratory scenarios. To examine whether debromination was likely in the field, PBDE congener profiles were tracked from a wastewater treatment plant (sludge) to receiving stream sediments and associated aquatic biota. BDE-209 and 23 additional PBDEs were detected. Sludge congener profiles resembled the commercial penta- and deca- formulations, suggesting minimal -209 debromination during wastewater treatment. Similar profiles were observed in surficial sediments at the outfall and downstream. However, sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), and crayfish (Cambarus puncticambarus sp. c) collected near the outfall contained tri- through deca-PBDEs, including congeners not detected in the commercial deca- mixture, sludges or sediments (BDE-179, -184, -188, -201, and -202). A previous in vivo laboratory study identified these as -209 debromination products. This supports the hypothesis that metabolic debromination of -209 does occur in the aquatic environment under realistic conditions. Hence assessments that assume no BDE-209 debromination may underestimate associated bioaccumulation and toxicity attributable to the less brominated congeners produced.

AB  - Due to the difficulties in testing for specific pathogens, water samples are tested for the presence of nonpathogenic indicator organisms to determine whether a water supply has been contaminated by fecal material. An implicit assumption in this approach is that where pathogenic microorganisms are present fecal indicator organisms are present as well; yet surprisingly few studies have been conducted that directly compare the transport of indicator organisms with pathogenic organisms in ground water environments. In this study we compared the cell properties and transport of Escherichia coli, a commonly used indicator organism, and Campylobacter jejuni, an important entero-pathogen commonly found in agricultural wastes, through saturated porous media. Differences in cell properties were determined by measuring cell geometry, hydrophobicity, and electrophoretic mobility. Transport differences were determined by conducting miscible displacement experiments in laboratory columns. Under the experimental conditions tested, C jejuni was much more negatively charged and more hydrophobic than E. coli. In addition, C jejuni cells were slightly longer, narrower, and less spherical than E. coli. The variations in cell properties, primarily surface charge, resulted in significant differences in transport between these two microorganisms, with the transport of C jejuni exceeding that of E. coli when conditions favored low attachment rates, thus calling into question the usefulness of using E. coli as an indicator organism for this important pathogen.

AB  - Apoptosis can limit the maximum production of recombinant protein expression from cultured mammalian cells. This article focuses on the links between nutrient deprivation, ER perturbation, the regulation of (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153) GADD153 expression and apoptosis. During batch culture, decreases in glucose and glutamine correlated with an increase in apoptotic cells. This event was paralleled by a simultaneous increase in GADD153 expression. The expression of GADD153 in batch culture was suppressed by the addition of nutrients and with fed-batch culture the onset of apoptosis was delayed but not completely prevented. In defined stress conditions, glucose deprivation had the greatest effect on cell death when compared to glutamine deprivation or the addition of tunicamycin (an inhibitor of glycosylation), added to generate endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, the contribution of apoptosis to overall cell death (as judged by morphology) was smaller in conditions of glucose deprivation than in glutamine deprivation or tunicamycin treatment. Transient activation of GADD153 expression was found to occur in response to all stresses and occurred prior to detection of the onset of cell death. These results imply that GADD153 expression is either a trigger for apoptosis or offers a valid indicator of the likelihood of cell death arising from stresses of relevance to the bioreactor environment.

AB  - The chlorophyll a fluorescence transient measured under high light shows a typical O-J-I-P polyphasic rise. However, under certain stress situations such as heat or drought stress? a rapid phase with a maximum around 300 mu s has been observed and called K (Guisse et al. (1995a) Arch Sci Geneve 48:147-160). Here, we show that under various conditions, the appearance of the K-step and the following dip, as well as the lowered maximum fluorescence level (F-M) attainable, can be explained by an imbalance between the electron flow leaving the RC to the acceptor side and the electron flow coming to the RC from the donor side. This leads to a stable oxidation of the secondary electron donor, the tyrosine Z (Y-Z), and possibly to the accumulation of P680(+). In the case of heat stress, we confirm that this situation is caused by an inhibition of electron donation to Y-Z, which is due to a damaged oxygen evolving complex (OEC). Finally, we present a model which includes the OEC, Y-Z, P680, Q(A) and Q(B) which is in good agreement with the experimental data. The appearance of the K-step, under natural conditions, can now be used as a convenient stress indicator and specifically attributed to a damage on the electron donor side.

AB  - In the dispersed acinar cells of the submucosal nasal gland in the guinea pig, intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) was measured with a microfluorimetric imaging method and the cytosolic indicator dye, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, under HCO3--free conditions. In the unstimulated condition, the [Na+]i was averaged to 12.8 +/- 5.2 mM. Addition of 100 mu M ouabain or removal of external K+ caused an increase in [Na+]i. Replacement of external Cl- with NO3- or addition of 0.5 mM furosemide reversibly decreased the [Na+]i. The recovery process from the reduced [Na+]i was inhibited by removal of either K+ or Cl- in the bath solution. These findings indicate the presence of a continuous influx of Na+ coupled with K+ and Cl- movement. Application of acetylcholine (ACh, 1 mu M) caused an increase in [Na+]i by about 15-20 mM, which was completely inhibited by addition of 10 mu M atropine. Increased cytosolic Na+ induced by ACh was extruded by the Na+-K+ pump. Removal of external Cl- and addition of 50 mu M dimethylamiloride inhibited ACh-induced increase in [Na+]i by about 66% and 19%, respectively. In both unstimulated and stimulated state, Na+-K+ pump, Na-K-Cl cotransport, and Na+-H+ exchange play a critical role in maintaining intracellular electrolyte environment and in controlling a continuous secretion of nasal fluids.

AB  - The Authors refer on a microbiological survey effected on developping world of leghornish catering. From 1994 to 1996 seventy-six checks have been done: 455 specimens have been collected. On every specimen seven bacteriological parameters have been choosen: biological indicators and pathogenetic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes). The trial showed evidently differences among the three types of catering in order to the microbiological quality. The analytical results and the ensuing remedies allowed to remove some hygienic problems. Besides, the collected data could constitute a contribute for drawing up guide lines in order to evaluate the hygienic condition of the ambients appointed to catering.

AB  - The rediscovery of Halocardyle fragilis Vannucci, of which the type material is lost, led us to consider it a variety of Halocardyle disticha (Goldfuss) that occurs in calm waters on soft bottoms. The typical H. disticha is open feather-shaped, with branching in one plane, while H. fragilis is bushy, much larger, with branching in many planes. The different habit of H. disticha is probably due to environmental conditions. The bushy and pinnate forms are considered extremes of a range of morphological variation.

The verified bioindicator had a z value of 10.1-degrees-C and a Dref (at 70-degrees-C) of 22 min.  At processing temperatures of 70-degrees-C and 80-degrees-C, the lethalities (F)bio as read from the bioindicator agreed very well with the target Ft10.0 values calculated from the time temperature data according to the general method.

AB  - Research indicates that adaptation influences how people experience indoor conditions (ICs), and that the built environment influences both adaptation, via perceived control, and well-being. Their interlinkage is, however, not well understood. Therefore, we investigated how the design of hospital rooms can contribute to patients' well-being by supporting their adaptation of and to ICs via perceived control. Two mixed methods case studies were conducted at hospital wards in Belgium, each concurrently collecting qualitative and quantitative data. These included interviews with 16 (case 1) and 19 (case 2) patients, self-documentation by 8 patients (case 1), sensor measurements of indoor environmental quality indicators (e.g. sound, light, and temperature levels) (cases 1 and 2) and questionnaires among 84 (case 1) and 238 (case 2) patients. Focusing on the built environment's role in adaptation allows characterizing known adaptation strategies in more detail. When perceiving control over adaptable building characteristics, patients can adapt ICs or adapt to ICs by choice. When not perceiving such control, they may still adapt sensations or their position. Without any perceived control, adapting to ICs is imposed. The built environment can support patients' adaptation by supporting their autonomy and competences. In this way it can foster both patients' eudaimonic as well as their hedonic well-being.

AB  - According to cultural historical activity theory motivation, adaptability, study-related experience ("perezhivanie"), and moral codes may be considered as prerequisites for Digital educational environment (DEE) acceptance. To measure the attitudes towards DEE a Scale for Assessing University Digital Educational Environment was used (AUDEE Scale by M. Sorokova, M. Odintsova, and N. Radchikova). Academic motivation was evaluated by "Academic Motivation Scales" Questionnaire (by T. Gordeeva, O. Sychev, and E. Osin). Study-related experiences were measured by Activity-Related Experiences Assessment technique (AREA) developed by D. Leontiev and his colleagues. Moral behavior was evaluated with the help of Moral Disengagement Questionnaire (MD-24) adapted by Y. Ledovaya and her colleagues. Students' adaptability was accessed by a questionnaire developed by T. Dubovitskaya and A. Krylova. 406 students of Moscow State University of Psychology and Education took part in the investigation (90,1% female). The average age was 28,7 +/- 9,6 years (median = 24 years) varying from 19 to 72 years. The results showed that it is possible to distinguish two groups based on the results of AUDEE scale: Acceptance group and Resistance group. Acceptance group has higher scores in almost all motivation indicators, studyrelated experiences of pleasure and meaning, adaptability to educational activities, and lower scores in five out of seven moral disengagement strategies. Statistical analysis (classification trees) showed that motivation (both external and internal) and study-related experience are key resources for the DEE acceptance.

AB  - Physical interactions between seaweed blades of Saccharina latissima and unidirectional turbulent flow were examined in an open-channel flume, focussing on flow velocities, drag force acting on a blade, and blade reconfiguration. The data reveal that seaweed blades adjust to high-energy flow conditions relatively quickly, efficiently reducing flow-induced drag via compaction, a mechanism of blade reconfiguration. The drag coefficient of blades of S. latissima varied between 0.02 and 0.07 over a range of mean flow velocities from 0.1 to 0.55m/s. Both flow action and blade biomechanical characteristics influenced the blade dynamics, with the flow role being predominant in highly energetic conditions. The interaction mechanisms and their strength were found to be scale-dependent, with the combined effect of reduced mean flow velocity and enhanced turbulence in blade wakes. The thickness of the diffusive boundary layer, an important factor in nutrient uptake from the surrounding water, was estimated to be in the range from 0.010 to 0.067mm. Mechanisms of blade adjustment to the flow and scale-dependent dynamic interactions between blades and turbulent eddies have direct implications for seaweed growth, acclimation, and survival. The estimates of the drag coefficient and the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer will be useful for the development of bio-physical models, environmental assessments, and design of seaweed farms.

AB  - Plants would experience more complex environments, such as sudden heat shock (SHS) stress combined with elevated CO2 in the future, and might adapt to this stressful condition by optimizing photosynthetic carbon metabolism (PCM). It is interesting to understand whether this acclimation process would be altered in different genotypes of maize under elevated CO2, and which metabolites represent key indicators reflecting the photosynthetic rates (P-N) following SHS. Although B76 had greater reduction in P-N during SHS treatment, our results indicated that P-N in genotype B76, displayed faster recovery after SHS treatment under elevated CO2 than in genotype B106. Furthermore, we employed a stepwise feature extraction approach by partial linear regression model. Our findings demonstrated that 9 key metabolites over the total (35 metabolites) can largely explain the variance of P-N during recovery from SHS across two maize genotypes and two CO2 grown conditions. Of these key metabolites, malate, valine, isoleucine, glucose and starch are positively correlated with recovery pattern of P-N. Malate metabolites responses to SHS were further discussed by incorporating with the activities and gene expression of three C-4 photosynthesis-related key enzymes. We highlighted the importance of malate metabolism during photosynthesis recovery from short-term SHS, and data integration analysis to better comprehend the regulatory framework of PCM in response to abiotic stress.

AB  - Drought stress is the most important factor limiting wheat yield in the Altai Territory, Russia. Several selection criteria have been proposed to select genotypes based on their performance in stressful and non-stressful environments. We tested seventy-five genotypes of spring bread wheat in a randomized complete block design with three replications for three years (2010-2012). The trials were conducted in the Altai Research Institute of Agriculture, Russia. Six drought resistance indices, including Sensitivity drought index (SDI), Mean productivity (MA, Tolerance index (Tol), Stress susceptibility index (SSI), Geometric mean productivity (GMP) and Stress tolerance index (STI) were calculated for each genotype based on grain yields under non-stress and three stress conditions. Stress intensity indices (SI) in the first, second, and third environments were low (SI = 0.39), moderate (SI = 0.56), and high (SI = 0.80), respectively. We found that different indices give a similar characteristic of the most drought-resistant and drought-susceptible genotypes. SSI fully corresponds to the SDI value, and STI corresponds to the GMP value (r = 1.00). Tolerance is closely related to SDI (r = 0.83-0.86). SDI and SSI are offered as useful indices for wheat breeding where stress is severe, while STI, MP and GMP are suggested if stress is less severe. Genotypes with high yield potential can be identified under moderate drought, but not under severe drought stress.

AB  - Maize is prone to infection by Aspergillus flavus, which can contaminate the product with aflatoxins. The objective of this study was to examine the impact that interactions between water activity (a(w)) and temperature may have on growth, the expression of a biosynthetic regulatory gene (aflR) and aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) production by a strain of A. flavus on a maize-based medium. Results showed that there were some differences between lag phases and growth rates of A. flavus. The optimum growth rate for A. flavus was at 30 degrees C and 0.99 a(w). No growth occurred at 0.90 a(w) and 20 degrees C. Both temperature and a(w) had an influence on the relative aflR gene expression and AFB(1) production by A. flavus; however, the results for AFB(1) production were not consistent with the effects on gene expression or growth. These findings provide data that are useful to better understand the conditions which represent higher risks from AFB(1) production. However, the aflR expression was not a good indicator of AFB(1) production alone. Thus, further molecular studies of other AF-related genes should be done. These results are discussed in the context of harvesting and storage of maize and the prevailing environmental conditions to minimise AFB(1) contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The progressive change in climatic conditions worldwide has increased frequency and severity of extreme hydrometeorological events (EHEs). Mexico is an example that has been affected by the occurrence of EHE leading to economic, social, and environmental losses. The objective of this research was to apply a Canadian distributed hydrological model (DHM) to tropical conditions and to evaluate its capacity to simulate flows in a basin in the central Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the DHM (once calibrated and validated) was used to calculate the theoretical hydraulic power (THP) and the performance to predict streamflow before the presence of an EHE. The results of the DHM show that the goodness of fit indicators between the observed and simulated flows in the calibration process Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.83, ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) = 0.41, and percent bias (PBIAS) = -4.3) and validation (NSE = 0.775, RSR = 0.4735, and PBIAS = 2.45) are satisfactory. The DHM showed its applicability: determination of THP showed that the mean flows are in synchrony with the order of the river reaches and streamflow simulation of 13 EHEs (NSE = 0.78 +/- 0.13, RSR = 0.46 +/- 0.14 and PBIAS = -0.48 +/- 7.5) confirmed a reliable efficiency. This work can serve as a tool for identifying vulnerabilities before floods and for the rational and sustainable management of water resources.

AB  - The range of applied possibilities of fuzzy logic theory in the analysis of the economic efficiency of an innovative chemical project is shown. A methodology for determining the return on assets and the return on assets of an innovative chemical project in conditions of uncertainty has been developed. In the 21st century, rapid changes took place throughout the world on the economic, social and business fronts. Their scales have formed an extremely complex and unpredictable decision-making structure that is difficult to model with traditional approaches. The main goal of this paper is to present the latest achievements in the development of innovative methods of uncertainty management that prevails in the global economic and administrative environment. Innovative projects that are highly technological, costly, energy- and labor-consuming, meeting all environmental standards are the basis for effective development of economy in each region. The Republic of Tatarstan is distinguished by a very high developed petrochemical cluster which small innovative projects are the most numerous and in demand today. Such models are the basis on which future breakthrough large-scale production is formed, but the forecasting of their development meets with high degrees of uncertainty connected both with traditional external and internal political and economic conditions, and are characteristic mainly for new projects with innovation, investment, market, commercial, raw materials, sector, and other risks.

AB  - Plants often encounter unfavorable environmental conditions because of their sessile lifestyle. These adverse factors greatly affect the geographic distribution of plants, as well as their growth and productivity. Drought stress is one of the premier limitations to global agricultural production due to the complexity of the water-limiting environment and changing climate. Plants have evolved a series of mechanisms at the morphological, physiological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular levels to overcome water deficit or drought stress conditions. The drought resistance of plants can be divided into four basic types-drought avoidance, drought tolerance, drought escape, and drought recovery. Various drought-related traits, including root traits, leaf traits, osmotic adjustment capabilities, water potential, ABA content, and stability of the cell membrane, have been used as indicators to evaluate the drought resistance of plants. In the last decade, scientists have investigated the genetic and molecular mechanisms of drought resistance to enhance the drought resistance of various crops, and significant progress has been made with regard to drought avoidance and drought tolerance. With increasing knowledge to comprehensively decipher the complicated mechanisms of drought resistance in model plants, it still remains an enormous challenge to develop water-saving and drought-resistant crops to cope with the water shortage and increasing demand for food production in the future.

AB  - Diatoms are ubiquitous marine photosynthetic eukaryotes that are responsible for about 20% of global photosynthesis. Nevertheless, little is known about the redox-based mechanisms that mediate diatom sensing and acclimation to environmental stress. Here we used a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein sensor targeted to various subcellular organelles in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, to map the spatial and temporal oxidation patterns in response to environmental stresses. Specific organelle oxidation patterns were found in response to various stress conditions such as oxidative stress, nutrient limitation and exposure to diatom-derived infochemicals. We found a strong correlation between the mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) redox potential (E-GSH) and subsequent induction of cell death in response to the diatom-derived unsaturated aldehyde 2E, 4E/Z-decadienal (DD), and a volatile halocarbon (BrCN) that mediate trophic-level interactions in marine diatoms. Induction of cell death in response to DD was mediated by oxidation of mitochondrial E-GSH and was reversible by application of GSH only within a narrow time frame. We found that cell fate can be accurately predicted by a distinct life-death threshold of mitochondrial E-GSH (-335mV). We propose that compartmentalized redox-based signaling can integrate the input of diverse environmental cues and will determine cell fate decisions as part of algal acclimation to stress conditions.
