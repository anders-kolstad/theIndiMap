AB  - Riparian forest width is a major driver of their capacity to retain sediments from agricultural fields. However, the relationship between forest width and ecosystem service provisioning may vary with local environmental conditions such as relief, soil, and vegetation types. In order to assess the effect of forest width, slope, hydraulic conductivity, and land cover (watershed scale) on the effectiveness of riparian buffers in retaining sediment from pastures cultivated with African C-4 grasses, we used the natural abundance of carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) in the soil and stream organic sediments as indicators. The study was conducted in small streams of the upper Corumba River basin, state of Goias (Cerrado biome), Brazil. We found that slight increases from 2 to 5% mean slope were sufficient to change SOM to a mixture of C-3 and C-4 carbon sources inside the riparian forests. Therefore, hillslope's steepness and magnitude control soil transport downslope, but after reaching the riparian forest, sediment retention is strongly affected by the forest width. We also found that soil erosion leads to fine sediment deposition in agricultural streams, especially in those watersheds with a high occurrence of degraded pastures. We conclude that sites along the stream course with a combination of steep slopes, narrow forests, and intensive land use are the most vulnerable to sediment inputs and should be the focus of preservation and restoration by landscape managers.

AB  - The implementation of directives such as the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) has promoted the development of several tools and methods for assessing the ecological health of marine ecosystems. Within the scope of the WFD and in terms of rocky shores, several multimetric tools were developed based on the macroalgae biological quality element (BQE), in addition to those based on macroinvertebrates.
   The WFD requires member states to assess each BQE separately. The present work aimed to test the ability of ecological indices to distinguish sites within anthropogenic disturbance gradients caused by organic enrichment, using macroinvertebrate communities on intertidal rocky shores. Owing to the lack of more specific indices (for rocky shore), indices based on abundance, diversity and/or taxonomic composition were selected from several widely used indices in ecological studies and/or developed for soft-bottom macroinvertebrate communities.
   Present findings reveal several indices based on diversity and/or taxonomic composition able to distinguish sites within the disturbance gradients, showing increasing quality from the site nearest the source of organic enrichment to that farthest from it, especially indices calculated using biomass data, and in the summer season. Such results open good perspectives for the use of intertidal macroinvertebrate communities from rocky shores, and also help add the perspective of this biological quality element in the ecological quality assessment of coastal waters.

AB  - In Mediterranean-type grassland ecosystems, the timing of rainfall events controls biogeochemical cycles, as well as the phenology and productivity of plants and animals. Here, we investigate the effect of short-term (days) soil environmental conditions on microbial community structure and composition during a natural wetting and drying cycle. Soil samples were collected from a meadow in Northern California at four time points after the first two rainfall events of the rainy season. We used 16S rRNA microarrays (PhyloChip) to track changes in bacterial and archaeal community composition. Microbial communities at time points 1 and 3 were significantly different than communities at time points 2 and 4. Based on ordination analysis, the available carbon, soil moisture, and temperature explained most of the variation in community structure. For the first time, a complementary and more comprehensive approach using linear regression and generalized logical networks were used to identify linear and nonlinear associations among environmental variables and with the relative abundance of subfamilies. Changes in soil moisture and available carbon were correlated with the relative abundance of many phyla. Only the phylum Actinobacteria showed a lineage-specific relationship to soil moisture but not to carbon or nitrogen. The results indicate that the use of a high taxonomic rank in correlations with nutritional indicators might obscure divergent subfamily-level responses to environmental parameters. An important implication of this research is that there is short-term variation in microbial community composition driven in part by rainfall fluctuation that may not be evident in long-term studies with coarser time resolution.

AB  - It is widely recognized that forest and water resources are intricately linked. Globally, changes in forest cover to accommodate agriculture and urban development introduce additional challenges for water management. The U. S. Southeast typifies this global trend as predictions of land-use change and population growth suggest increased pressure on water resources in coming years. Close attention has long been paid to interactions between people and water in arid regions; however, based on information from regions such as the Southeast, it is evident that much greater focus is required to sustain a high-quality water supply in humid areas as well. To that end, we review hydrological, physicochemical, biological, and human and environmental health responses to conversion of forests to agriculture and urban land uses in the Southeast. Commonly, forest removal leads to increased stream sediment and nutrients, more variable flow, altered habitat and stream and riparian communities, and increased risk of human health effects. Although indicators such as the percentage of impervious cover signify overall watershed alteration, the threshold to disturbance, or the point at which effects can been observed in stream and riparian parameters, can be quite low and often varies with physiographic conditions. In addition to current land use, historical practices can greatly influence current water quality. General inferences of this study may extend to many humid regions concerning climate, environmental thresholds, and the causes and nature of effects.

AB  - This study is based on detailed multidisciplinary field investigations with the use of the Alpine River and Stream Ecosystems (ARISE) Classification to assess spatial and temporal patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in relation to altitudinal and channel stability gradients. We expected the field validation through the use of an innovative ARISE classification approach of alpine aquatic ecosystems by collecting physicochemical variables and benthic macroinvertebrate community data from various stream locations of Khunjerab National Park (Pakistan). The significant differences in physicochemical habitat structure and altitudinal changes of benthic macroinvertebrate communities (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) were observed among the ARISE classification categories. For instance, the early spring categories had high Shannon-Wiener index (1.377) than summer (1.267), while summer season categories had high turbidity (>5NTU). Early spring mercury nival (0.00083 mg/L) and aluminum nivo-kernal (0.25 mg/L) were also found above permissible levels according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The multivariate statistical techniques showed a strong correlation among physicochemical and biological parameters of stream classification categories suggesting the increased applicability of the use of the ARISE classification approach. This study is expected to contribute to the advancement in the method of the stream monitoring program and improve conservation and management of the alpine benthic macroinvertebrate diversity further in Pakistan, the Asian Himalayas, and beyond.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment could be a valuable tool for water management since it can simulate the potential response of the aquatic system to changes such as the addition of organic pollution, an increase in nutrient levels or water abstraction rates and changes in sewage treatment operations. The negative effects of human activity on water quality are manifested both by the contamination of resources and by violation of the natural conditions of water circulation. This study aims to determine the relationships between anthropogenic activities, stressors and adverse effects based on previously acquired knowledge about the state of water quality in the Laborec River and the sources of pollution in the river basin. The exposure profile, developed within this research, is the output of an analysis of environmental risks in the studied river basin and is focused on an evaluation of the surface water quality in the Laborec River. The results from the evaluation are following: risk is characterized as acceptable in the upper section of the Laborec basin; it can be characterized as moderate to undesirable in the middle part of the river basin; and the risk is unacceptable in the lower part of the river basin, mainly due to industry. This results can identify the priority areas where measures for decreasing of the water pollution have to be done.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment as currently practiced has hindered consideration of ecosystem services endpoints and restoration goals in the environmental management process. Practitioners have created barriers between procedures to clean up contaminated areas and efforts to restore ecosystem functions. In this article, we examine linkages between contaminant risk assessment approaches and restoration efforts with the aim of identifying ways to improve environmental outcomes. We advocate that project managers and other stakeholders use an ecological planning framework, with restoration options included upfront in the risk assessment. We also considered the opportunities to incorporate ecosystem services as potential assessment endpoints in the Problem Formulation stages of a risk assessment. Indeed, diverse perspectives of stakeholders are central to understand the relevance of social, cultural, economic, and regional ecology as influences on future use options for the landscape being restored. The measurement endpoints used to characterize the existing ecological conditions for selected ecosystem services can also be used to evaluate restoration success. A regional, landscape, or seascape focus is needed throughout the risk assessment process, so that restoration efforts play a more prominent role in enhancing ecosystem services. In short, we suggest that practitioners begin with the question of how can the ecological risk assessment inform the decision on how best to restore the ecosystem?

AB  - The potential risks of cultivating carrageenophyte genera for commercial purposes in the circumtropical belt are debated. However, species introductions of two such genera, Kappaphycus Doty and Eucheuma J. Agardh, have been reported in 30 different locations in this region over the last 30 years. On several occasions, these introductions did not adequately evaluate potential environmental risks or were conducted without approval from local regulatory bodies. In the present paper, a working protocol is proposed for the quarantine and assessment of the possible effects of the introduction of Kappaphycus alvarezii and Kappaphycus striatus to shallow marine ecosystems of the tropical Western Atlantic. This protocol is based on field data following from the introduction of eucheumoids onto the Cuban shelf in the early 1990s. It was demonstrated that the propagation of either carrageenophyte in oligotrophic waters of the Cuban Archipelago did not pose a potential risk to the region's biodiversity due to the synergic combination of high herbivory and low rates of growth. Physical features of the substrate and depth were the most important regulators of grazing. These environmental conditions restrict potential cultivation sites in the Cuban Archipelago to a few small regions where nutrient pulses are well established. In these areas, when the canopy of cultivated carrageenophytes is sufficiently high, a significant effect on benthic communities is observed. In consideration of the need to protect places with high intrinsic value, this fact should be considered during site selection.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of diatoms and mollusks as paleoenvironmental indicators in semiarid lakes of the Argentinean Pampas. At each lake, physical and chemical variables were quantified, and diatoms and mollusks collected. The relationships between environmental variables and biological assemblages were explored through ordination techniques. Lakes were highly all:aline (pH 9.5-10.5), and varied significantly in conductivity (0.2-15.7 mS/cm) and hardness (120-1874 mg/l CaCO3). A total of 79 diatom and two mollusk species were identified. The highest percentage variance in diatom data was explained by hardness, conductivity, and mud percentage. Mollusk variability was significantly related to conductivity, hardness, and vegetation cover. Diatom-based ordination of sites accurately reflected the main environmental gradients characteristic of the region, while the resolution provided by mollusk-based ordinations was lower, mainly as consequence of the wide ranges of tolerance to hardness and conductivity exhibited by the two species represented. Hence, while the use of mollusks as paleoenvironmental indicators is only valid at a large, regional scale, diatoms allow discriminating local conditions and subtle environmental differences. As a consequence, the results emphasize the use of mollusks as qualitative and semi-quantitative indicators, while the strong statistical relationship between diatoms and climate-driven environmental parameters highlights their potential use as quantitative indicators of Quaternary climatic changes in the semiarid Pampas.

AB  - In the last decade a politically inspired marine protection movement arose in the European Union. This movement leads to an holistic strategy. Merging the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Directive (MSD) along the European coastline demands sophisticated ecological classification procedures. The 'Benthic Quality Index' (BQI) is one of several indices created in view of the WFD. We used the dynamic species reference system ES500.5 to test the capability of BQI to exclude primary environmental factors including the salinity gradient and depth (a proxy for the oxygen regime) from the ecological quality (EcoQ) assessment.
   A macrozoobenthos dataset of the southern Baltic Sea spreading over more than 20 years and over 100,000 km(2) Was used for the EcoQ assessment. Quality assurance rules were applied to the record set and an analytical dataset of 936 sampling events with 20,451 abundance records was used in the analysis. We show that the natural salinity gradient has a severe impact on the BQI based EcoQ We adapted the calculation procedure to reduce the salinity effects to a minimum.
   According to the adaptation 503 sensitivity/tolerance values for 87 species were computed. These values were calculated within seven salinity ranges from 0 to >30 PSU and two depth zones. These values can be used as a reference for further investigation in the Baltic and other areas with similar environmental conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetlands including salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They are known for improving the quality of coastal water and provisioning coastal fisheries. However, this ecosystem is under potential threat due to urban coastal land reclamation, limited sediment supply, increased nutrient/eutrophication, and sea level rise. Therefore, restoration efforts to protect the degraded salt marsh habitat are considerably increasing worldwide. In this paper, we present an overview of salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. Published scientific literature in English language was collected by searching the most relevant keywords from popular search engines, namely, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Mendeley to get the information about salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. This study comprehensively reviewed data from 78 peer-reviewed papers. Results indicated that much of the salt marsh was restored through assisted abiotic strategies (e.g., recovery of tidal exchange, managed realignment, and sediment level amendment). A total of 214 indicators were found, spanning over six major ecological attributes such as structural diversity, ecosystem functions, physical conditions, species composition, external exchange, and absence of threat. Author keywords analysis revealed several hotspots for recent research (e.g., 16 s rRNA, fungi, microbial communities, carbon accumulation, and blue carbon). This paper proposes a model for restoring degraded salt marsh, as well as tracking their success. The information presented here will assist the marine ecosystem restoration practitioners in getting a comprehensive understanding of salt marsh restoration success evaluation.

AB  - The global range of the environmental quality issues we all face necessitates integrated action from all of the countries that suffer from a particular environmental issue. We must be able to obtain data on the presence of pollutants and their effects on biota from any territory, regardless of its environmental, infrastructural, social, and economic conditions. Biomonitoring utilizes organisms and natural materials to obtain this information. In particular, the honeybee is a ubiquitous, easy-to-breed organism with great mobility. Its body, which is covered with hairs, picks up materials and particulates that it encounters in the environment. Therefore, bees are highly effective accumulators of materials from the soil, vegetation, air, and water. These characteristics mean that the honeybee is both a bioindicator and a passive bioaccumulator organism, making it an ideal agent for easily monitoring vast areas inexpensively, even in regions where infrastructure is scarce. In this short review, we summarize the main targets of the honeybee-based monitoring campaigns that have been carried out to date, highlighting the results obtained in assessments of organic and inorganic pollution performed by coupling more modern technologies with this long-standing practice. It is hoped that this review will make scientists more aware of the incredible potential of these delicate organisms to provide data that could prove useful in the management of environmental issues.

AB  - Aquatic pollutants produce multiple consequences in organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems, affecting the function of organs, reproductive state, population size, species survival and even biodiversity. In order to monitor the health of aquatic organisms, biomarkers have been used as effective tools in environmental risk assessment. The aim of this study is to evaluate, through a multivariate and integrative analysis, the response of the native species Hypostomus ancistroides over a pollution gradient in the main water supply body of northwestern Parana state (Brazil). The condition factor, micronucleus test and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA), comet assay, measurement of the cerebral and muscular enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and histopathological analysis of liver and gill were evaluated in fishes from three sites of the Pirapo River during the dry and rainy seasons. The multivariate general result showed that the interaction between the seasons and the sites was significant: there are variations in the rates of alterations in the biological parameters, depending on the time of year researched at each site. In general, the best results were observed for the site nearest the spring, and alterations in the parameters at the intermediate and downstream sites. In sum, the results of this study showed the necessity of a multivariate analysis, evaluating several biological parameters, to obtain an integrated response to the effects of the environmental pollutants on the organisms.

AB  - Chironomid communities were studied in a sediment core collected from Lake Moreno Oeste, located in Nahuel Huapi National Park. A major change in midge assemblages occurred at similar to AD 1760, which was characterized by a decrease of "cold taxa" including Polypedilum sp.2 and Dicrotendipes, and an increase of "warm taxa" including Apsectrotanypus and Polypedilum sp.1. These taxa are likely related to climatic conditions concurrent with the end of a cold period at similar to AD 1500-1700 and the beginning of a drying climate at similar to AD 1740-1900 in northern Patagonia. Coarse tephra layers had low midge diversity; however they did not disrupt the climatic trend as the community recovered rapidly after the event. Since AD 1910, after the increase in suburban housing, fish introduction, and the construction of a road, there was an increase in the relative abundances of taxa typically associated with the littoral zone, such as Para-psectrocladius, Riethia, Apsectrotanypus, and some Tanytarsini morphotypes. The main change in the chironomid community appears to be associated with long-term climate change. At the beginning of the 20th century, other site-specific environmental factors (catchment change and fish introduction) altered the chironomid assemblages, making it more difficult to understand the relative importance of each driver of assemblage change.

AB  - Due to arid conditions, population growth, and anthropogenic impacts from agricultural and urban development, wastewater effluent makes up an increasingly large percentage of surface water supplies promoting concerns about the potential ecological and human health effects associated with the organic quality of surface waters receiving treated wastewater discharge. Anthropogenic inputs alter the quality and quantity of organic carbon and also affect the ability of aquatic ecosystems to retain or transform carbon and other nutrients. In this paper, we use pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) as a tool to examine whether the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in suburban streams influenced by anthropogenic inputs displays an organic signature that is structurally different from natural organic material (NOM). Py-GC/MS was not only able to differentiate among stream sites that received discharge from upstream wastewater treatment plants and those that did not, but also distinguished stream sites influenced significantly by storm water. Distinct organic signatures were evident in stream waters with upstream wastewater treatment plant discharges regardless of the distance from effluent discharge, indicative of the persistent nature of effluent-derived organic material (EfOM). The pyrolysis fragments of 3-methyl-pyridine, 2-methyl-pyridine, pyrrole, and acetamide were identified as indicators of EfOM, supporting previous research that has suggested that protein and aminosugar derivitives are possible wastewater markers. Furthermore, pyrolysis fragments associated with soil polycarboxylic acids correlated highly with stream sites having the least anthropogenic influences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The creation of Protected Areas was one of the first measures taken for the protection of biodiversity and it is still the most widely used. The establishment of systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the management of these areas are crucial to validate their importance for conservation and guide the managers towards their conservation goals. Aculeate Hymenoptera, specifically Apiformes and Spheciformes, gather exceptional characteristics as bioindicators and are essential to ecosystem sustainability by including key pollinators (Apiformes), contribute for the maintenance of the equilibrium between arthropod populations (Spheciformes), and also reflect the patterns of other taxa. Apiformes and Spheciformes communities were sampled with Malaise traps in eight different habitats initially identified by habitat type (mainly vegetation). These communities were evaluated to determine if the habitats could be differentiated based on their Apiformes and Spheciformes generic communities. Apiformes and Spheciformes diversity provided limited differentiation between habitats but was able to differentiate the most disturbed habitat from the most pristine. In general, Apiformes and Spheciformes communities were different among the eight habitats. It was also possible to establish a relation between some genera and a specific habitat type. Several genera of Apiformes and Spheciformes showed a preference for the riparian galery (RLR) and a mixed woodland (COZ), providing a general idea of the ideal conditions for the development of these groups. These results suggest that Apiformes and Spheciformes communities are a suitable management tool for habitat evaluation.

AB  - 1. The impacts of human activities on tropical forests are widespread and increasing. Hence, a good knowledge base about ecological processes in undisturbed tropical forest is crucial to provide a baseline for evaluating anthropogenic change.
   2. Our 5-year study focused on understanding the background spatial and inter-annual variation in dung beetle communities at 12 sites of undisturbed lowland tropical rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon. We then assessed how this variation may affect ecological evaluations of anthropogenic influence by comparing community metrics with comparable dung beetle data collected from 15 sites of Eucalyptus plantation in the same region.
   3. Of all measured environmental variables, soil texture best explained spatial variation in dung beetle communities in undisturbed forests. Furthermore, soil texture was important for community assembly as it was associated with dung beetle nesting behaviours. While the relative abundance of dung beetle functional groups was stable over time, there were important inter-annual temporal dynamics, with a fivefold variation in abundance and body mass, and with species richness ranging from 52 to 74. These temporal oscillations were probably caused by variation in dry season rainfall.
   4. This inter-annual variation influenced the comparison between undisturbed forests and plantations, which could lead to inconsistencies in evaluation of anthropogenic change. We therefore highlight the importance of understanding natural variation in studies evaluating the consequences of land-use change and other forest disturbances on forest biodiversity.

AB  - In revegetation projects, distinguishing species that can be passively restored by natural regeneration from those requiring active restoration is not a trivial decision. We quantified tree species dominance (measured by an importance value index, IVIi) and used abundancesize correlations to select those species suitable for passive and/or active restoration of disturbed riparian vegetation in the Lacandonia region, Southern Mexico. We sampled riparian vegetation in a 50x10m transect in each of six reference (RE) and five disturbed (DE) riparian ecosystems. Those species representing more than 50% of total IVI in each ecosystem were selected, and Spearman rank correlation between abundance and diameter classes was calculated. For eight species, it was determined that passive restoration could be sufficient for their establishment. Another eight species could be transplanted by means of active restoration. Five species regenerate well in only one ecosystem type, suggesting that both restoration strategies could be used depending on the degree of degradation. Finally, two species were determined to not be suitable for restoration in the RE (based on the above selection criteria) and were not selected during this initial stage of our restoration project. The high number of tree species found in the RE suggests that the species pool for ecological restoration is large. However, sampling in both ecosystem types helped us reduce the number of species that requires active restoration. Restoration objectives must guide the selection of which methods to implement; in different conditions, other criteria such as dispersal syndrome or social value could be considered in the species selection.

AB  - With the increase in global mean surface temperature predicted for the near future, stream water temperature will also increase. Simultaneously, water quality is likely to decrease (e.g., due to increases in nutrient and pollutant concentrations). The objective of this study was to evaluate the individual and combined effects of increases in water temperature and nutrients concentration on periphyton respiration, as a surrogate for stream metabolism. Stones naturally colonized with periphyton in an unpolluted mountain stream in Central Portugal were sampled seasonally over a year, and incubated in the laboratory under two water temperatures (ambient and 4 degrees C elevated) and two nutrients concentration levels (ambient and approximate to 6x higher inorganic dissolved nitrogen, approximate to 2x higher soluble reactive phosphorous concentrations). Overall, increases in water temperature stimulated periphyton respiration to a larger extent than did increases in nutrients concentration. In spring, the simultaneous increase in water temperature and nutrients concentration stimulated periphyton respiration beyond expected from the individual effect of each factor. These results indicate that synergistic interactions between factors might occur under certain environmental conditions, suggesting that care should be taken when predicting the combined effect of changes in multiple factors from their individual effects. The observed stimulation of periphyton respiration promoted by increased temperature and nutrients concentration can lead to changes in streams carbon budgets, with a positive feedback for global warming, as more CO2 might be released to the atmosphere.

AB  - As important marine mesopredators and sensitive indicators of Antarctic ecosystem change, penguins have been a major focus of long-term biological research in the Antarctic. However, the vast majority of such studies have been constrained by logistics and relate mostly to the temporal dynamics of individual breeding populations from which regional trends have been inferred, often without regard for the complex spatial heterogeneity of population processes and the underlying environmental conditions. Integrating diverse census data from 70 breeding sites across 31 years in a robust, hierarchical analysis, we find that trends from intensely studied populations may poorly reflect regional dynamics and confuse interpretation of environmental drivers. Results from integrated analyses confirm that Pygoscelis adeliae (Adelie Penguins) are decreasing at almost all locations on the Antarctic Peninsula. Results also resolve previously contradictory studies and unambiguously establish that P. antarctica (Chinstrap Penguins), thought to benefit from decreasing sea ice, are instead declining regionally. In contrast, another open-water species, P. papua (Gentoo Penguin), is increasing in abundance and expanding southward. These disparate population trends accord with recent mechanistic hypotheses of biological change in the Southern Ocean and highlight limitations of the influential but oversimplified "sea ice'' hypothesis. Aggregating population data at the regional scale also allows us to quantify rates of regional population change in a way not previously possible.

AB  - Thecamoebian faunas identified from 15 small permanent and ephemeral lakes and ponds on Barbados, West Indies, are characterized by low numbers of individuals and low species diversities (Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index = 0-1.4). Four lakes and ponds were found to contain no thecamoebians. The faunas were dominated by Centropyxis aculeata, with lesser numbers of Arcella vulgaris, Cucurbitella tricuspis, Centropyxis constricta and Cyclopyxis kahli. Very low numbers of the small idiosomic species Euglypha rotunda and an undifferentiated Corythion-Trinema type were also reported; the first records from a tropical region. Centropyxid-dominated faunas have been reported from other tropical areas and may indicate stressed environmental conditions. Additional important ecological controls on these faunas include substrate characteristics, the nature of bankside and aquatic vegetation and water depth. Land use characteristics do not appear to have a significant influence on faunal distribution, although the soil indicator thecamoebian species C. kahli seems to have been introduced into at least one pond through erosion from adjacent fields. Significant numbers of the salt marsh foraminiferid Jadammina macrescens, and lesser numbers of Polysaccammina ipohalina and Miliammina fusca, were found in one coastal pond, with a few specimens of J. macrescens found in another. The presence of this unusual, nonmarine foraminiferal fauna may relate to the intrusion of salt water into local ground waters, or possibly the introduction of sea salt from the prevailing Atlantic winds. Foraminiferal and thecamoebian colonization into the ponds may have been avian mediated.

AB  - Diatom genera in many large East African lakes change little throughout the Holocene period suggesting relatively stable ecological conditions and some resilience to environmental change. Ecosystem stability is less common in smaller, more sensitive lakes, such as those within volcanic craters, where external impacts can cause abrupt and rapid fluctuations. A 4100-year diatom and cyanobacteria pigment record from Lake Massoko, a volcanic crater lake in southern Tanzania, is used to illustrate important switches in resource ratios following tephra deposition 1190 years ago. It is hypothesized that the tephra reduced the rate of P diffusion from the sediments and increased the Si:P ratio in the lake. A period of acute change in planktonic diatom communities resulted from the tephra impact and lasted c. 110 years. The magnitude of the change shown by the diatoms and their slow recovery from the tephra may be due in part to a coincident fall in lake level caused by a reduction in regional rainfall. The statistical significance of the tephra impact relative to that of catchment and climate change has been tested using variance partitioning and rate-of-change analysis. Multiproxy indicators show an important period of positive water balance 1700 ago and a relatively dry episode persisting between 1000 and 400 years ago. The lake ecosystem is shown to be highly sensitive to both climate change and tephra deposition.

AB  - Quality assessment of environments under high anthropogenic pressures such as the Seine Basin, subjected to complex and chronic inputs, can only be based on combined chemical and biological analyses. The present study integrates and summarizes a multidisciplinary dataset acquired throughout a 1-year monitoring survey conducted at three workshop sites along the Seine River (PIREN-Seine program), upstream and downstream of the Paris conurbation, during four seasonal campaigns using a weight-of-evidence approach. Sediment and water column chemical analyses, bioaccumulation levels and biomarker responses in caged gammarids, and laboratory (eco)toxicity bioassays were integrated into four lines of evidence (LOEs). Results from each LOE clearly reflected an anthropogenic gradient, with contamination levels and biological effects increasing from upstream to downstream of Paris, in good agreement with the variations in the structure and composition of bacterial communities from the water column. Based on annual average data, the global hazard was summarized as "moderate" at the upstream station and as "major" at the two downstream ones. Seasonal variability was also highlighted; the winter campaign was least impacted. The model was notably improved using previously established reference and threshold values from national-scale studies. It undoubtedly represents a powerful practical tool to facilitate the decision-making processes of environment managers within the framework of an environmental risk assessment strategy.

AB  - The ecological impacts of emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals are not well understood. The lack of experimental approaches for the identification of pollutant effects in realistic settings (that is, low doses, complex mixtures, and variable environmental conditions) supports the widespread perception that these effects are often unpredictable. To address this, we developed a novel screening method (GSA-QHTS) that couples the computational power of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with the experimental efficiency of quantitative high-throughput screening (QHTS). We present a case study where GSA-QHTS allowed for the identification of the main pharmaceutical pollutants (and their interactions), driving biological effects of low-dose complex mixtures at the microbial population level. The QHTS experiments involved the integrated analysis of nearly 2700 observations from an array of 180 unique low-dose mixtures, representing the most complex and data-rich experimental mixture effect assessment of main pharmaceutical pollutants to date. An ecological scaling-up experiment confirmed that this subset of pollutants also affects typical freshwater microbial community assemblages. Contrary to our expectations and challenging established scientific opinion, the bioactivity of the mixtures was not predicted by the null mixture models, and the main drivers that were identified by GSA-QHTS were overlooked by the current effect assessment scheme. Our results suggest that current chemical effect assessment methods overlook a substantial number of ecologically dangerous chemical pollutants and introduce a new operational framework for their systematic identification.

AB  - Daya Bay, is one of the largest and most important semi-closed bays along the southern coast of China. Due to the favorable geomorphological and climatic conditions, this bay has become an important conservation zone of aquatic germplasm resources in South China Sea. To characterize the trophic structure, ecosystem properties and keystone species, a food-web model for Daya Bay has been developed by the means of a mass-balance approach using the Ecopath with Ecosim software. The mean trophic transfer efficiency for the entire ecosystem as a whole is 10.9% while the trophic level His 5.1%. The primary- and secondary-producers, including phytoplankton, zooplankton and micro-zoobenthos demonstrated the important overall impacts on the rest of the groups based on mixed trophic impact (MIT) analysis and are classified as the keystone groups. The analysis of ecosystem attributes indicated that ecosystem of Daya Bay can be categorized as an immature one and/or is in the degraded stage. A comparison of this model with other coastal ecosystems, including Kuosheng Bay, Tongoy Bay, Beibu Gulf and Cadiz Gulf, underpinned that the ecosystem of Daye Bay is an obviously stressed system and is more vulnerable to the external disturbance. In general, our study indicates that a holistic approach is needed to minimize the impacts of anthropogenic activities to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem in the future.

AB  - The seasonal variation of the protozooplanktonic community (ciliates and testate amoebae) was studied in a tropical oligotrophic reservoir in Brazil, which was under the influence of two contrasting climatic seasons (rainy/warm and dry/cold). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of these climatic changes on physical, chemical and biological variables in the dynamic of this community. The highest mean density of total protozoans occurred in the rainy/warm season (5683.2 ind L-1), while the lowest was in the dry/cold (2016.0 ind L-1). Considering the seasonal variations, the protozoan groups that are truly planktonic, such as the oligotrichs (Spirotrichea), predominated in the dry season, whereas during the rainy season, due to the material input and resuspension of sediment, sessile protozoans of the Peritrichia group were the most important ones. The dominant protozoans were Urotricha globosa, Cothurnia annulata, Pseudodifflugia sp. and Halteria grandinella. The highest densities of H. grandinella were associated with more oxygenated and transparent water conditions, while the highest densities of C. annulata occurred in sites with high turbidity, pH and trophic state index (TSI). The study demonstrated that density and composition of protozooplanktonic species and groups of the reservoir suffered seasonal variation due to the environmental variables (mainly temperature, turbidity, water transparency, dissolved oxygen and TSI) and the biological variables (e.g. morphological characteristics, eating habits and escape strategies from predation of the species).

AB  - The increasing urbanization in big cities, that jeopardizes the ecosystems, makes it important to protect them as well as to recognize and manage the services they provide. In order to have the required scientific evidence to support conservation projects, an assessment of water quality and quantity seen as hydrological ecosystem services in the Magdalena River watershed, was carried out. Water quality was assessed in two annual cycles based on physicochemical, chemical, bacteriological and algal indicators, showing an abrupt change between the natural and urbanized areas. This has the potential to affect negatively the recreational activities practised in the area. The relevance of the indicators for water quality is that they show different aspects of the problem: physical and chemical parameters indicate variations across sites along the Magdalena River and point the places where domestic discharges occur. Algae reveal the natural conditions of the habitat and the risks to public health can be assessed with bacteriological indicators. To calculate the water quantity, balances were made in order to know the amount of water that runoff in the three dominant plant communities: the fir forest that generates 10,944,800 m(3) of water per year, the pine forest generates 6,878,000 m(3) and the mixed and oak forest generates 3,217,500 m(3). It is important to preserve the hydrological ecosystem services conserving the forests and rehabilitating the Magdalena River in order to enhance the provision of drinking water to the southern part of Mexico City.

AB  - The commercial production ofM. x giganteusfor bioenergy and lignocellulose products requests research on plant-parasitic nematodes which can cause serious crop yield losses when the crop is cultivated long-term in big plantations at the different environmental conditions and geographical locations. The occurrence ofM. x giganteusplant-feeding nematodes and temporal-spatial aspects of distribution were studied in 2016-2017 at the crop established stands of 1-10 years of age representing, consequently, 8 locations and 6 soil types in Ukraine and 9 localities and 8 soil types in Poland. Fifty-three plant-feeding nematodes of belonging to 22 genera and 10 families were identified, including plant-parasitic species which populations in several locations exceeded the estimated damage threshold. The distribution of nematode species was evaluated by applying the non-metric multidimensional scaling approach indicated spatial heterogeneity of sampling points and community dynamics. The relationships among the hyphal and root hair feeders, semiendoparasites and ectoparasites were characterized, and these groups were proposed as indicators for assessing the state ofM. x giganteusplantations with different years of cultivation. Obtained results can be applied for improvement ofM. x giganteusproduction technologies to prevent the risk of biomass yield reduction posing by plant-parasitic nematodes in temporal regions of East-Central Europe. Further study is needed to develop nematode-based biological monitoring of perennial grassland to enhance the sustainability of bioenergy systems.

AB  - Lake water temperature is one of the key parameters in determining the ecological conditions within a lake, as it influences both chemical and biological processes. Therefore, accurate prediction of water temperature is crucially important for lake management. In this paper, the performance of soft computing techniques including gene expression programming (GEP), which is a variant of genetic programming (GP), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict hourly water temperature at a buoy station in the Yuan-Yang Lake (YYL) in north-central Taiwan at various measured depths was evaluated. To evaluate the performance of the soft computing techniques, three different statistical indicators were used, including the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of correlation (R). Results showed that the GEP had the best performances among other studied methods in the prediction of hourly water temperature at 0, 2 and 3 meter depths below water surface, but there was a different trend in the 1 meter depth below water surface. In this depth, the ANN had better accuracy than the GEP and ANFIS. Despite the error (RMSE value) is smaller in ANN than GEP, there is an upper bound in scatter plot of ANN that imposes a constant value, which is not suitable for predictive purposes. As a conclusion, results from the current study demonstrated that GEP provided moderately reasonable trends for the prediction of hourly water temperature in different depths.

AB  - Small mammals are widely used as suitable indicators of environmental pollution and genotoxic damage.
   The present investigation of the karyotype sensitivity to the influence of a strong mutagen was held under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. The data about the chromosome aberrations induced by treating of Mitomycin C (3.5 mg/kg) in bone marrow cells have been analysed. The structural changes in the chromosomes including laboratory white mice ICR as well as five species small rodents - Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780), Apodemus sp. (Kaup, 1829), Microtus levis (Miller, 1908), Mus spicilegus (Petenyi, 1882) originating from Rila Natural Park, Vitosha Nature Park, Kresna Gorge and the vicinities of Pleven region were compared.
   The analysis was performed according to the protocol described by PRESTON et al. [(13)].
   All treated groups of small mammals investigated showed significantly higher percentage of damaged cells in comparison with their own untreated controls (P >= 0.99).
   Rodent species under the present investigation have presented significantly lower sensitivity of their chromosome set when compared to the laboratory mice ICR (p >= 0.99). The lowest chromosome aberrations value (in %) was expressed within the specimens in Microtus arvalis (10.29 +/- 0.38) while the highest sensitivity was shown in Mus spicilegus (21.6 +/- 1.45). In the four other species investigated quite close values about the number of induced chromosome aberrations were expressed.
   These findings have important implications for the use of zoomonitors as bioindicators in ecotoxicology and in application of genotoxicity findings in laboratory animal models to natural populations.

AB  - Background: Surface waters are the lowest points in the landscape, and therefore serve as excellent integrators and indicators of changes taking place in the surrounding terrestrial and atmospheric environment.
   Aims: Here we synthesise the findings of limnological studies conducted during the past 15 years in streams and lakes in the Green Lakes Valley, which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Site.
   Methods: The importance of these studies is discussed in the context of aquatic ecosystems as indicators, integrators, and regulators of environmental change. Specifically, investigations into climatic, hydrologic, and nutrient controls on present-day phytoplankton, and historical diatom, community composition in the alpine lake, Green Lake 4, are reviewed. In addition, studies of spatial and temporal patterns in dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry and reactive transport modelling that have taken place in the Green Lakes Valley are highlighted.
   Results and conclusions: The findings of these studies identify specific shifts in algal community composition and DOM biogeochemistry that are indicative of changing environmental conditions and provide a framework for detecting future environmental change in the Green Lakes Valley and in other alpine watersheds. Moreover, the studies summarised here demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring programmes such as the LTER programme.

AB  - The first decade of the new millennium saw a boom in rubber prices. This led to rapid and widespread land conversion to monoculture rubber plantations in continental SE Asia, where natural rubber production has increased >50% since 2000. Here, we analyze the subsequent spread of rubber between 2005 and 2010 in combination with environmental data and reports on rubber plantation performance. We show that rubber has been planted into increasingly sub-optimal environments. Currently, 72% of plantation area is in environmentally marginal zones where reduced yields are likely. An estimated 57% of the area is susceptible to insufficient water availability, erosion, frost, or wind damage, all of which may make long-term rubber production unsustainable. In 2013 typhoons destroyed plantations worth US$ >250 million in Vietnam alone, and future climate change is likely to lead to a net exacerbation of environmental marginality for both current and predicted future rubber plantation area. New rubber plantations are also frequently placed on lands that are important for biodiversity conservation and ecological functions. For example, between 2005 and 2010 >2500 km(2) of natural tree cover and 610 km(2) of protected areas were converted to plantations. Overall, expansion into marginal areas creates potential for loss-loss scenarios: clearing of high-biodiversity value land for economically unsustainable plantations that are poorly adapted to local conditions and alter landscape functions (e.g. hydrology, erosion) - ultimately compromising livelihoods, particularly when rubber prices fall.

AB  - Vegetation, soil, and hydrology in drylands often collectively exhibit strong ecohydrological interrelationships in which vegetation both influences and is influenced by runoff, particularly on sites with more gradual slopes. These two-way relationships have important implications for ecological restoration of disturbed sites, such as those being reclaimed following mining, yet studies from both ecological and hydrological perspectives specifically evaluating how the strength of ecohydrological interrelationships varies for a range of natural and restored conditions are still missing. We assessed two-way relationships between vegetation and soil hydrological properties by evaluating patterns of both plant community structure and soil hydrological characteristics related to runoff for natural sites and restored sites following mining. At the plot scale, we identified eight ecohydrological units based on interrelationships between vegetation communities and hydrological properties associated with runoff along a progression from source to sink patch types. Similarly, at the hillslope scale, which included patches of different types, we found a correspondence between the proportions of source and sink patches and both vegetation community and hydrological properties. The relative strength of ecohydrological interrelationships in hillslope mosaics decreased with decreasing disturbance except for rilled hillslopes, likely because parts of the hillslope become isolated from the others. Our results highlight, in general, how ecohydrological interrelationships are related with degree of disturbance, and in particular, how rilling alters ecohydrological interrelationships, thereby precluding effective restoration.

AB  - Higher trophic level species such as parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens are frequently ignored in community studies, despite playing key roles in the structure, function, and stability of ecological communities. Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in. oral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks.

AB  - The amelioration of air quality represents one of the most complex challenges that the European Union is facing today. Although a successful strategy to improve air quality should decisively act on pollution sources, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) may provide a huge contribution to tackle air pollution, while delivering a wide range of Ecosystem Services and enhancing the Natural Capital. In this paper, we analyzed, in both biophysical and monetary terms, the role of the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in improving air quality in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Southern Italy) by implementing an accounting model of PM10 removal. Our findings indicate that about 1,148 Mg of PM10 were annually removed by the UGI, for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year. We also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area, which resulted in a loss of PM10 removal of about 97 Mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year. The results also showed that PM10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation, highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of Ecosystem Services under Mediterranean climate conditions. In conclusion, we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of Ecosystem Services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well-being in metropolitan cities.

AB  - The restoration and the preservation of aquatics ecosystems is a critical issue in our contemporary society. In lake ecosystems, phytoplankton taxonomic-based indicators have been developed to evaluate water quality, but suffer of limited ecosystem ecological value. The recent development of functional approaches may allow to evaluate other aspects of ecosystem quality, and to develop new trait-based indicators responding to different environmental conditions. Here, our aim was to analyze the response of phytoplankton traits to numerous environmental variables and to identify relevant traits for the development of future indicator metrics. We used a French national database of 469 lakes, consisting in phytoplankton biovolumes and physicochemical values. The response of 84 morpho-functional traits towards environmental variables was tested with Machine Learning models, taking into account lake typology.
   We identified 21 traits significantly related to environmental variables. Dissolved Organic Carbon, Nitrates and Total Suspend Solids were the physiochemical parameters which had the higher influence on our traits selection. However the response of phytoplanktonic traits to environmental variables did not change according to lake typology, advocating for a consistent response at the whole national scale contrary to the classical taxonomic approach. We finally identified several candidate traits that could be used for the development of new metrics for French lakes in a context of bio-assessment programs.

AB  - The use of chemicals around the globe in different industries has increased tremendously, affecting the health of people. The modern world intends to replace these noxious chemicals with environmental friendly products for the betterment of life on the planet. Establishing enzymatic processes in spite of chemical processes has been a prime objective of scientists. Various enzymes, specifically microbial proteases, are the most essentially used in different corporate sectors, such as textile, detergent, leather, feed, waste, and others. Proteases with respect to physiological and commercial roles hold a pivotal position. As they are performing synthetic and degradative functions, proteases are found ubiquitously, such as in plants, animals, and microbes. Among different producers of proteases, Bacillus sp. are mostly commercially exploited microbes for proteases. Proteases are successfully considered as an alternative to chemicals and an eco-friendly indicator for nature or the surroundings. The evolutionary relationship among acidic, neutral, and alkaline proteases has been analyzed based on their protein sequences, but there remains a lack of information that regulates the diversity in their specificity. Researchers are looking for microbial proteases as they can tolerate harsh conditions, ways to prevent autoproteolytic activity, stability in optimum pH, and substrate specificity. The current review focuses on the comparison among different proteases and the current problems faced during production and application at the industrial level. Deciphering these issues would enable us to promote microbial proteases economically and commercially around the world.

AB  - From 1999-2005, seventy-eight samples were collected from the small streams in the area of the Boubin Mountain including also the natural preserve "Boub nsky prales" (Boub n primeval forest) (Sumava Mts, Czech Republic). Nineteen species of thecamoebians were identified in the samples; the most abundant species were Centropyxis orbicularis, Pontigulasia compressa, Centropyxis aculeata, Difflugia oblonga and Centropyxis arcula. Species composition of assemblages as well as ecological affinities of the most common taxa are comparable with data from the previously analysed streams in the Sumava Mts. This correlation improves the quality of data for environmental preferences of thecamoebian assemblages contained in the streams and these can be used for interpretation of ancient environments. Though species composition of assemblages changes gradually, two end-member assemblages can be defined. For both assemblages, environmental conditions were defined: Lower-diversity assemblages dominated by centropyxids originated mainly from standing water with low content of organic debris. Relative abundances of C. orbicularis showed negative correlations with abundances of other Centropyxis spp. which may indicate different ecological affinities of this species. Centropyxis orbicularis may tolerate higher levels of. ne organic debris in stream sediments. Assemblages with common to abundant occurrences of P. compressa and/or D. oblonga prefer running water. Difflugia oblonga dominated in samples with higher content of. ne organic debris. Relation between test size of D. oblonga and flow rate was recorded: large D. oblonga prevailed in standing water while small specimens dominated in fast streams.

AB  - The environmental problem of the antifouling agent tri-n-butyltin (TBT) was recognized during the 1980's and the use of TBT on pleasure crafts was banned in several countries. Marine periphyton were established in a flow-through aquaria system under TBT stress. Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) was quantified, in a short-term test for inhibition of photosynthesis, and compared to effects on biomass and community structure. Community structure was measured by diatom species richness, Jaccard similarity index, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and evaluated by linear regression and multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques. The aim was to (1) determine a no effect level for marine periphyton communities under ecologically realistic conditions (2) validate PICT against other longterm effect indicators (3) confirm, with a controlled experiment, the TBT effect thresholds indicated by PICT studies in the field. We found that TBT alone indeed was able to cause the same kind of effects on periphyton that earlier have been detected in periphyton from contaminated ecosystems and that the effects occur at concentrations in water higher than 0.5 nM TBT. The agreement between TBT effects in field and in the microcosm system implies that the system is sufficiently realistic in yielding ecologically relevant information. Effect indicators such as periphyton photosynthesis and net production were found to be less sensitive than PICT and community structure.

AB  - Corsican marine aquaculture is one of the highest contributors of fish production in France, which may result in environmental perturbations caused by organic matter (OM) accumulation under fish farms and impacting natural communities. This study aimed to (1) characterise the environmental conditions at two different fish farms, (2) monitor the response of benthic foraminiferal species to this activity, and (3) assess the accuracy of existing foraminiferal biotic indices. In 2017, sea floor sediment was sampled in transects from two Corsican fish farms for living foraminiferal and sedimentary analyses. Four indices were calculated and compared: exp(H '(bc)), Foram-AMBI, Foram Stress Index and TSI-Med. A significant increase in total organic carbon (TOC) has been shown, mainly below the fish cages. Communities were characterized by a shift from high density, opportunistic and tolerant species under the cages to lower densities and more sensitive species further away. According to their distribution patterns along the TOC gradient, we propose to update the ecological group classification of seven species to improve Foram-AMBI's accuracy and sensitivity: Triloculina oblonga and Quinqueloculina lamarckiana to Ecological Group (EG) I; Rosalina bradyi to EGIII; and Bolivina dilatata, Bulimina aculeata and Quinqueloculina stalkeri to EGIV. We recommend prioritising the use of TSI-Med and Foram-AMBI with the updated list to assess ecological quality in coastal waters of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Decentralised wastewater management (DWM) systems are deployed in areas where the topography does not allow for gravity flow to a centralised system, or requires a complex and expensive pumping station network. Also, DWM systems are often the only option in rural areas where there are no sewage transport networks. This paper aims at addressing the question of the degree to which DWM systems can be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. First, the environmental sustainability is investigated to identify environmental hotspots in two (nature-based and engineered) onsite DWM systems. Second, DWM scenarios are compared against centralised wastewater management (CWM) scenarios using a whole-systems approach. Finally the boundary conditions under which a given DWM scenario performs better than a CWM scenario are discussed. Results show CWM scenarios were less sustainable than DWM scenarios on the resources endpoint due to their sewer infrastructures, however CWM scenarios performed better than DWM scenarios on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well-managed air emissions and discharges. While on human health no clear conclusion could be drawn. Finally, for relatively few households (subject of the study in rural areas) CWM scenarios did not score superior performances compared to DWM scenarios on all three endpoint indicators. Yet for a greater number of households it was impossible to decide in favour of decentralisation because of a lack of favourable consensus on all three endpoint indicators.

AB  - The traditional models of tourism development generate strong negative effects on the areas, causing degradation. No form of tourism has escaped this, because in all of them natural resources are used as raw material. The objective of this study was to calculate the tourist load capacity of the environmental dimension as an indicator for planning sustainable tourism on the Kuata trail, Nova Esperanca Community, Sao Marcos Indigenous Land, Pacaraima - Roraima. The approach was of a quantitative, bibliographic and field nature, once the authorization of the community was obtained, the carrying capacity of the tourist in the leisure area and surroundings was determined through the application of the Cifuentes methodology that defines the tourist carrying capacity considering three levels to be calculated: physical load capacity (CCF); real load capacity (CCR); effective or permissible load capacity (CCE), which establish the maximum number of visits that a protected wild area can receive according to its physical, biological and handling conditions at the time of the study. The results obtained showed that the management capacity reached a value of 38.88%, evidencing the need to implement infrastructure, both physical and human resources, to possibly develop EcoTourism in a safe way and the minimum of comfort for visitors, with the objective of valuing tourism products, encouraging both the return and the arrival of new visitors, guaranteeing a flow of people who manage to secure the fundraising for the community and for the surrounding populations.

AB  - The long-term trends and seasonal patterns of stream water chemical composition in a small remote forested karst catchment, were investigated from 1978 to 2018. Calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonates, the dominant ions, increased over the period together with temperature, while sulfates decreased. Carbonate and sulfate mineral dissolution was the main source of these elements. These trends and the seasonal opposite patterns of discharge vs. temperature, calcite saturation index vs. pCO(2) and bicarbonate vs. sulfates, suggested the influence of discharge, of reduced long-range atmospheric pollution, and of increasing air temperature on biological activity and carbonate dissolution. Furthermore, the hydrological regime controlled the seasonal stream water chemical composition and fluxes by: (i) a dilution during the high discharge period, (ii) a change in the contribution rate of the waters draining different lithological areas in the catchment, e.g., the increased sulfates to bicarbonates ratio during summer low flows, with a maximum alkalinity decrease of 24%, and (iii) a "piston" and a "flushing" effects of dissolved elements stored in soils and epikarst with the first autumn heavy rains. Long-term stream water hydrochemical surveys of karst system have proved to be powerful indicators of biogeochemical processes, water sources and pathways under variable natural and anthropogenic environmental pressure conditions.

AB  - While Ecosystem Services (ES) are crucial for sustaining human wellbeing, urban development can threaten their sustainable supply. Following recent EU directives, many countries in Europe are implementing laws and regulations to protect and improve ES at local and regional levels. However, urban planning regulations already consider mandatory compensation for the loss of nature, and this compensation is often restricted to replacing green with green in other locations. This situation might lead to the loss of ES in areas subject to urban development, a loss that would eventually be replaced elsewhere. Therefore, ES assessments should be included in urban planning to improve the environmental conditions of urban landscapes where development takes place. Using an actual planning and development example that involves a proposed road to a restructured former industrial area in Bochum, Germany, we developed an ad-hoc assessment to compare a standard environmental compensation approach applying ES. We evaluated the impact of the planned construction alternatives with both approaches. In a second step, we selected the alternative with a lower impact and estimated the ES losses from the compensation measures. Our findings show that an ES assessment provides a solid basis for the selection of development alternatives, the identification of compensation areas, and the estimation of compensation amounts, with the benefit of improving the environmental quality of the affected areas. Our method was effective in strengthening urban planning, using ES science in the assessment and evaluation of urban development alternatives.

AB  - The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has been a major factor in land transitions out of intensive row-crop management on marginally productive lands in the central United States. While CRP can protect these more environmentally sensitive lands against erosion and potential nutrient loss, information on how CRP affects soil quality over time is limited. Using a chronosequence with 0-40 yr of CRP conversion history, we evaluated soil quality under different land use intensities (CRP, pasture, row crop) using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF). Effects of slope classes (higher [14-25%] and lower [2-14%]) and soil depth (0-120 cm) were also evaluated. Our results show that the soils were functioning at 84 and 78% of their theoretical capacity under CRP and row crop, respectively. Conversion to CRP enhanced overall soil quality by increasing soil biological, physical, and chemical attributes, but soil nutrient availability decreased due to the absence of fertilizer application. Increasing soil organic C (SOC) enhanced overall soil quality because of its impact on soil biological, physical, chemical, and nutrient conditions. Conversion to CRP will likely have greater benefits for more environmentally sensitive soils (i.e., higher slope) as demonstrated by structural equation modeling. Land use effects were also depth dependent, with more prominent effects within the 0-to-5-cm than the 5-to-15-cm depth increment. Overall, our methods focused on key soil quality indicators, confirmed ecological benefits of CRP conversion, and provided guidance for improved and simplified land management recommendations.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape disturbances, including industrial development, can have significant impacts on wildlife populations. In Canada, federal, territorial, and provincial laws require major industrial development projects to submit detailed environmental impact assessments (EIA) reports as part of the project application process. These assessments are meant to establish baseline habitat conditions and predict which landscape components will be altered by the project and to what degree. Based on these changes, indirect predictions for wildlife impacts are made using a variety of models, which can vary in validation adequacy and often rely heavily on expert opinion. In the oil sands region of Canada, wildlife species and habitat types used to make predictions are not comprehensive nor standardized between EIAs, despite a high degree of landscape similarity between projects. We extracted habitat model parameters, projected impacts, and anticipated mitigation effectiveness from 30 project EIAs. Despite all these projects occurring in the same natural region, we found very little agreement in the species used to assess wildlife impacts as well as the parameters used to model impacts on those species. Relative to unvalidated habitat models, we found that models receiving independent validation required half the habitat amount for proponents to conclude that the project will have an adverse effect. Our analyses have exposed many areas where policy could improve the efficiency of the EIA process as well as the scientific rigour underlying regulatory decisions.

AB  - The Songnen grasslands were traditionally thought to be dominated by Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae plants as early as the late Pleistocene. However, increasing evidence has called that interpretation into question. To shed new light on the paleovegetation evolution of the arid and semi-arid steppe in North China, phytolith assemblages preserved in the region's sand-paleosol sequence (section Daike) are used as a proxy for paleovegetation structure. Results show that both the sand and paleosol layers in the Songnen grassland sections contain well-preserved phytoliths attributed to different families of grass. This is the first direct evidence of the nature of the vegetation that existed during the sandy layer episodes. Moreover, the phytolith evidence represented in the samples indicates that plant successions happened within the subfamilies of Poaceae through the time. Referring to phytoliths in modern plants and topsoils, and using statistical analyses, we propose that phytolith assemblages in the section Daike originated from Poaceae-dominant communities rather than an Artemisia-Chenopodiaceae ecosystem. The phytoliths, and evidence from the historical and modern pollen-vegetation relationships, lead to rejection of the hypothesis of a past widespread Artemisia-Chenopodiaceae ecosystem in the Songnen grasslands. Using published radiocarbon and thermoluminescence data, it is proposed that the present Poaceae-dominated grasslands developed as early as the early Holocene. This study also highlights the usefulness of phytolith analysis in paleovegetation reconstruction in arid and semi-arid lands.

AB  - In areas with a long history of urbanization and agriculture, ecological properties of lakes can be substantially altered by anthropogenic eutrophication. We used a paleolimnological approach to identify how anthropogenic change affected a hard-water lake ecosystem during the last 200 years. Using sedimentary pigments, green algal remains, pollen analyses and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb)), we assessed the dynamics of paleo-indicators of eutrophication in Lake Verevi (southern Estonia) and compared these with historical evidence and limnological surveys. The study site was also selected to quantify the impact of a documented change in water level on sedimentary pigment preservation (via changes in oxygen and light availability) and green algal remains (whose abundance is higher in the littoral zone). In addition, the ratio of chlorophyll a to pheophytin a provided valuable information on sedimentation conditions, and thus, helped interpret the variation in sedimentary pigments concentrations. All indicators showed a synchronous ecological response to an increasingly pronounced anthropogenic impact. Furthermore, our results showed that the first sign of eutrophication was present as early as the 19th century, as indicated by a sharp rise in green algae (Pediastrum), more positive (delta C-13(carb) values, and a pronounced increase in phytoplankton pigment concentrations. Pollen data showed that these changes coincided with land clearance and the start of agricultural activities. The delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb) data were strongly correlated and enriched isotopic content coincided with the eutrophication signal.

AB  - During the development of a genetically modified (GM) crop product, extensive phenotypic and agronomic data are collected to characterize the plant in comparison to a conventional control with a similar genetic background. The data are evaluated for potential differences resulting from the genetic modification process or the GM trait, and the differences-if any-are subsequently considered in the context of contributing to the pest potential of the GM crop. Ultimately, these study results and those of other studies are used in an ecological risk assessment of the GM crop. In the studies reported here, seed germination, vegetative and reproductive growth, and pollen morphology of Roundup Ready 2 Yield(A (R)) soybean, MON 89788, were compared to those of A3244, a conventional control soybean variety with the same genetic background. Any statistically significant differences were considered in the context of the genetic variation known to occur in soybean and were evaluated as indicators of an effect of the genetic modification process and assessed for impact on plant pest (weed) characteristics and adverse ecological impact (ecological risk). The results of these studies revealed no effects attributable to the genetic modification process or to the GM trait in the plant that would result in increased pest potential or adverse ecological impact of MON 89788 compared with A3244. These results and the associated risk assessments obtained from diverse geographic and environmental conditions in the United States and Argentina can be used by regulators in other countries to inform various assessments of ecological risk.

AB  - Regime shifts have been observed in marine ecosystems around the globe. These phenomena can result in dramatic changes in the provision of ecosystem services to coastal communities. Accounting for regime shifts in management clearly requires integrative, ecosystem-based management (EBM) approaches. EBM has emerged as an accepted paradigm for ocean management worldwide, yet, despite the rapid and intense development of EBM theory, implementation has languished, and many implemented or proposed EBM schemes largely ignore the special characteristics of regime shifts. Here, we first explore key aspects of regime shifts that are of critical importance to EBM, and then suggest how regime shifts can be better incorporated into EBM using the concept of integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA). An IEA uses approaches that determine the likelihood that ecological or socio-economic properties of systems will move beyond or return to acceptable bounds as defined by resource managers and policy makers. We suggest an approach for implementing IEAs for cases of regime shifts where the objectives are either avoiding an undesired state or returning to a desired condition. We discuss the suitability and short-comings of methods summarizing the status of ecosystem components, screening and prioritizing potential risks, and evaluating alternative management strategies. IEAs are evolving as an EBM approach that can address regime shifts; however, advances in statistical, analytical and simulation modelling are needed before IEAs can robustly inform tactical management in systems characterized by regime shifts.

AB  - Impact of Cr3+ pollution on soil microbial quantity, enzyme activity and biological activity in purple paddy soil were studied under incubation conditions. The results showed that amounts of all tested microbes and enzyme activities in soil were inhibited by low Cr3+ concentration (200mg/kg). After 7-day incubation, sulfate-reducing activity, methanogen activity, denitrifying activity and anaerobic nitrogen-fixing activity in soil were reduced by 34%, 66%, 98% and 65% respectively. Amounts of soil microbes were remarkably inhibited with medium Cr3+ concentration (400mg/kg), all with reduction of more than 50%; and all tested soil biological activity was almost recovered in the fourth week except soil denitrifying activity. Activities of urease, invertase, neutral phosphatase and catalase were decreased by 60%, 21%, 59% and 42%, respectively. With high Cr3+ concentration (1600mg/kg), amounts and activities of tested microbes had only about 1% of that with control. As calculated from the regression equation, the ED50 (ecological dose) values of activities of soil urease, invertase and catalase were around 800mg/kg; the ED50 values of soil sulfate-reducing activity, methanogen activity and anaerobic nitrogen-fixing activity were also around 800mg/kg with an exception of soil denitrifying activity which ranged 35 to 39 mg/kg. According to the Standards of National Soil Environmental Quality in China and their sensitivities to 400mg/kg Cr3+ concentration, quantity of denitrifying bacteria, urease activity and denitrifying activity could be selected as indicators of early warning for Cr3+ pollution in purple paddy soil.

AB  - Water temperature is a primary factor affecting the number and kinds of species in a stream. A key step towards including water temperatures in environmental flow assessments is to develop metrics which describe natural variability in a river's thermal regime. This is best achieved using time series analyses, where metrics are defined based either on time series disaggregation, or shapes of regimes defined using agglomerative techniques. The aim of this paper was to refine approaches in setting environmental water temperature guidelines for inclusion in defining environmental flows assessments. Annual water temperature series from 82 sites sampled across 48 rivers (mainstems and tributaries) in ten catchments in the southern Cape region of South Africa were described using 39 metrics based on the magnitude, frequency, duration and timing of thermal events. Sites were classified into thermal groups using their similarity in multivariate temperature regime and variation amongst groups along important temperature gradients examined. Deviation from a natural range of variability using a thermal confidence envelope is a suitable approach for broad evaluation of thermal guidelines. The approach presented can be applied at multiple levels of complexity to assess which elements of a thermal time series fall outside of reference conditions. Further steps in this approach are to link thermal patterns to biotic metrics, and gain a clearer understanding of interactions between flows, temperatures and biota, particularly below impoundments. Research on improving approaches in defining thermal regions is recommended. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study deals with the application of macrozoobenthos-based biotic indices (BI) within the frame of the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive. More precisely, this study aimed at assessing the performance of five recently developed methodologies (BI) for the assessment of ecological quality status (EcoQ) in two semi-enclosed, sheltered coastal ecosystems and in one transitional water body situated along the Western French coast, namely Marennes-Oleron Bay, Arcachon Bay, and the Seine Estuary. This study showed that these five indices rarely agreed with each other, describing very different pictures of the overall EcoQ of the three study sites. This work also clearly underlined the limitations of these approaches, notably the dependency of most of these BI and the resulting EcoQ classifications on habitat characteristics, more particularly to natural levels of sediment silt-clay content and the location of stations in the subtidal or the intertidal. The implication of our observations concerning the use of these BI for implementation of the WFD is discussed in terms of definition of habitat-specific reference conditions and necessity to adjust thresholds to the particular habitat occurring in semi-enclosed ecosystems. Meanwhile, the unmodified use of these BI severely impaired accurate assessment of EcoQ and decision-making on the managers' point of view. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bird counting inevitably suffers from imperfect detection, which varies across species, habitats, period of the day, and seasons. Although various modeling techniques have recently been developed to account for this phenomenon, the biological basis of natural variation in detection remains insufficiently known. This study examined the bird species' detection rate throughout the day, considering their body mass and diet type, concerning the environment and weather characteristics. Species detection rates were significantly affected by the number of individuals of that species but were unrelated to body mass. Overall, species with the highest detection rate were Corn bunting, Blackbird, European robin, House sparrow and Common chiffchaff. Granivores-insectivores and insectivores showed significant differences in detection rates throughout the day among habitats, with higher detection rates in grasslands during the afternoon. Insectivores showed higher detection rates in farmland during midday (warmest time of the day). Granivores, omnivores and scavengers did not show changes in detection rates in different day periods. Such patterns in daily detection rates were significant even when considering abundance and total species richness in each community. Finally, cloudiness was unrelated to the overall detection rate of birds, while temperature and wind affected detection rates in some guilds. Our findings provide some advice for choosing a suitable ornithological sampling method by considering the avian communities composition in combination with the type of environment, the diet of bird species, and the period of the day.

AB  - Phototrophic microorganisms are the dominant populations in microbial mats, which play an important role in stabilizing sediments, such as happens in the Ebro Delta. These microorganisms are exposed to low metal concentrations over a long period of time. Distinct methods have been used to evaluate their toxic effect on the preservation of these ecosystems. Nevertheless, most of these techniques are difficult to apply in isolated phototrophs because (i) they usually form consortia with heterotrophic bacteria, (ii) are difficult to obtain in axenic cultures, and (iii) do not grow on solid media.In this study, and for the first time, a combination of fast, non-invasive, and in vivo Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) techniques were applied in a consortium of Scenedesmus sp. DE2009 to analyze its physiological state and viability under metal stress conditions. Microalga was more resistant to Pb followed by Cr and Cu. However, in multimetal combinations, the presence of Cu negatively affected microalga growth. Additionally, the inhibitory concentration (IC) values were also calculated by CLSM pigment analysis. The result determines a higher degree of toxicity for Cu and Cr in comparison to Pb. The high sensitivity of these CLSM-methods to detect low concentrations allows consideration of Scenedesmus sp. DE2009 as a good bioindicator of metal pollution in natural environments.

AB  - The Scolytinae is highly diversified in tropical forests, but richness and abundance patterns within most Ecuadorian forest habitat types are not yet characterized. In this study, we assessed patterns of variation in Scolytinae richness, abundance, and species composition in a primary and a secondary natural forest, and a commercial balsa plantation in Ecuador. We conducted a 1-yr survey of Scolytinae communities with baited traps and measured associated environmental variables. In total, 18,169 Scolytinae individuals were captured and comprised 85 species, 16 genera, and six tribes. In the natural forests, main indicator species were Xylosandrus morigerus, Xyleborus affinis, Xyleborus sp.02, and Corthylus sp.01, whereas all species of Hypothenemus were indicator species in the balsa plantation. The exotic Premnobius cavipennis (Ipini), Xylosandrus compactus, and Xylosandrus morigerus were indicator species for the natural forests. We provide evidence that commercial balsa plantations provide abundant favorable resources for native and exotic scolytines in Ecuador, and that scolytine communities in natural forest and in plantations are more likely to differ in their species composition than in their cumulated species richness. In all habitats, species composition, abundance, and species richness showed temporal patterns of variation that coincided with seasonal variations in climatic conditions, with highest records during the coldest and driest months in the primary forest and the balsa plantation. We provide new knowledge on the native Ecuadorian scolytine fauna and a foundation for the monitoring for potential scolytine pest species of natural and planted tropical forest ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal vegetation communities are important for primary production, biodiversity, coastal protection, carbon and nutrient cycling which, in combination with their sensitivity to eutrophication, render them potential indicators of environmental status for environmental policies like the EU Water and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. We evaluated one potential indicator for coastal vegetation, the cumulative cover at depths where the vegetation is light limited, by investigating its response to eutrophication along gradients in natural conditions. We used a large data set covering the Swedish coastline, spanning broad gradients in nutrient level, water clarity, sea-bed substrate, physical exposure and climate in addition to a salinity gradient from 0.5 to 30.5. Macroalgal cover increased significantly along gradients of declining nutrient concentration and increasing water clarity when we had accounted for diver effects, spatio-temporal sampling variability, salinity gradients, wave exposure and latitude. The developed empirical model explained 79% of the variation in algal cover across 130 areas. Based on this, we identified macroalgal cover as a promising indicator across the Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak. A parallel analysis of soft-substrate macrophytes similarly identified significant increases in cover with decreasing concentrations of total nitrogen and increasing salinity, but the resulting empirical model explained only 52% of the variation in cover, probably due to the spatially more variable nature of soft-substrate vegetation. The identified general responses of vegetation cover to gradients of eutrophication across wide ranges in environmental settings may be useful for monitoring and management of marine vegetation in areas with strong environmental gradients.

AB  - With the increase in coastal hazards induced by global change, estuarine deltas are urgently required to enhance nature-based coastal defenses. This study sets an example at the Nanhui nearshore salt marshes in the Yangtze Estuary, China, with a one-dimension wave attenuation empirical model and Landscape Resistance Index (LRI). We explored wave attenuation by salt marshes at site and transect scale, and put forward potential approaches to improve coastal defenses. Results showed that 1) the two 10 m-wide stripes of typical vegetation (Spartina alterniflora and Scirpus mariqueter) could attenuate wave height mostly when incident wave height was 0.22 m and 0.20 m, respectively; 2) under the condition of 0.6 m initial wave height, wave attenuation rate among all transects ranged from 32.50% to 98.30% (71.30 +/- 16.09% on average); and 3) Land cover-Position-Length weighted LRI was an effective indicator for the relationship between wave attenuation and landscape pattern. Wave attenuation by salt marshes differ in various environments and are species specific. Wave attenuation along transects was also affected by both land cover and spatial configuration. Thus, we proposed some salt marsh restoration strategies, such as preferential restoration of long transects, differentiation of vegetation configuration, and engineering protections like low levees or breakwaters in front of salt marsh edges. These findings could be used to promote ecological functions in the Yangtze Estuary and other coastal marshes in the world.

AB  - In the Mediterranean region, islands are among the most important tourist destinations, being sites of considerable naturalistic, historical and cultural importance. This is highly beneficial for local economies, but may also represent a threat for the environment, especially during the peak season (i.e. summer). Indeed, the sharp demographic increase concentrated in a relatively short period may negatively affect the quality of coastal marine systems and the provision of ecosystem services, producing in turn negative feedbacks on tourism industry. Nevertheless, the assessment of the environmental impact of tourism on coastal seawater has been seldom addressed. Here, we show the results of the biomonitoring approach adopted in the tourist Island of Rhodes (Greece), in the context of the Interreg Med BLUEISLANDS project. The study involved short-term macroalgae transplantation and incubation, and, through the analysis of nitrogen stable isotopes, provided a time-integrated picture of the occurrence of anthropogenic nutrients, which are indicators of water quality and might be missed by routine water quality monitoring programs. Main findings ruled out a marked input of anthropogenic nutrients potentially threatening the functioning of coastal ecosystems and highlighted overall good environmental conditions. In addition, this approach provided spatial data useful to produce GIS maps, useful tools that may help the decisional process of policy-makers, for adopting management practices to mitigate the environmental impact and foster sustainable tourism.

AB  - Even though empirical data supporting sound ecoregion-specific ecotoxicological evaluations are still scarce, the differences of environmental (including climatic) conditions in specific ecoregions are already currently being regulated for environmental risk assessment of pesticides in Europe. To shed new light on the ecotoxicological effects of pesticides on aquatic communities across ecoregions, the model pollutant pyrimethanil (fungicide) was tested in an outdoor mesocosm study with macrophyte-dominated communities in the European "South" (Portugal) and "Centre" (Germany) regulatory zones. Phytoplankton indicators monitored over 12 months indicated a low risk of the fungicide (0.73 or 0.77 mg pyrimethanil L-1, single application) to phytoplankton functioning; as expected since exposure simulated worst-case scenarios. However, the growth of key structural macroalgae and macrophytes was affected by the fungicide and negative effects occurred, especially in the Central zone experiment. Such effects were not detected earlier than approximately nine months post single pyrimethanil application. The presence or absence of such extremely long-lasting/delayed pyrimethanil effects depended on species, competitive situation, and ecoregion-specific physico-chemical environment. The present findings suggest that a better understanding of both direct and indirect effects of fungicide pollution on aquatic flora in two European ecoregions helps to consolidate the environmental risk assessment of pesticides in specific regulatory zones.

AB  - Coral reef restoration initiatives are burgeoning in response to the need for novel management strategies to address dramatic global declines in coral cover. However, coral restoration programs typically lack rigor and critical evaluation of their effectiveness. A review of 83 peer-reviewed papers that used coral transplantation for reef restoration reveals that growth and survival of coral fragments were the most widely used indicators of restoration success, with 88% of studies using these two indicators either solely (55%) or in combination with a limited number of other ecological factors (33%). In 53% of studies, reef condition was monitored for 1 year or less, while only 5% of reefs were monitored for more than 5 years post-transplantation. These results highlight that coral reef restoration science has focused primarily on short-term experiments to evaluate the feasibility of techniques for ecological restoration and the initial establishment phase post-transplantation, rather than on longer-term outcomes for coral reef communities. Here, we outline 10 socioecological indicators that comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of coral reef restoration across the four pillars of sustainability (i.e. environmental, sociocultural, governance, and economic contributions to sustainable communities). We recommend that evaluations of the effectiveness of coral restoration programs integrate ecological indicators with sociocultural, economic, and governance considerations. Assessing the efficacy of coral restoration as a tool to support reef resilience will help to guide future efforts and ensure the sustainable maintenance of reef ecosystem goods and services.

AB  - Soils from some Latin American countries support the highest biodiversity levels on the planet and simultaneously have some of the most serious environmental impacts attributed to both historical and current agricultural practices and industrial activities. Soil contamination has resulted from intensive use of pesticides, extensive mining and other industrial activities, and uncontrolled management of waste within inappropriate regulatory frameworks. The present study presents an overview of the scientific research on soil ecotoxicology conducted in Latin America, summarizing the recent advances and highlighting the needs for further refinements in this research field. Most of the contributions to the scientific literature have been from Brazil. The most investigated issue is the ecotoxicity of pesticides and earthworms, which were the organisms most frequently used as test species. Needs identified by Latin American researchers include methods and procedures for: 1) identifying and collecting natural soils to be used as reference testsubstrates in tests, 2) identifying and discerning the range of sensitivities of native test species to soil contaminants, 3) developing environmental guidelines applicable to tropical/ subtropical conditions, and 4) developing methods and procedures for higher tier testing for full development and implementation of environmental risk assessment schemes. The protection of Latin American soils, including provision of goods and services, is currently framed in legislation and other regulations, but implementation requires significant improvement and additional training programs.

AB  - One of the main goals of ecology is to understand how the abiotic environment influences the biotic characteristics of the ecosystem. Various processes at multiple scales interact to affect the physical and chemical environments that are experienced by organisms, which ultimately influence community composition. We aimed to understand the processes that control benthic algae community composition within a watershed. We investigated the impact of both land cover and physiochemical variables on benthic algal community composition. We sampled benthic algae along with multiple habitat and water chemistry parameters within three microhabitats across eight sites along the mainstem of the Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma. We used the benthic light availability model to assess the amount of light reaching the bottom of the stream. Additionally, we conducted a GIS analysis of the watershed to determine the land cover affecting each of these sites. Several of the in-stream site-scale variables that were measured (e.g., conductivity, pH and canopy cover) were strongly correlated with both position within the watershed and percent agriculture within the watershed. The physiochemical parameters that were correlated with watershed position and land cover were then used to understand the linkage with algae community composition. Algae genera composition was strongly correlated with both light reaching the bottom of the stream and conductivity. Our results suggest a hierarchy of factors that determine species composition and show the dependence of community composition on differing light regimes.

AB  - The United Nations response mechanism to environmental emergencies requested a tool to support disaster assessment and coordination actions by United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams. The tool should support on-site decision making when substantial chemical emissions affect human health directly or via the environment and should be suitable for prioritizing impact reduction management options under challenging conditions worldwide. To answer this need, the Flash Environmental Assessment Tool (FEAT) was developed and the scientific and practical underpinning and application of this tool are described in this paper. FEAT consists of a printed decision framework and lookup tables, generated by combining the scientific data on chemicals, exposure pathways and vulnerabilities with the pragmatic needs of emergency field teams. Application of the tool yields information that can help prioritize impact reduction measures. The first years of use illustrated the usefulness of the tool as well as suggesting additional uses and improvements. An additional use is application of the back-office tool (Hazard Identification Tool, HIT), the results of which aid decision-making by the authorities of affected countries and the preparation of field teams for on-site deployment. Another extra use is in disaster pro action and prevention. In this case, the application of the tool supports safe land-use planning and improved technical design of chemical facilities. UNDAC teams are trained to use the tool after large-scale sudden onset natural disasters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - On February 27, 2010, the world's sixth strongest earthquake on record (8.8 M (w)) and tsunami hit central Chile. We assess the response of the epibenthic macrofaunal community following this event in Coliumo Bay, one of the areas most affected by this mega-perturbation. The indicators of aggregate and compositional variability show that 3 years after this event, the community appears to have undergone the following dynamics: (1) At an inter-annual timescale, the community (both in density and biomass) shifted through different structures with apparent directionality; (2) Oceanographic and biological seasonality had a strong cyclical influence on the inter-annual community response; (3) There was spatial homogenization of the community over time (i.e., recovery of diversity), probably promoted by the ecological functionality of scavenger species (i.e., crab Cancer coronatus and snail Nassarius spp.) and by the proportional increase in non-dominant species; (4) Bathymetry and bottom dissolved oxygen also played significant roles in the spatial structure of this community; (5) Three years after the perturbation, total density and total community biomass were still considerably below those described under unperturbed conditions, mainly associated with the decrease in density and biomass of dominant species. Therefore, in spite of this apparent community compositional recovery, the aggregate variability currently remains below the levels reported prior to the effect of the mega-earthquake and tsunami. These results provide evidence that supports both the Cross-Scale Resilience Hypothesis and the Response Diversity Hypothesis.

AB  - Ecology may benefit from long term, large scale experiments on low intensity farming to test theoretical principles and convert them into practical lessons, One century of land conversion in the Argentine pampas, and its effect on critical ecological properties, were analysed and discussed. Land transformation has resulted in significant changes of land use, land cover, energy flow, nutrient dynamics, hydrology, and the trade-offs between productivity, stability and sustainability. The analytical procedure involved the complementary utilisation of different data sources and approaches. The study was focused on large geographical scales: the entire pampas and its five ecoregions. Results were interpreted under the theoretical framework of succession in ecology. The historical conversion of natural grasslands into cultivated grasslands and croplands was not homogeneous, determining a variety of land use and land cover patterns. Due to its higher productivity, much more energy, nutrients and water were mobilised in the rolling pampas than in the other ecoregions. This study provides lessons about how the energy flow, the nutrient dynamics and the hydrological process are modified by land transformation under low external-input conditions. Technical coefficients to be applied in emerging fields of environment administration such as ecological-monitoring, environmental accounting and auditing, agro-ecological certification, land evaluation and allocation, and land management, can also be supplied by this kind of studies.

AB  - Similarly to other Mediterranean regions, Italy is expected to experience dramatic climatic changes in the coming decades. Do to their poikilohydric nature, lichens are among the most sensitive organisms to climate change and species requiring temperate-humid conditions may rapidly decline in Italy, such in the case of the epiphytic Lobaria species that are confined to humid forests. Our study, based on ecological niche modelling of occurrence data of three Lobaria species, revealed that in the next decades climate change will impact their distribution range across Italy, predicting a steep gradient of increasing range loss across time slices. Lobaria species are therefore facing a high extinction risk associated with reduction of their range. The current patterns indicate that only L. pulmonaria still has a continuous distribution across Italy, with potential contact between Apennine and Alpine populations. This situation is consistent with the wider climatic niche of this species, still offering a major opportunity for its successful long-term conservation. Results (a) support the inclusion of the three Lobaria species in European conservation policies, such as the Habitat Directive, and (b) warn against an over-estimation of the indicator power of single flagship species to establish conservation priorities for lichens, indicating that even lichens with peculiar and similar climatic envelopes may fail to co-occur within a given forest stand. A multiple indicator approach could provide more useful tools for a community-based conservation strategy for epiphytes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic diatoms have been widely used as indicators of water quality in streams. New insights that diatoms may also respond to large-scale drivers, such as climate or historical factors, highlight the need to reassess the usefulness and the reliability of diatoms as bioindicators. Using a suite of modelling techniques, weighted averaging (WA), weighted averaging partial least squares, modern-analogue technique (MAT) and two machine learning techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forests (RF), we calibrated models to infer water quality and climatic variables using diatom abundance data collected from 227 stream sites in Finland. Predictive ability was generally better for climatic variables [growing degree days (GDD) defined as temperature >5 degrees C, summer precipitation and water balance] than for local environmental variables (conductivity, water colour and total phosphorus). The strongest relationships were found for GDD (r(2)=0.86, MAT) and conductivity (r(2)=0.82, RF). Using BRT, we also identified potential indicator species for local environmental and climatic variables, based on relative importance species in the models. Our results show that diatoms could serve as efficient proxies for climatic variables and local environmental conditions. Furthermore, new modelling techniques such as modern regression trees can provide new insights into relationships between diatom assemblages and local water quality and climate, and thus help to construct more reliable indices. These methods could also serve as important tools to infer environmental variables in changing ecosystems.

AB  - Population models, in particular individual-based models (IBMs), are becoming increasingly important in chemical risk assessment. They can be used to assess recovery of spatially structured populations after chemical exposure that varies in time and space. The authors used an IBM coupled to a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model, the threshold damage model (TDM), to assess recovery times for 4 aquatic organisms, after insecticide application, in a nonseasonal environment and in 3 spatial settings (pond, stream, and ditch). The species had different life histories (e. g., voltinism, reproductive capacity, mobility). Exposure was derived from a pesticide fate model, following standard European Union scenarios. The results of the IBM-TDM were compared with results from simpler models: one in which exposure was linked to effects by means of concentration-effect relationships (IBM-CE) and one in which the IBM was replaced by a nonspatial, logistic growth model (logistic). For the first, exposure was based on peak concentrations only; for the second, exposure was spatially averaged as well. By using comparisons between models of different complexity and species with different life histories, the authors obtained an understanding of the role spatial processes play in recovery and the conditions under which the full time-varying exposure needs to be considered. The logistic model, which is amenable to an analytic approach, provided additional insights into the sensitivity of recovery times to density dependence and spatial dimensions. (C) 2014 SETAC

AB  - We present a psychophysiological study of facial expressions of happiness (FEH) produced by advertisements using the FaceReader system (Noldus, 2013) for automatic analysis of facial expressions of basic emotions (FEBE; Ekman, 1972). FaceReader scores were associated with self-reports of the advertisement's effectiveness. Building on work describing the role of emotions in marketing research, we examined the relationship between the patterns of the FEBE and the perceived amusement of the advertisements, attitude toward the advertisement (AAD) and attitude toward the brand (AB). Differences were observed between FEH scores in response to high-, medium-, and low-amusing video advertisements (AVAs). Positive correlations were found between FEH and AAD and FEH and AB in high-and medium-but not in low-AVAs. As hypothesized, other basic emotions (sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust) did not predict advertisement amusement or advertisements' effectiveness. FaceReader enabled a detailed analysis of more than 120,000 frames of video-recordings contributing to an identification of global patterns of facial reactions to amusing persuasive stimuli. For amusing commercials, context-specific FEH features were found to be the major indicators of advertisement effectiveness. The study used video-recordings of participants in their natural environments obtained through a crowd-sourcing platform. The naturalistic design of the study strengthened its ecological validity and demonstrated the robustness of the software algorithms even under austere conditions. Our findings provide first evidence for the applicability of FaceReader methodology in the basic consumer science research.

AB  - Background: Disturbances by avalanches have created unique habitats for animals and plants in subalpine ecosystems worldwide, but at the same time avalanches can pose a major threat to humans. Thus, avalanches are suppressed by means of avalanche barriers to protect settlements and infrastructures in populated areas of the European Alps. As a consequence, the disturbance regime in avalanche tracks has fundamentally changed.
   Methods: In the present study we address ecological consequences of avalanche suppression on plant diversity. We analysed plant diversity and species composition in recent and old avalanche tracks with and without avalanche suppression and in undisturbed adjacent forests at high and low elevations.
   Results: The number of species was higher in both active and inactive avalanche tracks as compared to undisturbed subalpine forest. The species composition indicated a wider range of ecological niches in active than in inactive avalanche tracks. The vegetation from active tracks showed lower indicator values for temperature and nitrogen availability. The proportion of alpine species was lower in formerly active tracks.
   Conclusions: The conditions that exist in active avalanche tracks increase plant diversity in relation to undisturbed forest. In the few decades following avalanche suppression, species composition changes in tracks from which avalanches have been excluded. Continued suppression of avalanche disturbance may lead to a decline in plant and habitat diversity. Avalanche disturbance can exert an important influence on the biodiversity of subalpine forests and provide important habitats. Anthropogenic changes in the natural regime of avalanche disturbance are likely to contribute significantly to future landscape changes in subalpine forests.

AB  - European Greenway developments typically 'upcycle' disused transport corridors for multi-use, non-motorised public infrastructure. The linear and relatively undisturbed nature of these disused infrastructures means many currently function as high quality ecological corridors. Corridors providing connectivity among habitat patches can mitigate the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, allowing species dispersal throughout the landscape matrix. The sustainable integration of Greenway infrastructure and ecological corridor functions requires consideration during design, development and maintenance stages, taking into account surrounding landscape composition and connectivity. This paper presents a method to characterise a proposed Greenway corridor landscape, focusing on habitat composition and ecosystems connectivity. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) was used to comprehensively describe the structural connectivity of linear and spatial habitats occurring within the study area. A subsequent multivariate classification of structural connectivity and habitat data determined six distinctive landscape characters. Interpretation of these landscape characters highlights the principal habitat compositions and connectivity conditions in terms of habitat core, links and potential linkages. For example one landscape was intensified, yet retained high woodland connectivity, while another diverse habitat landscape supported little connectivity for woodland and grasslands. The results of this study suggest significant opportunities exist to enhance European landscape connectivity through informed Greenway development. Crucial habitat linkages can be optimised along Greenway infrastructure, contributing towards the realisation of European Greenways as Green Infrastructure and true sustainable projects.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution in sediment is one of the most serious problems in water bodies, including rivers, which can cause secondary pollution when environmental conditions change. In this study, surface sediment samples collected from the four main tributaries of Dongting Lake (i.e., Xiangjiang River (XR), Zishui River (ZR), Yuanjiang River (YR), and Lishui River (LR)) were analyzed for concentrations of Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb. The spatial distribution, source, and potential ecological risk of these metals were determined. The results suggest a great spatial heterogeneity of heavy metals in the sediment of the studied rivers. Heavy metals had highest concentrations in the sediment of XR, especially midstream and downstream. A principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis indicated that Cd and As were mainly from industrial wastewater and mineral mining, Cr came from natural process and agricultural activities, and Zn and Cu potentially from both. Pb was originated from atmospheric deposition and river inflow transportation. According to the geo-accumulation index (I-geo), enrichment factor (EF), and risk index (RI) assessment, heavy metals pollution was highest in the sediment of XR, and Cd was the main pollutant in the sediment of XR, presenting considerable potential ecological risk. This may contribute to heavy metal pollution in Dongting Lake. This paper provides a reference for the aquatic environmental management of heavy metals in Dongting Lake area and its tributaries.

AB  - There are global calls for new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approaches. Scientific support for EBFM includes assessing ecosystem indicators of biological communities, environmental conditions, and human activities. As part of a broader research project we have synthesized a suite of traditional and new indicators for the Grand Bank in Atlantic Canada, which we share here. This is an ideal ecosystem for indicator analysis because it experienced dramatic changes over the past three decades, including a collapse in fish biomass that had profound socio-economic consequences. We exploit the wealth of data for this ecosystem to investigate how individual indicators reflect observed changes in the ecosystem, and then illustrate two applications of this indicator suite. Correlations were used to show that relationships among the fish functional groups changed after the collapse, and that a subset of indicators is sufficient to characterize each ecosystem category. Lagged correlations highlighted how changes in the drivers and pressures are often not immediately manifest in the fish community structure. We also organized indicators into the DPSIR (driver-pressure-state-impact-response) management framework.

AB  - When birds are exposed to oil, their ability to thermoregulate is impaired as a result of damage to the insulative properties of their feathers. If an oiled bird is unable to maintain thermal homeostasis, hypothermia and death can follow rapidly. Physiological responses to oiling depend on several variables including environmental conditions (e.g., ambient air and water temperatures), life history of bird species (e.g., body size and habitat selection), and foraging strategies (e.g., divers, surface feeders, shorebirds). The most widely used approach to assess the effect of spilled oil on birds is the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Type A Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Model for Coastal and Marine Environments. This approach addresses body size and time spent in a hypothetical slick but lacks the flexibility to assess other variables related to physiological response. We developed a dynamic physiologically based oiling model (PBOM) for birds to address this need. The PBOM has been validated against empirical data from a dose-response study in which common eiders were exposed to Statfjord A crude oil. The PBOM can be used to predict time to hypothermia for birds of differing body size and habitat preferences, in environments ranging from Arctic to subtropical. The model presently includes 5 representative bird species: common eider, spotted sandpiper, great blue heron, dovekie, and American white pelican, but could be adapted to represent almost any bird.

AB  - The effects of the global climate change on oceans and coastal areas are manifested in many ways. In coastal environments, the climate change influence on coastal ecosystems is particularly worrisome, affecting their configuration and restricting the ecosystem services they produce and their benefits to nature and society. This possible loss of ecosystem services translates well the significance of the "environmental risk" that climate change can cause. An assessment of the environmental risk generated by climate threats in coastal ecosystems was carried out through a South American case study developed on the Southern coast of Brazil - Estuary of Patos Lagoon. The study involved the implementation of a model that estimates the risk of losing ecosystem services used by different stakeholder groups as a function of (1) the climate threat, (2) the value of the service defined by the stakeholder perception, and (3) the vulnerability of each group in relation to a possible service loss. Based on information generated by scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and from a significant database collected from interviews of several service users, the model was able to generate levels of risks for different conditions. The calculated risk values, standardized to values between zero and one, allow numerous possibilities of evaluation for ecosystems, user groups and climate variability indicators. Moreover, the model appears as a tool capable of generating comparative risk levels and can help to establish environmental management policies related to the climatic effects and the necessary adaptations.

AB  - The scarcity of water can result in a direct conflict between the protection of aquatic resources and water use. For many agencies, environmental flow (EF) methods are essential in environmental impact assessments and in the protection of important fisheries resources. The objective of this paper is to compare selected hydrological and hydraulic methods and determine the scientifically acceptable and cost-effective way to environmental flow within a section of a mountain river with high naturalness, on the example of the Wisloka. In this paper, environmental flow was calculated using conventional hydrological methods: Tennant's, Tessman's, flow duration curve and hydraulic methods, wetted perimeter method (WPM) and method based directly on ichthyofauna habitat requirements (spawn and migration). The novelty is the combined use of the hydraulic and hydrological methods which relates to flow hydraulics based directly on ichthyofauna habitat conditions. The hydraulic methods provide lower values of environmental flow in comparison with the hydrological methods. The key issue in the use of the hydraulic methods is the choice of criteria. The development of the required set of parameters while taking into account their seasonal nature shifts the method toward habitat modeling methods. However, the scope of habitat requirements of ecosystems must be defined, including the set of aquatic organisms and watercourse type before a hydraulic method may be widely used. Being generally low-cost and simple, the methods presented in this paper can be applied in the water management legislative process.

AB  - Knowledge of past environmental and climatic conditions of lake ecosystems on Chiloe Island on a millennial scale is limited. Hence, this study fills a gap in our understanding of this part of southern Chile. The aim of this study was to reconstruct the environmental and climatic history of the last 1000 years of Lake Pastahue through a multi-proxy sediment core analysis. The 1-m-long core was subsampled every centimeter for the organic matter, magnetic susceptibility, grain-size distribution, and biological indicator (pollen, chironomids) analyses. The age model was constructed from Pb-210, Cs-137, and C-14 activity. Pollen results revealed a North Patagonian forest composition represented by Nothofagus, Weinmannia, Drimys, Tepualia, Myrtaceae, Poaceae, and Pteridophyta. The abundance of Rumex and Pinus in the most recent part of the pollen assemblage reflects a clear anthropogenic impact. The sedimentological parameters and chironomid assemblage show similar variations, which highlight changes in the trophic state of the lake. The changes observed in all proxies suggest the influence of climate events such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA) and Little Ice Age' (LIA). The variations observed since the beginning of the 20th century could be the result of the combined effect of anthropogenic activities and the increase in temperature recorded in south-central Chile and Patagonia.

AB  - Marine spatial planning temporally and spatially allocates marine resources to different users. The ecosystem approach aims at optimising the social and economic benefits people derive from marine resources while preserving the ecosystem's health. Marine ecosystem services are defined as the benefits people obtain from marine ecosystems. The aim of this study is to determine which interrelations between marine ecosystem services and the marine energy industry can be identified for use in transnational marine spatial planning exemplified in the North Sea region. As the North Sea is one of the busiest seas worldwide, the risk of impairing the ecosystems through anthropogenic pressures is high. Drawing on a literature-based review, 23 marine ecosystem services provided by the North Sea region were defined and linked to seven offshore energy fields comprising oil and natural gas, wind, tides and currents, waves, salinity gradients, algal biomass, and geothermal heat. The interactions were divided into four categories: dependence, impact, bidirectional, or no interaction. Oil and natural gas, as well as algae biomass, are the fields with the most relations with marine ecosystem services while waves and salinity gradients exhibit the least. Some marine ecosystem services (Conditions for Infrastructure, Regulation of Water Flows, and Cognitive Development) are needed for all fields; Recreation and Tourism, Aesthetic and Cultural Perceptions and Traditions, Cognitive Development, and Sea Scape are impacted by all fields. The results of this research provide an improved basis for an ecosystem approach in transnational marine spatial planning.

AB  - Twin births are often construed as a natural experiment in the social and natural sciences on the premise that the occurrence of twins is quasi-random. We present population-level evidence that challenges this premise. Using individual data for 17 million births in 72 countries, we demonstrate that indicators of mother's health, health-related behaviors, and the prenatal environment are systematically positively associated with twin birth. The associations are sizable, evident in richer and poorer countries-evident even among women who do not use in vitro fertilization-and hold for numerous different measures of health. We discuss potential mechanisms, showing evidence that favors selective miscarriage.

AB  - Understanding the natural history of a disease is an important prerequisite for designing studies that assess the impact of interventions, both chemotherapeutic and environmental, on the initiation and expression of the condition. Identification of biomarkers that mark disease progression may provide important indicators for drug targets and surrogate outcomes for clinical trials. However, collecting and visualizing data on natural history is challenging, in part, because disease processes are complex and evolve in different chronological periods for different subjects. Various epidemiological designs are used to elucidate components of the natural history process. We briefly discuss statistical issues, limitations, and challenges associated with various epidemiological designs.

AB  - The first prograding bioclastic bodies of the Messinian carbonate platform from Melilla-Nador (Morocco) contain numerous feeding tubes of Vermetidae (Petaloconchus) shells. This accumulation results from dense littoral settlements of vermetids, sometimes preserved in place in the higher part of the system, having produced during their life several tubes in a short duration, probably under repeated stressing environmental conditions. The progradation of the system allows, under constant sea level, the continuity of the process. This original construction-cutting-accumulation phenomenon could be related to the fluctuations of the palaeoproductivity characterizing this period.

Vegetation ordination axes were correlated with environmental variables deduced to have influenced plant species composition. Soil type proved to be the most significant variable, followed by bush density and canopy cover. Herbaceous species most responsive to the discerned gradients were selected as key ecological species using multiple regression analysis. These species are useful indicators of habitat type and range condition.

AB  - Context Several initiatives seek to increase the pace and scale of dry forest restoration and fuels reduction to enhance forest resilience to wildfire and other stressors while improving the quality and reliability of key ecosystem services. Ecological effects models are increasingly used to prioritize these efforts at the landscape-scale based on simulated treatment outcomes. Objectives Treatments are often simulated using uniform post-treatment target conditions or proportional changes to baseline forest structure variables, but do not account for the common objective of restoration to mimic the complex forest structure that was present historically which is thought to provide an example of structural conditions that contributed to ecosystem diversity and resilience. Methods We simulate spatially homogenous fire hazard reduction treatments along with heterogeneous restoration treatments in dry conifer forests to investigate how spatial complexity affects ecological indicators of (1) forest structural heterogeneity, (2) forest and watershed vulnerability to high-severity fire, and (3) feasibility of future prescribed fire use. Results Our results suggest that spatially explicit restoration treatments should produce similar wildfire and prescribed fire outcomes as homogeneous fuels reduction treatments, but with greater forest structural heterogeneity. The lack of strong tradeoffs between ecological objectives suggests the primary benefit of spatially complex treatments is to increase forest structural heterogeneity which may promote biodiversity. Conclusions We show that landscape-scale prioritization to maximize ecological benefits can change when spatially complex restoration treatments are modeled. Coupling landscape-scale management simulations and ecological effects models offers flexible decision support for conservation assessment, prioritization, and planning.

AB  - Benthic algae communities dominate the primary production in littoral zone of shallow lake. To understand the long-term effect of alteration in the composition of benthic algae community assemblage in such as a lake in China, we analyzed the benthic algae developments and indicators in the Donghu Lake in Wuhan, central China in 2004 and 2014. We compared the benthic algae biomass, compositions, and species richness of aquatic macrophytes and the changes of primary physicochemical parameters. The results show that in the 10-year period, chl a and conductivity declined significantly but nutrient level of the whole lake remained largely stable. The benthic algae biomass doubled and the relative proportion of green algae increased, whereas the benthic diatom ratio decreased. The benthic diatom assemblages and taxa differed in a number of ways, showing more epiphytic diatom species, and the relative abundance and species richness changed markedly. The number of aquatic macrophyte species increased from 3 in 2004 to 15 in 2014, presenting a remarkable recovery from previous eutrophication conditions. The changes of water level, chl a, and conductivity played a crucial role in governing aquatic macrophytes re-colonization in the littoral zones in the period. The ecological characteristics of littoral benthic diatoms reflect habitat coupling as indicated by redundancy analysis. Therefore, the close link between benthic algae and macrophyte recovery demonstrates that the benthic algae metrics are much more useful than nutrient levels to quantify the process of restoration in the lake.

AB  - A total 190 experiments were performed to study the dissipation kinetics of monochloramine (NH2Cl, CAS no 10599-90-3) in surface water samples from six rivers (Loire, Rhone, Meuse, Garonne, Seine and Moselle) and an artificial reservoir (Mirgenbach), all located in France. Experiments were conducted in an open reactor, under relevant controlled environmental conditions. The impact of various parameters such as initial NH2Cl concentration, temperature, pH, presence of sediments, sampling site and collection period was investigated. It was found that NH2Cl dissipated rapidly without any lag phase, and that decay follows an apparent first-order kinetics (r(2) > 0.99). Presence of sediment greatly accelerated decay. Half-lives were generally <1 h in river water in presence of natural sediment, but of several hours without sediment. The impact of pH was low for the normal river water pH range. However, increase in temperature significantly accelerated decay. The combination of high initial NH2Cl concentrations and elevated temperatures generally gives half-lives similar to those obtained at lower temperatures and lower concentrations. Short half-lives (0.06 to 1.50 h) were found in all the surface waters examined, regardless of geographic location of sampling site or collection period, indicating no temporal or site-specific effects on NH2Cl dissipation. Decay was slightly faster at lower initial concentrations, which supports extrapolation of half-lives measured in this study to a wide range of environmental concentrations. It can thus be assumed that NH2Cl degradation in river and reservoir waters is mainly determined by presence of sediments and temperature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization has led to changes in urban morphology and climate, while urban open space has become an important ecological factor for evaluating the performance of urban development. This study presents an optimization approach using computational performance simulation. With a genetic algorithm using the Grasshopper tool, this study analyzed the layout and configuration of urban open space and its impact on the urban micro-climate under summer and winter conditions. The outdoor mean Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was applied as the performance indicator for evaluating the quality of the urban micro-climate. Two casesone testbed and one real urban block in Nanjing, Chinawere used to validate the computer-aided simulation process. The optimization results in the testbed showed UTCI values varied from 36.5 to 37.3 degrees C in summer and from -4.9 to -1.9 degrees C in winter. In the case of the real urban block, optimization results show, for summer, although the average UTCI value increased by 0.6 degrees C, the average air velocity increased by 0.2 m/s; while in winter, the average UTCI value increased by 1.7 degrees C and the average air velocity decreased by 0.2 m/s. These results demonstrate that the proposed computer-aided optimization process can improve the thermal comfort conditions of open space in urban blocks. Finally, this study discusses strategies and guidelines for the layout design of urban open space to improve urban environment comfort.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance reservoirs within food-producing animals are thought to be a risk to animal and human health. This study describes the minimum natural resistome of pig faeces as the bacteria are under no direct antibiotic selective pressure. The faecal resistome of 257 different genes comprised 56 core and 201 accessory resistance genes. The genes present at the highest relative abundances across all samples were tetW, tetQ, tet44, tet37, tet40, mefA, aadE, ant(9)-1, ermB and cfxA2. This study characterized the baseline resistome, the microbiome composition and the metabolic components described by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in healthy pig faeces, without antibiotic selective pressures. The microbiome hierarchical analysis resulted in a cluster tree with a highly similar pattern to that of the accessory resistome cluster tree. Functional capacity profiling identified genes associated with horizontal gene transfer. We identified a statistically significant positive correlation between the total antibiotic resistome and suggested indicator genes, which agree with using these genes as indicators of the total resistomes. The correlation between total resistome and total microbiome in this study was positive and statistically significant. Therefore, the microbiome composition influenced the resistome composition. This study identified a core and accessory resistome present in a cohort of healthy pigs, in the same conditions without antibiotics. It highlights the presence of antibiotic resistance in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure and the variability between animals even under the same housing, food and living conditions. Antibiotic resistance will remain in the healthy pig gut even when antibiotics are not used. Therefore, the risk of antibiotic resistance transfer from animal faeces to human pathogens or the environment will remain in the absence of antibiotics.

AB  - Recent declines in coastal water quality in SW Ireland have led to changes in the abundance of algal-associated bryozoans and a hydroid. These common North Atlantic species offer considerable potential as indicator species for reduced oxygen conditions due to habitat degradation. Annual monitoring for more than two decades (1994-2016) at 10 rocky shore sites within Lough Hyne Marine Reserve, SW Ireland revealed a significant reduction in abundance of the ctenostome bryozoan, Flustrellidra hispida, through time, coincident with the development of daily, extreme, shallow water oxygen fluctuations (hyperoxia and hypoxia) due to eutrophication. In contrast, the ctenostome, Alcyonidiwn species-complex, increased significantly during the two decade period. The thecate hydroid, Dynamena pumila, did not show any significant decadal-scale pattern but temporal variability in abundance increased since 2010. Abundances of F. hispida and D. pumila were positively correlated with estimates of water flow. F. hispida inhabited a variety of algal hosts but appeared most sensitive (of the taxa surveyed) to variation in habitat quality, especially experimentally reduced levels of dissolved oxygen (< 4 mg L-1). Such sensitivity indicates F. hispida could be useful as an indicator of environmental change, whereas D. pumila was more robust in response to reduced oxygen with 38.6% of the hydroid zooids being able to survive under hypoxic conditions as compared to only 0.2% of the bryozoan zooids. Given the widespread European distribution of these species, they offer the opportunity to act as important bioindicators of water quality and hence environmental degradation in north temperate intertidal systems.

AB  - The application of traditional analyses and methods in breeding-genetic researches is necessary to be combined with the study of the ecological-genetic model for organization of the quantitative trait revealing a new perspective in the plant breeding. The present study was conducted during the period 2015-2016 at the Institute of Forage Crops (Pleven) with 23 white lupine cultivars with different origin. The issue of breeding identification of the best white lupine cultivars from the available collection in their phenotype was examined. A rationale of the principle "background trait" was represented with purpose for effective breeding activity. Characteristic of the possibility of using the mean values of plant seed weight and crude protein content in seeds in the selection of parental forms for the needs of the combinative breeding was made.
   The developed method of orthogonal regressions to identify phenotype by genotype has characterized BGR 6305, Tel Keram and Pflugs Ultra as cultivars having "strong" genetic systems regarding attraction and adaptability of seed productivity and crude protein content of the seeds.
   The assessment of ecological stability showed that the cultivars Tel Keram, Bezimenii 2, Pflugs Ultra and Solnechnii were stable, highly productive and suitable for growing in a wide range of environmental conditions. Cultivars BGR 6305, Tel Keram, Pflugs Ultra, Horizont and Solnechnii exhibited stability of their genetic systems under changing the environmental conditions and can be used as donors in regard to attraction and adaptiveness to develop hybrid forms with high seed productivity and crude protein content in the seeds.

AB  - This study investigated factors affecting transplantation success of native forest understory vegetation on metal-contaminated soils. One year after transplantation along a gradient of historical Cu-Ni smelter pollution in Sudbury, Canada, community-level characteristics of the transplanted plots and short-term indicators expressing the performance of selected species were assessed. Thirty 16-m(2) plots were studied, each established with 45 transplanted 0.56x0.64-m turfs 10 cm thick, extracted from mixed-hardwood forests slated for development. Species richness, diversity, and evenness were not affected by environmental conditions but short-term responses of root growth and sexual reproduction of selected species to environmental variables indicate a need for long-term monitoring. Root growth of Clintonia borealis (Aiton) Raf. and Gaultheria procumbens L. was positively related to soil temperature. Root growth of G. procumbens correlated negatively with soil Ni availability, but in all plots, root growth was comparable with the literature values from unaffected forests. Flowering frequency of G. procumbens correlated negatively with soil pH and positively with tree cover, corresponding to ecological requirements of this species. Soil SO4-2 had a negative effect on sexual reproduction of C. borealis. Unexpectedly, fruiting of C. borealis responded positively to Ni, and fruiting of Maianthemum canadense Desf. positively to As, possibly due to interdependencies among soil variables. The results are encouraging with respect to transplant success, as effects of smelter-related variables were relatively minor, but species-specific responses of the selected species to environmental factors indicate that species performance is dependent on site-specific conditions, potentially influencing long-term success of the transplants.

AB  - Leaf litter breakdown is a fundamental process in aquatic ecosystems that is realized by microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores. Although this process may be adversely affected by fungicides, among other factors, no test design exists to assess combined effects on such decomposer-detritivore systems. Hence, the present study assessed effects of the model fungicide tebuconazole (65 mg/L) on the conditioning of leaf material (by characterizing the associated microbial community) as well as the combined effects (i.e., direct toxicity and food quality-related effects (=indirect)) on the energy processing of the leaf-shredding amphipod Gammarus fossarum using a five-week semistatic test design. Gammarids exposed to tebuconazole produced significantly less feces (similar to 20%), which in turn significantly increased their assimilation (similar to 30%). Moreover, a significantly reduced lipid content (similar to 20%) indicated lower physiological fitness. The conditioning process was altered as well, which was indicated by a significantly reduced fungal biomass (similar to 40%) and sporulation (similar to 30%) associated with the leaf material. These results suggest that tebuconazole affects both components of the investigated decomposer-detritivore system. However, adverse effects on the level of detritivores cannot be explicitly attributed to direct or indirect pathways. Nevertheless, as the endpoints assessed are directly related to leaf litter breakdown and associated energy transfer processes, the protectiveness of environmental risk assessment for this ecosystem function may be more realistically assessed in future studies by using this or comparable test designs.

AB  - We develop indicators showing the relative environmental burdens that human activities place on locales for a given level of economic benefits. The main purpose is to develop tools that allow us to examine the potential vulnerabilities within economies to changes in resource conditions. The indicators of pollution emission or resource consumption per job can be used to identify potential challenges to resource and industry managers and to compare areas in terms of their ability to adapt to change. For example, if a large number of area jobs are dependent on abundant water, this indicates a vulnerability to a reduction in water availability for industrial use. We develop a case study for 23 counties and 1 city in Maryland to examine the usefulness and limitations of the indicators. Our case study demonstrates that the indicators provide an informative view into patterns of local economic activity and use of an area's environmental goods and services. In contrast to patterns for total environmental burdens (e.g., total SO2 emissions) that are typically reported, the rates of environmental burden per job are not simply correlated with high or low economic output. Thus, the indicators represent distinct patterns of environmental burdens per job that reflect reliance on environmental services. The indicators have some limitations when used at this fine scale because they can misrepresent conditions in counties in which economic sectors are dominated by one or a few businesses. For this reason, the indicators are best used as a regional screening tool.

AB  - Mytilus edulis were collected intertidally from three locations in Halifax Harbor, Nova Scotia, on five occasions during spring and summer 2000. Bioindicators of health (lipid content), condition and gonad indices (CI and GI), and sex ratio, as well as vitellins, were compared with the bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), coprostanol, and metals. Twice as many male as female mussels were collected from a downtown site (M8) close to numerous raw sewage effluents and a naval dockyard. Males from M8 had a high lipid content, and females had a delayed production of vitellins. These mussels also displayed the highest levels of PACs, coprostanol, Ag, and Sn. Coprostanol and silver are sewage markers in sediments, and their presence in mussels confirms exposure to sewage effluents. Female mussels were more abundant in an area outside the industrialized part of the harbor that had higher marine traffic (M14); displayed higher levels of vitellins in gonads; had similar time trends for Cl and GI; and had some similar metals compared with mussels from M8. The lowest variability in biomarkers was observed at a site in a mostly residential arm of the harbor (M12), which was expected to be more pristine based on an earlier investigation. Compared to mussels in M14, the mussels of M12 had the lowest condition indices and PCB concentrations and low but similar levels of lipids, PACs, and coprostanol. They also displayed the highest concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ph, and Hg, and females had the highest gonad indices early in the season.

AB  - Environmental and genetic factors increasingly, stress natural populations, and conservationists need simple tools to measure the effect of these stresses before populations become irreversibly, affected. The inability of an organism to withstand random perturbations during its development-so-called developmental instability-has been proposed as a potential early, indicator of stress. To act as a true earl), warning system, however, stress-mediated changes in developmental instability, should be manifest in the phenotype before major changes occur in more direct components of fitness. We tested this hypothesis by, estimating the survival Probabilities of 260 Taita Thrushes (Turdus helleri) inhabiting three differentially, disturbed forest fragments (little, moderately,, and highly, deteriorated) and relating these to individual estimates of tarsus asymmetry, (a measure of developmental instability,), two other putative indices of expected fitness (size and body, condition), and a coefficient of inbreeding. Tarsus symmetry, but not survival, was lower in the moderately disturbed population than in the least disturbed one, whereas both symmetry, and survival were lower in the most disturbed population. Thus, higher levels of habitat disturbance were reflected by, increased population levels of asymmetry before a decrease in survival became apparent. In contrast, none of the other variables showed a significant response to habitat disturbance. At the individual level, asymmetric thrushes showed lower probabilities of survival than more symmetric ones, and the magnitude of the relationship increased with habitat disturbance. Birds in better condition (i.e., higher residual body, mass) survived better, irrespective of the quality, of the habitat. The key,finding that stress-mediated increase influctuating asymmetry may, precede decrease in survival suggests that single-trait asymmetry can serve as an early warning system in conservation.

AB  - The role of ciliated protozoa in the root zone method of wastewater treatment was assessed by analyzing ciliate community structure in four experimental subsurface flow wetlands (planted or unplanted in either soil or gravel) and estimating Escherichia coli removal due to ciliate predation. A total of 22 different ciliate taxa were isolated from the four reed beds. The first third of each bed contained a higher abundance and diversity than the final third of the bed. There was a qualitative correlation between physicochemical conditions and ciliate community structure: microaerophilic species dominated the organic-rich and oxygen-poor environment of the unplanted soil bed; aerobic and facultative bacterivorous species dominated the better oxygenated gravel beds; a combination of these two communities was found in the planted soil bed. The average grazing rates of ciliates was around 5 times higher in the planted gravel bed (49 bacteria/ciliate/hour) than in the unplanted soil bed (9.5 bacteria/ciliate/hour). Taking into account the retention time and ciliate abundance, it was calculated that ciliates, by their predatory activities, are capable of removing up to 2.35 x 10(5) and 0.45 x 10(5) E. roll in the first third of the planted gravel bed and unplanted soil bed, respectively. These results are discussed in relation to variations in E. coli removal kinetics. The potential for using ciliate communities as indicators of conditions within constructed wetlands is also assessed. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate) and malathion (diethyl mercaptosuccinate, S-ester with O, O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate) are insecticides used to control grasshopper infestations on rangeland. Insecticides used to control grasshopper infestations pose a hazard to aquatic organisms because although no-spray buffer zones are observed around aquatic habitats, pesticide may be deposited by drift or mobilized from upland areas by runoff. A number of processes may affect the fate of carbaryl and malathion in the aquatic environment, but no method is available for estimating degradation over the range of conditions that occur in the field. We used results of published studies in meta-analyses to estimate degradation models that predict half-life of carbaryl and malathion in freshwater over temperature and pH ranges relevant to western grasshopper-management programs. Estimated degradation models were:
   ln (half-life carbaryl) = 24.3 - 2.36(pH) - 0.0788(t)
   and
   ln (half-life malathion) = 5.98 + 2.84(pH) - 0.326(pH(2)) - 0.202(t) + 0.000135(t(2))
   where half-life has units of hours, and temperature (t) has units degrees C. Both models accounted for a significant amount of total variation (P<0.0001) and had r(2) > 0.97. Accuracy of these degradation models was evaluated by comparing predicted degradation of carbaryl and malathion to field and laboratory data. We suggest that use of these degradation models be restricted to conditions where water has 7 less than or equal to pH less than or equal to 10 for carbaryl, and 7 less than or equal to pH less than or equal to 8.2 for malathion.

AB  - We report on experiments featuring horizontally (HH) and vertically (VV) polarized X-band marine radar sea scatter imagery in the coastal environments of Bermuda and La Jolla, under light to moderate winds and the absence of long gravity waves. These conditions allowed the study of fundamental scattering mechanisms from small scale roughness and short waves of a few meters wavelength or less, shorter than the radar pulse. While a large fraction of radar data collected revealed the presence of slick bands, we analyze here the radar echo of ambient background outside of the slicks. Sea scatter data were digitally recorded for 360 degrees azimuthal coverage for grazing angles between 1-3.5 degrees, and were converted to normalized radar cross section (NRCS or sigma(o)) images. The HH and VV polarizations show quite different spatial texture, with HH exhibiting a discrete character and VV being more nearly spatially homogeneous. Grazing angle dependencies are different for HH and VV: upwind-downwind differences of mean NRCS show ratios of just 4-6 dB for VV, but are equal or greater than the 16-dB noise-imposed limit for HH for the low wind conditions. HH NRCS grazing angle characteristics are shown tb correlate with biological activity indicators of the coastal waters, with a fourth power dependence in relatively unproductive waters, to a nearly quadratic in productive waters. Arguments are presented that suggest different scattering mechanisms for the two polarizations: evenly distributed Bragg scatter patches for VV and scatter from small asymmetric bore features for HH. A multipath illumination model for small bore features is outlined, and scale sizes for the small scale breakers inferred from the experimental results presented here are between 2 and 4 cm in height, with crest widths between 24 and 48 cm.

AB  - Populations of mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) and longnose sucker (Calostomus catostomus) exposed to bleached-kraft mill effluent (BKME) in the Wapiti/Smoky river system in northwestern Alberta were compared to similar populations in a reference river system (the upper North Saskatchewan River). Fish species distribution and relative abundance patterns were linked to natural events such as floods and low flows, and to habitat quality. There was no evidence that fish were avoiding the effluent plume area; relative abundance was often highest near the effluent discharge due to use of this area for overwintering and rearing. Radiotelemetry and recapture studies indicated that fish movements could be both rapid and extensive, occurring during spawning periods and at other times of the year. Thus, exposure could not be assumed to be related to capture location alone; separate exposure measures were necessary. Populations of exposed mountain whitefish and longnose sucker were growing and reproducing successfully. Higher condition factors in ''posed longnose suckers and greater mesenteric fat stores in exposed individuals of both species were not accompanied by any apparent disruption in allocation of energy to reproduction or growth. The age structure of the populations showed that there had been no losses of age classes through reproductive or recruitment failures, and growth curves were indistinguishable from reference curves. There were no correlations between indicators of exposure and population-level effects. Important natural phenomena, including a one-hundred-year flood and natural upstream/downstream habitat gradients, affected species distribution and were correlated with some population parameters such as condition factors and relative gonad size.

AB  - Diatom assemblages are used widely as indicators of environmental conditions. They have been particularly useful in the assessment of some acute environmental problems such as water acidification, eutrophication and salinisation. High mountain lakes arc currently a research focus as sentinels of global change, predominantly of long-distance atmospheric pollution and climate warming. The diatom assemblages in these lakes are extremely rich, and the sediment record provides short and long historical perspectives of the changes. We investigated the relative sensitivity of diatoms to the main environmental gradients found in mountain lakes and evaluated the strength and uncertainties for predicting simultaneously several environmental variables associated with these gradients based on a survey 01 83 lakes in the Pyrenees. Variables related to the ionic composition and acid-base balance (calcium, acid neutralizing capacity, magnesium, sodium, and sulphates), trophic conditions (total phosphorus* and dissolved organic carbon) and physical factors (water temperature*, irradiance at the lake bottom*, and macrophyte cover) explained independently the variation in the diatom assemblages. However, the assemblage predictive capacity of these variables-tested by developing transfer functions (Weighted Averaging-Partial Least Squares) was only acceptable for a subset of the variables (*). The spatial autocorrelation of the environmental variables had no influence on the performance of the transfer functions except for water temperature, which is highly dependent on altitude. Our results indicate that diatom assemblages have great potential for assessments of multiple environmental variables in mountain lakes and, consequently, in applications of global change surveillance.

AB  - A laboratory approach was adopted in this study to explore the potential of Cl-37-CSIA in combination with C-13-CSIA and Biological Molecular Tools (BMTs) to estimate the occurrence of monochloroenzene (MCB) aerobic biodegradation. A new analytical method for Cl-37-CSIA of MCB was developed in this study. This methodology using a GC-IRMS allowed to determine delta Cl-37 values within an internal error of +/- 0.3%. Samples from a heavily MCB contaminated site were collected and MCB aerobic biodegradation microcosms with indigenous cultures in natural and enhanced conditions were set up. The microcosms data show a negligible fractionation for C-13 associated to MCB mass decrease of >95% over the incubation time. Conversely, an enrichment factor of -0.6 +/- 0.1% was estimated for Cl-37, which is a reflection of a secondary isotope effect. Moreover, the dual isotope approach showed a pattern for aerobic degradation which differ from the theoretical trend for reductive dehalogenation. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) results showed a significant increase in todC gene copy number with respect to its initial levels for both natural attenuation and biostimulated microcosms, suggesting its involvement in the MCB aerobic degradation, whereas phe gene copy number increased only in the biostimulated ones. Indeed, Cl-37 fractionation in combination with the dual carbon chlorine isotope approach and the todC gene copy number represent valuable indicators for a qualitative assessment of MCB aerobic biodegradation in the field.

AB  - Many ecosystems have experienced anthropogenically induced changes in biodiversity, yet predicting these patterns has been difficult. Recently, individual behavioural and physiological measures have been proposed as more rapid links between environmental variation and fitness compared to demographics. Glucocorticoid hormones have received much attention given that they mediate energetic demands, metabolism, and foraging behaviour. However, it is currently unclear whether glucocorticoids can reliably predict environmental and fitness-related traits and whether they may be useful in specific groups of taxa. In particular, seabirds are a well-studied avian group often employed as biomonitoring tools for environmental change given their wide distribution and reliance on large oceanic patterns. Despite the increase in studies attempting to link variation in baseline corticosterone (the primary avian glucocorticoid) to variation in fitness-related traits in seabirds, there has been no comprehensive review of the relationship in this taxon. We present a phylogenetically controlled systematic review and meta-analysis of correlative and experimental studies examining baseline corticosterone as a predictor of fitness-related traits relevant to predicting seabird population health. Our results suggest that, while variation in baseline corticosterone may be a useful predictor of larger-scale environmental traits such as overall food availability and fitness-related traits such as reproductive success, this hormone may not be sensitive enough to detect variation in body condition, foraging effort, and breeding effort. Overall, our results support recent work suggesting that the use of baseline glucocorticoids as conservation biomarkers is complex and highly context dependent, and we suggest caution in their use and interpretation as simplified, direct biomarkers of fitness.

AB  - This paper presents the results of multi-proxy palaeo-ecological research (luminescence and radiocarbon dating, grain size measurement, loss-on-ignition, pollen, microcharcoal and plant macrofossil analysis), with the aim of reconstructing palaeo-environmental conditions and the impact of prehistoric people on the vegetation in Ljubljana (central Slovenia). The results of luminescence dating and pollen analysis suggest that the Late Copper Age (ca. 2500 cal. BC) archaeological settlement at Spica, which is located on the embankment of the Ljubljanica River, was built directly on silty sediment, which was deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 20 ka). Late glacial and early/middle Holocene sediment, which is missing, was presumably removed by fluvial processes. Therefore, only environmental conditions in the late prehistory after ca. 2500 cal. BC were reconstructed. The results of palynological research suggest that mixed forests with beech, fir, oak, and hornbeam were growing near the Spica settlement. Human impact on the environment was moderate, with weak traces of agricultural activities. After the abandonment of the settlement, the traces of human impact on the environment became more apparent, especially in the Iron Age, when the pollen of plants growing on (abandoned) fields and ruderal ground (cereals, goosefoot, mugwort) and grazing indicators (ribwort plantain) increases. Fir, which is sensitive to grazing and fire, declines. A major clearance of beech forest is dated in the Early Roman Age, most probably in mid-1st century BC (ca. 162 cal. BC-AD 52). These changes of vegetation can be associated with prehistoric and Roman archaeological sites of Tribuna and Prule, which is in the vicinity of Spica.

AB  - This study examines the evolution of Lough Furnace, a coastal brackish lake in the west of Ireland, using high-resolution sensors in the water column and palaeolimnological examination of the sediment archive. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that meromixis formed as a result of sea level rise prior to ca. 4000 cal. yr BP. Increased seawater inflow has progressively led to permanent water stratification, which caused the onset of anoxia, making the monimolimnion a harsh environment for biological life. Diatom floristic interpretations suggest a progressive upcore increase in salinity, which is paralleled by a reduction in cladocera remains. Diagenetic processes have not altered the sediment organic matter signature. Organic matter mainly derives from freshwater DOC and appears to be linked to the presence of peat bogs in the catchment as confirmed by the C/N ratio. Upcore variations in the C/N ratio with a ca. 800-year periodicity have been interpreted as the result of alternating dry and wet climatic phases during the late Holocene, which appear synchronous with the NAO and long-term solar cycles. The current hydrology is largely controlled by freshwater inflow, which determines permanent meromictic conditions. Overturns are rare, requiring a specific combination of factors such as exceptionally dry and warm summers followed by cool autumns. According to the climate projections for the next century in Ireland, permanent meromictic conditions will probably continue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - When convection is thermal, there is no insolation, and water is fresh, the upward heat flux on the surface of a natural reservoir can be presented as the product of the root-mean-squire deviation (RMSD) of water-surface temperature from its mean in the power of 4/3 and a polynomial function of the Prandtl number, where the latter corresponds to the bulk water temperature. The error of measuring the heat flux arising due to this representation is estimated. To be applicable in the sea, the proposed heat-flux representation is corrected, so, that to take into account water salinity, which becomes essential when thermal convection develops in cold water. In the Prandtl number range 4.4-7.2, the skewness of the surface temperature, which, along with its RMSD from the mean, can be measured by infrared imaging, is a linear function of the Prandtl number (Verevochkin [4], Int J Heat Mass Transfer 143:118426). It is shown that, in this case, the relative error of calculating the Prandtl number is less than occurring while measuring the skewness. A possibility of using the spatial-average water-surface temperature to calculate the Prandtl number is also considered, and the relative error arising here is estimated. Two heat-flux values corresponding to the same conditions, but obtained in different ways, are used as coordinates of a point. The first value measured calorimetrically is taken from literature sources, while the second one is calculated by the being proposed here formulae. The linear function fitted to the set of thirteen such points by the least square method has the slope 1.15 +/- 0.11.

AB  - Atrazine is one of the most used herbicides in China. It is a persistent organic pollutant but has been widely used on Chinese farmlands for a long time. To assess its dietary and ecological risks to human and environment, in this study, atrazine residues were extracted with acetonitrile and then plant samples were detected with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and soil samples were determined with gas chromatography coupled with nitrogen-phosphorus detector (GC-NPD). The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 0.01 mg/kg for all matrices. The recoveries ranged from 82.0 to 105.4% for plant samples and 75.6 to 85.6% for soil samples. The final residues of atrazine in all plant samples were lower than LOQ. Dietary risk assessment suggested that under good agricultural practices (GAP) conditions, intake of atrazine from apples, grapes, and tea would exhibit an acceptably low health risk on consumers. However, the final residues of atrazine in soil samples were <0.01-9.2 mg/kg, and the half-lives were 2.0-9.1 days. Based on the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model, the potential affected fraction (PAF) of atrazine in soil samples ranges from 0.01 to 65.8%. Atrazine residues in 43.1% soil samples were higher than 0.11 mg/kg, which was the hazardous concentration for 5% of species (HC5) of atrazine in soil. These results suggested that the ecological risks of atrazine in apples, grapes, and tea garden soil would exhibit a high risk on environmental species even under the same GAP conditions. This study could provide guidance for comprehensive risk assessment of atrazine properly used in apple, grape, and tea gardens.

AB  - 1. Crayfish are culturally and ecologically important species in freshwater ecosystems, but many are now threatened with extinction, due to threats such as habitat loss. Depending on their habitat selectivity and sensitivity, freshwater crayfish could provide effective targets for stream monitoring, restoration and conservation. This study used repeated field surveys of the threatened Murray crayfish, Euastacus armatus (family Parastacidae), to establish their habitat preferences and sensitivity to habitat loss across mesohabitat and microhabitat scales within upland streams of south-east Australia. 2. Selectivity analysis revealed that upland populations of E. armatus displayed a strong preference for areas of intermediate water flow velocity, deeper water, and stream beds dominated by boulders and gravel. Variations in E. armatus density among and within the two upland streams aligned with these microhabitat preferences, with best-subsets analyses revealing that E. armatus abundance hotspots were best predicted by models combining water depth with percentage cover of boulders, gravel and overhanging riparian vegetation. 3. Major shifts in stream habitat condition from 2009 to 2015 (e.g. 32% and 50% decline in boulder and overhanging vegetation cover, respectively) was associated with a 91% decline in E. armatus mean density within glide-pool mesohabitats. 4. These findings highlight how habitat specialization in threatened crayfish such as E. armatus may render them sensitive to changes in stream habitat condition, and how targeted monitoring, restoration and conservation of their preferred habitats could yield multiple benefits for montane freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow, wind blown (aeolian) and often by water reworked sediment that is distributed on continents world-wide. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of biological loess crusts in trapping and transforming aeolian material into loess and also in prevention from wind and water erosion of deposited material.
   Some planets and satellites in our solar system are characterized by conditions comparable to those related to loess formation in terrestrial environments. Given the requirements for loess deposition on Earth, this study aims to ask the following questions: 1) if loess-like sediment formation is possible outside Earth, what are the mechanisms of sediment deposition and preservation; 2) could the possible loess-like sediments be stabilized through the activity of extraterrestrial equivalents of biological loess crusts found on Earth? As loess formation on Earth is related to biological activity, we propose a new direction in the search for extraterrestrial life: evidence about extraterrestrial loess might indicate extraterrestrial life connected to loess formation.
   On the basis of comparative analysis of some astrophysical conditions of seven celestial bodies, we propose Mars and Titan, and possibly Venus and Io, to be assessed for evidence of loess deposition and the possible presence of related life forms and their biomarkers. Following recent advances in our understanding of terrestrial loess deposition we propose new indicators of extraterrestrial life research - biomarkers in loess (cyanobacterial and other microbial).

AB  - Coastal environments host plant taxa adapted to a wide range of salinity conditions. Salinity, along with other abiotic variables, constrains the distribution of coastal plants in predictable ways, with relatively few taxa adapted to the most saline conditions. However, few attempts have been made to quantify these relationships to create niche models for coastal plants. Quantification of the effects of salinity, and other abiotic variables, on coastal plants is essential to predict the responses of coastal ecosystems to external drivers such as sea level rise. We constructed niche models for 132 coastal plant taxa in Great Britain based on eight abiotic variables. Paired measurements of vegetation composition and abiotic variables are rare in coastal habitats so four of the variables were defined using community mean values for Ellenberg indicators, i.e. scores assigned according to the typical alkalinity, fertility, moisture availability and salinity of sites where a species occurs. The remaining variables were the canopy height, annual precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperatures. Salinity and moisture indicator scores were significant terms in over 80 % of models, suggesting the distributions of most coastal species are at least partly determined by these variables. When the models were used to predict species occurrence against an independent dataset 64 % of models gave moderate to good predictions of species occurrence. This indicates that most models had successfully captured the key determinants of the niche. The models could potentially be applied to predict changes to habitats and species-dependent ecosystem services in response to rising sea levels.

AB  - 1. Rehabilitating degraded riverine landscapes in order to restore their ecosystem services require a scientific approach. The tasks include the development of methods for the assessment of ecological conditions and trends, for benchmarking of management alternatives and for the definition of ecological goals.
   2. The central challenge is to develop a coherent eco-hydrological research protocol analyzing the causal effects of hydrology on geomorphic processes and ecology.
   3. A major aspect is the formulation of ecological targets: historical reference conditions can be used to illustrate ecological deficiencies. However, at the planning and operational levels, they have to be substituted by a set of models which predict the responses towards management measures.
   4. Large scale restoration programmes should be accompanied by hypothesis-based research in order to analyze the effects of engineering measures and advance our understanding of river-floodplain ecology.
   5. A focus has to be the promotion of comprehensive management concepts, taking into account all concerned parties and assuring their active involvement. It is important to take advantage of management initiatives of various stakeholders, because governmental water policies rarely promote ecological improvement as a goal in itself.
   6. Institutional frameworks should be established with the mandate to develop large-scale and comprehensive rehabilitation concepts and guaranteeing transparent planning and decision processes. It is imperative that expert panels comprising of scientists, river-engineers, planners and managers are installed, with long-term mandates, clearly defined responsibilities and authority for decision making.

AB  - In this study, we assess the impacts of future climate and land-use in the Beca River (northern Portugal) under different scenarios and how this will translate into the conservation status of the endangered pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera (Linnaeus, 1758). This species is currently present in several stretches of the Beca River that still hold adequate ecological conditions. However, the species is threatened by projected declines in precipitation for the 21st century, with implication on the river flows and water depths that might decrease below the species requisites. This situation could be especially critical during summer conditions since the ecological flows may not be assured and several river stretches may be converted into stagnant isolated pools. The habitat connectivity will also be affected with reverberating effects on the mobility of Salmo trutta, the host of M. margaritifera, with consequences in the reproduction and recruitment of pearl mussels. In addition, human-related threats mostly associated with the presence of dams and an predicted increases in wildfires in the future. While the presence of dams may decrease even further the connectivity and river flow, with wildfires the major threat will be related to the wash out of burned areas during storms, eventually causing the disappearance of the mussels, especially the juveniles. In view of future climate and land-use change scenarios, conservation strategies are proposed, including the negotiation of ecological flows with the dam promoters, the replanting of riparian vegetation along the water course and the reintroduction of native tree species throughout the catchment.

AB  - Bacterioplankton communities are deeply diverse and highly variable across space and time, but several recent studies demonstrate repeatable and predictable patterns in this diversity. We expanded on previous studies by determining patterns of variability in both individual taxa and bacterial communities across coastal environmental gradients. We surveyed bacterioplankton diversity across the Columbia River coastal margin, USA, using amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from 596 water samples collected from 2007 to 2010. Our results showed seasonal shifts and annual reassembly of bacterioplankton communities in the freshwater-influenced Columbia River, estuary, and plume, and identified indicator taxa, including species from freshwater SAR11, Oceanospirillales, and Flavobacteria groups, that characterize the changing seasonal conditions in these environments. In the river and estuary, Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria indicator taxa correlated strongly with seasonal fluctuations in particulate organic carbon (rho = -0.664) and residence time (rho=0.512), respectively. In contrast, seasonal change in communities was not detected in the coastal ocean and varied more with the spatial variability of environmental factors including temperature and dissolved oxygen. Indicator taxa of coastal ocean environments included SAR406 and SUP05 taxa from the deep ocean, and Prochlorococcus and SAR11 taxa from the upper water column. We found that in the Columbia River coastal margin, freshwater-influenced environments were consistent and predictable, whereas coastal ocean community variability was difficult to interpret due to complex physical conditions. This study moves beyond beta-diversity patterns to focus on the occurrence of specific taxa and lends insight into the potential ecological roles these taxa have in coastal ocean environments.

AB  - In this study, we determined variations in ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations in the gonads and liver, and of the innate immune response (lysozyme activity and antiprotease) in the plasma of Engraulis ringens (anchoveta) and Strangomera bentincki (common sardine) during their reproductive seasons of 2007 and 2008 in the central area of the Humboldt Current. During the main spawning season in 2007, colder environmental conditions, higher phytoplankton biomasses, low dinoflagellate abundance and the dominance of large copepods in winter-early spring and of small copepods in late spring contributed to explain higher AA concentrations in anchoveta tissues. During the warmer year of 2008, lower phytoplankton biomasses, a notable increase of dinoflagellate abundance and the dominance of small-size copepods in winter and of larger copepods in spring occurred along with a drastic drop in AA concentrations in anchoveta tissues. These results contrasted with those in common sardine, a species in which AA did not vary as much as in anchoveta. An inverse trend between AA concentration in the liver and the gonadosomatic index suggested the AA utilization during gonadic maturation. Innate immune parameters were determined for the first time in small pelagic fish and constitute a new baseline data to evaluate their natural response to environmental changes. Changes in the distribution and abundance of edible taxa containing AA and edible for fish along with variations in AA in fish tissues during their reproductive season could become good indicators of the overall fish physiological condition resulting from variations in the trophic web structure.

AB  - Palynological studies have been performed in order to increase knowledge of relations between present vegetation and fungal biota. The analysis of modern analogues will help to improve the palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of fossil sequences from Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. A total of 24 fungal taxa have been found, described and illustrated. Surface samples were collected from the different vegetation communities developed on the island: steppe, Nothofagus forest-steppe ecotone and Nothofagus forest. The steppe is characterised by a predominance of Poaceae pollen accompanied by Nothofagus pollen (up to 30%) and spores of Glomus sp. In the forest-steppe ecotone, Nothofagus pollen frequencies rise up to 50% along with dwarf shrub heath communities and Gaeumannomyces species. In the forest unit, the percentage values of Nothofagus pollen surpass 50%. Among the fungal remains, fructifications of Microthyriaceae and dematiaceous spores such as Alternaria sp., Dictyosporium sp. and Sporidesmium sp. are present in forest samples and may be related to damp environments. Ascospores of the coprophilous Sordaria-type and Sporormiella-type appear to be common and are probably associated with livestock grazing. Fungal remains are very scarce in some of the samples obtained in mire environments. The ecological requirements of some of the fungi identified allowed inferences about the local conditions of the sampled site. This study demonstrates the palaeoenvironmental indicator value of fungal components and encourages further investigation of surface samples considering local habitat features to obtain a better understanding of local environmental conditions in the past.

AB  - Earthworms are important components of soil ecosystems worldwide, and have been used extensively as indicator species in ecotoxicology studies. Our understanding of mating systems, population structure, and genetic diversity in earthworms is limited by the current lack of available genetic tools. To address this gap, we developed 16 novel microsatellite markers for the compost earthworm Eisenia fetida, one of the most widely studied earthworm species. We tested the new markers in 3 putative populations of worms from commercial vermiculture operations in Canada and the U.S.A. All 16 loci were variable in at least one population, with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 3 to 10, observed heterozygosity from 0.000 to 0.783, and polymorphic information content from 0.032 to 0.587. One group had significantly reduced heterozygosity compared to the other 2, but overall there were only minor genetic differences among the tested suppliers, suggesting a possible bottleneck for this species in North America. The microsatellite loci we describe here will be extremely useful tools for future field and laboratory studies of E. fetida. Body size and condition in adult worms varied significantly by supplier, and breeding success and cocoon production were significantly higher in breeding pairs from one supplier compared to the other two. In the absence of evidence for genetic divergence among populations, our results suggest that the early rearing environment may be an important factor affecting adult breeding performance. We caution that the source of worms may affect the outcome of laboratory experiments involving growth and reproduction. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agapetus fuscipes is a caddisfly that only seems to occur in unimpacted streams and therefore can be a suitable indicator species for natural conditions. The species has decreased in the Netherlands because of human activities which caused organic pollution and hydromorphological degradation. Literature was reviewed to study the autecology and life cycle of A. fuscipes in order to reveal the ecological requirements of this species. By taking Agapetus fuscipes as an example, it is shown that the autecology and life cycle of an indicator species can give important clues for its presence in unimpacted and absence in impacted streams. A. fuscipes is very susceptible to organic pollution and to a lesser degree to discharge dynamics (dropping water level and discharge peaks). The species copes with dynamic discharge events by maintaining a high population density and recolonisation of disturbed habitats from refuges. However, the vulnerability of the species strongly depends on the life stage of the animals (e.g., the ability to migrate, the oxygen demand and the habitat requirements differ between instars). Although several adaptations to dynamic conditions, a high frequency of discharge peaks or a long period of drought can cause the population to decline. Once a population has totally disappeared from a stream it will take the species a long time to recolonise the stream because of its low dispersion capacity. To protect this species stream restoration should focus on water quality (avoid organic pollution and agricultural run off) and on stabilising the discharge by taking care of natural infiltration in the catchment area instead of fast removal of rain water by drainage systems.

AB  - Isotope-dilution analysis in combination with GC-ICP-MS detection has been applied to the determination of butyltin species in environmental samples. Different spikes containing the isotopically labeled butyltin species have been synthesized in the laboratory after optimization of the reaction conditions. The isotopic compositions of the tin species in the different spike solutions were deten-nined by GC-ICP-MS after derivatization by aqueous ethylation with sodium tetraethylborate. Reverse isotope-dilution analysis was used for quantitation of the spike solutions by means of natural MBT, DBT, and TBT standards. The mixed spikes were used for simultaneous analysis of MBT, DBT and TBT in the certified reference materials, PACS-2, CRM 462, and CRM 646, with satisfactory results. The excellent agreement of the different speciation results obtained by use of the different spikes is a good indicator of the precision, accuracy, and reliability which can be achieved by using isotope-dilution analysis for trace metal speciation.
   Application of a double spike containing Sn-119-enriched MBT (79.7 At%), Sn-118-enriched DBT (86.7 At%), and 119Sn-enriched TBT (83.1 At%) also enabled evaluation of the conditions resulting in quantitative extraction of the species from the solid matrix, in combination with possible alterations depending on the different extraction procedures used (mechanical shaking, ultrasounds, and microwaves). Mathematical equations used for this purpose computed the correct species concentrations directly and, additionally, the decomposition factors (from TBT to DBT and from DBT to MBT) after precise measurement of the Sn-119/Sn-120 and Sn-118/Sn-120 ratios for all butyltin species by GC-ICP-MS.

AB  - Suitable monitoring of drinking water sources may prevent the occurrence of waterborne disease. Furthermore, determining the environmental factors which affect virus inactivation may help in predicting the fate of pathogenic microorganisms in water sources. This study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of F+ bacteriophages as indicators for microbial contamination of water sources and to determine the effects of water quality, temperature and virus type on virus inactivation. The inactivation of hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus I, F+ bacteriophages and E. coli was compared in groundwater and wastewater effluents at various temperatures. Similar inactivation patterns were observed for HAV and poliovirus 1 under various experimental conditions. Male-specific bacteriophages persisted for the longest time in the various water types, whereas E. coli inactivation was the fastest in groundwater at 4 and 37 degrees C. Fi bacteriophages have been found more suitable than E. coli to predict the inactivation of pathogenic viruses in natural water sources. The effects of temperature and microorganism type have been found significant in all studied water types. The interaction between temperature and microorganism type was highly significant in groundwater and phosphate buffered saline and less significant in raw wastewater, indicating that wastewater may enhance virus persistence. The difference between the inactivation of F+ bacteriophages and E, coli was significant under all experimental conditions, indicating their suitability to signal the persistence of pathogenic viruses in natural water sources.

AB  - Shale gas development in China can generate great potential economic benefits, but also poses serious environmental risks. In this paper, we offer a macro assessment of the environmental risks of shale gas development in China. We use the US experience to identify the nature of shale gas development activities and the types of potential burdens these activities may create. We then review the baseline environmental conditions and the effectiveness of environmental regulations in China and discuss the implications of these China-specific factors for risk assessment. We recommend China to conduct a strategic environmental assessment and to consider sector-specific environmental regulations. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A planktonic foraminifer, Gallitellia vivans, has been recorded in the Quaternary sediments exposed in the Gulf of Cambay. Its occurrence in the sediments dated similar to 50 ka and similar to 125 ka respectively, is identical to peak occurrence of monsoon upwelling indicator, Globigerina bulloides in the Arabian Sea and the continental record of monsoon enhancement in Mahi and Narmada estuaries. The species is known as a tracer of high run-off, environmentally unstable and upwelling conditions. The study suggests the possibility of using G. vivans as monsoon tracer, similar to the well-established biological proxy G. bulloides.

AB  - Thousands of lakes in a similar to 17,000 km(2)area around Sudbury (Ontario) acidified (pH < 6) and became metal contaminated as a result of local smelting activities that have taken place since the 1880s. Middle Lake, an urban lake located in Sudbury, acidified to pH similar to 4.3, and was subsequently limed and fertilized in the 1970s and 1980s as part of experimental remediation efforts. Little is known about the long-term impacts of acidification, metal contamination, and subsequent remediation efforts on the benthic invertebrate communities in Middle Lake. Thus, we used paleolimnological methods to examine long-term trends in Chironomidae and Chaoboridae (Diptera) assemblages. Three important chironomid assemblage zones were identified, corresponding to pre-smelting/mining (i.e. reference) conditions, acidification/metal contamination, and subsequent remediation efforts. Acidification led to the increased abundance of acid-tolerant chironomid taxa such asPsectrocladiusandZalutschia, as well as the dominance ofChaoborus americanusindicating the loss of the fish community in the lake between similar to 1920 and similar to 1990. Liming, fertilization, and fish stocking abruptly shifted the chironomid assemblages fromChironomus- toSergentia-dominated, likely through alterations to habitat quality, food availability, and predation pressure. Fish stocking efforts were clearly visible in the record by the loss ofChaoborus americanus. Following mitigation efforts, chironomid assemblages did not return to their pre-impact state; however, they remained relatively stable after similar to 1990. The recorded shifts in taxonomic composition provide insights into the impacts of smelting operations and remediation efforts on benthic invertebrates, which is important in future lake management and in the future inference of environmental conditions using chironomids in multiple-stressor systems.

AB  - The relevance of the work is caused by the need to combine the principles of economic efficiency of array state control while filling the cavities formed when mining and safety of the environment in the area of mineral resource extraction with the increase in volumes of extraction of mineral raw materials for the needs of the growing population.
   The aim of the research is to develop the parameters of ore extraction technique without filling the cavities with the material. These materials would preserve the earth surface from destruction in the case of rock caving zone yield to the level of pumps for indefinitely long period of time after filling the workings.
   Research methods: critical analysis of the experience in development of deposits similar in ore localization conditions, physical and mathematical modelling of the production technologies and forecasting the ways of development of technology, experimental determination of the value of a span limited in stability condition.
   Results. It is shown that the earth surface stability over the filled deposit area after its performance is provided with preventing the possibility of deformation phenomena occurrence. It is proved that the field with the void volume of 2 million ma can be repaid without filling voids with backlit! material. The authors have substantiated the necessity of a more complete accounting of geomechanical factors in assessment of environmental and economic efficiency of extraction of mineral raw materials. The paper introduces the model of estimation of underground mining efficiency depending on the use of properties of ore-bearing massifs.
   Conclusions. Purposeful use of the properties of ore-bearing massifs largely determines the performance indicators of underground mining. One of the main operational issues is the choice of development options to ensure the safety of the earth surface.

AB  - The article is a discussion of the concept of quality of life in a regeneration area based on the personal evaluation of residents. Developed by social scientists to evaluate people's well-being, satisfaction, and happiness, the concept of quality of life raises the issue of adapting the conditions of living spaces to meet people's needs, expectations, and demands. The aim of this study was to establish an integrated and comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of life in a regeneration case in Turkey through empirical research conducted at the neighborhood level. Data were collected from 359 households in the regenerated neighborhood of Akpinar, in the city of Ankara, using a questionnaire to inquire about the quality of life. The methodological framework of the study included a theory-based choice of indicators identified in a comprehensive literature review, including economic, ecological, physical, and social aspects of an urban environment, and an analysis of the relationship of the indicators to quality of life. Despite the diverse literature on urban environmental quality, there is no uniform, generally accepted conceptual framework to measure quality of life. Therefore, in this research, a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis was adopted to assess the quality of life of the residents with respect to their housing and urban environment. The findings suggested that modern quality of life requires understanding the social, political, spatial conditions, and needs of residents. Based on the findings of the study, policy recommendations were developed to enhance quality of life at the neighborhood level from a space-sensitive perspective.

AB  - Filter-feeding bivalves have been used extensively as an indicator of ecosystem condition and in management of estuarine environments. The current study aimed to determine whether sedimentary metals could predict metal concentrations in tissue of filter-feeding mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and to identify areas of the estuary where mussel consumption posed a human health risk. Mussel tissue Cu and Zn concentrations (wet weight) were below guideline values for human consumption in all parts of the waterway, whereas Pb tissue concentrations exceed these guidelines (2.0 mu g g(-1) wet weight) in the upper reaches of some embayments of the estuary. Concentrations of Cu and Pb in the fine fraction (< 62.5 mu m) of bottom sediment reasonably predicted concentrations (dry weight) of these metals in mussel tissue (r (2) = 0.460 and p = 0.001 and r (2) = 0.669 and p < 0.0001, respectively) as these materials are resuspendable and available to filter-feeding estuarine animals, whereas total sediment and mussel tissue were poorly related. Lead concentrations (> 350 mu g g(-1)) in fine sediments indicated areas of this estuary where human health was at risk due to high tissue concentrations of this metal. These results give encouragement for the use of the metal concentration in fine sediments as an indicator of estuarine condition and risk to human health in this waterway. Mussels were distributed in all parts of the estuary, even in areas where metal concentrations exceeded sediment quality guidelines.

AB  - The Anzali Wetland is one of the most important ecosystems in the north of Iran, and parts of it were registered as a Ramsar site in 1975. However, even though, due to many problems, including eutrophication produced by inflow of excess nutrients and organic materials, the wetland was also listed on the Montreux Record indicating the need to take urgent remedial action. This study was conducted to study the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and total mercury (THg) in two fish species (Esox lucius and Carassius auratus) as bio-indicators of the ecosystem condition in eastern part of Anzali Wetland. The sampling was carried out in six different periods between years 2009 and 2010. The results showed that the amounts of PCBs in the muscle of northern pike were below the detection limit of gas chromatography, whereas the average concentration in goldfish was 0.449 mg/kg wet weight. Some possible reasons for the higher levels of PCBs in goldfish in comparison with pike have been discussed. No significant (p < 0.05) correlation was observed between PCBs and biological factors (weight, length, lipid content) for both species. On the other hand, the mean concentration of THg in the muscle of pike and goldfish were 182.22 and 75.27 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Although these concentrations were below US-EPA criterion for human consumption (0.3 mg/kg), it pointed up a significant deterioration of the ecosystem condition during the past years. Finally, statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between THg with weight and an insignificant correlation with length for pike specimens.

AB  - The effects of habitat restoration measures designated to promote farmland biodiversity have been documented at the field scale, but little is known about their role in restoring the agricultural mosaic. In this study, we analyzed the effects of wildflower strips (WFS) at the field scale and in the landscape context on butterflies in a Swiss arable landscape. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of restoration measures depending on the landscape context. The influence of proximity and connectivity of WFS were, however, not significant. The occurrence of specialists was conditioned by plant species richness, while the effect of WFS for overall diversity was affected by the amount of grassland in the surroundings. We conclude that to increase the effectiveness of biodiversity-orientated restoration measures, their implementation should be steered toward increasing the share of WFS in the landscape. However, the combination of WFS with additional restoration measures might be needed to halt the decline of specialist species.

AB  - Taxonomic distinctness is a highly useful index combining species richness and taxonomic (phylogenetic) diversity to detect changes in the taxonomic structure of communities and assemblages. While analysis of an odonate assemblage before and after construction of a hydroelectric impoundment in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, revealed no significant increase in average monthly species richness (although annual counts were slightly higher for the latter survey), taxonomic distinctness and its variation were reduced. The impoundment converted natural lotic conditions into lentic habitat with more littoral vegetation. Such conditions favored plant-dependent species (mostly in the Zygoptera) with more species per genus and genera per family relative to those not dependent (mostly in the Anisoptera). High ratios reduce the average risk of losing higher taxonomic structure with loss of a species. Reduced taxonomic distinctness and its variation occurred at the expense of the Gomphidae and Corduliidae, and several genera in the Libellulidae having non-plant dependent species that favor inorganic substrate in flowing waters. The results contrast with the common assumption that higher odonate diversity occurs in lentic habitats. Seasonal patterns of taxonomic distinctness appeared similar between surveys and may reflect reproductive and emergence cycles. The results support the use of taxonomic distinctness and its variation over species richness in ecological assessments and its application in further freshwater research. We encourage its use with aquatic insects, but recommend frequent sampling intervals to account for effects from emergence and reproductive behaviors. These results suggest new and added breadth to the value of taxonomic distinctness in ecological research regarding habitat change.

AB  - Validly measuring aggression is challenging because self-reports are plagued with biased answer tendencies and behavioral measures with ethical concerns and low ecological validity. The current study, therefore, introduces a novel virtual reality (VR) aggression assessment tool, differentially assessing reactive and proactive aggression. Two VR tasks were developed, one in an alley environment (N = 24, all male, M-age = 23.88, 83.3% students) and an improved second one in a bar (N = 50, all male, M-age = 22.54, 90% students). In this bar VR task, participants were randomly assigned to either the reactive condition where they were triggered by a cheating and insulting dart-player or to the proactive condition where they could earn extra money by aggressing. Participants' level of self-reported aggression and psychopathy was assessed, after which they engaged in either the reactive or proactive VR task. Changes in affect and blood pressure were also measured. Aggression in the reactive VR task was evidenced to mostly display convergent validity because it positively correlated with self-reported aggression and total and fearless dominance factor scores of psychopathy, and there was a trend relationship with increased systolic blood pressure. The validity of the proactive aggression variant of our VR bar paradigm received less support, and needs more refinement. It can be concluded that VR is a potentially promising tool to experimentally induce and assess (reactive) aggression, which has the potential to provide aggression researchers and clinicians with a realistic and modifiable aggression assessment environment.

AB  - Smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) has been planted widely for use as a forage grass and erosion control. Its competitive nature and rapid growth have allowed smooth brome to become an invasive species throughout the Northern Great Plains. Prescribed burning is commonly employed to control smooth brome in the region's remaining native grasslands. Burning at the initiation of elongation, when smooth brome populations are most vulnerable, destroys the carbohydrate reserves that allow the plants to recover. Identifying the five-leaf stage in phenological development has been recommended to signal the start of elongation in order to time prescribed burning to be most detrimental to smooth brome. Unfortunately, in a recent field survey of 27 sites in the Northern Great Plains, less than 1% of smooth brome tillers were observed to achieve the five-leaf stage prior to elongation, calling the tying of prescribed burning to identification of the five-leaf developmental stage into question. Accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) provides a more reliable indicator of smooth brome's vulnerability to control efforts through prescribed burning than reliance on the observance of the five-leaf stage. This study was designed to monitor phenological development of smooth brome in a controlled greenhouse environment to determine whether the correlation between AGDD and phenological development was exhibited in greenhouse populations across a gradient of nitrogen conditions encountered throughout the Northern Great Plains. It was determined that, while nitrogen treatment did affect the biomass and number of tillers produced, it did not affect the phenological progression of development. The greenhouse population reached 50% elongation at an average of 2287 AGDD.

AB  - We examined the effect of mesoscale oceanographic conditions on the seasonal abundance and distribution patterns of chaetognaths, a major component of the zooplankton community in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with data collected in late spring (May/June) and summer (July) from 2015 to 2017. Overall, 13 chaetognath species from six genera were observed in the samples. Significant pairwise associations were found between some species of chaetognaths, e.g. Flaccisagitta enflata and Sagitta bipunctata, which were affected by the distance of sampling stations to the Loop Current front. Flaccisagitta hexaptera observed in the samples appeared as an indicator species of high salinity water. Additionally, the abundance of chaetognaths showed an increasing trend as the distance increased from the Loop Current front. The potential effects of environmental factors (e.g. SST, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and oceanographic features (i.e. the Loop Current front) on abundance and distribution of chaetognaths were further examined using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and generalized additive models (GAM). The NMDS ordination showed significant differences in chaetognath assemblages between the cruises. Furthermore, the GAM modeling displayed species-specific impacts of salinity, dissolved oxygen, and distance to the Loop Current front on the abundance of key chaetognaths in the region. Given the critical roles of zooplankton communities, this three-year study of chaetognaths contributed to the understanding of the processes and drivers of zooplankton dynamics in relation to environmental factors in the northern Gulf of Mexico to further explore how these changes would affect fisheries production and ecosystem functions in the areas.

AB  - The environmental system of the northern Nordic Seas is very sensitive to oceanographic and climatic changes at the contact of cold Arctic and warmer North Atlantic waters. These contrasts are reflected in the associations of marine microorganisms and archived in the bottom sediments. A microfossil study (diatoms, coccoliths) of late Holocene sediments in core MSM5/5-712-1 from the eastern Fram Strait provides a better understanding of marine ecosystems and palaeoenvironments during Arctic warming events of the last two millennia. Indicative diatom species and groups of species revealed a high variability of sea-surface conditions. Based on the diatom distribution, three warming periods could be detected, corresponding to the time intervals of 0 to 440 CE (the later part of the Roman Warm Period), 1200 to1420 CE (the final part of the Medieval Climate Anomaly) and 1730 CE to present (including the Recent Warming). The various micropalaeontological proxies used in this study and other publications describe the Roman Warm Period and, especially, the Recent Warming as the most pronounced warm events in the area during the last 2000years. A comparison of data from the different microfossil groups, indicators of sea-surface and subsurface conditions, reveals variable, complicated and non-simultaneous palaeoenvironmental signals within the warm periods. This can potentially be explained by changes in the surface/subsurface water structure during the events (variations in the cold/warm water advection, stratification, availability of nutrients, seasonal succession of bioproductivity, etc.), which are reflected by changes in the microplankton communities.

AB  - In West Africa, the most extreme predicted effects of climate change are expected to occur in desert and grassland areas. It is crucial for local populations in this region to better understand what such projections signify to them to identify sound adaptation policies and interventions. We developed a game, called the "grazing game," and conducted trials with local farmers at multiple study sites as a learning tool to better understand their behavior in response to climate variability under semiarid conditions in West Africa and to facilitate social learning. The grazing game was designed to reveal the processes that lead to overgrazing and desertification based on the players' interactions with environmental conditions and their resulting decisions. We conducted a total of 23 game trials around the Vea catchment of the Upper East Region of Ghana involving 243 individual farmers. From the games, local farmers exhibited a very positive response to how the game replicated rainfall fluctuations that they currently experience and led to the identification of coping strategies, such as selling cows, seeking government assistance, and engaging in alternative livelihood means. Participating farmers tended to avoid uncertain situations and sought to simplify their decisions, and the game provided insight into the rich local ecological knowledge of environmental indicators. Based on the game trial results, we found that the game facilitated instrumental and communicative learning among the players and facilitators. Further, the game served as a platform where players could share their views, knowledge, and perceptions of climate-related issues.

AB  - Green roofs have received considerable attention for multiple ecosystem services which include stormwater amelioration. Offering sustainable stormwater source-control, green roofs utilize otherwise unused impervious urban surfaces to restore pre-development hydrologic functions such as infiltration and retention. Its ability to retain stormwater is related to external and internal factors. Meteorological conditions prior to a rainfall event can influence antecedent evapotranspiration, the only water-exit pathway of the green-roof system besides discharge. Whereas evapotranspiration may be difficult and costly to measure directly, other common meteorological conditions can be monitored conveniently and inexpensively even prior to actual green-roof installation. Identifying salient on-site meteorological factors may provide valuable insights into hydrologic dynamics, and inform green-roof design and planning decisions. A statistical regression approach identified potential antecedent meteorological factors and moisture indicators of extensive green-roof retention. Continuous field-monitoring data revealed the combined effects of rainfall depth, wind speed, solar radiation, and antecedent dry weather period to explain the measured stormwater retention under a humid subtropical rainfall regime. Amongst the studied environmental factors, solar radiation and wind speed contributed notably to green-roof stormwater retention and may provide a dependable basis to assist green-roof site selection when resources are limited. It is important to incorporate site-specific planning and assessment prior to green infrastructure design and implementation to maximize hydrologic and evaporative cooling services in cities with complex topographical features.

AB  - In a recent study on indigenous yellow perch chronically exposed to metals, we reported a negative correlation between liver metal concentration and liver transcription levels of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of retinoids. We therefore speculated that metals, and especially the non-essential metal Cd, could alter the metabolism of retinoids in wild fish. Thus the present field study investigates the impact of in situ metal exposure on retinoid storage. A total of 55 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were sampled in six lakes representing a metal contamination gradient (8 <= N <= 10 per lake). Our results show that yellow perch from Cd-contaminated lakes had significantly higher concentrations of liver dehydroretinol and dehydroretinyl esters than did fish from reference lakes. However, the increase in retinyl ester stores with increasing Cd concentrations was quantitatively much more important than the increase in free dehydroretinol. As a result, a significant decrease in the percentage of hepatic free dehydroretinol with increasing renal Cd concentrations was observed. These results suggest that the enzymes and the binding proteins involved in vitamin A homeostasis are inhibited by the presence of Cd. Alternatively, the increase in tissue vitamin A (antioxidant) levels could serve to better counteract the oxidative stress engendered by Cd exposure. Overall our findings illustrate that vitamin A(2) homeostasis can be altered as a consequence of chronic exposure to low Cd concentrations. Thus, in the context of environmental risk assessment, the percentage of liver free dehydroretinol can be considered as a biomarker of for in situ Cd exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (RBPs) have been widely used to assess the ecological health of aquatic ecosystems. Specific aims of RBPs for wadeable streams are to indicate the ecological condition of a stream using low-cost protocols to allow long-term and widespread routine monitoring. Our study was part of an ongoing effort to test and standardize a protocol using benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of the water quality of wadeable streams in southeast Brazil. One of the most controversial issues during RBP development is deciding the taxonomic resolution that should be used. We evaluated how well genus-, family-, and order-level taxonomic resolution detected a gradient of impairment. All 3 taxonomic resolutions statistically discriminated reference, intermediately impaired, and impaired sites based on assemblage structure, water-quality classification, and biotic index responses. Analysis at the genus level was more effective than analysis at other levels of taxonomic resolution for discriminating sites that varied in degradation conditions, especially when considering biotic index responses, but the lack of comprehensive taxonomic keys and information about the ecology of those genera hinder their widespread use in bioassessments. On the other hand, analyses at the order level had lower discriminating power to separate reference sites from intermediately impaired sites when considering biotic index responses. Analyses at the family level gave results similar to results at the genus level, and we support its use in a RBP program for this region, at least until better keys and autoecological knowledge are available.

AB  - In semiarid ecosystems plant cover plays an important role in the improvement of physical, chemical and biochemical soil properties. With the aim of studying the influence of different plant species on soil properties, and establishing the relationships between them, 160 soil samples from under four different plant species (Pinus halepensis, Quercus coccifera, Juniperus oxycedrus and Rosmarinus officinalis) were taken in a forest area of the province of Alicante (SE Spain). The following soil properties were analyzed in all soil samples: organic carbon content, microbial biomass, soluble organic carbon, aggregate stability, basal respiration, and some eco-physiological ratios. In addition, the near infrared spectra (NIR) of all soil samples were obtained to verify the similarities or differences between soil samples under the four species. Some differences in parameters such as organic carbon content or basal respiration were found mainly between the group of P. halepensis and Q. coccifera with respect to J. oxycedrus and R. officinalis. Despite this, the high organic carbon content found under the four plant species showed an influence on the rest of soil properties. Moreover, using a discriminant analysis with factorial scores from NIR absorbance data did not result in a good classification of samples in terms of the species, reflecting some similarities between them. Our results show that the high contents observed in some parameters under the four species, and the lack of significant differences in most of them, prove the important role of shrubland in semiarid conditions, it being capable of promoting good soil conditions.

AB  - Environmental and past land use controls on tree species assemblages on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were characterized to determine whether biophysical factors or land-use history has been more important in determining the species composition of secondary tropical forests after large-scale forest clearing for agriculture, widespread species introduction, and landscape-scale forest fragmentation. Post-deforestation, secondary forest assemblages are comprehensively described, both as broad general assemblages and island-specific variations by calculating species importance values from forest inventory data. Hierarchical clustering and indicator species analysis defined species assemblages, and then correlations between species assemblages and environmental variables were explored with non-metric multidimensional scaling, analysis of variance and chi(2) testing. These assemblages are arrayed along environmental gradients of decreasing spring moisture stress, decreasing maximum temperatures, and increasing minimum temperatures. Land-use history is not as important to determining variation in species composition across climatic zones, although several species assemblages are associated with certain geology types or land-use histories. Naturalized tree species are prominent in these secondary forests and contribute to the formation of some novel assemblages, but native late and early successional species also colonize former agricultural land, all influenced by the degree of disturbance. We conclude that environmental factors have an overarching effect on forest species composition across the broader range of climatic, geologic and topographic conditions and larger geographic scales, while land-use history influences subtropical secondary forest species assemblages within a specific climatic zone or set of relatively narrow environmental conditions.

AB  - Leaf delta C-13 is an indicator of water-use efficiency and provides useful information on the carbon and water balance of plants over longer periods. Variation in leaf delta C-13 between or within species is determined by plant physiological characteristics and environmental factors. We hypothesized that variation in leaf delta C-13 values among dominant species reflected ecosystem patterns controlled by large-scale environmental gradients, and that within-species variation indicates plant adaptability to environmental conditions. To test these hypotheses, we collected leaves of dominant species from six ecosystems across a horizontal vegetation transect on the Tibetan Plateau, as well as leaves of Kobresia pygmaea (herbaceous) throughout its distribution and leaves of two coniferous tree species (Picea crassifolia, Abies fabri) along an elevation gradient throughout their distribution in the Qilian Mountains and Gongga Mountains, respectively. Leaf delta C-13 of dominant species in the six ecosystems differed significantly, with values for evergreen coniferous < evergreen broadleaved tree < alpine shrub < sedges similar to graminoid < xeromorphs. Leaf delta C-13 values of the dominant species and of K. pygmaea were negatively correlated with annual precipitation along a water gradient, but leaf delta C-13 of A. fabri was not significantly correlated with precipitation in habitats without water-stress. This confirms that variation of delta C-13 between or within species reflects plant responses to environmental conditions. Leaf delta C-13 of the dominant species also reflected water patterns on the Tibetan Plateau, providing evidence that precipitation plays a primary role in controlling ecosystem changes from southeast to northwest on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - This study examined relationships among water, sediment, diet, and fish tissue metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn) concentrations in yellow perch from metal gradients in two regions (Sudbury (S), Ontario, and Rouyn-Noranda (RN), Quebec, Canada) in two seasons (spring and summer). The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the influences of aqueous and dietary metal contamination on yellow perch liver and kidney metal accumulation; (2) to compare the seasonal and regional variations in gut content and tissue metal concentrations along the two gradients studied; and (3) to investigate the potential of metals for tissue accumulation under conditions of life-long chronic exposure. Our results suggest a greater aqueous than dietary influence on tissue metal concentrations for all metals examined except Cd, where the opposite was observed. Metals did not accumulate in older fish, except for Cd that accumulated with age in RN, but not S, fish. Regional, but also metal-specific differences in metal handling capacities are proposed. Fish from neither region appeared capable of regulating tissue Cd concentrations, but fish from both regions regulated Zn tightly. Sudbury fish appeared better at regulating tissue Cu, Ni, and perhaps also Se concentrations than RN fish, suggesting acclimation or selection for metal tolerance. There were several significant seasonal effects on tissue metal concentrations. However, close examination of the dataset does not allow proposing the presence of a season-linked mechanism explaining these variations, precluding a modeling approach and implying that repeat sampling within and among years is required for proper ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Paralia sulcata is a diatom commonly found in both the plankton and benthos of coastal environments. This species is heavily silicified and thus preserves well in sedimentary records, making it a potentially useful paleoindicator species. However, its tychopelagic nature and association with a wide range of environmental conditions have made detailed palcoecological interpretations complicated. The abundance and size of P. sulcata varies in sediments along the Swedish west coast. While most cells have diameters from 12 to 18 mum, cells greater than 20 mum can constitute over 50% of the population. High-resolution stratigraphies in sediment cores from two Swedish fjords reveal changes in the abundance and valve diameter of P. sulcata over a 200 year time span. Paralia sulcata is abundant in non-laminated sediment sequences. Cells with large diameters (>20 mum) are however more common in laminated sections. The connections between environmental parameters and P. sulcata abundance and size were further investigated from surface sediments along the Swedish west coast. Multivariate analyses highlight the importance of surface water properties and water column stability in the abundance and size distribution of P. sulcata along the coast. Water columns that are vertically mixed have more upwelling of nutrient-rich, high salinity water to the surface; and these conditions result in large populations of small-sized P. sulcata. In contrast, stratified water columns with low surface water salinity and low phosphorus concentrations show reduced quantities of P. sulcata, but a higher percentage of cells greater than 20 mum. These results help clarify the potential of P. sulcata as a paleoindicator species in coastal environments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most difficult components to measure in the energy budgets of natural fish populations is the energy released in metabolism. Telemetry of physiological correlates of metabolism, such as heart rate, can (with calibration) enable direct measurements of metabolism and simultaneous observations of behavior in the natural environment. Heart rate is a good indicator of metabolic rate for northern pike Esox lucius and was used to obtain information on metabolism, activity, and food intake in the natural environment. Mean field metabolic rates were 1.5 times standard metabolic rate. Activity metabolism accounted for 5-10% of total metabolism and was approximately an order of magnitude greater than estimates based on mean swimming speed derived from location tracking. Feeding metabolism was 15-25% of total metabolism. Even when the full metabolic rate calibration is not considered, physiological telemetry can provide useful information on patterns of energy expenditure of direct relevance to bioenergetics modeling. Heart rate telemetry of spawning Atlantic salmon Salmo salar demonstrated that females expended large amounts of energy during upstream movement and redd cutting, but exhibited prolonged periods of inactivity and low energy expenditure. In contrast, males displayed higher sustained metabolic costs and greater up and downstream movements than females. Metabolism can be standardized with respect to minimum and maximum limits, enabling useful comparisons between species and environmental conditions. This technique was used to demonstrate that patterns of energy expenditure vary with fish species, lifestyle, stage of life cycle, and environmental conditions. Because of recent technological advances, physiological telemetry should become an increasingly useful tool for improving and validating bioenergetics models.

AB  - The effects of organic pollution have been estimated on the French coast of the western Channel (Saint-Malo Bay) using specific biotic indices and biological indicators. Although the environmental (megatidal) conditions differ greatly from those in the Mediterranean Sea where this method was first employed, the results obtained have revealed a structural imbalance between annelid communities on rocky and on soft bottoms. The areas in this region affected by organic discharges have also been delimited. Our evaluation shows that this method can usefully be extended to much wider fields than has so far been supposed.

AB  - Seagrasses and associated microbial communities constitute a functional unit (holobiont) which responds as a whole to environmental changes. However, it is still unclear how the microbial colonizers are selected. In this study we compared the epiphytic microbial communities associated with Posidonia oceanica and Halophila stipulacea, Mediterranean native and exotic seagrass species, respectively, growing side by side in monospecific patches within the port of Limassol (Cyprus, Eastern Mediterranean Sea). To evaluate whether the environment rather than the host species and/or its physiological condition play a role in shaping the seagrass epiphytic microbial community, the environmental microbial communities (seawater and sediment) and seagrass associated ones were determined by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Plant ecological status was evaluated by morphological (biometry), structural (density) and biochemical (pigment/phenol content) descriptors. In both species, leaf associated microbial communities are clearly similar to seawater microbes; conversely, microbes associated with H. stipulacea roots/rhizomes differ from the microbial communities in surrounding sediment. In both seagrasses, Pseudomonadaceae was the most abundant family on leaves, but each species harboured unique microbial families. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on these two neighbouring seagrass species, coupling plant ecological status with associated microbial communities. Results demonstrated that each seagrass responded differently to the same environmental conditions and selected different epiphytic microbial communities, supporting their putative use as ecological indicators.

AB  - Boa Viagem is an urban beach located in the northeast of Brazil. It exhibits a high degree of development and use. Although characterized by typical tourist activities, it is under pressure and the quality of its environment and socioeconomic function can be jeopardized. This study assessed the temporal variation of the quality of the beach over a decade (2007-2017), in order to determine whether its conditions have improved or worsened, and whether the parameters used in 2007 were still effective for this type of assessment. Four indicators (A = excellent, B = good, C = fair, and D = bad) based on the assessment of 60 parameters subdivided into two subsystems (natural and anthropic) were used. All the 30 natural parameters were assessed based on an attribute scale ranging from the worst (1) to the best (3) quality. For the anthropic parameters, only positive or negative categories were attributed. For both subsystems, a scale from 1 (not important) to 3 (very important) was used to obtain the weight of each parameter. The sum of each subsystem was used to obtain a score. The results obtained in the second assessment were very similar to those obtained in the first. The most central part of the beach, which suffered from erosion problems and absence of backshore, was the most affected in both assessed periods; whereas the northern and southern extremes remained in better conditions. Indicators A and D did not occur in the two periods assessed. There was a slight improvement in the infrastructure (such as the extension of the bike path to the entire length of the beach, and safety signaling for users), and there was a very small reduction in quality of the natural subsystem (<5%).

AB  - Research suggests that wild animals in urban areas exhibit heightened behavioral flexibility when they encounter novel human-made objects, but most such studies compared responses in urban populations with those from disjunct populations in less disturbed environments. We therefore know little about intrapopulation variation in cognitive or behavioral flexibility under different conditions of anthropogenic exposure. Here, we investigate object exploration and behavioral flexibility in a single group of samango monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) in an environment in which individuals forage in both gardens and natural forest. Over 2 months, we presented monkeys with novel, human-made objects in both natural and disturbed areas, varying the position of objects in trees to represent exposed or safer foraging zones. We video-recorded and analyzed interactions with these novel objects, assessing interaction times (an indicator of persistence), exploratory diversity (or motor diversity), and the occurrence of foraging innovations. Results from 67 interactions (29 in natural habitats and 38 in disturbed) indicate that samango monkeys exhibited a spatially complex response to novel objects: in contrast to that in other species, exploration diversity decreased significantly in anthropogenic environments, even as persistence remained largely static across contexts. Monkeys also exhibited foraging innovations by pulling on strings to bring objects closer. This may reduce exposure to danger, as string-pulling was most prevalent in the highest risk condition (ground level in human gardens). Significant intrapopulation variation in behavioral flexibility suggests that samango monkeys adjust the expression of problem-solving behaviors in relation to the degree of human disturbance in their immediate environment.

AB  - Sound knowledge of present-day diatom species and their environments is crucial when attempting to reconstruct past climate and environmental changes based on fossil assemblages. For the North Atlantic region, the biogeography and ecology of many diatom taxa that are used as indicator-species in paleoceanographic studies are still not well known. Using information contained in large diatom-environment calibration datasets can greatly increase our knowledge on diatom taxa and improve the accuracy of paleoenvironmental reconstructions. A diatom calibration dataset including 183 surface sediment samples from the northern North Atlantic was used to explore the distribution and ecology of 21 common Northern Hemisphere diatom taxa. We define the ecological responses of these species to April sea ice concentrations and August sea surface temperatures (aSSTs) using Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF)-response curves, provide distribution maps, temperature optima and ranges, and high-quality light microscope images. Based on the results, we find species clearly associated with cold, warm and temperate waters. All species have a statistically significant relationship with aSST, and 15 species with sea ice. Of these, Actinocyclus curvatulus, Fragilariopsis oceanica and Porosira glacialis are most abundant at high sea ice concentrations, whereas Coscinodiscus radiants, Shionodiscus oestrupii, Thalassionema nitzschioides, Thalassiosira angulata, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii and Thalassiosira pacifica are associated with low sea ice concentrations/ice-free conditions. Interestingly, some species frequently used as sea ice indicators, such as Fragilariopsis cylindrus, show similar abundances at high and low sea ice concentrations with no statistically significant relationship to sea ice.

AB  - The Hominoidea (apes and, eventually, humans) and Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) diverged from a common ancestor during the late Oligocene (similar to 25 Ma) in East Africa. Subsequently, both catarrhine groups diversified in the early Miocene (similar to 23-16 Ma), making this time period an extremely important one for understanding our (deep) ancestral roots and the link between our hominoid ancestors and the environment. A remote region of west Turkana known as Loperot provides an exciting opportunity to study early Miocene primate paleoecology and has the potential to reveal the phylogenetic relationship between cercopithecoid monkeys and stem hominoids. The site of LpM4 is particularly fossiliferous and has produced a diverse fauna that includes several catarrhine fossils that await description. Radioisotopic dating indicates that the Loperot fauna are older than similar to 17 Ma (early Miocene). Using geochemical data from paleosols and stable isotope values from rhizolith calcite, coupled with detailed sedimentology and stratigraphy, we reconstruct the early Miocene Critical Zone of Loperot to reveal a large perennial river system fed by ephemeral streams that created localized riparian forest microhabitats within a larger open ecosystem under semi-arid climate conditions, making Loperot's environmental reconstruction unlike many other early Miocene catarrhine-bearing localities. The perennial river system supported corridors of C-3 forests; however, because these forests were restricted, they could not support a high diversity of forest indicator taxa. This is the most comprehensive analysis of the environmental conditions at Loperot to date, and provides new empirical evidence to suggest that African climate varied significantly by region and that arid habitats certainly existed during the early Miocene.

AB  - Wetlands restoration has been implemented on sites exploited for agricultural for over a decade in Eastern Europe. However, little is known about microbial diversity in this region. Microbial processes and patterns can be used as sensitive indicators of changes in environmental conditions. The responses of ciliates wetlands restoration are largely unexplored. Based on the results of a long-term study in fen of the Poleski National Park (Poland), we assumed that restoration causes changes in the physicochemical properties of fen water and sought to answer the question of how ciliate communities react to these changes and whether these microorganisms can play a significant role as bioindicators in evaluating the restoration process. Twenty taxa were recorded in the ciliate community, with 16 taxa found prior to restoration and 12 after restoration. Restoration clearly modified the taxonomic composition and abundance of ciliates. This was reflected in a decrease in the abundance and in the density of these protozoa and in a significant increase in the proportion of euplanktonic species. Before restoration, the most common ciliates were Cinetochilum margaritaceum and Strombidium viride, while the proportion of Paramecium bursaria increased after restoration. We also observed that the improvement in hydrological conditions, and hence the transformation of the vegetation structure in the peat bog, causes changes in the trophic structure of ciliates. The RDA analysis showed that all variables together accounted for 86.9% of the total variance. However, variables that significantly explained the variance in ciliate communities were water level, temperature, pH, and nutrients. Our results suggest that an indicator species approach based on functional groups may be appropriate for biomonitoring fens restoration.

AB  - Building reservoir release schedules to manage engineered river systems can involve costly trade-offs between storing and releasing water. As a result, the design of release schedules requires metrics that quantify the benefit and damages created by releases to the downstream ecosystem. Such metrics should support making operational decisions under uncertain hydrologic conditions, including drought and flood seasons. This study addresses this need and develops a reservoir operation rule structure and method to maximize downstream environmental benefit while meeting human water demands. The result is a general approach for hedging downstream environmental objectives. A multistage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program with Markov Chains, identifies optimal environmental hedging, releases to maximize environmental benefits subject to probabilistic seasonal hydrologic conditions, current, past, and future environmental demand, human water supply needs, infrastructure limitations, population dynamics, drought storage protection, and the river's carrying capacity. Environmental hedging hedges bets for drought by reducing releases for fish, sometimes intentionally killing some fish early to reduce the likelihood of large fish kills and storage crises later. This approach is applied to Folsom reservoir in California to support survival of fall-run Chinook salmon in the lower American River for a range of carryover and initial storage cases. Benefit is measured in terms of fish survival; maintaining self-sustaining native fish populations is a significant indicator of ecosystem function. Environmental hedging meets human demand and outperforms other operating rules, including the current Folsom operating strategy, based on metrics of fish extirpation and water supply reliability.

AB  - We conducted a survey of 170 streams distributed throughout the mountaintop-mining region of West Virginia (USA) and linked stream data to a temporally consistent and comprehensive land-cover data set. We then applied a generalized linear modeling framework and constructed cumulative effects models capable of predicting in-stream response to future surface-mine development within the context of other landuse activities. Predictive models provided precise estimates of specific conductance (model R-2 <= 0.77 and cross-validated R-2 <= 0.74), Se (0.74 and 0.70), and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition (0.72 and 0.65). Deletion tests supported the conclusion that stream degradation across the region is the result of complex, but predictable, additive and interactive effects of surface mining, underground mining, and residential development. Furthermore, we found that as stressors other than surface mining are factored out completely, the surface-mining level that results in exceedance of the 300 mu S/cm conductivity benchmark increased from 4.4% in the presence of other stressors to 16.6% when only surface mining was present. Last, extrapolating model results to all unsampled stream segments in the region (n = 26,135), we predicted high levels of chemical (33%) and biological (67%) impairment to streams on the current landscape. Of this total impairment, however, <25% could be attributed to surface mining alone. These results underscore the importance of multistressor landuse models for reliable predictions of stream conditions, and the difficulty of interpreting correlations between surface mining and stream impairment without fully accounting for other landuse activities.

AB  - Deforestation in the tropical Andes is affecting ecological conditions of streams, and determination of how much forest should be retained is a pressing task for conservation, restoration and management strategies. We calculated and analyzed eight benthic metrics (structural, compositional and water quality indices) and a physical-chemical composite index with gradients of vegetation cover to assess the effects of deforestation on macroinvertebrate communities and water quality of 23 streams in southern Ecuadorian Andes. Using a geographical information system (GIS), we quantified vegetation cover at three spatial scales: the entire catchment, the riparian buffer of 30 m width extending the entire stream length, and the local scale defined for a stream reach of 100 m in length and similar buffer width. Macroinvertebrate and water quality metrics had the strongest relationships with vegetation cover at catchment and riparian scales, while vegetation cover did not show any association with the macroinvertebrate metrics at local scale. At catchment scale, the water quality metrics indicate that ecological condition of Andean streams is good when vegetation cover is over 70%. Further, macroinvertebrate community assemblages were more diverse and related in catchments largely covered by native vegetation (>70%). Our results suggest that retaining an important quantity of native vegetation cover within the catchments and a linkage between headwater and riparian forests help to maintain and improve stream biodiversity and water quality in Andean streams affected by deforestation.

AB  - Tyrosinase catalyzes the biological conversion of tyrosine to dopaquinone with dioxygen at the dinuclear copper active site under physiological conditions. On the basis of the recent X-ray crystal structural analysis of tyrosinase (J BioL Chem. 2006, 281, 8981), a possible mechanism for the catalytic cycle of tyrosinase is proposed by using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations, which can reasonably take effects of surrounding amino-acid residues, hydrogen bonding, and protein environment into account. The (mu-eta(2):eta(2)-peroxo)dicopper(II) species plays a role in a series of elementary processes mediated by the dicopper species of tyrosinase. A stable phenoxyl radical is involved in the reaction pathway. The catalysis has five steps of proton transfer from the phenolic O-H bond to the dioxygen moiety, O-O bond dissociation of the hydroperoxo species, C-O bond formation at an ortho position of the benzene ring, proton abstraction and migration mediated by His54, and quinone formation. The energy profile of the calculated reaction pathway is reasonable in energy as biological reactions that occur under physiological conditions. Detailed analyses of the energy profile demonstrate that the O-O bond dissociation is the rate-determining step. The activation energy for the O-O bond dissociation at the dicopper site is computed to be 14.9 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with a measured kinetic constant. As proposed recently, the His54 residue, which is flexible because it is located in a loop structure in the protein, would play a role as a general base in the proton abstraction and migration in the final stages of the reaction to produce dopaquinone.

AB  - Although 1-alkyl-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenes and a high relative amount of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene have been detected in marine oils and oil asphaltenes from Tabei uplift in the Tarim Basin, their biological sources are not determined. This paper deals with the molecular characteristics of typical marine oil asphaltenes from Tabei and Tazhong uplift in the Tarim Basin and the stable carbon isotopic signatures of individual compounds in the pyrolysates of these asphaltenes using flash pyrolysis-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (PY-GC-MS) and gas chromatograph-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-C-IRMS), respectively. Relatively abundant 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is detected in the pyrolysates of these marine oil asphaltenes from the Tarim Basin. delta C-13 values of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in the pyrolysates of oil asphaltenes vary from -19.6%. to -24.0%., while those of n-alkanes in the pyrolysates show a range from -33.2%. to -35.1%.. The 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in the pyrolysates of oil asphaltenes proves to be significantly enriched in C-13 relative to n-alkanes in the pyrolysates and oil asphaltenes by 10.8%.-15.2%. and 8.4%.-13.4%., respectively. This result indicates a contribution from photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria Chlorobiaceae to relatively abundant 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in marine oil asphaltenes from the Tarim Basin. Hence, it can be speculated that the source of most marine oil asphaltenes from the Tarim Basin was formed in a strongly reducing water body enriched in H2S under euxinic conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of salmon farming effects on marine systems in the inner seas of southern Chile: a large-scale mensurative experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY

KW  - AQUACULTURE
KW  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - The impact of salmon farming on the environment has been widely studied; there is, however, no consensus on the magnitude and quality of these effects and little information on their extent over large salmon farming areas. Forty-three salmon farm sites of which 29 are in full operation and grouped in nine locations in southern Chile were evaluated. Using statistical methods (two-way <smallcapitals>anova</smallcapitals>), no effects were found on water column variables such as nitrate, ammonia, orthophosphate and chlorophyll, whereas they were significant on sediment variables such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and organic carbon (OC), among others. Natural variability evaluation of some parameters revealed that P in sediments had the lowest coefficient of variation (23.2%) when compared with N (65.2%), particulate organic matter (POM) (139%) and OC (39%), and showed more marked salmon farming effects with no locality effects. Four of the nine locations showed stronger effects on sediments, with average P values ranging from 150 to 230 mmol that were six to nine times higher than in control sites (25 mmol). Nitrogen and carbon in sediments, while showing significant effects on salmon farming, also showed locality effects that revealed other biogenic processes influencing sediment composition. Thus, P in sediments was proposed as a promising indicator of impact on salmon farming, although the relationship with fauna in sediments was not linear and somewhat variable; more research is therefore needed to understand such connections. Considering entire geographical locations, no relationship was found between sediment conditions under salmon cages and the condition of the water column at a farm. This may indicate the possibility of high dilution rates and recycling processes, which so far preclude the detection of more global impacts beyond the cages shadow.

AB  - Open-cast mining in tropical forests causes negative impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Postmining reclamation is therefore imposed to recover the vegetation despite the lack of understanding which indicators can be used to monitor the progress of succession. This study proposes an integrated framework to assess the trajectory of vegetation succession in coal mining site in East Kalimantan, Borneo. We combine the indicators of floristic diversity of naturally growing terrestrial and epiphytic plants, survival and growth of enrichment planting of native plants, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and the measurements on micro-climate and soil conditions. We compare some indicators across the 9-year-old and 17-year-old reclaimed sites and the premining sites. The results showed that naturally growing vegetation at the reclaimed sites was at the early to midsuccession stages, with biodiversity indicators much lower than those at the premining areas, implying the necessity of native species planting. During a six-month monitoring, the enrichment planting of native species had high rates of survival and growth. Surprisingly, the above-ground carbon at the two reclamation sites were higher, up to six times larger, than that at the premining sites. While the micro-climates had been improved, the soils in the reclaimed sites were still in poor conditions. Our findings suggest that using single parameter to monitor the trajectory of vegetation succession in postmining reclamation can be biased, and integrating several monitoring measures would provide a much better assessment.

AB  - Atmospheric dust establishes an element of study to know the distribution of pollutant particles such as heavy metals and their effects on ecological systems. The objective was to determine the elemental composition of particles deposited in two species of trees as an indicator of environmental impact in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The distribution of Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis laevigata trees was taken into account in five soil uses to collect leaf material and extract atmospheric dust during the spring and summer seasons, determining the concentration of heavy metals using the ICP-MS technique. The results indicated the presence of Al> Cu> Zn> Pb> V> As> Ni> Cd> Ti> Cr> Co. Correlations with values of r(2) > 0.90 were presented between V-Ti, Ni-V, Ni-Ti, AI Ti and Cr-V. The species factor conditioned the concentrations of Al, Ti, V, Cr, Ni and Zn mainly in the particles deposited in Prosopis leaves. Particles of nine elements were conditioned by the activities of the five land uses, where the use of mineral soil affected by the presence of Al, Cd, Co, Pb, Cu and Zn. Concentrations of Cd were 6.2 times higher in the use of mining soil than in the agricultural sector; 5.9 and 5.4 times the concentrations of Co and Pb in the use of mining soil with respect to the trade and service respectively. The season had only significant effects on Cr and Pb particles. This study indicates the existence of pollutants that can affect ecological systems so it falls within the context of continued evaluation of environmental impacts.

AB  - Reintroduction is a viable conservation strategy for large carnivores however such reintroductions require robust feasibility assessments, considering ecological, management, and social factors, prior to implementation. Plans are being developed in a number of tiger range countries, including Cambodia, for tiger Panthera tigris reintroductions in response to local and national extinctions. We provide a framework for undertaking feasibility assessments for tiger, and other large carnivore, reintroductions and present a number of methodological tools, and appropriate indicators, for conducting such assessments. We apply the framework to plans by the Royal Government of Cambodia for tiger reintroduction into Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary (formally Mondulkiri Protected Forest), eastern Cambodia. Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary forms part of a large (> 13,000-km(2)) trans-boundary conservation landscape with potential to support a tiger source population. Current ungulate prey densities, assessed through robust line-transect sampling, at approximately 5.0 individuals per km(2) may be sufficient to support a breeding tiger population. However levels of protected area management and law enforcement fall below global standards for tiger recovery. Local communities, though supportive of conservation efforts, also identified a number of concerns regarding reintroduction. Therefore current ecological, social, and management conditions within SWS are not currently suitable for tiger reintroduction. However with improved and more effective law enforcement, combined with robust monitoring of the indicators within our framework, such conditions could be met. We recommend that our framework for assessing landscape suitability for reintroductions offers an effective road map for reintroduction-based recovery of tiger populations across tiger range countries.

AB  - Alpine aquatic environments are one of the harshest on earth and are sensitive indicators of climate change. In Washington, the most glaciated state in the contiguous United States, relatively little is known about the effect of loss of glacial water sources on macroinvertebrate communities. Our study compares the water quality conditions and composition of benthic macroinvertebrates from five rhithral (snowmelt-fed) and five kryal (glacially-fed) lake outlet streams in the North Cascade Mountains, WA. Kryal streams were characterized by lower water temperatures, higher discharge rates, higher turbidities, and less stable in-stream channels compared to rhithral sites. A total of 24 985 specimens representing 96 macroinvertebrate taxa were collected. Rhithral lake outlet streams had significantly higher densities and supported more taxa than kryal sites (9049 individuals m(-2) and 82 taxa versus 821 individuals m-2 and 38 taxa). Chironomidae dominated macroinvertebrate populations at all sites, although densities and taxa richness were significantly lower in kryal sites. Rhithral sites contained higher densities of non-insect taxa such as Acari, Oligochaeta, Nemathelminthes, Planariidae, and crustaceans. Kryal sites were dominated by cold stenotherm or cool eurythermal taxa and supported glacial-tolerant taxa such as chironomids Diamesa and Parorthocladuis, and the mayfly Rhithrogena. Water temperature, stream discharge, and turbidity were most strongly correlated to macroinvertebrate density and taxa richness. Our results suggest that glacial presence was the dominant factor influencing in-stream environmental conditions and macroinvertebrate assemblages of alpine lake outlet streams. Continued glacial retreat due to climate change may result in an overall loss of specialists and decreased regional diversity.

AB  - Growth in human populations causes habitat degradation for other species, which is usually gauged by physical changes to landscapes. Corresponding habitat degradation to air and water is also common, but its effects on individuals can be difficult to detect until they result in the decline or disappearance of populations. More proactive measures of pollution usually combine abiotic samples of soil, water or air with invasive sampling of expendable species, but this approach sometimes creates ethical dilemmas and has limited application for threatened species. Here, we describe the potential to measure the effects of pollution on many species of birds and fish by using ornamental traits that are expressed as coloured skin, feathers and scales. As products of sexual selection, these traits are sensitive to environmental conditions, thereby providing honest information about the condition of their bearers as ready-made biomarkers. We review the documented effects of several classes of pollutants, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, industry-related compounds and metals, on two classes of colour pigments, namely melanins and carotenoids. We find that several pollutants impede the expression of both carotenoids and brown melanin, while enhancing traits coloured by black melanin. We also review some of the current limitations of using ornamental colour as an indicator of pollution exposure, suggest avenues for future research and speculate about how advances in robotics and remote imagery will soon make it possible to measure these traits remotely and in a non-invasive manner. Wider awareness of this potential by conservation managers could foster the development of suitable model species and comparative metrics and lay a foundation for pollution monitoring that is more generalizable and biologically relevant than existing standards.

AB  - Escherichia coli is used to indicate fecal contamination in freshwater systems and is an indicator of the potential presence of human pathogens. However, naturalized E. coli strains that persist and grow in the environment confound the use of this bacterium as a fecal indicator. Here we examined the spatial and temporal distribution of E. coli in water and sediments of the Seven Mile Creek (SMC), a constructed, ephemeral watershed. E. coli concentrations showed variation by site and date, likely due to changes in temperature and rainfall. Horizontal fluorophore enhanced rep-PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that E. coli populations were very diverse and consisted of transient and naturalized strains, which were especially prevalent in sediment. E. coli fingerprints from water and sediment collected in the same year clustered together with significant overlap, indicating exchange of strains between matrices. Isolates obtained during periods of flow, but not during non-flow conditions, clustered together regardless of sample site, indicating that transport between sites occurred. Naturalized E. coli strains were found in the SMC and strains become geographically isolated and distinct during non-flow conditions. Isolates collected during late spring to fall clustered together at each site, suggesting that temperature and growth of naturalized strains are likely factors affecting population dynamics. Results of this study show that newly introduced and naturalized E. coli strains are present in the SMC. Results of this study highlight an important concern for resource managers using this species for water quality monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate changes impose requirements for many species to shift their ranges to remain within environmentally tolerable areas, but near-continuous regions of intense human land use stretching across continental extents diminish dispersal prospects for many species. We reviewed the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on species' abilities to track changing climates and existing plans to facilitate species dispersal in response to climate change through regions of intensive land uses, drawing on examples from North America and elsewhere. We identified an emerging analytical framework that accounts for variation in species' dispersal capacities relative to both the pace of climate change and habitat availability. Habitat loss and fragmentation hinder climate change tracking, particularly for specialists, by impeding both propagule dispersal and population growth. This framework can be used to identify prospective modern-era climatic refugia, where the pace of climate change has been slower than surrounding areas, that are defined relative to individual species' needs. The framework also underscores the importance of identifying and managing dispersal pathways or corridors through semi-continental land use barriers that can benefit many species simultaneously. These emerging strategies to facilitate range shifts must account for uncertainties around population adaptation to local environmental conditions. Accounting for uncertainties in climate change and dispersal capabilities among species and expanding biological monitoring programs within an adaptive management paradigm are vital strategies that will improve species' capacities to track rapidly shifting climatic conditions across landscapes dominated by intensive human land use.

AB  - Microbial communities within beach sand play a key role in nutrient cycling and are important to the nearshore ecosystem function. Escherichia coli and enterococci, two common indicators of fecal pollution, have been shown to persist in the beach sand, but little is known about how microbial community assemblages are related to these fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) reservoirs. We examined eight beaches across a geographic gradient and range of land use types and characterized the indigenous community structure in the water and the backshore, berm, and submerged sands. FIB were found at similar levels in sand at beaches adjacent to urban, forested, and agricultural land and in both the berm and backshore. However, there were striking differences in the berm and backshore microbial communities, even within the same beach, reflecting the very different environmental conditions in these beach zones in which FIB can survive. In contrast, the microbial communities in a particular beach zone were similar among beaches, including at beaches on opposite shores of Lake Michigan. The differences in the microbial communities that did exist within a beach zone correlated to nutrient levels, which varied among geographic locations. Total organic carbon and total phosphorus were higher in Wisconsin beach sand than in beach sand from Michigan. Within predominate genera, fine-scale sequence differences could be found that distinguished the populations from the two states, suggesting a biogeographic effect. This work demonstrates that microbial communities are reflective of environmental conditions at freshwater beaches and are able to provide useful information regarding long-term anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Coastal dolphins are regarded as indicators of changes in coastal marine ecosystem health that could impact humans utilizing the marine environment for food or recreation. Necropsy and histology examinations were performed on 35 Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and five Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) incidentally caught in shark nets off the KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa, between 2010 and 2012. Parasitic lesions included pneumonia (85%), abdominal and thoracic serositis (75%), gastroenteritis (70%), hepatitis (62%), and endometritis (42%). Parasitic species identified were Halocercus sp. (lung), Crassicauda sp. (skeletal muscle) and Xenobalanus globicipitis (skin). Additional findings included bronchiolar epithelial mineralisation (83%), splenic filamentous tags (45%), non-suppurative meningoencephalitis (39%), and myocardial fibrosis (26%). No immunohistochemically positive reaction was present in lesions suggestive of dolphin morbillivirus, Toxoplasma gondii and Brucella spp. The first confirmed cases of lobomycosis and sarcocystosis in South African dolphins were documented. Most lesions were mild, and all animals were considered to be in good nutritional condition, based on blubber thickness and muscle mass. Apparent temporal changes in parasitic disease prevalence may indicate a change in the host/parasite interface. This study provided valuable baseline information on conditions affecting coastal dolphin populations in South Africa and, to our knowledge, constitutes the first reported systematic health assessment in incidentally caught dolphins in the Southern Hemisphere. Further research on temporal disease trends as well as disease pathophysiology and anthropogenic factors affecting these populations is needed.

AB  - Most impacts on providing ecosystem services (ESs) are related to land use changes that may cause ecosystem fragmentation and loss of ecosystem functions. Spatial planning, focusing on sustainable landscape development, should consider the local potential for providing ESs as well possible impacts due to land use changes. The results of a large number of recent studies on ES assessment are difficult to replicate and integrate into landscape planning or definition of land use policies. The time and resource constraints, needed in data gathering and analysis, limit local administrations in the concern about ES.
   Extending the approach of spatially explicit benefit transfer, we present an expert-based estimation of land use potential in providing ES. We enhanced ES estimations related to different land use classes (in terms of (sic)/ha year) by considering "local conditions" such as elevation and distance from urban areas, assuming these spatial characteristics can affect ES provisioning. The adaptation for "local conditions" was performed through expert consultation, using Delphi survey and focus groups, involving 46 experts from 10 Italian research institutions. In detail, we used land cover maps for 1990 and 2000, and aggregated the results on the province scale. The results show spatial pattern of gains and losses in ES values for Italian provinces. The province level of aggregation seems to be effective for dealing with strategic phase of spatial planning. By eliciting possible consequences of land use changes, this knowledge framework may foster strategies for sustainable landscape planning and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcrete in Alfisols on Precambrian silicate rocks is studied here in an attempt to reconstruct paleorainfall trends in semiarid South India. Facies of observed carbonate accumulation are pseudomycelium, calcrete nodules, nodular horizons, hardpan, and laminar horizons. Based on geochemical and Sr isotope tracing we relate the presence of calcrete to local geologic conditions within the Precambrian basement, notably discrete Ca-rich metamorphic outcrops, and rule out eolian input. Micromorphologic analysis reveals a multi-stage origin of the calcretes involving soil, colluvial, geochemical and biologic processes mostly in vadose environments. Preliminary U-Th ages of 190-200 ka obtained on calcrete nodules suggest a major phase of Ca release (rock weathering) and precipitation during marine oxygen isotope stage 7. The calcrete thus indicates fairly stable semiarid conditions at the >= 200 ky time scale despite fluctuations around an annual rainfall average close to current values (similar to 700 mm). The stability of the Western Ghats barrier as a shield to the southwest monsoon explains the long-term average stability of the pedoclimatic environment in the rainshadow zone. The radiometric ages suggest that weathering may occur massively at discrete intervals of geologic history, during spikes of humidity in the paleoclimatic record. The rest of the time is spent recycling and redistributing the products of weathering incrementally at landscape scale, within seasonal cycles of a relatively stable semi-arid climate. Dating the calcrete therefore does not equate with dating the soil but, instead, the residence times of nodules in a dynamic soil system in which different constituents have different turnover rates.

AB  - A biomarker study was undertaken using the Calico scallop Argopecten gibbus to assess the ecotoxicological effects of a semi-submerged municipal dump on the adjacent patch reef lagoon ecosystem (Castle harbour, Bermuda). Caged scallops were deployed in situ for 2 months at various distances from the dump (50 in, 900 m and 2.7 km) and at a reference site (14 km). A suite of biomarkers comprising metallothionein (MT), lipid peroxidation (LPO), vitellin-like proteins (Vn), glutathione S-transferase (GST), DNA strand breaks and condition factor (CF) were investigated in various tissues of the scallop (gill, digestive gland and gonad). Levels of heavy metals were also measured in the whole scallop soft tissue. While there was some variation in response between tissues, in general the results indicated that the dump was negatively impacting scallops deployed in the adjacent marine environment: elevated levels of MT, DNA strand breaks, Vn and GST and reduced condition factor were found for scallops deployed nearest to the dump and at the site 1.5 km from this point source of contamination (Tuckers town) in Castle harbour, with respect to the reference site, North Rock (although this exhibited some degree of metal contamination). The gills from scallops deployed at the dump site were the most responsive tissue, with the highest expression of MT, LPO and DNA damage. This study indicates the potential of the Calico scallop as a convenient bioindicator species in the marine tropical benthos. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the last petroleum shortages, environmental aspects are becoming more important. This has driven the scientific community to find new environmentally friendly solutions that help to minimize exhaust emissions and natural resources depletion. To achieve this, the environmental implications as well as critical points involved in each process must be analyzed, making possible the design of the best environmental strategies. Life cycle assessment (LCA) consists of an ultimate tool that provides a comparison between products, process, or services, thus helping to develop environmental improvements. In the present work, an LCA of a building air conditioning air-air heat pump has been carried out. To accomplish this objective, two methodologies have been tested-the Eco-Indicator99 and the EPS2000. Emissions and environmental impact determination, including those produced during the heat pump manufacture as well as the ones produced during the heat pump functioning were the primary analyzed parameters. Finally, a comparative long-term profitability study between a heat pump and a gas boiler has been carried out. External costs due to the environmental impact were also considered. Results show that EPS2000 is mainly focused on the energetic and nonenergetic resources decrease, while the Eco-indicator99 methodology is mainly focused on human health. The main impacts are due to resources depletion, life expectancy, and refrigerant (EPS2000), and to respiratory effects of inorganic substances, carcinogenesis, and climatic change (Eco-indicator99). Also, long-term profitability studies reveal better results for the heat pump compared to the boiler. The longer the life expectancy, the higher the economic profitability of the heat pump. Furthermore, the heat pump provides an alternative that does not need any additional investment for cooling requirements during summertime, while the boiler does. This factor could double the boiler investment costs.

AB  - Surviving the seedling phase is crucial for the establishment of plant individuals and populations. In ecosystems with dynamic water availability such as temperate grasslands, seedlings should adjust their growth strategy not only to match the current conditions but also to secure resource acquisition in the future. Here, we explored evolutionary adaptations determining plant early growth strategies in herbaceous species of temperate grasslands differing in their requirements for soil water availability. We chose 15 plant genera, within which we selected species differing in their Ellenberg indicator values for moisture. We cultivated the seedlings under standard conditions with sufficient water supply for 4 weeks. Subsequently, we measured length-based and mass-based shoot:root ratio to investigate seedling growth strategy and its association with species ecological niche. Seed size and content of soil-borne nutrients were considered as potential covariates affecting this association. Linear mixed-effect models identified the length-based shoot:root ratio of seedlings was positively associated with soil moisture requirements in a congeneric species comparison. Nitrogen and phosphorus seed concentrations had an additional negative effect on the shoot:root ratio. Neither of these trends was found for the mass-based shoot:root ratio. We demonstrated for the first time that there might be a general adaptation modifying the seedling shoot:root ratio according to the species niche position on the soil moisture gradient in temperate grassland species across a broad range of angiosperm phylogeny. This adaptation seems to be affected by seed mineral nutrient reserves and may operate in parallel to the well-known phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Background Drought is a major environmental disaster that causes crop yield loss worldwide. Metabolites are involved in various environmental stress responses of plants. However, the genetic control of metabolomes underlying crop environmental stress adaptation remains elusive. Results Here, we perform non-targeted metabolic profiling of leaves for 385 maize natural inbred lines grown under well-watered as well as drought-stressed conditions. A total of 3890 metabolites are identified and 1035 of these are differentially produced between well-watered and drought-stressed conditions, representing effective indicators of maize drought response and tolerance. Genetic dissections reveal the associations between these metabolites and thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which represented 3415 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) and 2589 candidate genes. 78.6% of mQTLs (2684/3415) are novel drought-responsive QTLs. The regulatory variants that control the expression of the candidate genes are revealed by expression QTL (eQTL) analysis of the transcriptomes of leaves from 197 maize natural inbred lines. Integrated metabolic and transcriptomic assays identify dozens of environment-specific hub genes and their gene-metabolite regulatory networks. Comprehensive genetic and molecular studies reveal the roles and mechanisms of two hub genes, Bx12 and ZmGLK44, in regulating maize metabolite biosynthesis and drought tolerance. Conclusion Our studies reveal the first population-level metabolomes in crop drought response and uncover the natural variations and genetic control of these metabolomes underlying crop drought adaptation, demonstrating that multi-omics is a powerful strategy to dissect the genetic mechanisms of crop complex traits.

AB  - In this study, we considered 41 fens located in northern and central Poland. In our main hypothesis, we assumed that the base chemical composition of fen waters primarily depends on the hydrological regime, indicating a relationship to morphogenetic type of fen. We analyzed 40 physicochemical parameters of peatland porewater samples and discussed the relation of water chemistry with the hydrological and morphogenetic conditions of the individual fens. Further, we considered the additional factors that could significantly modify water chemistry. Physicochemical and hydrological parameters indicated a large diversity in habitat conditions among the investigated fens. Parameters significantly differentiating the examined objects were the concentrations of basic anions and cations and the associated electrolytic conductivity. Higher ion concentrations indicated a greater share of groundwater in the recharge of the investigated wetlands. Fens having a greater inflow of groundwater were characterized primarily by higher concentrations of calcium, bicarbonates and electrolytic conductivity, and were usually associated with tunnel and melt-out valleys. However, in some cases, the higher electrolytic conductivity resulted from anthropogenic pollution. Therefore, the use of indicators to separate such anthropogenically influenced sites from those naturally enriched in basic ions is crucial. Moreover, human-related disturbance of fen ecosystems were also demonstrated by elevated concentrations of certain metals and nutrients. We found that the processes responsible for the mobilization and inflow of metals played a secondary role in the diversification of the chemical composition of the waters of the investigated fens.

AB  - Sea level rise is a fundamental driver of ecosystem change and has the potential to shift the spatial distributions of habitats more rapidly than species can adapt. Rapid sea level rise and associated saltwater intrusion have negative impacts on coastal environments, including loss of habitat for species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. In Florida's largest wetland, the Everglades, the availability of small fishes that are prey for wading birds serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. In the southwestern part of the ecosystem, sea level rise and a reduction in freshwater flow have converted formerly freshwater marsh into an estuarine mangrove-dominated landscape. In this study, we sampled fish communities in this southwest portion of the Everglades exposed to a range of saline conditions. Biomass of native fishes was highest at a salinity value of approximately 25 parts per thousand, while non-native biomass decreased with increasing salinity. Applying salinity change scenarios, we determined that a 10% reduction from the salinity levels recorded in this study would be optimal for biomass of native fishes. The baseline data we collected on non-native fishes at the site will be useful for monitoring as restoration progresses and for managers working on invasive species control. This region has been actively undergoing ecosystem restoration for the last decade, but restored freshwater flow closer to historical conditions is still years away. Without increased freshwater inflow from hydrologic restoration, rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion may provide conservation challenges for wading birds and their prey-base fishes.

AB  - As seagrasses decline worldwide, determining their phenotypic variability in response to human altered environmental factors becomes important to better understand their acclimation strategies. Many studies have reported seagrass responses to environmental gradients of single parameters, using either single or multiple metrics. However, studies of species' phenotypic variations along environmental gradients that include several environmental factors are rather scarce. In this study, we evaluated and compared the responses of Halodule wrightii and Ruppia maritima at different organizational levels (meadow/shoot, leaf and biochemical level) to key environmental factors, such as urbanization, light availability, salinity and sediment characteristics in a subtropical Brazilian coastal lagoon. Both species tolerated the variable environmental conditions across the lagoon, but showed species-specific differences in the adjustments at certain organizational levels. Halodule wrightii, an opportunistic species, expressed phenotypic responses mostly at the meadows/shoot and biochemical level, while the colonizer R. maritima exhibited phenotypic variability mostly constrained to the biochemical level. Also, determinations on a few selected meadows showed species-specific photosynthetic responses to environmental conditions. These differences might be related to the species' life history, with R. maritima performing adjustments at organizational levels with a fast response time, while the longer life span of H. wrightii makes also investments in modifications at the shoot and meadow level useful. Thus, this study demonstrates differences in seagrass acclimation strategies in response to environmental variability and, as a first study in this region, it also provides useful baseline data that will allow detecting potential changes and/or deterioration of the habitat.

AB  - Since von Humboldt, recognizing and using elevational subdivisions is at the core of biogeographical and ecological studies in mountain ecosystems. However, despite the large use of vegetational belts, their conceptual definition and practical identification appear to be surprisingly loose and inconsistent. Many authors use variations in climatic conditions to identify elevational belts. These belts are useful to set a framework for ecological studies but cannot be considered a surrogate of vegetational belts, because factors different from climate play a major role in determining the distribution of plant assemblages. Vegetation physiognomy can be used to identify 'biome-type' belts that are useful for comparisons across geographical areas with different floras. However, to properly reflect ecological conditions at local scale, vegetational belts should be based on species composition. One of the most effective statistical approaches for this purpose is the use spatially constrained cluster analysis. The use of indicator species analysis may be also recommended to identify the species that most characterize vegetational belts. This can help researchers to identify belts in the field. Since species identification can be difficult, some authors use plant functional types for belt delimitation. Plant functional types can be helpful to trace the adaptative responses of vegetation along elevational gradients, but cannot be recommended as a standard way to identify belts. In general, criteria to identify vegetational belts can be based on both vegetation structure (namely physiognomy and structural parameters) and/or species composition, depending on the scale and the aim of the analyses, and they should be clearly stated.

AB  - Our work analyzed Indigenous partnership arrangements and conditions associated with natural resource development, specifically, the capacities identified by Indigenous peoples needed to participate in resource wealth generation. The review was needed to take stock of previously understudied and new partnerships emerging in Canada's rapidly growing natural resource sectors where cross-cultural collaboration is becoming a feature, and in some cases a requirement, of new ventures. Results illustrate nine categories of arrangements (i.e., land use/regional planning processes; IBAs; MOUs; Indigenous businesses, joint ventures; environmental assessments; revenue sharing; advisory committees; and regional economic councils) used by Indigenous communities and their partners to assert their control and derive benefits from natural resource extraction. These included highly formal and technical legal arrangements, such as Impact and Benefit Agreements, and less formal arrangements such as Memorandums of Understandings and advisory committees. Using the five capitals' (social, human, financial, built, and natural) approach we also synthesized existing knowledge of partnership capacities and benefits. We found benefits in each of the five capital areas, most of which were forms of human capital. Employment (50%), improved decision making (46%), and also financial support (33%) were the top cited benefits. Results build to the conclusion that differences exist between capacities needed to start working together (pre-existing supporting conditions), and those built through collaboration (new or enhanced capitals as beneficial outcomes). Development models will produce more and sustainable benefits where capacity building is both an explicit process objective and outcome of new partnership designs.

AB  - To investigate the potential effects of physiological stress on stable isotope (SI) ratios in oysters, we transplanted hatchery-reared oysters to reefs that experienced different concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) in Mobile Bay, Alabama, USA, a freshwater dominated estuary that experiences periodic hypoxia. We monitored physical, biological, and chemical parameters of the environment and biological responses in oysters, including growth, survival, and carbon and nitrogen SI ratios in tissues. Oysters at the low DO site (3.66 +/- 0.05 mg/L) had similar to 1 & higher delta N-15 values in tissue than oysters at the higher DO site (6.00 +/- 0.06 mg/L). Oysters grown at the low DO site also had lower survival (25%) and no growth compared to oysters at the higher DO site, which had 96% survival and growth rates up to 38 mm/d. Multivariate and regression statistics related DO concentration to changes in delta N-15 values in three different oyster tissues (adductor muscle, gut gland, and gill), regardless of similarity in suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll a concentrations (food quantity), C:N (food quality), and SI composition in available foods between sites. The increased delta N-15 values in oyster tissues under low DO conditions during this study were consistent with known starvation responses in which oysters stop feeding and catabolize tissues. These data indicate that environmental conditions related to physiological stress can affect SI ratios in oysters in a similar manner to changes in diet composition. Small changes in SI ratios, therefore, may be physiologically significant indicators of environmental stress. When analyzing SI ratios for food web dynamics and source tracing, potential for confounding effects of environmental stressors should be considered.

AB  - Creative class refers to the demographic segment composed of intellectuals, knowledge intensive workers and artists in different fields. Creative class is of essential social significance in that its members are capable of booming regional economy through innovation. Rather few studies have empirically examined the neighborhood social determinants of intra-urban creative class concentrations (CCCs), especially in the developing countries. Using the case of Shanghai city in China, this paper characterizes the CCCs in relation to social tolerance and life quality supportive conditions (LQSCs) at district level. Data for CCCs are collected from Shanghai's Population Census (2010) at the district level. A set of social diversity indices (ethnic, education, income, marriage status, and birth place) are used as proxy for tolerance and LQSCs are described by a set of indicators from 8 domains (job chance, medical care, educational facilities, commutation, food resources, housing, leisure, and natural amenities). Multivariable linear regression is employed to identify the determinants of CCCs. Results show that both neighborhood social tolerance and LQSCs have significant influences on different categories of CCCs. In particular, creative class is attracted by the neighborhoods that are open and welcoming to the outsiders. In addition, creative class emphasizes accessible medical care, traveling convenience, elementary education institution, great housing choices, and more natural amenities in their neighborhood. The variance decomposition method demonstrates that neighborhood LQSC determinants are more important for the intellectuals, knowledge workers and total CCCs. For the artists, the neighborhood social tolerance determinants are more influential. Our study generates a set of neighborhood social indicators to understand the intra-urban CCCs.

AB  - The calcium/aluminum (Ca/Al) molar ratio of the soil solution provides a valuable measurement endpoint or ecological indicator for identification of approximate thresholds beyond which the risk of forest damage from Al stress and nutrient imbalances increases. The Ca/Al ratio can also be used as an indicator to assess forest ecosystem changes over time in response to acidic deposition, forest harvesting, or other processes contributing to acid soil infertility. Based on a critical review of literature on Al stress, we estimate that there is a 50:50 risk of adverse impacts on tree growth or nutrition when the soil solution Ca/Al ratio is as low as 1.0, a 75% risk when the soil solution ratio is as low as 0.5, and nearly a 100% risk when the soil solution Ca/Al molar ratio is as low as 0.2. The Ca/Al ratio of the soil solution can be corroborated with other complementary indices. Our analysis found that threshold conditions for potential forest impacts from Al stress are indicated by four successive measurement endpoints: (i) soil base saturation less than 15% of effective CEC; (ii) soil solution Ca/Al molar ratio less than or equal to 1.0 (for 50% risk); (iii) fine root tissue Ca/Al molar ratio less than or equal to 0.2 (for 50% risk); and (iv) a foliar tissue Ca/Al molar ratio less than or equal to 12.5 (for 50% risk). With appropriate precautions and caveats, these sequential indices based on the Ca/Al ratio provide a means of distinguishing site conditions where Al stress is likely to affect tree growth adversely.

AB  - Phenotypic heterogeneity within microbial populations arises even when the cells are exposed to putatively constant and homogeneous conditions. The outcome of this phenomenon can affect the whole function of the population, resulting in, for example, new "adapted" metabolic strategies and impacting its fitness at given environmental conditions. Accounting for phenotypic heterogeneity becomes thus necessary, due to its relevance in medical and applied microbiology as well as in environmental processes. Still, a comprehensive evaluation of this phenomenon requires a common and unique method of quantitation, which allows for the comparison between different studies carried out with different approaches. Consequently, in this study, two widely applicable indices for quantitation of heterogeneity were developed. The heterogeneity coefficient (HC) is valid when the population follows unimodal activity, while the differentiation tendency index (DTI) accounts for heterogeneity implying outbreak of subpopulations and multimodal activity. We demonstrated the applicability of HC and DTI for heterogeneity quantitation on stable isotope probing with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIP-nanoSIMS), flow cytometry, and optical microscopy datasets. The HC was found to provide a more accurate and precise measure of heterogeneity, being at the same time consistent with the coefficient of variation (CV) applied so far. The DTI is able to describe the differentiation in single-cell activity within monoclonal populations resolving subpopulations with low cell abundance, individual cells with similar phenotypic features (e.g., isotopic content close to natural abundance, as detected with nanoSIMS). The developed quantitation approach allows for a better understanding on the impact and the implications of phenotypic heterogeneity in environmental, medical and applied microbiology, microbial ecology, cell biology, and biotechnology.

AB  - The tropical, macro-tidal estuary of Darwin Harbour is in near-pristine condition and supports a rich biodiversity. However, urban and industrial development pressures are increasing in many parts of the catchment. This challenges us to improve our understanding of how the harbour's ecosystem responds to environmental threats andhowbest to optimise future development while preserving valuable ecosystem services. Here, we synthesise our current knowledge of several environmental aspects of the harbour and its catchment.
   The intertidal zone and its abundant mangrove forests account for a major proportion of primary productivity in Darwin Harbour. These areas also play a key role in preserving water quality by intercepting catchment-derived pollutants and they substantially influence the movement of sediment through the estuary. Darwin Harbour mangroves generally remain in healthy condition with extensive areas of highly biodiverse habitats near urban and industrial developments.
   The future health of Darwin Harbour depends substantially on the protection of the mangrove estate against further pressures from coastal land clearing, catchment derived pollutants and accelerated sedimentation from runoff and dredging. Rapid sea level rise (currently approximate to 8 mm/year) is a further significant threat to the stratified floristic assemblages and specialised invertebrate fauna typical of Darwin Harbour mangrove forests. These threats require development of new sensitive harbour-wide monitoring techniques to provide early warning of the excess accumulation of stressors and disruption to ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Anthropogenic influences from increased nutrients and chemical contaminants, to habitat alterations and climate change, can have significant effects on fish populations. Adverse effects monitoring, utilizing biomarkers from the organismsl to the molecular level, can be used to assess the cumulative effects on fishes and other organisms. Fish health has been used worldwide as an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health. The necropsy-based fish health assessment provides data on visible abnormalities and lesions, parasites, condition and organosomatic indices. These can be compared by site, season and sex, as well as temporally, to document change over time. Severity ratings can be assigned to various observations to calculate a fish health index for more quantitative assessment. A drawback of the necropsy-based assessment is that it is based on visual observations and condition factors, which are not as sensitive as tissue and subcellular biomarkers for sublethal effects. Additionally, it is rarely possible to identify causes or risk factors associated with observed abnormalities. So, for instance a raised lesion or "tumor on the fins, lips or body surface may be a neoplasm. However, it could also be a response to a parasite, chronic inflammation or hyperplasia of normal cells in response to an irritant. Conversely, neoplasms, certain parasites, other infectious agents and many tissue changes are not visible and so may be underestimated. However, during the necropsy-based assessment, blood (plasma), tissues for histopathology (microscopic pathology), genomics and other molecular analyses, and otoliths for aging can be collected. These downstream analyses, together with geospatial analyses, habitat assessments, water quality and contaminant analyses can all be important in comprehensive ecosystem evaluations.

AB  - Abuja, Nigeria's capital city has witnessed remarkable expansion, growth and developmental activities since its inception in 1976. This mass inrush and settlement of people often leads to the replacement of the natural land cover with urban infrastructural facilities resulting in micro-climate change and worsening thermal environmental conditions. It is therefore pertinent to study the thermal environment of the city if Abuja will avoid the associated problems of growing and expanding city like many others in the world. Thus this study examines the use of remote sensing and geographic information system in mapping the temperature humidity index (THI) as human comfort indicator relative to land use land cover change in Abuja using Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper ? and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor data of 1987, 1999, 2009 and 2014. This is to assess the changes that have taken place between these periods. Subsequently, an attempt was made at comparing differences in the THI between five different land cover classes: water body, built-up area, closed canopy vegetation, open vegetation and waste land. The results show that the declining trend of vegetation cover between 1987-1999, and 2009-2014 saw a rise in the region with THI > 26 (discomfort) while the periods between 1999 and 2009 where there was a remarkable improvement in the vegetation cover saw an increase in region where comfortable condition is achieved. The discomfort index class category is the most dominant across most of the land cover classes except in the water body and closed canopy class categories. This order of dominance is the highest in wasteland and built-up areas land use/land cover categories.

AB  - The research aim was to understand how variation of temperature and water availability drives trait assemblage of seminatural grasslands in sub-Mediterranean climate, where climate change is expected to intensify summer aridity. In the central Italy, we recorded species abundance and elevation, slope aspect and angle in 129 plots. The traits we analysed were life span, growth form, clonality, belowground organs, leaf traits, plant height, seed mass, and palatability. We used Ellenberg's indicators as a proxy to assess air temperature and soil moisture gradients. From productive to harsh conditions, we observed a shift from tolerance to avoidance strategies, and a change in resource allocation strategies to face competition and stress or that maximize exploitation of patchily distributed soil resource niches. In addition, we found that the increase of temperature and water scarcity leads to the establishment of regeneration strategies that enable plants to cope with the unpredictability of changes in stress intensity and duration. Since the dry habitats of higher elevations are also constrained by winter cold stress, we argue that, within the sub-Mediterranean bioclimate, climate change will likely lead to a variation in dominance inside plant communities rather than a shift upwards of species ranges. At higher elevations, drought-adaptive traits might become more abundant on south-facing slopes that are less stressed by winter low temperatures; traits related to productive conditions and cold stress would be replaced on north-facing slopes by those adapted to overcome both the drought and the cold stresses.

AB  - Sedimentary diatom profiles from saline lakes are frequently used to reconstruct lakewater salinity as an indicator of drought. However, diatom-inferred salinity (DI-salinity) reconstructions from geographically proximal sites in the Great Plains (USA) have yielded disparate results. This study explores how physical changes in lake habitat resulting from drought may affect climate inferences from salinity reconstructions. Differences in relationships among drought, lake-level change, and diatom community structure over the last century were examined for three saline lakes in the northern Great Plains with dissimilar DI-salinity records. At each site, models were developed relating available planktic:benthic (P:B) habitat area to lake-level change, and models were compared with instrumental drought records and fossil diatoms to understand how drought conditions were recorded in sedimentary diatom assemblages. The degree to which DI-salinity tracked drought variation was affected by site-specific physical characteristics that influenced the relationship between lake-level change and P:B habitat zonation within each lake. Moon Lake showed the strongest correlation between drought and DI-salinity, although this relationship was weaker during wetter conditions, as highstands resulted in a larger influx of benthic diatoms. At Coldwater Lake, a dual-basin system, P:B varied depending on lake level, which apparently reduced the correlation between DI-salinity and drought. At Lake Cochrane, the simplest and freshest of the three basins, the P:B of fossil diatoms was a better proxy for drought than DI-salinity. The integration of additional ecological characteristics into interpretations of paleoclimate records, particularly for biologically-based proxies, may improve reconstructions of regional patterns of climate variation.

AB  - We investigated the mineral composition and trace element contents of dustfall with different deposited phases at the Minqin Oasis, in China's Hexi Corridor. The contents of elements such as Pb, Cd, Cu, As, Sb, Se, Rb, Cs, and Ba (believed to be of anthropogenic origin) indicated that the significance of human impacts on dust emissions increased from 1970s to the early 2000s. However, variations in the content of elements including Sc, Mn, Na, Cr, V, Eu, Ce, Nb, Zr, La, and Ce (believed to originate from natural processes such as physical and chemical weathering) show no obvious changes in the major potential dust source areas (PSAs) in this region. In addition, analysis of the assemblage of trace elements in dustfall indicated that the elements assumed to originate from anthropogenic and natural processes appear to be intertwined, leading to difficulties and uncertainties in identifying the PSAs and evaluating the significance of human impacts on dust emissions. Comparisons of the element contents of dustfall collected in Beijing and Minqin with similar data for Beijing show that under different conditions some differences in ranges are permitted; the contents of most trace elements were similar even though the dustfall in the two areas came from different sources. These results suggest that before attempting to identify major PSAs, researchers should perform an integrated analysis that includes the mineral, elemental, geomorphological, vegetation cover, climatic conditions, and other characteristics of the regions being studied.

AB  - High levels of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in surface waters is a common problem in urban areas that often leads to impairment of beneficial uses such as swimming. Once impaired, common management and regulatory solutions include development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and other water quality management plans. A critical element of these plans is establishment of a "reference" level of exceedances against which to assess management goals and TMDL compliance. The goal of this study was to provide information on indicator bacteria contributions from natural streams in undeveloped catchments throughout southern California during dry weather, non-storm conditions. To help establish a regional reference data set, bacteria levels [i.e. Escherichia coli (E. coli), enterococci and total coliforms] were measured from 15 unimpaired streams in 11 southern California watersheds weekly for one full year. Concentrations measured from reference areas were typically between one to two orders of magnitude lower than levels found in developed watersheds. Nearly 82% of the time, samples did not exceed daily and monthly bacterial indicator thresholds. E. coli had the lowest daily percent exceedance (1.5%). A total of 13.7% of enterococci exceeded daily thresholds. Indicator bacteria levels fluctuated seasonally with an average of 79% of both enterococci and total coliforms exceedances occurring during summer months (June to August). Temperature, at all sites, explained about one-half the variation in total coliforms density suggesting that stream temperatures regulated bacterial populations. Accounting for natural background levels will allow for management targets that are more reflective of the contributions from natural sources.

AB  - It is widely accepted that alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) is an efficient indicator of phosphate limitation in freshwater phytoplankton communities. In this study, we investigated whether the response in APA to phosphate limitation differs among the taxa in a mixed phytoplankton assemblage. We used the new enzyme-labeled fluorescence (ELF) technique, which allows microscopic detection of phosphate limitation in individual cells of multiple species. The most prominent findings of this study were that alkaline phosphatase (AP) was induced in many, but not all taxa and that different taxa, as well as different cells within a single taxon, experienced different degrees of phosphate stress under the same environmental conditions. Our approach was to manipulate the limiting nutrient in a natural freshwater phytoplankton community by incubating lake water in the laboratory. We induced nitrogen (N) or phosphate limitation through additions of inorganic nutrients. Both the ELF assay and bulk APA indicated that the lake phytoplankton were not phosphate limited at the start of the experiment. During the experiment, several chlorophyte taxa (e.g., Eudorina and an unidentified solitary spiny coccoid) were driven to phosphate limitation when inorganic N was added, as evidenced by a higher percentage of ELF-labeled cells relative to controls, whereas other chlorophyte taxa such as Actinastrum and Dicryosphaerium were not phosphate stressed under these conditions. In the phosphate-limited treatments, little or no ELF labeling was observed in any cyanobacterial taxa. Furthermore, all taxa observed after the ELF labeling procedure (>10-mum fraction) were labeled with ELF at least on one occasion, demonstrating the wide applicability of the ELF method. By using ELF labeling in tandem with bulk APA, the resolution and analysis of phosphate limitation was increased, allowing the identification of specific phosphate-stressed taxa.

AB  - Bulk-geochemical and biomarker (molecular fossil) data were collected for four Cenomanian-Turonian sections in the Western Interior Basin, USA. The four sections represent a 900 km wide transect across the basin from Kansas to New Mexico. Rock-Eval and biomarker analyses indicate an east-west thermal maturity trend due to progressive deeper burial associated with the tectonic flexure of the foreland basin since the Cenonamian-Turonian. At each site the source of extractable organic matter is dominantly marine with minor terrestrial contribution. The presence of isorenieratene derivatives in samples from Bunker Hill (KS), Pueblo (CO), and Red Wash (NM) indicates the presence of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium in the water column, and shows that the southern part of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS) experienced events of photic zone anoxia. At maximum transgression, sedimentary features indicative of water column oxygenation occur within single beds with geochemical evidence of photic zone anoxia. This is consistent with a scenario in which bottom waters experienced alternating oxic/dysoxic and anoxic conditions. These so-called 'intermittent anoxic events' underline the high variability in redox conditions in the WIS. The distribution of isorenieratene derivatives shows a dynamic water column structure of the WIS, and indicates that anoxia was a permanent feature of the transgressive and regressive intervals of the Greenhorn Cyclothem, rather than at maximum transgression. Hence, the oceanographic circulation is dominated by near field effects inherent to the seaway, rather than by direct proto-Atlantic elements such as the oceanic anoxic event (OAE).

AB  - The mercury rejected in the water system, from mining operations and lixiviation of soils after deforestation, is considered to be the main contributors to the contamination of the ecosystem in the Amazon Basin. The objectives of the present study were to examine cytogenetic functions in peripheral lymphocytes within a population living on the banks of the Tapajos River with respect to methylmercury (MeHg) contamination, using hair mercury as a biological indicator of exposure. Our investigation shows a clear relation between methylmercury contamination and cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes at levels well below 50 micrograms/gram, the level at which initial clinical signs and symptoms of mercury poisoning occur. The first apparent biological effect with increasing MeHg hair level was the impairment of lymphocyte proliferation measured as mitotic index (MI). The relation between mercury concentration in hair and MI suggests that this parameter, an indicator of changes in lymphocytes and their ability to respond to culture conditions, may be an early marker of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in humans and should be taken into account in the preliminary evaluation of the risks to populations exposed it? vivo. This is the first report showing clear cytotoxic effects of long-term exposure to MeHg. Although the results strongly suggest that, under the conditions examined here, MeHg is both a spindle poison and a clastogen, the biological significance of these observations are as yet unknown. A long-term follow-up of these subjects should be undertaken.

AB  - The late Pliocene, similar to 33-3.0 Ma, is the most recent interval of sustained global warmth in the geologic past This window is the focus of climate reconstruction efforts by the US. Geological Survey's Pliocene Research, Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) Data/Model Cooperative, and may provide a useful climate analog for the coming century. Reconstructions of past surface ocean conditions proximal to the Antarctic continent are essential to understanding the sensitivity of the cryosphere to this key interval in Earth's climate evolution. An exceptional marine sediment core collected from the southwestern Ross Sea (78 degrees S), Antarctica, during ANDRILL's McMurdo Ice Shelf Project preserves evidence of dramatic fluctuations between grounded ice and productive, open ocean conditions during the late Pliocene, reflecting orbitally-paced glacial/interglacial cycling. In this near-shore record, diatom-rich sediments are recovered from interglacial intervals; two of these diatomites, from similar to 3.2 Ma and 3.03 Ma, are within the PRISM chronologic window. The diatom assemblages identified in PRISM-age late Pliocene diatom-rich sediments are distinct from those in mid-Pliocene and later Pliocene/Pleistocene intervals recovered from AND-1B, and comprise both extant taxa with well-constrained ecological preferences and a diverse extinct flora, some members of which are previously undescribed from Antarctic sediments. Both units are dominated by Chaetoceros resting spores, an indicator of high productivity and stratification that is present at much lower abundance in materials both older and younger than the PRISM-age sediments. Newly described species of the genus Fragilariopsis, which first appear in the AND-1B record at 32 Ma, are the most abundant extinct members of the PRISM-age assemblages. Other extant species with established environmental affinities, such as Fragilariopsis sublinearis, F. curta, Stellarima microtrias, and Thalassiothrix antarctica, are present at lower abundances. Environmental inferences drawn from extant diatom assemblages are in good agreement with those from Chaetoceros resting spores and the Fragilariopsis radiation. All three lines of evidence indicate the onset of late Pliocene cooling in the Ross Sea near-shore environment at 3.2 Ma, with intensification and possible regional persistence of summer sea ice by 3.03 Ma. An important implication of this research is the indication that the Ross Ice Shelf fluctuated dramatically on orbital timescales at a time when nearshore Antarctic conditions were only modestly warmer than present.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are always changing due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Many studies have described the changes through landscape indicators, but landscape stability and processes are considered less in existing studies. Therefore, it is essential to establish effective indicators to detect the landscape changes and stability. In this study, three indicators were proposed to characterize the vegetation landscape stability and processes based on the system fluctuation and stability theory, which were applied to a typical semiarid grassland coal mine region. The indicators were calculated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data griding, which characterized the NDVI central tendency, heterogeneity, and relative fluctuation in each grid through spatio-temporal analysis. The study has confirmed that the dynamic process and stability of each landscape type identified through the three indicators were in good agreement with the on-site conditions. Firstly, the natural grassland was in a macro-stable state generally. Secondly, partial regions associated with open-pit mining regions were identified as severe disturbance regions, with grassland entirely replaced by the bare land, while the grasslands surrounding were identified as mild disturbance regions, with the stability decreasing. Finally, the surface subsidence was characterized by ground surface deformation and fracture, which causes mild disturbance to the grassland landscape. However, the surface collapse, characterized by subsidence pits, has always caused grassland instability. Moreover, the reclaimed grassland is prone to deterioration and lack of stability under severe natural conditions such as drought. We suggest this study could be used to identify the stability and dynamic trend of grassland landscape.

AB  - Climate change/variability and subsequent exacerbation of extremes are affecting human and ecological health across the globe. This study aims at unpacking hydro-climatic extremes in a snow-fedMarshyangdiwatershed, which has a potential for water infrastructure development, located in Central Nepal. Bias-corrected projected future climate for near (2014-2033) and mid-future (2034-2053) under moderate and pessimistic scenarios were developed based on multiple regional climate models. Historical (1983-2013) and future trends of selected climatic extreme indices were calculated using RClimDex and hydrological extremes using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration tool. Results show that historical trends in precipitation extremes such as number of heavy and very heavy precipitation days and maximum 1-day precipitation are decreasing while the temperature-related extremes have both increasing and decreasing trends (e.g., warm spell duration index, warm days and summer days are increasing whereas cold spell duration index, cool days and warm nights are decreasing). These results indicate drier and hotter conditions over the historical period. The projected future temperature indices (hot nights, warm days) reveal increasing trend for both the scenarios in contrast with decreasing trends in some of the extreme precipitation indices such as consecutive dry and wet days and maximum 5-day precipitation. Furthermore, the watershed has low mean hydrological alterations (27.9%) in the natural flow regime. These results indicate continuation of wetter and hotter future in theMarshyangdiwatershed with likely impacts on future water availability and associated conflicts for water allocation, and therefore affect the river health conditions.

AB  - Mountain streams play a key role in the conservation of aquatic biodiversity and key ecosystem services; however human activities are threatening these ecosystems as mountain areas become more and more developed and intensively used. Many of these streams are not considered in current national monitoring programs due to their small catchment area. However, assessing their status and monitoring their trends is well needed to ensure their proper management and conservation. In this study, we evaluated the use of a range of indicators related to different ecosystem structural and functional components in 2 streams affected by sewage outflows and compared with an unpolluted stream in the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain). We surveyed benthic periphyton, macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and also estimated periphyton growth rates, wood decomposition rates and river metabolism. Additionally, we compared the performance of the selected indicators in different hydraulic conditions. Results revealed an effect of the organic pollution on most of the functional and structural indicators for the most polluted stream. Only the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party index, the invertebrate multimetric index used by the regional water agency, the fish abundance and biomass were sensitive enough to detect low leyels of pollution and followed the expected response to the pollution degree. Moreover, most of the indicators behaved similarly under different hydraulic conditions, without major differences between pools and runs. However, the combination of both pool and run replicates at the reach scale resulted in a higher detection capacity of the effects of organic pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) are forage fishes and form a crucial link in the flow of energy from phytoplankton to marine top predators in the North Atlantic. The nutritional value of the sandeel is linked to the presence of lipid-rich zooplankton species, which makes their trophic role vulnerable to climate-induced changes in the zooplankton community. We provide the first description of diet and lipid accumulation of the northern sand lance Ammodytes dubius Reinhardt, 1837 in southwest Greenland (64 degrees N) during a growing season. Sampling occurred in May, August and September 2013, and differences in diet and lipid content were found in relation to season, gender and ontogeny. In terms of numbers and biomass, nauplii constituted the vast majority of prey in May, whereas copepods (primarily large Calanus spp.) dominated in August and September. Groups of larger prey (euphausiids and amphipods) were only found late in the season and primarily in sandeel larger than 16 cm. Mean lipid content (% DW) was at a minimum in May for both mature (males: 5.6%, females: 6.4%) and immature sandeel (3.9%), and peaked in August for mature individuals (males: 21.7%, females: 24.2%) and in September for juveniles (19.8%). Sandeel condition responds quickly to changes in prey availability and can be used as an indicator sensitive to of productivity and environmental change on the banks in West Greenland. In the light of rapid climate changes in Arctic marine ecosystems, the present findings may serve as a baseline for future monitoring of the productivity of pelagic ecosystems in West Greenland.

AB  - Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, and there is a need to develop new approaches to monitor reef health under natural conditions. Because simultaneous measurements of net community production (NCP) and net community calcification (NCC) are used as important indicators of reef health, tools are needed to assess them in situ. Here we present the Benthic Ecosystem and Acidification Measurement System (BEAMS) to provide the first fully autonomous approach capable of sustained, simultaneous measurements of reef NCP and NCC under undisturbed, natural conditions on time scales ranging from tens of minutes to weeks. BEAMS combines the chemical and velocity gradient in the benthic boundary layer to quantify flux from the benthos for a variety of parameters to measure NCP and NCC. Here BEAMS was used to measure these rates from two different sites with different benthic communities on the western reef terrace at Palmyra Atoll for 2 weeks in September 2014. Measurements were made every similar to 15 min. The trends in metabolic rates were consistent with the benthic communities between the two sites with one dominated by fleshy organisms and the other dominated by calcifiers (degraded and healthy reefs, respectively). This demonstrates the potential utility of BEAMS as a reef health monitoring tool. NCP and NCC were tightly coupled on time scales of minutes to days, and light was the primary driver for the variability of daily integrated metabolic rates. No correlation between CO2 levels and daily integrated NCC was observed, indicating that NCC at these sites were not significantly affected by CO2.

AB  - Objectives: High level of oxidative stress (OS) during the first weeks of pregnancy is related to many serious pregnancy complications. Previous studies showed that body fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is related to OS level in men, suggesting that FA is a marker of oxidative balance in an individual. The aim of this study was to analyze if body FA was related to the level of biomarkers of OS in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   Methods: The sample included 34 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, not smoking, and not exposed to toxins in their work environment. The composite FA and levels of two biomarkers of OS, 8-iso-ProstaglandinF2 alpha (an indicator of oxidative damage to lipids) and 8-OH-dG (an indicator of oxidative damage to DNA) were measured. Factors that may affect the level of OS (vitamin supplementation, age, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and health condition) were controlled.
   Results: The levels of OS markers in the first trimester of pregnancy correlated positively with women's FA (r = 0.52, P = 0.002 for 8-OH-dG; r = 0.50; P = 0.003 for 8-iso-PGF2 alpha level) and positively with body height (r = 0.37, P = 0.03 for 8-OH-dG level).
   Conclusion: The level of OS is likely to be a substantial and important fitness trait, and FA may convey information on the level of OS in women. The result confirms that FA is an indicator of biological condition, as suggested by an evolutionary approach to morphological human traits perceived as attractive. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Land use change is a complex response to changing environmental and socioeconomic systems. Historical drivers of land use change include changes in the natural resource availability of a region, changes in economic conditions for production of certain products and changing policies. Most recently, introduction of policy incentives for biofuel production have influenced land use change in the US Midwest, leading to concerns that bioenergy production systems may compete with food production and land conservation. Here we explore how land use may be impacted by future climate mitigation measures by nesting a high resolution agricultural model (EPIC - Environmental Policy Indicator Climate) for the US Midwest within a global integrated assessment model (GCAM - Global Change Assessment Model). This approach is designed to provide greater spatial resolution and detailed agricultural practice information by focusing on the climate mitigation potential of agriculture and land use in a specific region, while retaining the global economic context necessary to understand the far ranging effects of climate mitigation targets. We find that until the simulated carbon prices are very high, the US Midwest has a comparative advantage in producing traditional food and feed crops over bioenergy crops. Overall, the model responds to multiple pressures by adopting a mix of future responses. We also find that the GCAM model is capable of simulations at multiple spatial scales and agricultural technology resolution, which provides the capability to examine regional response to global policy and economic conditions in the context of climate mitigation.

AB  - Pesticides have become major stressors in many aquatic communities. Laboratory studies suggest their impact may be further magnified in the presence of cues from predators. Despite their importance for ecological risk assessment, synergisms between pesticides and predator cues have not been confirmed under semi-natural outdoor conditions. We evaluated how the presence of predator cues and the presence of a non-corixid community affect the pesticide sensitivity of five water bug (Corixidae) species in an outdoor, multi-species container experiment. The experiment employed a full factorial design with two pesticide treatments, two predator cue treatments and two (non-corixid) community treatments (absence versus presence of Cloeon dipterum mayfly larvae, Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae and Physa acuta snails). The pesticide treatment negatively affected survival in Cymatia coleoptrata, and to a lesser extent, Sigara lateralis, but not in the other three Corixidae species (Hesperocorixa linnaei, Sigara iactans and Sigara striata). The addition of pesticides did not significantly affect body mass in the latter four species, unless combined with predator cues. To our knowledge this is the first report of this synergism under semi-natural, outdoor conditions. Neither lethal nor sublethal pesticide effects in the Corixidae depended on the community context, yet the presence of the non-corixid community when combined with predator cues reduced survival and body mass. Our results suggest that the here documented synergism between pesticides and predator cues may occur in nature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Native species are important in ecological restoration of degraded forest ecosystems provided that their ecological engineering potential is exploited. Their failure to get established is usually due to the use of low-quality planting stock and adverse site conditions. Mini-plug transplants are a relatively new and promising production system in the forest nursery area. Objectives of our study were the evaluation of seedling production of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) in mini-plug containers, the study of the effect of mini-plug density and substrate on planting stock quality, the comparison of the performance between mini-plug seedlings and the standard planting stock produced by Greek nurseries and the evaluation of physiological and morphological variables as predictive indicators of Italian cypress field performance. Our results showed that cypress seedlings could be produced using the mini-plug technique, resulting in higher quality seedlings than the standard stock type. Pre-cultivation of cypress seedlings under favorable conditions for a period of 5 weeks using peat and high mini-plug densities (1800-3500 mini-plugs m(-2)) could be recommended. Grading of seedlings by using both easily measured morphological variables (root length, leaf area, root and shoot dry weight) and physiological tests, such as shoot electrolyte leakage, may improve survival and transplanting success. It is concluded that mini-plugs can serve ecological restoration of degraded forest ecosystems more efficiently than standard planting stock. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The maternal environment may contribute to population differentiation in offspring traits if growing conditions of mother plants are different. However, the magnitude of such environmental maternal effects compared with genetic differentiation is often not clear. We tested the importance of environmental maternal effects by comparing population differentiation in parental seed directly collected in the field and in F, seed grown under homogeneous conditions. The F-1 seeds were obtained by random crosses within populations. We used five populations in each of four plant species to analyse seed mass and growth chamber germination of both generations at the same time. In two species, we additionally tested offspring performance in the field. We found a significant population differentiation in all species and for nearly all measured traits. Population-by-generation interactions indicating environmental maternal effects were significant for germination (three species) and for seed mass (two species) but not for growth and reproduction. The significant interaction was partly due to a reduction of among-population differentiation from the parental to the F, generation that can be explained by a decrease of maternal provisioning effects. However, in some species by trait combinations a change in population ranking and not a decrease of variation was responsible for significant population-by-generation interactions indicating environmental maternal effects beyond maternal provisioning. Fitting of seed mass as covariate was not successful in reducing environmental maternal effects on Population differentiation in germination. We discuss alternative methods to account for environmental maternal effects in studies on genetic differentiation among populations.

AB  - Accurate characterization of gross primary productivity (GPP) is critically important in assessing mangrove carbon budgets, but the current knowledge of the temporal variations of GPP in evergreen mangroves is very limited. Remote sensing of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a promising approach to approximating GPP across ecosystems, but its capability for tracking GPP in evergreen mangroves has not been assessed. The SIF-GPP link at a subtropical mangrove and its environmental controls are explored using 1-year time-series measurements from tower-based hyperspectral and eddy covariance systems. Both the relationship between SIF and GPP as well as that between SIFy (SIF yield: the ratio of SIF over absorbed photosynthetically active radiation [APAR]) and LUE (light use efficiency: the ratio of GPP over APAR) at diurnal and seasonal time scales are analyzed. The temporal variations of SIF and GPP shared overall similar changing patterns, but their functional relationship tended to be time scale-dependent. Midday depressions in SIF were observed when environmental stresses occurred around noon (including excess light and high VPD), and the strength of the SIF-GPP link was affected by changing environmental conditions. The SIFy-LUE relationship was temporally more dynamic, tending to match during midday hours but diverge from each other during morning and afternoon hours. These findings confirm SIF can serve as a potential remotely sensed indicator of mangrove canopy photosynthesis. This paper provides the first, high temporal-resolution, continuous SIF measurements in mangroves, and highlights the importance of the impacts of environmental conditions on the SIF-GPP relationship.

AB  - Background: While mammalian embryos can adapt to their environments, their sensitivity overshadows their adaptability in suboptimal in vitro conditions. Therefore, the environment in which the gametes are fertilized or to which the embryo is exposed can greatly affect the quality of the embryo and consequently its implantation potential.
   Objectives: Since providing an optimal culture condition needs a deep understanding of the environmental effects, and regarding the fact that normal morphology fails to be a reliable indicator of natural embryo development, the current study aimed at comparing in vivo- and in vitro-derived blastocysts at the molecular level.
   Materials and Methods: In vivo and in vitro mouse blastocysts were obtained by flushing the uterine horns and in vitro fertilization/culture, respectively. Normal blastocysts of both groups were evaluated in terms of hatching rate and expression of three lineage-differentiation-, apoptosis-, and implantation-related genes.
   Results: The hatching rate was lower in In vitro fertilization (IVF)-produced blastocysts in comparison with that of the in vivo counterparts. More importantly, the study results indicated significant changes in the expression levels of eight out of ten selected genes, especially Mmp-9 (about -10.7-fold). The expression of Mmp-9 in trophoblast cells is required for successful implantation and trophoblast invasion.
   Conclusions: The current study, in addition to confirming that the altered gene expression pattern of in vitro-produced embryos resulted in normal morphology, provided a possible reason for lower implantation rate of in vitro-produced blastocysts regarding the Mmp-9 expression.

AB  - Discharge of untreated wastewater into freshwater ecosystems increases nutrient concentrations, causing eutrophication and demanding more intensive monitoring and control activities, particularly in developing areas. Two approaches are commonly used for assessing trophic states of rivers: (1) physicochemical trophic state indexes (TSIs), and (2) trophic indexes based on bioindicators, mainly periphytic diatoms (TDIs). Even when these two approaches seem to be very different, they can be complementary under certain circumstances. This is the case with Rio Chili (Arequipa, Peru), a shallow regulated river used for multi-purpose activities, but which is highly polluted due to the discharge of municipal wastewater. The present study assessed the suitability of different TSIs and TDIs by processing data from historical water quality registers and recent monitoring, including periphytic diatom sampling. TDIs were compared with TSIs applied to both recent and historical records. Results indicated that TSIs can be easily obtained from measurements of phosphorus concentrations, but they are less sensitive and resulted in a high degree of homogeneity among the classification of trophic conditions along the urban path of the river. Alternatively, TDIs showed higher precision and sensitivity, reporting detailed classifications of the sampling points. TDIs suggested that Rio Chili presented conditions that varied from mesotrophic to eutrophic as consequence of wastewater discharges and soil occupation. A routine use of TDIs with occasional assessment by physicochemical TSIs may contribute to water quality sustainability by informing managers of the effects of organic and phosphorus pollution on eutrophication at a lower cost.

AB  - The development of standard procedures for mapping ecosystem services (ES) hotspots is an active research issue, mainly because it is very important to provide spatially reliable information to decision makers on land use planning. When ES supply is estimated and mapped from sets of contributing ecosystem functions (EF), it is important to identify which of them contribute the most to a particular ES. Also, it is crucial to determine whether that contribution varies across different ecological contexts. In this work, we used an expert-knowledge-elicitation approach to build "integration matrices" that resume the relationships between EF and ES in four different ecoregions of southern South America (Valdivian Forests, Campos, Chaco and Pampas). To verify the utility of creating different matrices, we compared the results of the Pampas ecoregion with an average score matrix from the four selected ecoregions. Results showed that the contribution of EF to ES differed slightly using the Pampas and the general matrix. We also mapped hotspots of three ES in a real landscape from the Pampas, using both matrices and the ECOSER protocol for ES supply mapping. The location of ES supply hotspots differed between matrices, but the amount of discrepancies was not proportional to the differences in matrices scores. This suggests that the developed matrix that takes into account local ecological conditions provides a more reliable source of spatially explicit information on ES supply for decision makers than a general matrix. The integration matrices generated in this study are useful for different protocols of ES supply mapping.

AB  - We examine the institutional fundamentals of the goals of sustainable development of a territory from the perspective of the development vector of a "green" economy that is responsible for the main directions of transformation of the economic complex of countries and regions. The possible main development directions of the socioeconomic structure of a typical Siberian region (Irkutsk oblast) are generalized, based on the principles of the modern view of the practical implementation of basic branches (sectors) of a "green" economy. Account is taken of the factor of the resource-oriented development model of the oblast for the foreseeable future by analyzing the main conceptual-strategic and planning documents defining the socioeconomic status of the territory into 2030. The main directions of modernization of the Irkutsk oblast's economic complex are suggested having regard to the principles of a "green" economy in order to ensure favorable conditions for future generations, including ecological conditions. A priority is given to an increase in the proportion of the branches (kinds of economic activity) in the gross regional product as well as in other socioeconomic indicators, which have the least negative influence on the environment. We formulated the development directions of one of the kinds of activity of current relevance to the oblast, namely waste management in the form of an environment protection infrastructure, and three structurally-hierarchically arranged main development and functioning levels of the modern environment protection infrastructure are suggested on the principles of a "green" economy (regional, subregional, and local) within the framework of the updated Strategy of Development of the Oblast's Productive Forces.

AB  - A general probabilistic prediction network is proposed for hydrological drought examination and environmental flow assessment. This network consists of three major components. First, we present the joint streamflow drought indicator (JSDI) to describe the hydrological dryness/wetness conditions. The JSDI is established based on a high-dimensional multivariate probabilistic model. In the second part, a drought-based environmental flow assessment method is introduced, which provides dynamic risk-based information about how much flow (the environmental flow target) is required for drought recovery and its likelihood under different hydrological drought initial situations. The final part involves estimating the conditional probability of achieving the required environmental flow under different precipitation scenarios according to the joint dependence structure between streamflow and precipitation. Three watersheds from different countries (Germany, China, and the United States) with varying sizes from small to large were used to examine the usefulness of this network. The results show that the JSDI can provide an assessment of overall hydrological dryness/wetness conditions and performs well in identifying both drought onset and persistence. This network also allows quantitative prediction of targeted environmental flow required for hydrological drought recovery and estimation of the corresponding likelihood. Moreover, the results confirm that the general network can estimate the conditional probability associated with the required flow under different precipitation scenarios. The presented methodology offers a promising tool for water supply planning and management and for drought-based environmental flow assessment. The network has no restrictions that would prevent it from being applied to other basins worldwide.

AB  - Ecotoxicity tests are often conducted following standard methods, and thus carried out at a fixed water temperature under controlled laboratory conditions. Yet, toxicity of a chemical contaminant may vary in a temperature-dependent manner, depending on the physiology of the test organism and physicochemical properties of the chemical. Although an assessment factor of 10 (AF10) is commonly adopted to account for variability in toxicity data related to temperature in the development of water quality guidelines and/or ecological risk assessment, no one has ever rigorously assessed the appropriateness of AF10 to account for potential variation in temperature-dependent chemical toxicity to aquatic organisms. This study, therefore, aims to address this issue through a meta-analysis by comparing median lethal concentration data for nine chemicals (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, zinc, arsenic, selenium and DDT) on a range of freshwater ectothermic animal species at different temperatures, and to assess whether AF10 is under- or over-protective for tropical and temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our results reveal varying extents of interaction between temperature and different chemicals on organisms and the complexity of these interactions. Applying AF10 sufficiently protects 90 % of the animal species tested over a range of temperatures for cadmium, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and DDT in the tropics, but it is insufficient to adequately encompass a larger temperature variation for most studied chemicals in temperate regions. It is therefore important to set specific AFs for different climatic zones in order to achieve the desired level of ecosystem protection.

AB  - Mediterranean agroecosystems are particularly vulnerable to soil degradation, and alterations in ecosystem services need to be predicted using appropriate approaches. In the present work, we perform an integrated assessment of soils under different long-term management practices-tillage vs. covered soils-under semiarid conditions by using a complementary soil biochemical, genomic, and transcriptomic approach. Dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, phosphatase, urease and arylsulphatase activities were determined, as well as both overall and metabolically active bacterial population number and community structure. In addition, this is the first report linking beta-glucosidase activity with genes encoding bacterial beta-glucosidases in soil, a key enzyme involved in soil-carbon cycle. In our work, data on bacterial biomass or beta-glucosidase gene copy number has provided no additional information regarding the effect of management or profile depth on soil bacteria behaviour other than those derived from traditional biochemical methods measuring overall microbial activity potential. Nevertheless, a different trend resulted when gene transcripts were considered pointing to the relevance of using RNA-related properties as sensitive indicators of bacterial physiological state in semiarid soils. The results evidenced the influence of management and soil depth on the expression of bacterial beta-glucosidase genes, which was by no means related to available C-nutrients. The results also pointed out overexpression of ribosomal RNA genes in tillage soils. This fact was not an indication of higher bacterial biomass but probably the response of the bacterial community to stressed conditions. Consequence of this would be the positive effect of spontaneous cover crops on soil biological stability, where bacterial metabolic expense was much lower.

AB  - This paper illustrates, by a case study, how to apply the conceptual Worst-Case Definition (WCD) model. developed in the methodological paper in the current journal, by Sorensen et al. (2010-this issue). The case is about eco-toxicological risk assessment of pesticides under Danish conditions. Cumulative aspects are included on a conceptual basis as elements of the worst-case conditions. This defines factors that govern the risk assessment, including location in time and space of risk "hotspots". Two pillars of concern drive the conceptual modelling: (1) What to protect (denoted Protected Units (Pus)) and (2) the reason for increased risk level (denoted Causes of Risks (CRs)). Both PUs and CRs are analysed using hierarchical procedures that facilitate a complete listing of concrete factors governing increased risk for adverse effect due to agricultural usage of pesticide. The factors governing pesticide risk are combined in a context that combines the protection of relevant groupings of organisms with the factors for increased risk level for each of these. Identification of the most important relations between defined types of PUs and CRs is illustrated using expert knowledge. Existing databases are used to form spatial distributed risk indicators as estimators for a selection of important relations between PUs and CRs. This paper illustrates how the WCD model can break down the complex issue of uncertainty into fractions that are more open for evaluations. Finally, it shows application of risk indicators in a multi-criterion analysis using respectively self organizing mapping and partial order technique in a comparative analysis that highlights critical aspects of uncertainty, due to the ambiguity between single risk indicator rankings.

AB  - Isoflavones exhibit many bioactive benefits, such as antioxidation, antimutagenic effects, and reduction of symptoms of postmenopause conditions. Aglycone forms of isoflavone have shown more biological effects over their glycosylated ones. Most isoflavones in nature, however, exist as glycosylated forms and cannot easily be absorbed in the intestines. The purpose of this study was to develop a fermentation process of black soybean to produce functional food using a Luffa cylindrical fiber biofilm reactor. Three filamentous-fungi, including Rhizopus oligosporus (BCRC 31996), Rhizopus oligosporus (NTU-5), and Rhizopus oryzae (BCRC 30894), were cultivated in black soybean medium. The assay using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging effect of fermented broth and isoflavone aglycosylation rate of genistin and daidzin were evaluated as indicators to determine the most suitable strain. After a 2-day cultivation in flasks, DPPH radical scavenging effect of R. oligosporus NTU-5 reached 83%, which is the maximum value among three strains. R. oligosporus NTU-5 was subsequently chosen as target strain and used for the scale-up of fungal-based aerobic growth. The optimal cultivation condition obtained in a 5-L bioreactor with Luffa cylindrical fiber was 30 degrees C, 0.1 vvm aeration, 100 rpm agitation, 10% inoculum volume, and 6% (w/v) black soybean as medium. After a 6-day cultivation, R. oligosporus NTU-5 converted isoflavones to their aglycones, daidzein and genistein, and these were 59.7 and 23.6 M, respectively.

AB  - Woody linear features of farmlands have received much attention as pools of diversity in European countries, but they have, in comparison, been little considered in eastern North American ecological studies. Here, we evaluate the relative contribution of environmental conditions, history of management practices within hedgerows, and adjacent land-use on herb and shrub species distribution in woody hedgerows of agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada. We pay particular attention to the distribution of forest herbs and weed species and identify the main factors that explain their presence. We also evaluate the amount of spatial structuring in the species data and explanatory variables.
   Our results show significant differences in species composition related to the unique influence of all sets of factors considered. Adjacent land-use (from intensive crop to fallow land) remains the best predictor of overall species distribution, followed by environmental conditions and history of management practices. The probability of finding forest herbs in hedgerows increases as intensity of adjacent agricultural practices (from intensive crop to fallow land) decreases. Potential weed species, on the other hand, are more likely to be found within narrow hedgerows adjacent to the more intensively managed fields. We discuss the results in terms of the interactions between the different determinants of plant diversity in hedgerows and demonstrate the necessity to distinguish between multiple structuring factors to devise proper conservation strategies. Such strategies will have to take into account. the ecological as well as the agricultural exploitation context in which linear features are found to be effective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found in the marine environment. Although there is a large body of evidence that pharmaceutical drugs exert negative impacts on aquatic organisms, especially in the freshwater compartment, only limited studies are available on bioconcentration and the effects of NSAIDs on marine organisms. Bivalves have a high ecological and socio-economic value and are considered good bioindicator species in ecotoxicology and risk assessment programs. Therefore, this review summarizes current knowledge on the bioconcentration and the effects of three widely used NSAIDs, diclofenac, ibuprofen and paracetamol, in marine bivalves exposed under laboratory conditions. These pharmaceutical drugs were chosen based on their environmental occurrence both in frequency and concentration that may warrant their inclusion in the European Union Watch List. It has been highlighted that ambient concentrations may result in negative effects on wild bivalves after long-term exposures. Also, higher trophic level organisms may be more impacted due to food-chain transfer (e.g., humans are shellfish consumers). Overall, the three selected NSAIDs were reported to bioconcentrate in marine bivalves, with recognized effects at different life-stages. Immune responses were the main target of a long-term exposure to the drugs. The studies selected support the inclusion of diclofenac on the European Union Watch List and highlight the importance of extending research for ibuprofen and paracetamol due to their demonstrated negative effects on marine bivalves exposed to environmental realistic concentrations, under laboratory conditions.

AB  - Bird communities wintering in the mosaic-like farming landscapes of SW Poland were studied to assess drivers of intra-seasonal changes in numbers and habitat associations of birds. During two severe winters (November-March) the complete area search method was applied to count birds and link their occurrence with weather and habitat in six plots (320 ha in total). A modelling approach was used to test birds' responses to environmental factors at community and species levels. These farmlands were inhabited by diverse and dense populations of wintering birds, including a significant proportion of species of conservation concern. Bird numbers revealed decreasing trends, with winter- and species-specific fluctuations, affected in particular by snow cover. The lowest population indices were recorded in mid-winter (February) and remained low until mid-March. Field margins (6.6% of the total area) supported 35.6% of individuals and 55.0% of flocks. The preference for field margins over other farmland habitats was particularly prominent during severe weather conditions. Our results suggest that during severe winters, complex farmlands are important areas for birds, enhancing their known importance to breeding birds. Intense snowfall in mid-winter rather than temperature drops lead to immediate population declines, aggravating the effects of natural food depletion. Adverse weather keeps populations at low levels until mid-March, despite the influx of spring migrants. Behavioural adjustments to winter conditions elicit the characteristic habitat distribution of birds, exposing the crucial importance of non-cropped landscape elements. In particular, the variety of field margins significantly contributes to the persistence of internationally important populations of farmland birds in Poland.

AB  - The fate of indigenous surface-water and wastewater antibiotic resistant bacteria in a mild slope streamsimulated through a hydraulic channel was investigated in outdoor experiments. The effect of (i) natural (dark) decay, (ii) sunlight, (iii) cloudy cover, (iv) adsorption to the sediment, (v) hydraulic conditions, (vi) discharge of urban wastewater treatment plant (UWTP) effluent and (vii) bacterial species (presumptive Escherichia coli and enterococci) was evaluated. Half-life time (T-1/2) of E. coli under sunlight was in the range 6.48-27.7 min (initial bacterial concentration of 105 CFU/mL) depending on hydraulic and sunlight conditions. E. coli inactivation was quite similar in sunny and cloudy day experiments in the early 2 hr, despite of the light intensity gradient was in the range of 15-59 W/m(2); but subsequently the inactivation rate decreased in the cloudy day experiment (T-1/2 = 23.0 min) comparedtosunny day (T-1/2 = 17.4 min). The adsorption of bacterial cells to the sediment (biofilm) increased in the first hour and thenwas quite stable for the remaining experimental time. Finally, when the discharge of an UWTP effluent in the stream was simulated, the proportion of indigenous antibiotic resistant E. coli and enterococci was found to increase as the exposure time increased, thus showing a higher resistance to solar inactivation compared to the respective total populations.

AB  - Multi-zoo comparisons of animal welfare are rare, and yet vital for ensuring continued improvement of zoo enclosures and husbandry. Methods are not standardized for the development of zoo enclosures based on multiple indicators, and case study species are required. This study compares behavior and breeding success to various enclosure and husbandry parameters for the Humboldt penguin, Spheniscus humboldti, for the development of improved enclosure design. Behavioral sampling was completed at Flamingo Land over a period of 8 months. Further data on behavior, enclosure design, and breeding success were collected via questionnaires, visits to zoos, and literature review. Breeding success was primarily influenced by colony age and number of breeding pairs, suggesting an important social influence on reproduction. Across zoos, there was also significant variation in behavior. The proportion of time spent in water varied between zoos (2-23%) and was used as an indicator of physical activity and natural behavior. Regression models revealed that water-use was best predicted by total enclosure area per penguin, followed by land area, with some evidence for positive influence of pool surface area per penguin. Predominantly linear/curvilinear increases in our biological indicators with enclosure parameters suggest that optimal conditions for S. humboldti were not met among the selected zoos. We propose revised minimum conditions for S. humboldti enclosure design, which exceed those in the existing husbandry guidelines. We present a framework for the evaluation of zoo enclosures and suggest that a rigorous scientific protocol be established for the design of new enclosures, based on multivariate methods.

AB  - Localized and global impacts are responsible for driving the current decline in coral reef ecosystems. The worldwide debate over the efficacy of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a conservation measure for coral reefs highlights the importance of acquiring accurate indicators of reef resilience and recovery under stressful conditions. Marine benthic foraminifera, considered outstanding indicators for environmental changes, are unicellular eukaryotes that inhabit sandy sediments in coral reefs. There are three kinds of benthic foraminifera: symbiotic, opportunistic, and other small heterotrophic. Symbiosis with microalgae is not favorable under high nutrient conditions. This study compared the FORAM Index (FI) in different sites inside and outside MPAs. The index was also compared with coral and algae cover. High FI values are characteristic of healthy oligotrophic reefs whereas low values represent eutrophicated ecosystems. A community structure analysis was done in order to determine the compositional change of functional groups, and thus, to test spatially the index efficiency and performance. In general, MPA sites presented lower indexes compared to Non-MPA sites, probably due to the higher impact of tourism and agriculture in these areas. On the other hand, the index was not correlated with coral nor algae cover, even though positive and negative trends were found. Assemblage analyzes corroborated that the symbiotic foraminifers' high susceptibility is the main source for the index variation, which was independent of the substrate type from which it was sampled. Our results show both the efficiency of this index and the importance of its application for evaluating conservation strategies.

AB  - In a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, spark ignition engines must operate at their maximum power to reduce the pay back time. Because of environmental and economic concerns, engines are set with high compression ratios. Consequently, optimal operating conditions are generally very close to those of knock occurrence and heavy knock can severely damage the engine piston.
   There are two main protection techniques: the curative one commonly used by engine manufacturers and well documented in the literature and the preventive one based on a knock prediction according to the quality of the supplied gas. The indicator used to describe gas quality is the methane number (MN). The methane number requirement (MNR) of the engine is defined, for an engine set (spark advance, air-fuel ratio, and load), as the minimum value of MN above which knock free operation is ensured. To prevent knock occurrence, it is necessary to adapt the engine tuning according to variable gas composition. The objective of the present work is to validate the concept of knock preventive protection. First, a prediction of MNR according to engine settings (ES) is computed through a combustion simulator composed of a thermodynamic 2-zone model. Predicted MNR are compared to experimental results performed on a single-cylinder SI gas engine and show good agreement with numerical results (uncertainty below 1 point). Then, the combustion simulator is used to generate a protection mapping. At last, the knock preventive protection was successfully tested. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trends in the percentage cover of macroalgae are generally used as an important indicator of the health of coral reefs. While considerable data exist on patterns of macroalgal cover, the underlying patch dynamics of macroalgae are poorly understood. It is important to appreciate the dynamical processes of algae because they determine the frequency and duration of competitive interaction with other taxa, such as corals, and thereby contribute to our understanding of competitive interactions. We used transition matrices to quantify and describe the patch dynamics of 2 common macroalgae in the Caribbean, Dictyota pulchella and Lobophora variegata, over a 9 mo period. Size-based matrices were constructed for both species from forereef habitats subjected to contrasting levels of wave exposure. The dynamics of D. pulchella are highly sensitive to the physical environment, whilst those of L. variegata are far less sensitive. The patch dynamics of D. pulchella showed a higher temporal variation than L. variegata, but only on the exposed forereef. D. pulchella virtually disappeared in January at both the exposed and sheltered sites, whereas L. variegata exhibited a continuing increase in patch size irrespective of exposure. D. pulchella formed larger, more dynamic patches under high exposure. This implies that contact interactions with coral colonies and space pre-emption for settling planulae will occur more frequently than in sheltered environments. Our results demonstrate the need to investigate patch dynamics of macroalgae at the individual species level, whilst taking into account environmental conditions.

AB  - Urban streams have been the focus of much research in recent years, but many questions about the mechanisms driving the urban stream syndrome remain unanswered. Identification of key research questions is an important step toward effective, efficient management of urban streams to meet societal goals. We developed a list of priority research questions by: 1) soliciting input from interested scientists via a listserv and online survey, 2) holding an open discussion on the questions at the Second Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology, and 3) reviewing the literature in the preparation of this paper. We present the resulting list of 26 questions in the context of a review and summary of the present understanding of urban effects on streams. The key questions address major gaps in our understanding of ecosystem structure and function responses (e.g., what are the Sublethal impacts of urbanization on biota?), characteristics of urban stream stressors (e.g., can we identify clusters of covarying stressors?), and management strategies (e.g., what are appropriate indicators of ecosystem structure and function to use as management targets?). The identified research needs highlight our limited understanding of mechanisms driving the urban stream syndrome and the variability in characteristics of the effects of urbanization across different biogeoclimatic conditions, stages of development, government policies, and cultural norms. We discuss how to proceed with appropriate management activities given our current incomplete understanding of the urban stream syndrome.

AB  - Dynamic changes in live fuel moisture (LFM) and fuel condition modify fire danger in shrublands. We investigated the empirical relationship between field-measured LFM and remotely sensed greenness and moisture measures from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Key goals were to assess the nature of these relationships as they varied between sensors, across sites, and across years. Most AVIRIS-derived measures were highly correlated with LFM. Visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) and visible green index (VIg) outperformed all moisture measures. The water index (WI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) had the highest correlations of the moisture measures. All relationships were nonlinear, and a linear relationship only applied above a 60% LFM. Changes in the fraction of green vegetation (GV) and nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) were good indicators of changes in fuels below the 60% LFM threshold. AVIRIS-and MODIS-derived measures were highly correlated but lacked a 1: 1 relationship. MODIS-derived greenness and moisture measures were also highly correlated to LFM but generally had lower correlations than AVIRIS and varied between sites. LFM relationships improved when data were pooled by functional type. LFM interannual variability impacted relationships, producing higher correlations in wetter years, with VARI and VIg showing the highest correlations across years. Lowest correlations were observed for sites that included two different functional types or multiple land cover classes (i.e., urban and roads) within a MODIS footprint. Higher correlations for uniform sites and improved relationships for functional types suggest that MODIS can map LFM effectively in shrublands.

AB  - Peatlands often have readily apparent gradients of plant species distributions, biogeochemistry, and hydrology across several spatial scales. Many inferences have been drawn about the colinearity of these gradients, and these assumptions have become ingrained in the terminology that describes and classifies peatlands. We review the Literature and present some of our own data that show that many of these inferences are either wrong or correct only under a limited set of ecological conditions. We examine historical classification schemes of peatlands and, in this context, gradients of alkalinity, pH, nutrient availability for plant growth, nutrient mineralization, hydrology, and decomposition. We further suggest a strictly defined set of terms to describe separate gradients of hydrology, alkalinity, and nutrients that limit plant growth in peatlands. Specifically, we make the following suggestions concerning terminology. (1) The suffix ''-trophic'' should only be used when referring to nutrients that directly Limit plant growth at natural availabilities (e.g., eutrophic and oligotrophic). (2) Terms such as circumneutral, moderately acid, and very acidic (or alternatively strong, intermediate, and weak) should be used to describe the pH of peatlands. (3) Ombrogenous and geogenous (or limnogenous, topogenous, and soligenous) should be used to describe the hydrology of peatlands. (4) The terms bog and fen should be defined broadly based on water/soil chemistry and dominant plant species without accompanying assumptions regarding hydrology, topography, ontogeny, nutrient availability, or the presence or absence of nondominant indicator plant species. Better yet, the generic term peatland be used when possible to avoid confusion about conditions that may or may not be present at a particular site.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which the behavioural traits of freshwater mussels provide suitable indicators of stress in individuals, towards the advancement of non-invasive, remote monitoring techniques to examine population condition. Variation in the expression of particular behavioural metrics was examined in accordance with measurements of oxygen consumption, across environmental stressors (aerial exposure and high concentrations of total suspended solids), and between two freshwater mussel species (Margaritifera margaritifera and Anodonta anatina) Aerobic metabolic rate was quantified using intermittent respirometry, and behaviour was observed using time-lapse footage. Comparisons of metabolic response and the occurrence of behavioural traits, across the two stressors, focused on differences between the 24 h pre-exposure period (pre-exposure), the first 3 h of post-exposure (immediate post-exposure), and the time following the initial 3 h of post-exposure until the end of the experimental run (extended post-exposure). The results of this study demonstrated a relationship between the frequency of occurrence of behavioural responses to stress exposure, associated with valve activity, and significant changes in the metabolic functioning of A. anatina and M. margaritifera mussels. The findings from the study also highlighted substantial intraspecific variation across species and stressors. Data from this research could assist in the development of novel biosensors that track mussel valve activity remotely in their natural environment. When coupled with real-time data examining alterations in environmental metrics, this technology could assist in the monitoring of population condition and aid conservation management.

AB  - Birds are widely used as bioindicators in monitoring programs in wetlands. We compare concentrations of seven trace metals and metalloids (TMM) As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Pb, Znin both feathers and blood in two flamingo species in two high-altitude wetlands in Bolivia, with different levels of anthropogenic point source pollution. Lake Uru Uru (LUU) receives discharges from mining operations, and also effluents from the nearby city of Oruro, while Laguna Colorada (LCo) does not receive contaminants from anthropogenic sources. We sampled water and sediments at each site, as well as flamingos in three age classes in an effort to establish a benchmark for long-term monitoring. Metal concentrations in water did not differ between sites, whereas Zn and Pb concentrations of TMM in sediments were higher at LUU, and Hg higher at LCo. TMM concentrations were highly specific for all separate elements, but results point to differences between Andean flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) chicks and the rest of the classes considered. As flamingo chicks did not molt before sampling, we pose that TMM concentrations in their blood and feathers may respond mainly to local conditions. Eggshells provide additional information, since adults transfer some TMM during egg development. Long-term monitoring in these species should include different age classes and sample both feathers and eggshells to monitor the environmental conditions and bioaccumulation of TMM in these species. Future studies should include sites devoid of natural sources of TMM to help distinguish sources of contamination, since some TMM (As and Pb) may be naturally in high concentrations in remote areas, like Laguna Colorada.

AB  - Small scale urban green-blue infrastructure (indicated as GBI hereafter) comprises huge underexploited areas for urban development and planning. This review article aims to highlight the relevance and knowledge gaps regarding GBI from the perspective of the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus, these being key resources for the survival of human communities. In particular, this review was focused on publications on urban ecosystem services (positive effects) and dis-services (negative effects) associated with different GBI typologies. The review proved that GBI can contribute environmentally, socially, and economically to FEW security and urban sustainability. Yet, such positive effects must be considered against ecosystem dis-services tradeoffs, including urban food production, commonly connected with heavy water and energy consumption, specifically under dry climate conditions, and sometimes related to an excessive use of manure, pesticides, or fertilizers. These conditions could pose either a risk to water quality and local insect survival or serve enhanced mosquito breeding because of irrigation. Up to now, the review evidenced that few nexus modeling techniques have been discussed in terms of their benefits, drawbacks, and applications. Guidance is provided on the choice of an adequate modeling approach. Water, energy, and food are intrinsically associated physically. However, depending on their management, their tradeoffs are often increased. There is a need to minimize these tradeoffs and to build up synergies between food, energy, and water using a holistic approach. This is why the FEW nexus approach offers good insights to address the relation between three important individual resource components of sustainability.

AB  - Production forestry is known to reduce the naturally variable microhabitat pools in live trees and their biodiversity by tree removal and broad indirect effects of silviculture. However, the tree-scale processes are not known well enough for microhabitat management for the future. This study investigates how tree age affects the microhabitat occurrence in live trees, its effect modifiers, and explanatory value compared with tree diameter. We inventoried tree-related microhabitats on 879 live aspens (Populus tremula) and Norway spruces (Picea abies) of known age in 141 forests representing contrasting productive site conditions in Estonia. We analysed microhabitat incidence using logistic mixed models for significant tree-scale and stand-scale factors. Most microhabitat types appeared rare even in old trees, and the age effects had various patterns. Only 2% of trees bore five or more microhabitat types. Aspens and spruces had a similar microhabitat diversity before 80 years of age. Stand-level effects varied among microhabitat types but were less significant than tree-level effects; interactions were even rarer. Most effects found could be interpreted through known ecological processes; for example, humidity-dependent epiphytic growth; bark stripping by herbivores; pathogen effects in forests with distinct histories. In contrast, a reliable tree-scale prediction of microhabitat occurrence appears rarely possible; and depending on microhabitat type, either tree age or diameter can be a better predictor. We suggest that managing for tree-related microhabitats in production forests should combine facilitating ecological conditions for microhabitat formation, and early detection and retention of the trees with high microhabitat potential.

AB  - Analysing the genesis of Quaternary sediments is important for understanding the glaciation history and development of marine sediments in the northern part of Western Siberia. The problem is relevant since there is no consistent concept of the Quaternary sediment genesis in the north of Western Siberia. The formation of sediments is associated with marine, glacial and interglacial sedimentation conditions. The research objective is to identify the persistent features characterising the conditions of sedimentation and relief formation using the Nadym River basin as an example. The best method for studying this problem is a comprehensive analysis of the lithological, chronostratigraphic, petrographic and geomorphological studies of the Quaternary sediment upper strata. This study provides data from the analysis of the basic characteristics of quartz grains at the site. The rounding and morphology of the quartz grains provide evidence of possible glacial processing of some of the site strata. A petrographic study of selected boulder samples was performed. Some of them, by the shape and presence of striation, can be attributed to ice basins. The first use of a detailed digital elevation model applied to the study area made it possible to identify specific relief forms that could very likely be created during glaciations. Based on the analysis, we propose to consider the vast lake alluvial plains in the Nadym River basin as periglacial regions. This idea lays the lithological framework for understanding the reasons for the formation of the modern landscape structure. The materials and descriptions provided are of interest to researchers of Quaternary sediments, topography, vegetation and soil cover, particularly researchers engaged in revising the history of the natural environment development in the north of Western Siberia.

AB  - Cold tolerance of New Rice for Africa (NERICA) and their parent varieties was evaluated under natural air temperature conditions of Kenyan tropical highlands using the multiple-sown field evaluation method. Rice varieties were cultivated 10 times to expose them to a shift in temperature during 20-day periods before heading (critical period), measuring the average daily mean temperature during the critical period (T-mean) for each variety and filled grain ratio, which was used as an indicator of cold tolerance. T(mean)of each variety was low in 6 out of 10 experiments. In the remaining four high-temperature experiments, there were no significant varietal differences in filled grain ratio. In the six low-temperature experiments, all varieties experienced 20.1-21.5 degrees C T-mean. After comparison under virtually the same cold stress, NERICA 1, 3, 4, 7-10, 12, 17, 18, and WAB 56-104 were judged as cold-tolerant; NERICA 2, 5, 11, 13, and 14, and WAB 56-50 and 181-18 were moderately tolerant, and NERICA 6, 15, and 16 were cold-susceptible varieties. These evaluations generally corresponded with previous experimental results under temperature-controlled environments, showing the practicality of multiple-sown field cold tolerance evaluation in Kenya. It also indicated that NERICA varieties, which recorded different levels of cold tolerance and whose average number of days to heading in all experiments were 66-78, are suitable as a set of standard check varieties in this region to evaluate cold tolerance of rice varieties with this range of days to heading.

AB  - Organic greenhouse (OGH) production is characterized by different systems and agricultural practices with diverse environmental impact. Soil arthropods are widely used as bioindicators of ecological sustainability in open field studies, while there is a lack of research on organic production for protected systems. This study assessed the soil arthropod abundance and diversity over a 2-year crop rotation in three systems of OGH production in the Mediterranean. The systems under assessment differed in soil fertility management: SUBST - a simplified system of organic production, based on an input substitution approach (use of guano and organic liquid fertilizers), AGROCOM - soil fertility mainly based on compost application and agroecological services crops (ASC) cultivation (tailored use of cover crops) as part of crop rotation, and AGROMAN - animal manure and ASC cultivation as part of crop rotation. Monitoring of soil fauna was performed by using pitfall traps and seven taxa were considered: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Araneae, Opiliones, Isopoda, Myriapoda, and Collembola. Results demonstrated high potential of ASC cultivation as a technique for beneficial soil arthropod conservation in OGH conditions. SUBST system was dominated by Collembola in all crops, while AGROMAN and AGROCOM had more balanced relative abundance of Isopoda, Staphylinidae, and Aranea. Opiliones and Myriapoda were more affected by season, while Carabidae were poorly represented in the whole monitoring period. Despite the fact that all three production systems are in accordance with the European Union regulation on organic farming, findings of this study displayed significant differences among them and confirmed the suitability of soil arthropods as bioindicators in protected systems of organic farming.

AB  - Because submarine caves are affected by wide spatial and temporal environmental variability, they are ideal environments for studying the effects of environmental changes on ecological indicators. Benthic foraminifera are protozoa living in marine and transitional habitats, developing typical assemblages as a response to different environmental conditions. For this, they have been increasingly used as ecological indicators for environmental characterization and monitoring. This study was the first one aimed to compare benthic foraminiferal fauna of two different submarine caves of temperate areas, Bel Torrente and Bue Marino, in the Orosei Gulf (Sardinia, Italy). It resumes the main results obtained in Bel Torrente cave by a previous research, implemented by new data acquired by the study of Bue Marino cave. The caves were surveyed and sampled by GUE (Global Underwater Explorers) divers for the first 450 m to recognize distinct ecozones, their ecological significance, and to compare them as regards species composition and extent. The succession of Marine, Entrance and Transitional Ecozones was recognized in both the caves. While the Marine Ecozone pointed out environmental conditions very similar to those of shallow water marine environment, the Entrance and Transitional Ecozones indicated increasing environmental stress. In the Entrance Ecozone, the dominance of tolerant species was probably due to the high environmental variability for the episodic high energy floods and, locally, reduced oxygenation events. In the Transitional Ecozone, the decrease of seawater salinity and temperature, especially after rainy periods, probably encouraged the prevalence of agglutinated taxa, which are normally rare in Mediterranean shallow water marine environment, while they are common in high latitude basins.

AB  - Aichi Target 11 (AT11) includes the commitment of 194 governments to equitably manage protected areas (PAs) by 2020. Here we evaluate whether existing PA Management Effectiveness (PAME) and social and governance assessment tools can be used to determine if AT11 meets equity goals. We find that PAME assessment conditions are insufficiently inclusive of relevant actors and do not satisfactorily allow for a diversity of perspectives to be expressed and accounted for, both of which are essential for equitable PA management. Furthermore, none of the analysed PAME tools fully cover multidimensional equity and thus they are inadequate for assessing progress towards equitable management in PAs. The available social and governance PA assessment tools stipulate more inclusive and participatory conditions within their guidelines, and the IUCN Governance Guidelines comprehensively capture equity dimensions in PA management, but results are not comparable across sites. We conclude that available assessment tools do not provide a reliable way to track equity in PM at global scale. The IUCN Governance Guidelines could be adjusted to achieve this goal, providing that the information collected is made globally comparable, while ensuring transparency, accountability and room for contestation, including by communities whose livelihoods are directly implicated. Ultimately, developing and deploying globally comparable measures to evaluate equity is problematic, as the process of gathering comparable data inevitably obscures information that is highly relevant to resolving equity issues at local scales. This challenge must be met, however, if nations are to achieve and report on their success at meeting AT11 by 2020.

AB  - Anthropic activities are directly related to the contamination of aquatic ecosystems owing to the release of numerous chemicals from agricultural and urban waste. These contaminants cause environmental degradation and a decrease in the availability of water quality. The objective of this search was to evaluate the efficiency of physicochemical, chemical, and microbiological tests; extraction of chlorophyll a; and genetic parameters to identify anthropic activities and weather condition effects on the stream water quality and the consequences of its use by the population. The physicochemical parameters were within the limits allowed by the Brazilian law. However, contamination by metals (Cd 0.510 mg L-1, Co 0.405 mg L-1, and Ni 0.316 mg L-1) has been found at various collection points to be more than the allowable values. The antibiotic oxytetracycline was detected in stream water in quantities of up to 89 mu g L-1. In relation to microbiological contamination, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. have been isolated. The averages of chlorophyll a were up to 0.15558 mg cm(-2). Genetic tools identified greater number of micronuclei and DNA damage in periods that showed lower rainfall rates and lower amounts of metals. The analysis used for monitoring was efficient to verify the interference that animal breeding and planting of different cultures have caused on that stream. Thus, the continued use of this water for drinking, irrigation of vegetables, and recreational activities makes the population susceptible to contamination by bacteria and creates conditions for the development of genetic alterations in the long run.

AB  - We developed a new modeling framework to assess how the local abundance of one species influences the local abundance of a potential competitor while explicitly accounting for differential responses to environmental conditions. Our models also incorporate imperfect detection as well as abundance estimation error for both species. As a case study, we applied the model to four pairs of mammal species in Borneo, surveyed by extensive and spatially widespread camera trapping. We detected different responses to elevation gradients within civet, macaque, and muntjac deer species pairs. Muntjac and porcupine species varied in their response to terrain ruggedness, and the two muntjac responded different to river proximity. Bornean endemic species of civet and muntjac were more sensitive than their widespread counterparts to habitat disturbance (selective logging). Local abundance within several species pairs was positively correlated, but this is likely due to the species having similar responses to (unmodeled) environmental conditions or resources rather than representing facilitation. After accounting for environment and correcting for false absences in detection, negative correlations in local abundance appear rare in tropical mammals. Direct competition may be weak in these species, possibly because the 'ghost of competition past' or habitat filtering have already driven separation of the species in niche space. The analytical framework presented here could increase basic understanding of how ecological interactions shape patterns of abundance across the landscape for a range of taxa, and also provide a powerful tool for forecasting the impacts of global change.

AB  - Agroforestry systems in Sub-Saharan African drylands are complex and heterogeneous in nature even under similar biophysical conditions. This can be attributed to household needs and socioeconomic status which influence the species and utility of the adopted trees. This has an impact on the trees establishment and management system through planting or Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). This study evaluates how trees for different utilities are managed and which socioeconomic factors influence these decisions. The study used primary data collected in Mutomo District, Kenya through a household survey based on a structured questionnaire. A paired sample t-test was done to assess the preferred mode of adopting trees for different utilities while factor analysis was used to characterize the households as either planting trees or practicing FMNR. Multiple linear regression using household regression factor scores as independent variables and socioeconomic indicators as dependent variables was done to ascertain which socioeconomic factors affect tree adoption. The results show that trees planted were mostly exotic species valued for their nutrition and commercial value, while FMNR was used for subsistence products and environmental services. Household size, livestock levels and mobility had a positive correlation with tree planting, while income, access to markets and roads had an inverse correlation. Access to natural woodland, distance to the nearest motorable road and land size had a positive correlation with tree protection. It is hoped that this knowledge will act as a reference point when designing agroforestry projects in similar areas to ensure they are more aligned to specific site and household conditions.

AB  - The influence of flash flood events on the input and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) in surface sediments from the Mar Menor lagoon were characterized in this study. These contaminants were analyzed in surface water samples collected during two flash flood events in the main surface watercourse which flow into the Mar Menor lagoon. Surface sediments were sampled semiannually before and after flash flood events. The total input of PAHs, OCPs, and PCBs (sorbed + dissolved) during two flash flood events was estimated at 0.98, 1.32, and 0.34 kg, respectively, the main input corresponding to p, p'-DDE (1.00 kg). The distribution of organic contaminants in surface sediments was not homogeneous as a consequence of the presence of many simultaneous sources and different meteorological, hydrodynamic, and physicochemical conditions. As a consequence of flash flood events, p, p'-DDE concentrations in surface sediments increased significantly in the central and south zones of the lagoon. However, in the case of PCBs, a dilution effect was observed in the south zone after such events, reducing the environmental risk. These changes in the pollutant distribution persisted at least 1 year later (autumn 2010), showing that the impact of flood events in the distribution of persistent organic contaminants in Mediterranean coastal lagoons is of relevance according to the ecological risk assessment carried out. The impact of these events should be also considered in other coastal systems, especially in semiarid and semiconfined areas.

AB  - The present study is aimed at characterising the ecological niche of a typical forest orchid (Epipactis pontica) in Slovakia. Vegetation-environmental data were collected across mountain ranges and their foothills in the Western Carpathians in 2011. Numerical classification was performed to delimit the main forest vegetation types and a linear mixed effect model was applied to reveal differences between plots with versus without E. pontica. This endangered species of Slovak flora grows in thermophilous turkey oak forests (Quercion confertae-cerris), mesophilous broad-leaved mixed oak-hornbeam forests (Carpinion betuli), but most stands correspond to the acidic (Luzulo-Fagion sylvaticae) and mesotrophic beech forests (Fagion sylvaticae). Principal component analysis supported the floristic separation of plant communities and showed some significant vegetation-environmental relationships. E. pontica prefers forests with closed canopy (mean canopy openness: 8.5-15.1%) occurring especially on slightly acidic (soil reaction: 4.48-5.65) and nutrient-poor soils (soil conductivity: 43.1-72.6 mu S/cm). The proposed Ellenberg indicator values for light (4), temperature (5), continentality (4), moisture (5), soil reaction (6) and nutrients (5) follow species composition pattern of vascular plants in Slovak phytosociological releves with E. pontica occurrence. They are also in accordance with its habitat conditions and ecological requirements in other parts of its range. The linear mixed effect model did not confirm any environmental peculiarity of plots with the presence of E. pontica at a microscale level and this result was consistent across the studied sites.

AB  - The Lobau, a former dynamic floodplain area of the Danube River situated close to Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity changed the conditions in the system which is nowadays groundwater-fed, back-flooded, and characterized by sedimentation and terrestrialisation processes.
   On one hand, the artificially created habitat types have a high conservation potential; they harbour a rich community whose habitat range has been reduced due to degradation in the cultural landscape. On the other hand, restoration efforts aim to reverse the anthropogenic impact due to damming and to restore the natural status of the wetland with its dynamic hydrological regime and its associated rheophilic community as far as possible.
   The challenge for floodplain managers is now to develop a compromise solution that integrates restoration and conservation efforts. The potential options range from the conservation of the present status to the restoration of the floodplain towards pristine conditions. We used a logistic regression approach to predict the potential habitat availability for indicator species including highly endangered and flagship species which are used for attracting public support for the conservation/restoration measures.
   The results represent the actual and potential future community of the system for the management options. Based on the results we make recommendations for the selection of a best compromise for the management of the floodplain with special regard to the legal objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this analysis is to provide an overview of the precipitation conditions of the Balaton catchments. Because Lake Balaton has shallow water, it responds sensitively to any change in the environment, including precipitation. The influence of the dry period on the lake's water level in the years 2000-2003 serves as a good example for this. Data series of 25 precipitation gauging stations of catchments, recorded between 1921 and 2007, were investigated in this study.. Annual precipitation sums, monthly distribution of rainfall, and the influence of rainfall on natural change in water storage were studied. The whole catchment area was divided into different parts depending on geographical locations and climatic conditions. We found significant differences in the regional precipitation amounts. The western part of the catchments (half of the Zala River basin) has the highest annual precipitation sum, while going towards the east and in the "cut" of the lake, the amount of rainfall decreases. At the majority of the examined stations the decrease in precipitation was also detectable on the basis of WMO climate means, but we did not find explicit decreasing tendencies in the case of several stations. Surface runoff moved collaterally with precipitation decreases, and its impact on natural change in water storage was even more pronounced. The natural change in water storage of the lake is a good indicator reflecting the drying tendency of the recent past, and it calls attention to the necessity of more deliberated water management of the Lake Balaton. Presumably, the precipitation phenomenon, similarly to the past, will also vary in the future. Analysing the data of the past decades may help in making more established decisions.

AB  - Enteropathogen contamination of groundwater, including potable water sources, is a global concern. The spreading on land of animal slurries and manures, which can contain a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms, is considered a major contributor to this contamination. Some of the pathogenic microorganisms applied to soil have been observed to leach through the soil into groundwater, which poses a risk to public health. There is a critical need, therefore, for characterization of pathogen movement through the vadose zone for assessment of the risk to groundwater quality due to agricultural activities. A lysimeter experiment was performed to investigate the effect of soil type and condition on the fate and transport of potential bacterial pathogens, using Escherichia coli as a marker, in four Irish soils (n = 9). Cattle slurry (34 tonnes per ha) was spread on intact soil monoliths (depth, 1 m; diameter, 0.6 m) in the spring and summer. No effect of treatment or the initial soil moisture on the E. coli that leached from the soil was observed. Leaching of E. coli was observed predominantly from one soil type (average, 1.11 +/- 0.77 CFU ml(-1)), a poorly drained Luvic Stagnosol, under natural rainfall conditions, and preferential flow was an important transport mechanism. E. coli was found to have persisted in control soils for more than 9 years, indicating that autochthonous E. coli populations are capable of becoming naturalized in the low-temperature environments of temperate maritime soils and that they can move through soil. This may compromise the use of E. coli as an indicator of fecal pollution of waters in these regions.

AB  - Methodologies based on indicators occupy a prevalent place when assessing ecosystem functioning and monitoring desertification processes because they are affordable yet do not compromise accuracy. The landscape function analysis (LFA), developed in Australia by David Tongway (CSIRO), uses soil surface indicators to assess the condition of a given ecosystem by producing three numerical indices (stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling) reflecting the status of basic soil functions. None of the previous studies aiming to validate the LFA indices have explored how they relate to surrogates of soil functioning using a large number of test sites capturing different climatic and soil conditions. We aimed to do so using data gathered in 29 Stipa tenacissima steppes in Spain. The nutrient cycling index was strongly correlated with soil variables related to microbial activity and nutrient cycling, such as soil pH, total soil N and P, soil respiration and phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities. Strong correlations between the infiltration index and both soil compaction and the water holding capacity of soils were found. The stability index was also significantly correlated with most of the soil variables evaluated. These relationships were evident in both gypsum and calcareous soils. Our results indicate that the LFA indices may be employed as surrogates of soil variables related to nutrient cycling and water infiltration in semi-arid S. tenacissima steppes. The LFA methodology has an enormous potential to assist land managers and policy makers in the establishment of cost-effective desertification monitoring and restoration programs in semi-arid environments.

AB  - Holocene palynological samples from the Laguna Hinojales (37similar to 34' S; 57degrees 27' W), southeastern Buenos Aires province, contain algae (Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Dinoflagellata) and acritarchs. The chlorophycean algae consist of cenobia of Pediastrum musterii Tell and Mataloni, P. boryantim (Turpin) Meneghini, and Scenedesmus sp., colonies of Botryococois braunii Mitzing, zygospores of Debarya madrasensis lyengar, Motigeotia laetenvirens (Braun) Wittrock, Moitgeotia sp., Zygnenia sp. and Spirogyra spp., and spores of Desmidiaceae. Cyanophycean sheets and akinetes of Gloeotrichia sp. are well preserved. The assemblages also contain freshwater dinoflagellates, represented by a peridinioid genus. Among the acritarchs, Cobricosphaeridium spp. reach highest percentages in the lowermost part of the core, where possibly freshwater algal spores are also present. These palynomorphs, produced by organisms from plankton and benthic communities, are used as indicators of nutrient, depth and salinity changes. Variable size and salinity of the water body are inferred from fluctuating frequencies of algae and acritarchs between ca. 4,500 - 2,100 C-14 yr B.P. From 2,100 C-14 yr B.P, algal assemblages indicate a freshening of the water and a gradual transition to favourable trophic conditions in the shallow lake. Higher values of Pediastrum spp., Scenedesmus sp., and Zygnemataceae, along with low frequencies of Botryococcus braunii reflect elevated nutrient levels in a relatively shallow lake. The improvement of climatic conditions, especially an increase in average temperature, probably was responsible for the expansion of aquatic plants and natural eutrophication of the water environment. After 400 14C yr B.P. the spectrum suggests a shallow eutrophic lake. However, alternating intervals, less favourable for algae, reflect a reduction in the water body size, possibly related to periods of lower precipitation.

AB  - Benthic indices are useful indicators of sediment condition, but many indices are difficult to employ because they require large calibration datasets. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) requires minimal local calibration, but it was developed in Europe and the validity of its extension to distant regions is unclear. Here we compare its performance in Southern California's marine bays with that of the Benthic Response Index (BRI), a locally derived data-intensive index. AMBI was calibrated in four ways: (1) using the original AMBI species' classifications developed in Europe; (2) augmenting the original classifications with closely related taxa, following AMBI guidelines; (3) using local expertise to independently classify taxa; and (4) revision of the local expert classifications by European developers of the index. These approaches were applied to a 685 sample data set and assessed relative to the BRI by comparing samples' classification from best to worst and by evaluating the level of agreement in assigning samples into four condition categories. The AMBI was validated against environmental proxies of disturbance and expert judgement, using consensus agreement about sample condition developed by nine benthic ecologists. The first AMBI approach did not work well, as only 24% of the 928 taxa were on the original AMBI species list, resulting in only 11% of the samples meeting the required 20% of classified individuals for AMBI application. The other approaches classified substantially more taxa, allowing application to 75-98% of the samples. Both of these approaches were significantly correlated with the BRI, though the correlations were lower than between the AMBI runs. None of the AMBI approaches, though, compared well with either the BRI or the validation data when placing samples into perturbation categories, with the AMBI having a greater central tendency. AMBI categorized less than 5% of the samples as reference compared to almost one-third of the samples by the experts or BRI, and substantially underestimating the number of severely affected samples. Species most responsible for disagreements between BRI and AMBI approaches were identified. Four modifications to enhance AMBI performance were identified: (1) incorporate local expertise in assigning ecological classifications, (2) use transformed abundance weighting to reduce the effect of dominant species, (3) calibrate the categorization scaling using expert judgement, and (4) use the AMBI in combination with other measures, such as the M-AMBI. The success of these modifications is specific to this study, but they are likely to enhance AMBI's performance worldwide. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global warming is one of the major causes of reef coral ecosystems' degradation. Predictions of further rise in sea surface temperatures call for urgent action. In this study, a holistic method for bio-monitoring heat stress in reef ecosystems was tested and optimized. Long-term induction of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress by elevated temperatures (30 degrees C and 32 degrees C) was assessed on fragments of reef-building corals and compared to control conditions (26 degrees C). The quantification of both oxidative stress, through lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in a long-term experiment (60 days), using seven Indo-Pacific reef-building coral species, provided useful information that was interpreted in combination with the observed partial mortality and growth rate of these organisms. These biomarkers were combined in integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices, either in an antioxidant defense mechanisms and oxidative stress response category (approach A: GST, CAT, LPO, and SOD) or in an integrated stress response category - organism performance (approach B: GST, CAT, LPO, SOD, partial mortality, and growth rate). The results of this study indicate that the IBRs were responsive to temperature treatment and dependent on the coral species. The approach B was the most adequate since it better reflected the stress suffered by the tested species, whereas the set of four biochemical biomarkers (approach A) was not enough to explain the organismal response of most of the tested species to thermal stress conditions.

AB  - In recent years many efforts have been made to overcome the conventional soil fertility analysis limitations contributing to the improvement of precision agriculture. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) is one of the methodologies proposed for the soil parameters analysis in a fast, cost effective and environmentally friendly way. However, most of contributions reported in the literature have been limited to the use of elemental data determined by EDXRF, which may cause loss of useful information contained in their spectra. Therefore, this study evaluates the use of EDXRF spectral data, under two measurement conditions, combined with partial least square regression (PLSR) in order to quantify cation exchange capacity (CEC), sum of exchangeable bases (SB) and base saturation percentage (BSP) in agricultural soils. Multivariate calibration models using full spectrum and selection of the most important EDXRF variables were developed. The variable selection achieved the best prediction power for all analyzed parameters. From randomization test at 95% of confidence level it was concluded that the accuracy of the PLSR models with Na-Sc and Ti-U spectral data (condition measurement) were equivalent. The analysis of the figures of merit (linearity, accuracy, systematic errors, sensitivity and limit of detections) indicated that proposed models are suitable for modeling soil fertility indicators with EDXRF spectral data. Furthermore, it was possible to identify the spectral regions that most contributed for the models. Thus, this study contributes toward a better understanding of the nature of EDXRF spectral data in the modeling of SB, CEC and BSP in soils by PLSR.

AB  - This paper focuses on how political, economic, and biophysical factors shape institutions that mediate how livelihoods and ecological processes align and interact at Koija, a pastoralist group ranch in Mukogodo Division, Laikipia, Kenya. While there is currently a high-profile emphasis on landscape conservation and maintenance of wildlife mobility in East Africa, pastoralist herding range fragmentation is less often considered within conservation planning or assessments of ecological change. To address this, we asked, how have institutional changes interacted with the alignment of livestock husbandry livelihoods and ecological dynamics? We identified institutional changes that formed due to state intervention during the colonial and post-independence eras, and recent changes that have occurred due to privatized wildlife conservation. We then used ethnographic methods to analyze how these changes have interacted with biophysical conditions and herder agency to shape current livelihoods. We found that recent barriers to seasonal range access have occurred due to policies on private conservation ranches, conflicts between pastoralists in surrounding areas, and recent conservation interventions. While pastoralist households have adapted their livelihood strategies within these constraints on mobility, livelihoods have also been impacted by complex interactions with markets, changes in herding institutions, relations with conservation actors, ecological conditions of currently accessed sites, and biophysical factors related to livestock species. Bringing together political ecology and social-ecological systems literatures, we conclude that efforts to align institutions and ecological processes in favor of wildlife conservation overlook the current institutional and ecological basis of livelihoods and, in so doing, perpetuate a historically-rooted scalar mismatch between pastoralist livestock mobility and ecological variability.

AB  - Polyethylene plastic mulches are widely used in agriculture due to the countless advantages they have. However, the environmental problems associated with their use have led us to look for alternative mulch materials which degrade naturally and quickly, impact the environment less and function satisfactorily. To this end, biodegradable plastics and paper mulches are being used, but aspects related to their degradation should be studied more in-depth. This work provides the deterioration pattern of six biodegradable mulch materials (i.e. vegetable starch, polylactic acid plastic films or paper mulches) in horticultural crop in the edaphoclimatic conditions of Central Spain in two situations: over the lifetime of the mulches and after being incorporated into the soil. In the first situation, the deterioration levels were evaluated by recording the puncture resistance, weight and area covered in the above-soil and the in-soil part, and after soil incorporation by the number of fragments, their surfaces and weight. In the above-soil part, biodegradable plastics experienced further deterioration, particularly with no crop, while the paper mulch remained practically intact. However, the in-soil paper experienced complete and rapid degradation. At 200 days after soil incorporation, mulch residues were scarce, with the environmental effects it entails. These findings offer practical implications regarding the type of crop. The measurement of the surface covered, rather than the weight, was shown to be a more reliable indicator of the degradation of mulches. Furthermore, visual estimation was found to underestimate the functionality of mulches in comparison to that of the measurement of the surface covered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cattle grazing is a traditional agricultural activity and one of the obligatory factors for maintaining steppe ecosystems. The impact of grazing depends on its intensity, site area, soil, topography, and microclimatic conditions. Both intensive grazing and long-term cessation differently affect various components of the steppe biota. During the research, cursorial spiders and true bugs were collected in grazed and ungrazed gullies in northeastern Ukraine. Seventy true bug and 73 spider species were recovered from the ungrazed gully and 65 true bug and 50 spider species from the grazed one. More than a 20-year grazing cessation resulted in the partial overgrowth of the gully bottom by arboreal and shrub vegetation and the predominance of meadow herb species. Consequently, spider assemblages being the richest in species number and individuals lost their steppe traits. Ungrazed south-facing slope covered with typical steppe vegetation harbored the most steppe-like spider assemblage and maintained abundance of steppe specialists. Spider assemblages of the grazed gully were the poorest. Species richness, number of individuals and ecological groups of true bugs depended on orographic conditions, being more divers on the gully slopes (58-60 species vs. 42-44 species in the bottoms). The true bug individual numbers were the highest on the grazed slope while in the bottoms it did not change with grazing. In general, cursorial spiders were better indicators of the grazing pressure than true bugs. At the study site, no specific pastoral assemblages of both arthropod groups were indentified. Nevertheless, patched grazing was necessary for maintaining steppe-like vegetation and arthropod assemblages in the gully bottoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ocean Acidification (OA) will influence marine ecosystems by changing species abundance and composition. Major effects are described for calcifying organisms, which are significantly impacted by decreasing pH values. Direct effects on commercially important fish are less well studied. The early life stages of fish populations often lack internal regulatory mechanisms to withstand the effects of abnormal pH. Negative effects can be expected on growth, survival, and recruitment success. Here we study Norwegian coastal cod, one of the few stocks where such a negative effect was experimentally quantified, and develop a framework for coupling experimental data on OA effects to ecological-economic fisheries models. In this paper, we scale the observed physiological responses to the population level by using the experimentally determined mortality rates as part of the stock-recruitment relationship. We then use an ecological-economic optimization model, to explore the potential effect of rising CO2 concentration on ecological (stock size), economic (profits), consumer-related (harvest) and social (employment) indicators, with scenarios ranging from present day conditions up to extreme acidification. Under the assumptions of our model, yields and profits could largely be maintained under moderate OA by adapting future fishing mortality (and related effort) to changes owing to altered pH. This adaptation comes at the costs of reduced stock size and employment, however. Explicitly visualizing these ecological, economic and social tradeoffs will help in defining realistic future objectives. Our results can be generalized to any stressor (or stressor combination), which is decreasing recruitment success. The main findings of an aggravation of trade-offs will remain valid. This seems to be of special relevance for coastal stocks with limited options for migration to avoid unfavorable future conditions and subsequently for coastal fisheries, which are often small scale local fisheries with limited operational ranges.

AB  - Little is known about the endemic Iberian wild rabbit subspecies, Otyctolagus cuniculus algirus, despite its importance in Mediterranean ecosystems. An individual's physical condition is of undisputed importance when evaluating the quality of habitats or restocking enclosures to assess the corresponding population status. We analysed post-weaning body weight and growth of 351 individuals of the endemic Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus subspecies under semi-natural conditions in a breeding enclosure in central Portugal. From these data, we described and estimated growth rates for juvenile and adult stages, and 3 sigmoidal growth models were developed. Body weight showed a linear growth of 0.00765 kg/d until 0.6 kg, whereafter it began to decrease steeply until 1 kg (<0.005 kg/d between 0.6 and 0.7 kg, <0.003 kg/d between 0.7 and 0.9 kg, and <0.001 kg/d then on). An age prediction linear growth equation was estimated for individuals up to 0.6 kg. The von Bertalanffy model best described the observed body weight growth. Juvenile body weight growth of Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus is lower than that of the widespread Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus. Our data revealed that Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus seems to be smaller, grows less and for less time than Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus, according to the literature. Body weight of the studied individuals seems to be more similar to free-living than to cage-bred individuals, according to the literature. These results should provide important indicators to assist managers and conservationists in accessing habitat quality for wild rabbit populations.

AB  - Obtaining a representative estimate of discard mortality for population and ecosystem assessments is very challenging. This can only rarely be done directly by recovering tagged discarded individuals. Instead, semi-quantitative measures of individual fish vitality or physical condition, obtained by onboard observers prior to discarding, can be used. Such vitality measures can be a good indicator of discard mortality, and by virtue of the data collection method, should also reflect the condition of discards throughout the fishery. Furthermore, vitality can be predicted using covariates known to affect discard mortality, allowing for a more general assessment. We argue that a representative mortality rate can be estimated using the product of at least two probabilities: that of belonging to a particular vitality class, conditional on the factors experienced during capture and catch handling; and the probability of surviving the event, conditional on pre-release vitality. Here we estimate mortalities for five fish taxa captured in southern Gulf of St. Lawrence fisheries. The conditional survival probabilities were obtained using survival analysis of data from experiments in which fish were captured using commercial fishing methods and held to assess short-term mortality (2-3 days). The analysis included a mixture model with a fraction of unaffected individuals, which appears appropriate for data from bycatch mortality studies. Based on this study and the mechanistic interpretation of the mixture model, short-term monitoring of discard mortality may be sufficient to characterize longer term impacts in a number of taxa.

AB  - Public environmental awareness and support for management measures are key determinants of the scope for successful implementation of natural resource management. To assess user perceptions and opinions on resource state and potential management options for the coastal zone of Curapao, we queried 250 coastal resource users from around the island (sport divers, part-time artisanal fishermen and recreational boaters) using questionnaires. There is wide awareness of a long-term decline in coastal resource condition as measured by various indicators. Even among fishermen there was wide awareness of anthropogenic contributors to the decline, broad agreement of management measures required and a general willingness to contribute to management by means of annual license fees. Some of the more salient findings include the endorsement by fishermen of the current ban on spearfishing (81%), the regulation of the beach seine fishery for scad (77%), the introduction of fish reserves (72%, special protection for sea turtles (90%), conch (82%), and lobsters (72%), and notable support for gradual elimination of trap fisheries (45%). Also, both divers (65%) and boaters (92%) expressed the importance to them of an attractive coastline, with both groups expressing preference for natural (un-built) coastline (>74%) above other categories. Management based on the concept "user pays", as already implemented in the Netherlands Antilles on Saba and Bonaire, is well supported by the resource user public. A review of other main constraints such as finances and institutional capacity, shows that conditions are quite favorable for implementation of new legislation. Modern coral reef management is urgently needed in Curacao to safeguard a key natural resource and concerted action is called for on the part of government agencies, legislators and elected officials.

AB  - Quantitative evaluation of soil quality (SQ) is of paramount importance to provide a basis for restoring degraded land that affects the living conditions of people in these degraded areas. Amongst land degradation types, karst rocky desertification (KRD) is caused by human disturbance on a fragile karst geo-ecological environment. However, SQ evaluations have not been widely and correctly used in KRD soil systems due to the complex soil conditions and lack of uniform standards. SQ evaluation can be qualitatively and quantitatively calculated. Soil quality index (SQI) can be used more frequently due to its simplicity and quantitative flexibility. To quantitatively analyse the SQ of four KRD grades in Hunan Province in China, 25 soil properties at 0-20 cm were identified as potential SQ indicators. SQ was assessed via SQI based on a total data set (TDS) and a minimum data set (MDS). Similar to grey relational analysis (GRA), the SQI was ranked as follows: potential KRD>moderate KRD>light KRD>intensive KRD. Total phosphorus, pH, calcium, clay, capillary porosity, biomass nitrogen and microbial biomass phosphorus were selected into the MDS, and they were sensitive to SQ. However, available phosphorus and soil organic carbon were not selected in the MDS. Soil quality in KRD areas could be quantitatively evaluated using SQI via factor analysis. SQ assessment based on the MDS can represent TDS to reduce labour intensity and detection costs. The quantification of SQ under different KRD grades can provide reference for improving SQ in limestone rocky desertification areas.

AB  - Periglacial environments are characterized by highly dynamic landscapes. Freezing and thawing lead to ground movement, associated with cryoturbation and solifluction. These processes are sensitive to climate change and variably distributed depending on multiple environmental factors. In this study, we used multi-geometry Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to investigate the spatial distribution of the mean annual ground velocity in a mountainous landscape in Northern Norway. Statistical modeling was employed to examine how periglacial ground velocity is related to environmental variables characterizing the diverse climatic, geomorphic, hydrological and biological conditions within a 148 km(2) study area. Two-dimensional (2D) InSAR results document mean annual ground velocity up to 15 mm/yr. Vertical and horizontal velocity components in the East-West plane show variable spatial distribution, which can be explained by the characteristics of cryoturbation and solifluction operating differently over flat and sloping terrain. Statistical modeling shows that slope angle and mean annual air temperature variables are the most important environmental factors explaining the distribution of the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. Vegetation and snow cover also have a local influence, interpreted as indicators of the ground material and moisture conditions. The results show contrasted model performance depending on the velocity component used as a response variable. In general, our study highlights the potential of integrating radar remote sensing and statistical modeling to investigate mountainous regions and better understand the relations between environmental factors, periglacial processes and ground dynamics.

AB  - In recent decades, the traditional management of woods has ceased in several parts of the Apennine ridge, with the result that some woods have not undergone forestry for 40-70 years. The research aim was to assess the variation of species and functional composition in the herb layer of Ostrya carpinifolia woods (central Italy), after cessation of the usual management (coppice-with-standards). Using a space-for-time substitution, we compared stands at the end of the usual rotation cycle (20-25 years) with stands not subjected to silvicultural treatments for about 40-45 years and collected environmental and structural data. The main drivers of the herb layer modification, assessed using Ellenberg indicator values analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA), were primarily related to time since the last coppicing and wood structure. Results of indicator species analyses (ISAs) and Wilcoxon rank sum tests indicated that in abandoned coppices, the regenerative processes proceed through the spread of late-successional species, while the light filtering through canopy fosters species usually considered of fringe habitats. The functional strategies revealed by ISA and RDA underlined still stressful conditions in stands at the end of the usual coppicing rotation cycle, which might be thought as a legacy of the post-logging condition, and processes of recovery/maturation of the forest systems in abandoned woods leading to a better spatial and temporal niche partitioning. The preferential distribution of species usually growing in the Apennine beech woods supports the hypothesis that the studied O. carpinifolia woods are secondary forest ecosystems originating from the degradation of mixed beech woods.

AB  - Bashkir Lombardy hybrid poplar (Populus nigra L. x Populus nigra var. italica Du Roi) is an ornament woody plant. It is used in landscape architecture. The hybrid poplar tends to grow rapidly. The average height increases in trees aged 30 years or less makes up 0.95 m. The tree is very resistant to atmospheric toxicants. Its vegetative season makes 190 days, while the same period of Berlin poplar is 153 and of Sverdlovsk Lombardy poplar, it is 174 days. All vegetation phases of hybrid poplar follow each other in strict sequence. However, the calendar dates of the beginning (swelling, bud opening) and of their ending (leaf blooming and leaf fall) of the vegetation phases are strongly affected by temperature conditions and precipitation during the prevernal period. In all urban plantings, the hybrid showed high tree ornament qualities. These are vigorous trees with strait timber and dense crown. In the zone of low pollution high sanitary and hygienic points, life status and aesthetic landscape assessment of the trees are observed (I). However, the Student's test (t) which was made to compare these indicators in other pollution zones (II and III) showed a statistically unreliable difference, which also confirms the tolerance of this hybrid to environmental conditions. There was made a research of forest and landscape valuation of hybrid poplar (Populus nigra L. x Populus nigra var. italica Du Roi). The results of the research as well as long phenological observations prove that widespread plantation of this tree can be very perspective for urban landscapes.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play major roles in nutrient acquisition by crops and are key actors of agroecosystems productivity. However, agricultural practices can have deleterious effects on plant-fungi symbiosis establishment in soils, thus inhibiting its potential benefits on plant growth and development. Therefore, we have studied the impact of different soil management techniques, including conventional moldboard ploughing and no-till under an optimal nitrogen (N) fertilization regime and in the absence of N fertilization, on AMF spore density and soil chemical, physical, and biological indicators in the top 20 cm of the soil horizon. A field experiment conducted over six years revealed that AMF spore density was significantly lower under conventional tillage (CT) combined with intensive synthetic N fertilization. Under no-till (NT) conditions, the density of AMF spore was at least two-fold higher, even under intensive N fertilization conditions. We also observed that there were positive correlations between spore density, soil dehydrogenase enzyme activity, and soil penetration resistance and negative correlations with soil phosphorus and mineral N contents. Therefore, soil dehydrogenase activity and soil penetration resistance can be considered as good indicators of soil quality in agrosystems. Furthermore, the high nitrate content of ploughed soils appears to be detrimental both for the dehydrogenase enzyme activity and the production of AMF spores. It can be concluded that no-till, by preventing soil from structural and chemical disturbances, is a farming system that preserves the entire fungal life cycle and as such the production of viable spores of AMF, even under intensive N fertilization.

AB  - Charophytes play an important role in aquatic ecosystems but there is a lack of knowledge on the ecology of these macroalgae. Our aim was to characterise the habitat of 12 charophyte species from 78 sites in Switzerland characterised by a set of environmental variables considered critical to the physiology and survival of these plants (climate, land-use, morphometry and chemistry). We searched (i) to evaluate how environmental gradients explain the distribution of species; and (ii) to identify if some species have narrower habitat range than others ("specialist" vs "generalist" species). The Outlying Mean Index (OMI) measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by a given species and the mean habitat conditions of all studied waterbodies and was used to analyse the distribution of species. Waterbody size, conductivity and altitude were the most discriminating habitat variables of 7 of the 12 species, followed by calcium and total phosphorus. Chara strigosa is considered a specialist of cold oligotrophic hard waters, and three as generalists (Chara contraria, Chara gloPularis, Chara vulgaris) with respect to our set of charophyte sites. We demonstrate that charophyte species occur together in a narrow environmental envelope but do not occupy exactly similar habitats. Despite a discrepancy among absolute optima of species in different countries, the relative position of species is likely to be transferable to other regions. Improving our understanding about the ecology of charophyte species by considering a broader scale dataset and more fine-scale biotic and abiotic factors is proposed as an important perspective.

AB  - Currently, the mouse represents the preferred model organism among mammals used for animal studies. Due to a great availability of mutant strains it represents a standard method to analyze in vivo the effects of targeted gene manipulations. While this - at least in theory - represents a valuable tool to elucidate the pathophysiology of certain human diseases, there are several caveats which need to be considered working with animals.
   In our study we aimed at elucidating, how a widely established breeding strategy, i.e. the use of "foster mothers" to save the survival of compromised mouse pups for ongoing experiments, per se, affects the emotional phenotype of the fostered offspring. Since it is a popular method to use outbred strains like NMRI to do this job, we sought to evaluate the potential effects of such an artificial postnatal condition and compare either offspring nurtured by their biological mothers or two different strains of foster mothers. Hence we analysed changes in maternal care and later on the emotional behaviour of male and female C57BL/6 mice reared by (i) their biological C57BL/6 mothers, (ii) C57BL/6 foster mothers and (iii) NMRI foster mothers in a behavioural test battery. In addition we assessed corticosterone levels as indicator for stress-physiological changes.
   Besides clear differences in maternal behaviour, our study indicates an altered emotional state (i.e. differences in anxiety and depressive-like features) in mice reared by different "categories" of mothers, which emphasizes the importance to embed such perinatal conditions in the evaluation of animal-deriving data.

AB  - Factors determining individuality are still poorly understood. Rodents are excellent model organisms to study individuality, due to a rich behavioral repertoire and the availability of well-characterized isogenic populations. However, most current behavioral assays for rodents have short test duration in novel test environments and require human interference, which introduce coercion, thereby limiting the assessment of naturally occurring individuality. Thus, we developed an automated behavior system to longitudinally monitor conditioned fear for assessing PTSD-like behavior in individual mice. The system consists of a safe home compartment connected to a risk-prone test compartment (TC). Entry and exploration of the TC is solely based on deliberate choice determined by individual fear responsiveness and fear extinction. In this novel ethological assay, C57BL/6J mice show homogeneous responses after shock exposure (innate fear), but striking variation in long-lasting fear responses based on avoidance and risk assessment (learned fear), including automated stretch-attend posture quantification. TC entry (retention) latencies after foot shock differed >24h and the re-explored TC area differed >50% among inbred mice. Next, we compared two closely related C57B L/6 substrains. Despite substantial individual differences, previously observed higher fear of C57BL/6N vs. C57B L/6J mice was reconfirmed, whereas fear extinction was fast and did not differ. The observed variation in fear expression in isogenic mice suggests individual differences in coping style with PTSD-like avoidance. Investigating the assumed epigenetic mechanisms, with reduced interpretational ambiguity and enhanced translational value in this assay, may help improve understanding of personality type-dependent susceptibility and resilience to neuropsychiatric disorders such as PTSD.

AB  - Conservation biology has provided wildlife managers with a wealth of concepts and tools for use in conservation planning; among them is the surrogate species concept. Over the past 20 years, a growing body of empirical literature has demonstrated the limited effectiveness of surrogates as management tools, unless it is first established that the target species and surrogate will respond similarly to a given set of environmental conditions. Wildlife managers and policy makers have adopted the surrogate species concept, reflecting the limited information available on most species at risk of extirpation or extinction and constraints on resources available to support conservation efforts. We examined the use of surrogate species, in the form of cross-taxon response-indicator species (that is, one species from which data are used to guide management planning for another, distinct species) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California (U. S. A.). In that system there has been increasing reliance on surrogates in conservation planning for species listed under federal or state endangered species acts, although the agencies applying the surrogate species concept did not first validate that the surrogate and target species respond similarly to relevant environmental conditions. During the same period, conservation biologists demonstrated that the surrogate concept is generally unsupported by ecological theory and empirical evidence. Recently developed validation procedures may allow for the productive use of surrogates in conservation planning, but, used without validation, the surrogate species concept is not a reliable planning tool.

AB  - A multivariate approach was used to test the value of intertidal communities as a bioindicator of environmental conditions at Algeciras Bay, southern Spain. The study area is located in the Strait of Gibraltar and it is subjected to a variety of anthropic impacts. Eight localities (5 inside and 3 outside the bay) were selected, and four transects were undertaken in each locality to characterise the fauna and flora. The spatial distribution of the intertidal species reflected the physico-chemical conditions of Algeciras Bay. The stations located outside the bay, characterised by high hydrodynamism and dissolved oxygen and low sedimentation and turbidity, had a higher diversity and species richness than the inner stations. According to the BIO-ENV procedure and CCA, water turbidity was the factor which best correlated with the intertidal assemblages. SIMPER showed that the molluscs Chtamalus stellatus, Mytilus cf edulis, Littorina neritoides and Balanus perforatus, and the algae Gelidium pusillum, Corallina elongata, Asparagopsis armata, Colpomenia sinuosa and Fucus spiralis were the species that most contributed to the dissimilarity between internal and external sites. The present study, based on the spatial distribution of intertidal taxa, yielded similar results to those previously obtained in the area with costly physico-chemical analysis based on complex matrices of subtidal epifaunal communities. Consequently, the intertidal sampling method proposed in this study is presented here as a quick, effective alternative strategy, and can be useful in environmental monitoring programs, since these communities are easily accessible and amenable to sample, and the sessile nature of the majority of the species makes future, long-term monitoring relatively simple.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment of heavy metals in soil frequently involves testing of freshly spiked soils kept under stable humidity conditions, but it has been questioned whether these assessments are representative of the field situation. Furthermore, the poor correspondence that is often found between total metal content and metal toxicity calls for integrated chemical and biological analysis. The aim of this work was to determine time- and moisture-dependent changes in total water-extractable Cu as well as bioavailable Cu in soil water extracts. Measurements of total water-extractable copper ([Cu](tot)) were performed using furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. An in vitro assay employing a Cu-specific Pseudomonas fluorescens reporter strain was used to estimate Cu that was biologically available to the reporter strain. We refer to this copper fraction as "bioavailable," [Cu](bio). We found a time-dependent decrease in [Cu](tot) and [Cu](bio) during incubation for up to 220 d at field capacity. Hence the [Cu](bio) was reduced to between 32 and 40% of the initial values. Furthermore, the [Cu](bio) to [Cu](tot) ratio correlated positively with the amount of added Cu and tended to increase with time. The moisture content of the soil was important for Cu retention. Dry soil had higher [Cu](tot) concentrations than humid soil, but the [Cu](bio) to [Cu](tot) ratio was lower in the dry soil. Alternating drying and wetting did not lead to a more rapid Cu retention than observed under constant humid conditions. Our observations underline the need for considering both time and moisture effects when interpreting short-term toxicity studies and when making predictions concerning possible long-term effects of Cu in the soil environment.

AB  - Although it is known that forest productivity is highly correlated with canopy leaf area, the influence of environmental gradients within a forest on leaf area-productivity relationships has not been well-documented, particularly for mixed-species forests. The present study was conducted to define the mechanisms by which Central Hardwood forest communities respond to changes in environment. Ecological Land Type Phases (ELTPs) of the Central Hardwood region, delineated by soils, topography, and indicator vegetation, provided a framework to examine the impacts of environmental gradients on leaf area-productivity relationships at a landscape level. Three ELTPs(1) Quercus prinus / Carex picta-Vaccinium, Dry slope, (2) Quercus alba-Acer saccharum / Parthenocissus, Dry-Mesic Slope, and (3) Fagus-Acer saccharum / Arisaema, Mesic Slope- were selected and stratified into three slope positions viz. the upper edge of the community, the middle or center of the community on the slope, and the lower edge of the community. Circular plots of 0.02 ha in size were established for sampling. Standing stock (basal area, volume, and biomass), annual production, leaf area index, and growth efficiency were determined for each slope position and examined to determine the mechanisms and trends for community change across slope positions. Among the three communities studied, dry slopes compensated for drier conditions through both a shift in species composition and reduced annual production. Dry-mesic slopes exhibited adaptation only through changing species composition whereas mesic slopes compensated for drier conditions primarily through reduction in annual production. These results indicate that mixed-species forest communities adjust to environmental gradients through several mechanisms and that the relative importance of these mechanisms changes with community type.

AB  - Foraminifera are single-celled eukaryotes (protists) of large ecological importance, as well as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators and biostratigraphic tools. In addition, they are capable of surviving in anoxic marine environments where they represent a major component of the benthic community. However, the cellular adaptations of Foraminifera to the anoxic environment remain poorly constrained. We sampled an oxic-anoxic transition zone in marine sediments from the Namibian shelf, where the generaBolivinaandStainforthiadominated the Foraminifera community, and use metatranscriptomics to characterize Foraminifera metabolism across the different geochemical conditions. Relative Foraminifera gene expression in anoxic sediment increased an order of magnitude, which was confirmed in a 10-day incubation experiment where the development of anoxia coincided with a 20-40-fold increase in the relative abundance of Foraminifera protein encoding transcripts, attributed primarily to those involved in protein synthesis, intracellular protein trafficking, and modification of the cytoskeleton. This indicated that many Foraminifera were not only surviving but thriving, under the anoxic conditions. The anaerobic energy metabolism of these active Foraminifera was characterized by fermentation of sugars and amino acids, fumarate reduction, and potentially dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Moreover, the gene expression data indicate that under anoxia Foraminifera use the phosphogen creatine phosphate as an ATP store, allowing reserves of high-energy phosphate pool to be maintained for sudden demands of increased energy during anaerobic metabolism. This was co-expressed alongside genes involved in phagocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Foraminifera may use CME to utilize dissolved organic matter as a carbon and energy source, in addition to ingestion of prey cells via phagocytosis. These anaerobic metabolic mechanisms help to explain the ecological success of Foraminifera documented in the fossil record since the Cambrian period more than 500 million years ago.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of the global urban gardening movement to mitigate spatial and environmental injustice conditions in the urban space. After a background discussion of the spatial and environmental injustice theory and an assessment of methodologies that have been adopted in relevant studies, we will highlight existing links with urban gardening initiatives in a specific case study, i.e. the city of Rome, Italy. The case study is introduced to investigate the spatial coincidence of urban gardening initiatives in this specific city (assumed as the dependent variable) and spatial and environmental injustice (S&EI) indicators. Several S&EI-related phenomena whose relevance has been demonstrated are mapped, and their goodness of fit in serving as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of urban gardening agency is investigated. The analysis builds upon a quantitative approach and features a linear spatial regression model. Surprisingly, findings suggest that social-economic variables generally have greater influence on spatial injustice than environmental variables. In fact, from a theoretical perspective, our results challenge the current interpretation of urban gardening as a mere means to address environmental, food or nature-related issues in cities. Instead, they support the increasingly popular interpretation of urban gardening as a political gesture. Our results provide policy-makers with useful observations about key variables related to spatial injustice in the city and contrasting initiatives, notably urban gardening projects. The paper concludes with a critical assessment of the results and the limiting and supporting factors of the featured theoretical and methodological framework.

AB  - Human communities in forested areas that are expected to experience climate-related changes have received little attention in the scholarly literature on vulnerability assessment. Many communities rely on forest ecosystems to support their social and economic livelihoods. Climate change could alter these ecosystems. We developed a framework that measures social vulnerability to slow-onset climate-related changes in forest ecosystems. We focused on temperate forests because this biome is expected to experience dramatic change in the coming years, with adverse effects for humans. We advance climate change vulnerability science by making improvements to measures of exposure and sensitivity and by incorporating a measure of adaptive capacity. We improved on other methods of assessing exposure by incorporating climate change model projections and thus a temporal perspective. We improved on other methods of assessing sensitivity by incorporating a variable representing interdependency between human populations and forests. We incorporated a measure of adaptive capacity to account for ways socioeconomic conditions might mitigate exposure and sensitivity. Our geographic focus was the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. We found that fifteen of the region's seventy-five counties were highly vulnerable to climate-related changes due to some combination of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Nine counties were highly vulnerable because they ranked very high in terms of exposure and sensitivity and very low in terms of adaptive capacity. The framework we developed could be useful for investigations of vulnerability to climate change in other forested contexts and in other ecological contexts where slow-onset changes might be expected under future climate conditions.

AB  - The Suquia River middle-lower basin (Cordoba, Argentina) is subjected to a strong anthropogenic impact because it receives pollutants from different sources. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after Cordoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream Cordoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins. Our results demonstrated the importance of addressing the environmental quality monitoring through an integrated analysis of water quality parameters together with histological, morphological and molecular parameters. Thus, our study provides a good model for application in other basins of South America. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the many methodologies available for undertaking environmental flow assessments, there are few published examples of environmental flow recommendations that arise from those assessments, and even fewer that evaluate their implementation. This is somewhat surprising considering environmental flow recommendations are effectively testable hypotheses of flow-ecology responses. We describe a framework to guide the assessment and recommendation of environmental flow regimes in Tasmania, Australia, where environmental values are highly catchment specific and rivers are largely semi-regulated or unregulated. This means that environmental flows must be focussed on setting water use thresholds to prevent degradation in condition, rather than delivering water to restore condition. The framework retains the philosophy and elements of many other methodologies but differs by having the flexibility to support application across different catchments while catering for catchment-specific issues. We present two case studies that demonstrate the application of our Framework, its use in the development of scientifically defensible environmental flow recommendations, and their implementation in catchment water management plans. The strengths of the Framework are: (i) using specific ecosystem values to define and communicate the objectives of environmental flows; (ii) using a non-prescriptive and flexible approach to incorporate catchment-specific issues; and (iii) framing recommendations in a manner that clearly illustrates flow linkages with ecosystem values so that stakeholders and managers understand the risks associated with water abstraction. Our experience demonstrates the imperative that scientists are not only involved in water planning but also in the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of plans so that the benefits of adaptive management can be realized.

AB  - Carbonate caves represent subterranean ecosystems that are largely devoid of phototrophic primary production. In semiarid and arid regions, allochthonous organic carbon inputs entering caves with vadose-zone drip water are minimal, creating highly oligotrophic conditions; however, past research indicates that carbonate speleothem surfaces in these caves support diverse, predominantly heterotrophic prokaryotic communities. The current study applied a metagenomic approach to elucidate the community structure and potential energy dynamics of microbial communities, colonizing speleothem surfaces in Kartchner Caverns, a carbonate cave in semiarid, southeastern Arizona, USA. Manual inspection of a speleothem metagenome revealed a community genetically adapted to low-nutrient conditions with indications that a nitrogen-based primary production strategy is probable, including contributions from both Archaea and Bacteria. Genes for all six known CO2-fixation pathways were detected in the metagenome and RuBisCo genes representative of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle were over-represented in Kartchner speleothem metagenomes relative to bulk soil, rhizosphere soil and deep-ocean communities. Intriguingly, quantitative PCR found Archaea to be significantly more abundant in the cave communities than in soils above the cave. MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN) analysis of speleothem metagenome sequence reads found Thaumarchaeota to be the third most abundant phylum in the community, and identified taxonomic associations to this phylum for indicator genes representative of multiple CO2-fixation pathways. The results revealed that this oligotrophic subterranean environment supports a unique chemoautotrophic microbial community with potentially novel nutrient cycling strategies. These strategies may provide key insights into other ecosystems dominated by oligotrophy, including aphotic subsurface soils or aquifers and photic systems such as arid deserts.

AB  - Field trials may be required to assess risks of genetically modified crops (GMCs) for nontarget arthropods. One critical point of these trials is their capacity to detect differences between the density of one taxon in the GMC and that in the comparator. The detection capacity of a trial depends on the abundance and variability of the taxon, the values assumed for type I (alpha) and II (beta) errors, and the characteristics of the trial and statistical design. To determine the optimal trial layout and statistical analysis, 20 field trials carried out in Spain from 2000 to 2009 to assess risks of GMCs on nontarget arthropods were examined with alpha and beta fixed at 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Under the experimental conditions tested, taxon variability is the most influential component determining test detection capacity; the maximum acceptable values of taxon variability to achieve a certain detection capacity were calculated for different numbers of replicates (blocks), treatments, and years. A close relationship between taxon variability and mean abundance in visual counts, pitfall traps, and yellow sticky traps allowed minimal critical abundance thresholds to be estimated to guarantee a certain detection capacity and to establish abundance criteria for selecting focal taxa. The number of replications (blocks), treatments, sites, and years has a lesser influence on detection capacity once minimal values in taxon abundance in field trials are ensured. Conclusions reached on the detection capacity of field trials with the experimental data obtained under Mediterranean conditions should be contrasted with those of other regions.

AB  - Constant and rapid increase in construction and demolition (C&D) waste generation and consumption of natural aggregate for concrete production became one of the biggest environmental problems in the construction industry. Recycling of C&D waste represents one way to convert a waste product into a resource but the environment benefits through energy consumption, emissions and fallouts reductions are not certain. The main purpose of this study is to determine the potentials of recycled aggregate concrete (concrete made with recycled concrete aggregate) for structural applications and to compare the environmental impact of the production of two types of ready-mixed concrete: natural aggregate concrete (NAC) made entirely with river aggregate and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) made with natural fine and recycled coarse aggregate. Based on the analysis of up-to-date experimental evidence, including own tests results, it is concluded that utilization of RAC for low-to-middle strength structural concrete and non-aggressive exposure conditions is technically feasible. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is performed for raw material extraction and material production part of the concrete life cycle including transport. Assessment is based on local LCI data and on typical conditions in Serbia. Results of this specific case study show that impacts of aggregate and cement production phases are slightly larger for RAC than for NAC but the total environmental impacts depend on the natural and recycled aggregates transport distances and on transport types. Limit natural aggregate transport distances above which the environmental impacts of RAC can be equal or even lower than the impacts of NAC are calculated for the specific case study.

AB  - An important challenge is getting to know the condition of vegetation in dry woodlands, fragile ecosystems with high ecological value, to propose conservation strategies. Our objectives were: (1) to quantify on-the-ground vegetation composition and structure in dry Ramorinoa girolae-dominated woodlands on three study sites, using (A) field-based methods and (B) passive and active remotely sensed data at multi-scale and (2) to assess whether the integration of different remote sensors allows for a better estimation. We recorded field-based data on 36 plots of 50 x 30 m distributed in three sites (Ischigualasto n = 16; Valle Fertil n = 10; Private land n = 10). On each plot, we estimated the standard deviation (SD) of passive (EVI-Enhanced Vegetation Index-and SATVI-Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) and active imagery data (SD of VV and VH polarisation) at multi-scale. The results of this approach show that passive and active remote sensing data were good indicators of almost all field-based data recorded at stand scale, except for richness, which was not related to remote sensing data. Shrub biomass, tree biomass and abundance of R. girolae were better explained by multi than single-sensor models. Only the variance in canopy cover of R. girolae was explained by single-sensor models. This work expands our understanding of the relationship of field-based data with both passive and active remotely sensed data, providing evidence that they could be used as a proxy for vegetation structure in dry R. girolae-dominated woodlands.

AB  - In this multi-proxy palaeo study, the response of primary producers and consumers to anthropogenic disturbances in a large shallow lake was investigated. Overall, eutrophication and water-level changes (partly inferred by bisaccate pollen grains) are well-reflected in changes in sedimentation rates of pigments, diatom and cladoceran species composition and other proxies (e.g. Rhabdocoela oocytes). In particular, the stepwise decrease in relative abundance of Pediastrum simplex compared to P. boryanum/P. duplex proved to be a good indicator for eutrophication intensity. Furthermore, reductions in the body size (i.e. coenobia diameter) of Pediastrum simplex were clearly related to phases of low visibility that were caused by lake damming in the 1950 s and by accelerating eutrophication in the 1990 s. During the latter period, strong algal growth led to turbid conditions, which are indicated by the co-occurrence of the diatoms Fragilaria crotonensis, Aulacoseira ambigua and A. granulata, the green algae Staurastrum sp. as well as the cladoceran Anthalona cf. milleri. This study highlights that subfossil remains, which are often found in, for instance, standard cladoceran analysis (green algae such as Pediastrum spp. and Staurastrum spp. or bisaccate pollen grains), can add valuable information to the reconstruction of past environmental conditions and biotic response. Such better and more holistic understanding of freshwater ecosystems is crucial to meet future challenges in a rapidly changing world.

AB  - Introduction. There is a need to develop fundamentally new theoretical methodological approach that would successfully solve the problems of economy and management in the field of government support for agricultural production.
   Problem Statement. Recommendations in favor of expediency of government support, measures for agricultural production are questioned in Ukraine and in other world countries. The importance of agricultural production for the economy of Ukraine and the importance of government support for its development are drivers of further research.
   Purpose. The purpose is to substantiate the expediency of government support of agricultural production on the basis of the analysis of natural climatic and production factors to ensure reproduction, efficient use of budget funds, and growth of agricultural production.
   Materials and Methods. The following methods have been used: monographic, scientific abstraction and constructive (while forming the basics of general methodology); structurally-functional connections (during the study of variational diversity of natural climatic and productive conditions of Ukraine as the main criterion for the creation and functioning of government support for agricultural production); a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis (while forming relationships among the cost parameters of the "green", "yellow", and "blue boxes").
   Results. The situation regarding government support in Ukraine has been analyzed through the prism of natural climatic and productive factors. Ukraine is characterized by a rather large spatial and geographical diversity. To estimate the intensity and trends in the production development, the indicator of agricultural production output has been used.
   Conclusions. We suggest that as the synthetic soil quality index of regional lands increases, the budget expenditure shall decrease, and vice versa.

AB  - Estuaries are special geographical units of sea and land alternation, and are sensitive to changes in environmental factors. Zostera japonica is a very widespread seagrass species in the Yellow River Estuary, China and seagrass beds consisted of them are important estuary ecosystem resources. Water and sediment regulation at the Xiaolangdi Reservoir on the Yellow River can change the water environment in the estuary and threaten seagrass distribution. We evaluated the salinity and turbidity stress on Z. japonica by site sampling and laboratory tests, and compared both sets of growth conditions. We then set turbidity and salinity gradients to quantify the variation in sediment and salinity conditions imposed by the water and sediment regulation. Results showed that changes in Z. japonica biomass can be used as a stress indicator. Salinity levels of 20 ppt and turbidity levels below 50 NTU were the most suitable for growth. Biomass decreased as turbidity increased. At high turbidity (> 100 NTU), growth in low salinity (< 20 ppt) was significantly better than at high salinity (> 25 ppt). The rank of inhibitory effect of salinity, turbidity and interactive salinity-turbidity treatment on the juvenile stage was salinity > salinity-turbidity interaction > turbidity. The rank of inhibitory effect on the mature stage was turbidity > salinity-turbidity interaction > salinity. Salinity inhibited growth at the juvenile stage, while turbidity inhibited growth at the mature stage. Our research suggested that Z. japonica can adapt to resist the stress of changing salinity and turbidity, and this has great significance to the sustainability of the seagrass bed in the Yellow River Estuary.

AB  - Coal resource extensive development and utilization seriously threatens the region fragile ecological environment in Western China. Using the Yushenfu coal mining area as a study site, the ecological and geological environment (eco-geo-environment) factors affected by coal mining were analyzed. Spatiotemporal data extracted from remote sensing images was combined with survey data to establish an evaluation and prediction model. Integrated eco-geo-environmental quality was established by calculating the combined weight of each factor using the fuzzy delphi analytic hierarchy process method to develop a comprehensive multi-factor eco-geo-environment quality evaluation map. Results shows that the eco-geo-environment quality was divided in five grades of worse, bad, medium, good and better, the overall condition of the study region is moderate and it is apparent that regions with less intensive mining activities (Yushen sub coal mining area) are in better condition as compared to those regions where intensive mining is well established (Shenfu sub coal mining area). Comparisons with the classified eco-geo-environment categories revealed that different eco-geo-environment quality grades were affected different eco-geo-environment categories after a period of coal resources exploitation, but eco-geo-environment quality generally has been declining since the development and utilization of coal resources. The model provides a more scientific and accurate method to evaluate regional eco-geo-environmental quality, which is important for the coordinated development between coal mining and the fragile eco-environment.

AB  - The Paleozoic Wufeng-Longmaxi shale is one of the main horizons for shale gas exploration in Sichuan Basin. Outcrop, core and thin section observations, X-ray diffraction analysis, trace element geochemistry and other methods have been used to understand the sedimentary characteristics and identify hydrocarbon source rocks in suitable sedimentary paleoenvironments in the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale in northern Guizhou Province. The thickness of the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation ranges from 20 to 200 m and it was mainly deposited on a deep-water shelf. The TOC content is high, up to 5.75%. The main non-organic minerals are detrital quartz and clay minerals, with a little plagioclase feldspar, potassium feldspar, calcite, dolomite and pyrite. There is also biogenic microcrystalline quartz. Six lithofacies have been identified: siliceous shale, clay shale, calcareous shale, silty shale, carbonaceous shale, and muddy siltstone. Using biological Ba, V/(V+Ni), TOC, V/Cr, B, Sr/Ba and other indicators, we estimate primary productivity, redox conditions and paleosalinity and show that the early stage of Wufeng-Longmaxi deposition occurred under strong anoxic conditions, high paleosalinity and yielded a high TOC content and an excellent potential shale gas source. The anoxic environment was destroyed at the late stages of Wufeng-Longmaxi deposition, the TOC content decreased, so that it is likely to be a high quality source rock. Organic pores acted as the key reservoir space in the shales, and the pores are mainly mesopose, with most pore diameters less than 20 nm. The siliceous shale has high TOC content and brittle mineral (quartz) content making it an important exploration target for shale oil and gas exploration.

AB  - Changes in enzymatic activities and protein content of leg muscle and hepatopancreas tissue of two deep-sea crabs were studied after 34 days of food deprivation. Geryon longipes and Bythograea thermydron are the most abundant deep-sea crab species in their respective environment. Geryon longipes dwells on the middle and lower slope of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea and has a bathymetric range between 450 and 1950 m depth. Bythograea thermydron dwells in Pacific hydrothermal vent sites and has a bathymetric range between 2000 and 3000 m depth. After 34 days under laboratory conditions, citrate synthase activities in the hepatopancreas of G. longipes and B. thermydron were found to be much lower in food-deprived crabs compared to fed crabs. In both species, no lactate dehydrogenase activity was detected in hepatopancreas tissue, and no food deprivation effects were observed for either lactate dehydrogenase or citrate synthase activities in leg muscle tissue. No changes in protein were found after 34 days of food deprivation, either. Enzyme activities of fed and food-deprived specimens maintained in the laboratory encompassed the natural range of variation measured in freshly caught crabs of both species. Lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and protein content of freshly caught specimens of G. longipes were significantly lower than in freshly caught specimens of B. thermydron. The results are discussed taking into account the surrounding environmental features both species encounter and from the point of view of the potential use of citrate synthase activity as an indicator of nutritional condition in deep-sea crustaceans.

AB  - Between 1999 and 2002, thecamoebian assemblages were analyzed in one hundred samples collected from tributaries of the Upper Vltava River (Sumava Mts., Czech Republic, Middle Europe). The Sumava Mountains comprise the largest forest complex in Central Europe that is still preserved in a near natural condition. Diverse fresh-water environments (springs, wetlands, peat bogs, creeks, rivers and ponds) characterize the area.
   Thecamoebian tests were picked from dried 36-500 pin residues. In total, eighteen thecamoebian species were identified. The number of species per sample varies from one to thirteen, and the assemblages are characterized by dominance of Centropyxis orbicularis, C. aculeata, Pontigulasia compressa, Difflugia oblonga and Centropyxis arcula. A negative correlation (r = - 0.67) is notable between abundances of centropyxids and P. compressa. The negative correlation is caused by the different environmental conditions preferred by each taxon. Assemblages dominated by centropyxids originate mainly from standing water, whereas assemblages with common to abundant occurrences of P. compressa prefer running-water environments and substratum without coarse organic debris.
   Following a flood event in August 2002, thecamoebian assemblages were more diverse and abundant. While reworking of thecamoebian tests from different biotopes during flooding probably caused the increase in diversity, a boom in the population of Centropyxis orbicularis after the flood event confirmed the opportunistic character of this species.
   Boundary abundances of diagnostic species defined for flowing and standing waters in the forest area (= more than 20% of Pontigulasia compressa for flowing water and more than 50% of centropyxids for standing water) can be applied in interpretation of ancient environments. Similarly, changes in thecamoebian assemblages before and after the flood event can be used in paleoecology.

AB  - From biomarker distributions it is possible to distinguish extracts from four different members/facies (Meade Peak, Rex, Retort, and Tosi) of the Permian Phosphoria Formation at Little Sheep Creek, Montana. These distributions reflect changes in floral and faunal distribution in response to a changing depositional environment and suggest that the Retort and Tosi Members (the second cycle of deposition) were deposited under more anoxic conditions and at higher salinity than Meade Peak and Rex Members (the first cycle). Correlations between biomarker indicators of anoxia and salinity suggest that anoxia was in part the result of a chemocline separating normal marine waters above from more saline bottom waters. Anoxia and salinity in the bottom waters increased with time making conditions in the basin progressively mom hostile to benthic organisms. Development of extreme environmental conditions in continental shelf habitats (such as those suggested by biomarker parameters at Little Sheep Creek) may have compounded spatial problems created by continental suturing suggested to be a cause of Permian extinctions. Factor analysis indicates that four factors account for 75.3% of the variance in biomarker ratios. These factors are suggested to be source organisms (types of eukaryotic plankton), salinity, Eh, and mineralogy. The Grandeur Member of the Phosphoria, which is a typical reservoir rock for Phosphoria derived oils, yields an extract containing a novel C30 nitrogen-containing steroid. This unique steroid is not abundant in any other known extracts or oils, which along with the extremely low Porphyrin Maturity Parameter of all the extracts (PMP < 0.01), confirms the absence of migrated oils in the Phosphoria at Little Sheep Creek. The biomarker ratios C29 alphabetabeta/(alphabetabeta + alphaalphaalpha) steranes; Ts/(Ts + Tm); triaromatic/(triaromatic + monoaromatic) steroids; short/(long + short chain) monoaromatic steroids; and short/(long + short chain) triaromatic steroids are commonly used to determine the thermal maturity of oils and source rock extracts. However, these ratios show considerable variation in core extracts of the same thermal maturity from different facies. In contrast, the thermal maturity parameters, C29 alphaalphaalpha 20S/(20S + 20R) steranes and Porphyrin Maturity Parameter (PMP) show little variation, indicating that these parameters are less affected by changes in depositional environment and may be most useful for thermal maturation determinations of Phosphoria related oils and source rocks. This study supports previous work suggesting environmental effects must be considered if correct determination of thermal maturity of an oil or extract is to be made. This is especially true of oils and extracts from source rocks with high sulfur concentrations and/or those deposited at elevated salinities.

AB  - In a time of increasing environmental change caused by anthropogenic disturbance, there is a greater need to understand animal adaptations to manmade environments. In this regard, the measurement of stress-related endocrine markers provides a useful tool to examine the impact of environmental challenges and the physiological consequences for wildlife occupying such space. The aims of the present study were to validate fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as a measure of stress using samples from a male African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis;n= 1) and to compare fGCM concentrations of otters occurring in a transformed and in 2 natural areas in South Africa. From the 5 different enzyme-immunoassays (EIA) tested, a cortisol and oxoetiocholanolone (measuring 11,17 dioxoandrostanes) EIA revealed the highest response (74% and 48% increase, respectively) 30 and 24 hours after a stress event (translocation of a captive individual as part of its rehabilitation prior to release), respectively. For both EIAs, fGCM concentrations were comparable for samples collected up to 3 h post-defecation. Using the cortisol EIA for subsequent analyses, fGCM concentrations of animals from the transformed area (n= 20; mean [+/- SD]: 0.468 [+/- 0.539] mu g/g dry weight [DW]) were significantly higher (P= 0.013) than those from otters in the natural areas (n= 17; 0.242 [+/- 0.226] mu g/g DW). These preliminary results suggest that African clawless otters may have increased adrenocortical activity that could be due to conditions linked to living in a transformed environment.

AB  - On the Mediterranean island of Corsica, cohabitation between sympatric domestic pigs and Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) is common and widespread and can facilitate the maintenance and dissemination of several pathogens detrimental for the pig industry or human health. In this study, we monitored a population of free-ranging domestic pigs reared in extensive conditions within a 800-ha property located in Central Corsica which was frequently visited by a sympatric population of wild boar between 2013 and 2015. We used GPS collars to assess evidence of a spatially shared environment. Subsequently, we analysed by PFGE of XbaI-restricted DNA if those populations shared faecal Escherichia coli clones that would indicate contact and compared these results with those collected in a distant (separated by at least 50km) population of wild boar used as control. Results showed that one of eight wild boars sampled in the study area shed E.coli XbaI clones identical to clones isolated from domestic pig sounders from the farm, while wild boar populations sampled in distant parts of the study area shared no identical clone with the domestic pigs monitored. Interestingly, within the sampled pigs, two identical clones were found in 2013 and in 2015, indicating a long-time persisting colonization type. Although the method of isolation of E.coli and PFGE typing of the isolates requires intensive laboratory work, it is applicable under field conditions to monitor potential infectious contacts. It also provides evidence of exchange of microorganisms between sympatric domestic pigs and wild boar populations.

AB  - This paper contributes to the notion of ecosystem services (ES) and dis-services (EDS) through an exploration of how they are experienced in an inner-city neighbourhood. We contrast the findings of a science-led assessment with qualitative interview and visual data from the residents of the Woodberry Down Estate (London, UK). We use the ontology of co-production and co-construction to understand how material and interpretative factors condition the translation of identified service-providing units (SPUs) into directly experienced ES and EDS. Findings demonstrate that aspects contributing to the perceived liveability of a neighbourhood also condition the experienced ES and EDS. In our case study, the history of the estate translates into subjective feelings of safety which influence whether individuals access parts of the regenerated estate. While the regeneration project provides a broad range of new and improved SPUs with significant ES potential, the access and recreational functions these offer are especially appreciated for the increased opportunities for social interaction and visitors they provide. However, new SPUs such as landscape vistas and formal gardens that attract people are also assigned further significance as markers of new divisions among social housing residents. We suggest that in order to realise the much-prophesised health and wellbeing benefits of urban ES in an equitable manner, a science-led approach to designing and assessing potential ES should be accompanied by a context-sensitive assessment of community needs and liveability aspects.

AB  - Nutrient-rich wastewater may provide a sustainable means to cultivate microalgal biomass for biofuel use, yet many microalgal strains are very sensitive to wastewater due to toxicity caused by abiotic and biotic stresses. Naturally adapted strains that can efficiently grow in wastewater effluent are therefore of interest, however, the mechanisms by which such strains tolerate wastewater conditions are unknown. This study isolated indigenous chlorophyte microalgae strains from a municipal secondary wastewater effluent tank. The strains were identified by molecular phylogenetics and characterised by their ability to utilise exogenous organic carbon sources for mixotrophic growth and on the basis of oxidative stress tolerance, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of wastewater adaptation. Two of the strains, identified as Chlorella luteoviridis and Parachlorella hussii, could grow very well in raw wastewater due to their substantial tolerance to oxidative stress, which is highly induced by the wastewater environment. These strains exhibited high ascorbate peroxidase activity allowing increased scavenging of reactive oxygen species compared to strains that are not well adapted to the wastewater conditions. Both strains displayed high biomass and lipid productivity values in wastewater effluent. The accumulated lipids were suitable for biodiesel usage with characteristics equivalent to palm oil- and sunflower oil-derived biodiesel. The strains were also efficient in nutrient remediation from the wastewater. These results demonstrate the potential of these two strains for future biofuel applications coupled to wastewater remediation and highlight the importance of oxidative stress tolerance as a key indicator of efficient wastewater growth.

AB  - The area devoted to vineyards in the Mediterranean regions is the largest in the world, with grape production being of immense economic and social importance. After centuries of traditional vineyard management, the continuous decomposition of organic matter has degraded the soil making it difficult to ensure the desired sustainable production of wine. A medium-term field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of conventional tillage and no-tillage with natural vegetation managements on the physicochemical properties and microorganism populations of two vineyard soils in south-western Spain under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. The natural vegetation management improved the soil quality compared to the conventional tillage management by increasing the soil's organic carbon, aggregate stability, water content, and amount and population biodiversity of culturable microorganisms (bacteria, yeasts, and moulds), while reducing the soil's penetration resistance. Although the total amount of soil culturable microorganisms showed seasonal fluctuations related to the weather and the phenological state of the vines, the amount of most microorganisms was mainly affected by the soil management. Only the yeast population was mainly dependent on the phenological vine state, with its amount seeming to be related to the availability of fermentable sugars from ripened grapes, and to the human activity during harvest. These results indicate that soil covered with natural vegetation may be an interesting option for the restoration of degraded vineyard soils such as are frequently found in semi-arid regions.

AB  - Most studies of vegetation in African savannas have adopted reductionist approaches to research, mostly by looking at only onaturalo or oanthropogenico spaces in focal landscapes. Few have considered how social and biophysical factors interact to create vegetation patterns across landscapes. More holistic understanding of pattern-process relationships across savanna landscapes as wholes is needed to manage the ecological connections of global and local change. To understand how process interactions create vegetation patterns in a savanna landscape, I sampled vegetation in 217 sites in southwestern Mali, where conditions are similar to many parts of West Africa. For each site, I collected site-specific data on several biophysical factors as well as histories of settlement or cultivation, based on ethnographic interviews. Hierarchical clustering, indicator species analysis, multiresponse permutation procedures, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed patterns of floristic variation across the landscape that related to patterns of biophysical variation and disturbance history. The results show complexity in terms of both pattern and process. Patterns evident at different scales of organization are not necessarily congruent, and vegetation heterogeneity is greater than expected based on any subset of biophysical or social processes. Soil moisture, bedrock lithology, and disturbance history are particularly important in shaping vegetation characteristics. Complex patterns arise because vegetation shows three different responses to settlement and cultivationturnover, homogenization, and resiliencewith actual outcomes that depend on site-specific biophysical and social conditions. This research shows that research epistemology can shape physical geographic knowledge and that savanna landscapes must be seen as entities with characteristics that are maintained through human-environment interaction.

AB  - Regarding the basic roles of urban ecosystem health assessment (i.e., discovering the comprehensive health status, and diagnosing the limiting factors of urban ecosystems), the general framework integrating comprehensive evaluation and detailed analysis is established, from both bottom-up and top-down directions. Emergy-based health indicators are established to reflect the urban ecosystem health status from a biophysical viewpoint. Considering the intrinsic uncertainty and relativity of urban ecosystem health, set pair analysis is combined with the emergy-based indicators to fill the general framework and evaluate the relative health level of urban ecosystems. These techniques are favorable for understanding the overall urban ecosystem health status and confirming the limiting factors of concerned urban ecosystems from biophysical perspective. Moreover, clustering analysis is applied by combining the health status with spatial geographical conditions. Choosing 26 typical Chinese cities in 2005, relative comprehensive urban ecosystem health levels were evaluated. The higher health levels of Xiamen, Qingdao, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai are in particular contrast to those of Wuhan, Beijing, Yinchuan, and Harbin, which are relatively poor. In addition, the conditions of each factor and related indicators are investigated through set pair analysis, from which the critical limiting factors of Beijing are confirmed. According to clustering analysis results, the urban ecosystems studied are divided into four groups. It is concluded that the proposed framework of urban ecosystem health assessment, which integrates comprehensive evaluation and detailed analysis and is fulfilled by emergy synthesis and set pair analysis, can serve as a useful tool to conduct diagnosis of urban ecosystem health.

AB  - The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is considered an indicator species of ecosystem health because of its longevity, life-history requirements, reliance on sea ice (i.e., sea ice obligate), and position in the Arctic food web. Polar bear distribution and habitat association should both be reliable signals for environmental perturbation, as the bears respond behaviorally to changes in sea ice extent, the timing and duration of ice formation, and ablation. Polar bears and sea ice conditions were monitored as part of the annual fall bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) aerial survey in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea between 1979 and 2005. Habitats associated with polar bear sightings changed during the study, with fewer bears associated with ice (irrespective of ice type and percent) and more bears associated with land and open water. Large-scale differences were documented for both ice type and percent ice cover, particularly in September. In general, the pattern in September (and to a lesser extent in October) included a reduction in old ice and a concomitant increase in open water. In addition, there was an eastward and landward shift in polar bear sightings. From 1979 to 1987, polar bears were observed primarily on ice along the shelf break near Barrow, whereas from 1997 to 2005, polar bears were observed on barrier islands or along the mainland coast near Kaktovik. The changes in polar bear distribution and habitat association appear to reflect a behavioral response by polar bears to changes in ice (type and percent cover) and in the timing of ice formation and ablation.

AB  - Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen has become a serious concern for nature conservation managers and policy makers. It has the potential to reduce species richness, increase the graminoid component of the sward, encourage species typical of more fertile conditions and alter the soil biogeochemistry of grasslands. Calcifugous grasslands (grasslands found on acid soils) are among the most sensitive to N deposition due to their poorly buffered soils and species typical of nutrient poor environments.
   Indicators have an important role to play in detecting the impact of nitrogen deposition on sites of conservation importance and assessing conservation status. This study investigates potential indicators of nitrogen deposition impacts that could be incorporated into site condition monitoring programmes such as the UK Common Standards Monitoring.
   Using two national surveys of calcifugous grasslands we examined the potential for using: the presence or absence of indicator species, the cover of indicator species, the species richness and richness of functional groups, and the cover of functional groups as indicators of N deposition impacts. Of all the potential indicators investigated, graminoid:forb ratio was found to be the best indicator of N deposition impacts. It showed a significant relationship to N deposition in both data sets and is quick and easy to assess in the field. Vegetation indicators must be used with caution as there is potential for vegetation management regime and nutrients from other sources to cause similar changes in species composition. Consideration must be given to these before attributing changes to nitrogen deposition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The vegetation of 107 study plots has been described twice, first in the 1960s and 1970s and then again in 1998 and 2003-2005, on the basis of phytosociological releves produced using the Braun-Blanquet method. In addition, soil studies were carried out in 2005 on the basis of soil-core sampling for chemical analysis. The research took in all of the natural types of forest wetlands to be met with in the study area. Phytosociological releves in the two repeat sets were obtained in line with the Braun-Blanquet method, while successional changes were analysed using DCA, on the basis of weighted average values for the species indicator values, analyses of the layer cover of phytocoenoses, number of species, and frequencies and cover of herb-layer vegetation. The analysis of vegetation in the two research periods shows that wetland habitat in the Bialowieza forest has been subject to successional processes conditioned by changes in the environment, i.e. desiccation through a lowering of the water table, and climatic changes inter alia entailing an increase in air temperature at the same time as amounts of precipitation have been falling. The reduced humidity of soils is leading to an accelerated process of peat decay, and hence to increased fertility and acidity of the soils. Changes in habitat conditions are bringing about major changes in both the floristic composition of the herb layer and the structure of the phytocoenoses in marshland and riparian forest habitats.

AB  - The size of cheilostome bryozoan zooids has been widely discussed for its potential in inferring palaeotemperatures, based on correlations between zooid size and temperature. Studies in both the natural environment and under experimental laboratory conditions have shown that an increase in temperature significantly decreases zooid size in a range of bryozoan taxa. In order to test the effect of temperature on zooid size, the cheilostome bryozoan Cryptosula pallasiana was for the first time successfully cultured under laboratory conditions. C pallasiana was grown at 14 degrees C and 18 degrees C using Rhodomonas sp. as a food organism. Zooid size, tentacle number and growth rate were measured over a period of 26 days. For comparison, zooids from colonies of C. pallasiana collected from the natural environment were measured in winter and summer months. Results showed that colonies grown in laboratory culture had significantly longer and wider zooids at 14 degrees C than at 18 degrees C. The specific growth rate of C. pallasiana doubled from 14 degrees C to 18 degrees C. Comparison of tentacle number in culture showed a significantly higher value at lower temperatures. This may be related to differing food availability, longer polypide life spans, or a shift of energy use at colder temperatures. In nature the zooids were significantly longer in colonies sampled in July than in January, a clear difference from laboratory results. The utility of cheilostome Bryozoa as indicators of environmental change and their potential for studies of paleotemperature are highlighted. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experimental modal analysis (EMA) has been explored as a technology for condition assessment and damage identification of constructed structures. However, successful EMA application's such as damage detection to constructed systems pose certain difficulties. The properties of constructed systems are influenced by temperature changes as well as other natural influences such as movements in addition to any deterioration and damage. Writers were challenged in their attempts to measure the dynamic properties of an aged bridge by EMA due to inconsistencies within the data set due to short-term variations in ambient conditions. A complex interaction was observed between the dynamic properties of the bridge, hour-to-hour changes in temperature, and controlled damages applied to the bridge. Inconsistencies in the data set made curve fitting difficult for some common parameter estimation algorithms that have been designed to handle consistent data sets. Although the quality of measurements within the entire data set was affected by time variance and nonlinearity, increasing the number of reference measurements significantly improved the reliability of the information which could be extracted. In conjunction with the multiple-input multiple-output technique, a parameter estimation method using complex mode indicator function (CMIF) was developed and implemented in this study to determine the modal properties with proper scaling to obtain modal flexibility. This method proved to be very successful among many others with the data acquired from the aged and deteriorated highway bridge. In this paper, challenges in reliable identification of modal parameters from large structures are reviewed and the new CMIF based algorithm is documented. The method is evaluated on actual bridge data sets from a damage detection research study.

AB  - A short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide (sc-FOS) was tested in a simulator of the human gut microbial ecosystem (SHIME) in vitro model to quantify its prebiotic effects according to Prebiotic Index (PI) and Measure of prebiotic effect (MPE) equations. Fossence (TM), (sc-FOS, 0.5%) was fermented in a simulated human proximal colonic condition, using a fecal inoculum from a healthy individual. We analysed the pH reduction, substrate utilization, lactate and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and microbial community modulation. Microbial fermentation of sc-FOS strongly reduced the media pH indicating the production of lactate and SCFA with accumulation of lactate and enhanced levels of acetate (34.38 +/- 0.38 mM), propionate (20.93 +/- 0.56 mM) and butyrate (4.93 +/- 0.03 mM) compared to 18.46 +/- 0.20 mM, 6.24 +/- 0.10 mM and 3.3 +/- 0.06 mM in the blank, respectively. Total SCFA production in test media was 61.91 +/- 0.87 mM compared to 33.65 +/- 0.36 mM in blank and the contribution of free-sugars present in sc-FOS to SCFAs was negligible. Modulation of the microbial community was analysed through 16S rRNA sequencing and we found that sc-FOS greatly stimulated the beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus. We report the PI and MPE values for Fossence (TM), as 14.9 and 0.01 respectively at the end of 24 h, which is an indicator of a strong prebiotic effect.

AB  - Global warming is causing shifts in distribution of plants, leading to alterations in the native flora. In addition, increased intensity and frequency of wildfires is posing threats to Himalayan ecosystems. Modeling a species' ecological niche and its potential distribution under projected impacts of climate change and distribution of wildfires provides an understanding of the behavior of native flora in altered climatic conditions. In this study, we predicted future distribution of four endemic tree species Pinus roxburghii, Quercus semecarpifolia, Rhododendron arboretum, and Cedrus deodara in western Himalaya under A1B scenario of Special Report on Emission Scenarios for 2030, 2050, and 2080, under two conditions: (i) without wildfire and (ii) with wildfire. We included wildfire occurrence as a predictor variable in the Maxent model along with 35 climate variables, to predict the future distribution of four indicator species. As per the predictions, there will be a significant reduction in the geographic distribution of the indicator species under the with wildfire' scenario as compared to the without wildfire' scenario. The future distribution range was shifted towards the northern and north-eastern regions of our study area owing to higher moisture availability. We predicted reduction in the range of C. deodara during 2030, R. arboreum during 2050, and P. roxburghii during 2080, while the distribution of Q. semecarpifolia remained unchanged. Our modeling predicted that climate change could induce reduction, expansion, and shift in the distributions of endemic plant species, which could lead to alteration in the endemic flora of the Himalayas.

AB  - Crabs play important roles in coastal ecosystems and are useful indicators for evaluating ecosystem health. Many previous studies have examined the distribution patterns of crabs among different habitats. However, we know little about what the key factors determining crab burrow distribution among types of habitats. Different kind of crab species may have different preferences of environmental conditions, here, we focus on the dominant crab species Hate tientsinensis in the Yellow River Delta. To identify the drivers of crab burrow distribution in intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta, we examined crab burrow density among seven habitats across different marsh zones, with reference to abiotic (water depth, soil hardness, water content, bulk density, porewater salinity, organic matter, total nitrogen and total carbon) and biotic (plant coverage, above- and belowground biomass, macrofauna species richness, abundance and biomass) factors that might explain crab burrow distribution patterns. Differences of all above factors were examined by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) among different habitats. The best single predictors of crab burrow density were tested by liner re- gression across the entire study area. Our results showed that patterns of crab burrow distribution were more strongly affected by abiotic drivers (water depth, water content, salinity, soil hardness, organic matter and total carbon) than biotic drivers. Crabs prefer habitats with softer and wetter edaphic conditions. In the future of coastal management, building habitats first, thereafter attracting crabs settling down and regulating feeding area of water birds and other benthic communities are good strategies to follow.

AB  - The oral microbiome has been linked to a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, including obesity, diabetes, periodontitis, and cancers of the stomach and liver. These conditions disproportionately affect Mexican American women, yet few studies have examined the oral microbiota in this at-risk group. We characterized the 16S rDNA oral microbiome in 369 non-smoking women enrolled in the MD Anderson Mano a Mano Mexican American Cohort Study. Lower bacterial diversity, a potential indicator of oral health, was associated with increased age and length of US residency among recent immigrants. Grouping women by overarching bacterial community type (e.g., "Streptococcus," "Fusobacterium," and "Prevotella" clusters), we observed differences across a number of acculturation-related variables, including nativity, age at immigration, time in the US, country of longest residence, and a multi-dimensional acculturation scale. Participants in the cluster typified by higher abundance of Streptococcus spp. exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity and appeared the most acculturated as compared to women in the "Prevotella" group. Computationally-predicted functional analysis suggested the Streptococcus-dominated bacterial community had greater potential for carbohydrate metabolism while biosynthesis of essential amino acids and nitrogen metabolism prevailed among the Prevotella-high group. Findings suggest immigration and adaption to life in the US, a well-established mediator of disease risk, is associated with differences in oral microbial profiles in Mexican American women. These results warrant further investigation into the joint and modifying effects of acculturation and oral bacteria on the health of Mexican American women and other immigrant populations. The oral microbiome presents an easily accessible biomarker of disease risk, spanning biological, behavioral, and environmental factors.

AB  - Barrientos Island is a small islet in the South Shetland archipelago frequently visited by Antarctic tourists. Collembola were recently used in another study developed in this site to assess the environmental conditions of two paths used by visitors, showing the importance of this soil faunal community. This motivated the realization of the first comprehensive census of Collembola from Barrientos Island. Fifty-six samples were recorded over three seasons, 2011-2013, from eight different substrate types. During the last campaign, 39 soil samples were also taken to analyze different physical, chemical, biological, microbiological, and biochemical variables in order to put into relation all these environmental conditions with abundance and richness of Collembola species. A total of ten species were recorded, all of them previously cited from Antarctica. The native species Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus Willem (Collembola: Isotomidae) is the most abundant in the island. Two cosmopolitan species-Hypogastrura viatica (Tullberg) (Hypogastruridae) and Mesaphorura macrochaeta Rusek (Tullbergiidae)-were also identified. Many of the species on this island can be considered as eurytopic, appearing in most of the analyzed substrate types. Collembola distribution was found to be influenced by elevation and, to a lesser extent, by phosphorous content and slope. Other variables that are usually cited in the specialized literature did not significantly influence the Collembola distribution in this island. Our results show that the distribution and abundance of Collembola in Antarctic locations is not directly dependent on a single factor. The environmental characteristics of each studied site will determine what factors are driving the composition and structure of this soil community.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) of rice paddy fields is very important because of the increasing demand for crop production and increasing scarcity of water for irrigation. The seasonal dynamics of WUE and their environmental controls were determined in a rice paddy field in Liaohe Delta, Northeast China, based on 2-year period (2013-2014) eddy-covariance flux and meteorological measurements. The annual and growing-season ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE) of the paddy field were 1.00 g C kg(-1) H2O and 1.35 g C kg(-1) H2O (two-year average), respectively. The seasonal variation of eWUE showed an asymmetric single-peak curve. The leaf area index (LAI) was the dominant regulator of evapotranspiration-based WUE; however, the VPD was the most important controlling factor of transpiration-based WUE. The significant positive control of LAI on evapotranspiration-based WUE was likely caused by its strong regulation of the ratio of transpiration (TR) to evapotranspiration (ET). The residual WUE (calculated from the WUE subtracted from the modeled WUE using the relationship between the WUE and LAI) was negatively correlated with net radiation (Rn). The WUE was generally higher under cloudy conditions than under clear conditions. Based on a comparison of the four WUE indicators, the separation of ET to TR and soil evaporation (ES), as well as the incorporation of the nonlinear effect of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on WUE, would both greatly improve the performances of WUE indicators in rice paddy fields.

AB  - We compared results derived using three different approaches to assess the suitability of common tree species on the Franconian Plateau in southern Germany under projected warmer and drier climate conditions in the period 2061-2080. The study area is currently a relatively warm and dry region of Germany. We calculated species distribution models (SDMs) using information on species' climate envelopes to predict regional species spectra under 63 different climate change scenarios. We complemented this with fine-scale ecological niche analysis using data from 51 vegetation surveys in seven forest reserves in the study area, and tree-ring analysis (TRA) from local populations of five tree species to quantify their sensitivity to climatic extreme years. The SDMs showed that predicted future climate change in the region remains within the climate envelope of certain species (e.g. Quercus petraea), whilst for e.g. Fagus sylvatica, future climate conditions in one third of the scenarios are too warm and dry. This was confirmed by the TRA: sensitivity to drought periods is lower for Q. petraea than for F sylvatica. The niche analysis shows that the local ecological niches of Quercus robur and Fraxinus excelsior are mainly characterized by soils providing favorable water supply than by climate, and Finns sylvestris (planted) is strongly influenced by light availability. The best adapted species for a warmer and potentially drier climate in the study region are Acer campestre, Sorbus torminalis, S. aria, Ulmus minor, and Tilia platyphyllos, which should therefore play a more prominent role in future climate-resilient mixed forest ecosystems.

AB  - Invasion by non-native conifers may pose a threat to local biodiversity, but knowledge about introduced conifer effects on Northern Hemisphere ecosystems is scarce. The coastal heathlands of north-west Europe are threatened by invasion of native and introduced tree species. We assess how spread of the introduced conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) into European coastal heathlands affect two major functional groups; vascular plants and bryophytes, and how these effects relate to the environmental changes imposed by the developing tree canopies. We compared the impact of introduced Sitka spruce and native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) by analysing effects on species richness and turnover of vascular plants and bryophytes along fine-scale transects from individual tree stems into open heathland vegetation. Environmental impacts were assessed by measured environmental variables, and the responses of the two species groups were assessed by calculating changes in their respective mean Ellenberg indicator values. Species richness decreased beneath both conifers, related to decreased light and increased nitrogen and pH. Whereas vascular plants responded negatively to poor light conditions beneath dense and low Sitka spruce canopies, bryophytes were more negatively affected by the warmer and drier microclimates beneath Scots pine. Introduced Sitka spruce impacts the sub-canopy environment differently from the native Scots pine, and the two functional plant groups responded differently to these impacts. This suggests that future forests are likely to differ in species richness and composition, depending on whether succession is based on native or introduced coniferous trees.

AB  - Biogeographic transition zones in marine temperate systems are often hotspots of biodiversity, with high levels of resilience to short-term climate shifts due to naturally occurring cyclic oscillations of oceanographic conditions. However, these environments are likely vulnerable to a steady global warming scenario in which these cyclical conditions could be disrupted. Here, we evaluate how changes in local oceanography affect the structure of rocky reef fish assemblages over a period of 50 yr in a biogeographic transition zone. Using a 12 yr time series of rocky reef fish assemblage structure, we identified the set of oceanographic variables that most influenced assemblage dynamics. Descriptive and predictive models (multivariate regression trees) were compared to observed data using the area under the curve. Winter northward wind stress and sea surface temperature (SST) were the most important drivers of change in assemblage structure. Only warmer years had indicator species with warm-temperate or tropical affinities. A fish assemblage 'tropicalization' index was developed in response to both local-spatial resolution and short-term environmental variation (1993-2011), and to regional spatial resolution and long-term SST (1960-2012). Predictive modelling for the last 50 yr revealed that species with tropical affinities have increased in frequency compared to cold-temperate species, coinciding with the trend of increasing mean winter SST. Since the mid-1980s, warm-temperate and tropical species have responded rapidly to more frequent warm winters, suggesting that species distributions are shifting polewards. Our results support a hypothesis that cold species retreat more slowly than the advance of warm species. We discuss the importance of transition zones as ` barometers' of climate change.

AB  - Exploring resource utilization strategies for different types of cities is essential for achieving the sustainable development of cities. Urban metabolism is a systems-oriented approach to understanding the interrelationship between urban socioeconomic status and natural environment through resource utilization. Recognition and identification of urban metabolic types could help in formulating targeted urban resource utilization strategies. However, few studies have investigated the classification of urban metabolism. Therefore, this study combines material flow analysis with the classification and regression tree model to present a classification approach for urban metabolism that considers cities' socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic conditions and resource consumption. This approach was tested in Chinese prefecture-level cities. The results showed that gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, population, population density, and climate types were significantly correlated with cities' resource consumption indicators. GDP per capita and climate types were the most important threshold variables for classifying urban resource consumption levels. GDP per capita was the optimal split node for electricity, total energy, water, industrial minerals and metals, and total outputs, while climate types was the optimal split node for biomass, fossil fuels, and construction materials. The level of urban resource consumption in temperate climates was higher than in other climate types. Eight types of urban metabolism were identified in China that were closely related to urban socioeconomic conditions, scale grade, resource endowment, industrial level, and energy structure. The findings of this study provide a reference for determining the problem of urban critical resource consumption and formulating appropriate urban resource utilization strategies.

AB  - Changes in the global climate system are creating increasingly non-analogue climate conditions with expectations of non-stationarity among climate drivers. Decoupling among climate drivers complicates the assessment of ecological response to the changing climate as characteristics that could be once treated as a suite of conditions now need to be treated as potentially independent with possible synergistic effects.
   Ecologists commonly use ordination techniques (often principal component analysis; PCA) on large climate and environmental datasets to reduce a range of variables to a few axes that are uncorrelated with each other and often explain large proportion of the variation in the original data. However, non-stationarity, with correlations among variables changing over time, can affect this approach. Here, we use a 37-year climate dataset from the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site (Colorado, USA) to present the use of both moving window principal component analysis and moving window correlation analysis to determine non-stationarity in climate data.
   Relationships among climate variables and between input variables and PCA axes changed over time; this obscured interpretation of relationships between PCA axes and an ecological response (plant biomass), suggesting that one-time PCA for environmental variables may lead to inappropriate inferences.
   Synthesis. Care must be taken in analysing climate-ecological relationships when predictor variables exhibit non-stationarity. We present a conceptual decision-making tree to help ecologists consider when to use PCA and extract axis scores or use alternative approaches for incorporating non-stationarity into subsequent analysis, including testing variables individually to aid in interpretation, break point analyses and averaging PC scores.

AB  - Indicator species provide an easy and quick method of evaluating ecosystems. The species comprising the most useful indicators of wetlands should be distributed across a range of water depths and inundation durations, while each species is representative of a specific condition. Hydrophytic vegetation is commonly used to determine the existence and type of wetland; however, such indicator systems often depend on assigning species qualitatively to discrete categories based on assumptions about their distribution along a gradient of conditions. The current study proposes a wetland indicator system based on the quantitative responses of individual vegetation species to a gradient of water depths and periods of inundation. A long-term database was utilized to determine species responses to hydrological alterations in a series of wetlands. The hydrophytic plant species investigated (n = 29) displayed relatively narrow ranges of mean hydrologic values and were distributed linearly along multiple hydrologic gradients (hydroperiod, average water depth, and maximum water depth) ranging from Amphicarpum muhlenbergianum which was observed at the shallowest water depths and shortest hydroperiod to Pontederia cordata and Ludwigia repens which were characteristic of wetlands with the deepest water and longest hydroperiod. The species distribution and means along the hydrologic gradients tested indicates they are prime candidates for inclusion in a quantitative or continuum indicator system. The historical database utilized for this study provided valuable information for numerous species common to the Tampa Bay region for which little or no ecological information was previously available. The methodology utilized in this paper provides a cost and time effective method for obtaining the vast amounts of information required to refine plant indicator systems using a large number of species.

AB  - Agriculture is a primary source of income in several countries, including Argentina. Among the many agrochemicals used, glyphosate-based herbicides raised controversy, encouraging research to clarify if the benefits of their use outweigh their alleged harmfulness. In this spirit, this study assessed soil quality indicators on glyphosate-sprayed fields under natural (NC) and zero tillage conditions (ZT) in Northwest Argentina, to analyze the effect of the herbicide application on soil degradation. The ZT soils underwent five years of continuous spraying (2-4 times a year) after land clearing, while the NC soil, without any laboring practices, was subjected to two consecutive applications. Among the measured indicators (physical, chemical, and biological), water-stable aggregates (WSA), particulate organic matter (POM) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) showed quality differences between ZT and NC samples. The highest values were found in NC (WSA 72%; POM 4.9%; DHA 1460 mg TPF/g(soil)/d) and the lowest in ZT (WSA 13%; POM 1.69%; DHA 180 mg TPF/g(soil)/d); showing a lower quality in ZT regarding structure stability, nutrient availability and microbial activity. A Discriminant Analysis revealed that as glyphosate application increased, the overall soil quality decreased within the NC samples, resembling that of ZT. Thus, soil health deterioration was attributed solely to glyphosate spraying in NC. Furthermore, multivariate analysis allowed identification of chemical indicators as of higher sensitivity to the short-term response after application, and biological indicators as more sensitive to long-term changes. The quality decline in time in the NC soil, caused by the use of glyphosate-based herbicides, could endanger the soils sustainability.

AB  - The karst region in southwestern China, one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world, is special for its high landscape heterogeneity, unique hydrology, high endemism among vegetation species and high intensity of human disturbance. The region had experienced severe degradation through karst rocky desertification (KRD) between the 1950s and 1990s. Starting in the late 1990s, various levels of the Chinese government conducted several ecological projects to recover degraded karst ecosystems. It was reported that the implementation of these projects had been successful in facilitating the recovery of karst vegetation in many areas. However, global climate changes may compromise the efficacy of recovery. Geospatial techniques had been employed to map and monitor karst ecosystem conditions during the recovery process. We examined the history and progress of the various geospatial techniques applied to monitor and evaluate karst vegetation conditions. In addition, we reviewed the techniques used to assess and monitor KRD, KRD influencing factors, vegetation community type, fractional vegetation cover, vegetation dynamics, vegetation productivity, ecosystem goods and services, vegetation biodiversity, ecosystem health and rural society changes. We also explored the potential to apply geospatial techniques for karst vegetation recovery in the future. It is projected that there will be more remotely sensed images for the vegetation dynamics monitoring at numerous scales. New techniques (e.g. image fusion and data assimilation) will be available to manage scale and heterogeneity issues in the karst landscape.

AB  - Management decisions aimed at protecting aquatic resources following accidental chemical spills into rivers and coastal estuaries require estimates of toxic thresholds derived from realistic spill conditions: acute pulse exposures of short duration (h), information which often is unavailable. Most existing toxicity data (median lethal concentration or median effective concentration) come from tests performed under constant exposure concentrations and exposure durations in the 24-h to 96-h range, conditions not typical of most chemical spills. Short-exposure hazard concentration estimates were derived for selected chemicals using empirical toxicity data. Chemical-specific 5th percentile hazard concentrations (HC5) of species sensitivity distributions (SSD) from individual exposure durations (6-96h) were derived via bootstrap resampling and were plotted against their original exposure durations to estimate HC5s and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at shorter exposures (1, 2, and 4h). This approach allowed the development of short-exposure HC5s for 12 chemicals. Model verification showed agreement between observed and estimated short-exposure HC5s (r(2) adjusted=0.95, p<0.0001), and comparison of estimated short-exposure HC5s with empirical toxicity data indicated generally conservative hazard estimates. This approach, applied to 2 real spill incidents, indicated hazard estimates above expected environmental concentrations (acrylonitrile), and suggested that environmental concentrations likely exceeded short-exposure hazard estimates (furfural). Although estimates generated through this approach were likely overprotective, these were derived from environmentally realistic exposure durations, providing risk-assessors with a tool to manage field decisions.

AB  - Contaminant uptake by algae, and its subsequent toxicity, has important ramifications for aquatic biomonitoring and environmental risk assessment. To study the effects of cadmium on diatom mats, a series of experiments was undertaken. These investigated the sensitivity of Navicula pelliculosa mats to cadmium, uptake of cadmium across a range of exposure concentrations, influence of mat biomass and thickness on uptake, and cadmium uptake by mats over time. Diatom mat formation proved to be sensitive to cadmium exposure, with a 96-h EC50 of 31 mu g/L. The rapid uptake of cadmium over 15 min was a linear function of exposure concentration and was not significantly affected by mat thickness. Cadmium uptake over time was also a linear function of exposure concentration for time periods up to 5 h. Linear uptake was likely due to the availability of algal binding sites as cadmium ions diffused through the diatom mats. Internal high-pH microenvironments may also have influenced uptake, through cadmium precipitation or enhanced adsorption within the mats. The lack of a significant relationship between mat biomass and uptake could be explained by the static water exposure conditions. Other studies have shown that cadmium uptake by algal mats was only significantly affected by biomass under flowing water conditions. Flowing water appeared to facilitate the diffusion of cadmium ions through the algal mats. Our research demonstrates the propensity of diatom mats to adsorb cadmium to achieve concentrations that could inhibit macroinvertebrate grazing. Overall, these findings contribute to a greater understanding of cadmium bioavailability in aquatic ecosystems and to the further development of benthic algae as an effective biomonitoring tool.

AB  - This paper examines disposal of metals and the origin, characteristics, and distribution of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in a Mediterranean karstic estuary in the north-eastern Adriatic. This environment offers a real-time, small model system for studies of geochemical processes in microtidal Mediterranean estuaries that are infilling with sediments and classified as river-dominated disequilibrium estuaries. The results have shown that the longitudinal distribution of heavy metals in sediments follows the sedimentation dynamics and deposition pattern of river-borne, clay mineral particles. The highest concentration of metals was found in the restricted upper part of the estuary, characterized by rapid deposition of clay particles and terrestrial sedimentary organic matter, and decreases toward the open sea. The vertical distribution of metals in sediment cores depends on the prevailing pH and Eh conditions. Significant increases of the concentrations of metals in the uppermost strata are the result of recent anthropogenic inputs. The share of the terrestrial component in SOM, estimated by N/C-org atomic ratios and delta C-13 values, decreases with distance from the river mouth. The small vertical variation in delta C-13 values of SOM indicates that a fast sedimentation rate overrides the diagenetically determined decomposition. The results obtained indicate that river-borne inorganic particles, natural terrigenous organic material, and anthropogenic metal loads are trapped in sediments of the estuarine system. Under the prevailing conditions, there is negligible transport towards the open sea. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The science of animal welfare is key to improving the life quality of billions of chickens, by supporting decisions through the assessment of environmental and animal-based indicators in different conditions. Our goal was to assess the variation of bird welfare within the same barn and whether this variation depends on barn type or season. We described and compared the in-barn heterogeneity of broiler chicken welfare in four closed-sided (CS) and 13 open-sided (OS) industrial poultry houses, during two different seasons (summer/autumn and winter). The measures were divided into two categories: 1) environmental indicators: relative humidity, temperature, air velocity, ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and illuminance; 2) animal-based indicators: contact dermatitis on the breast and abdominal areas, bird soiling, footpad dermatitis, hock burn, and lameness. The results of assessments in 30 equidistant locations, covering the whole inside area of each barn, were organized into kriging maps. Linear regression and generalized models were fitted, considering predictor variables and the interaction effect between them; the Tukey test was used for the multiple comparisons of means. We used geostatistical modelling for continuous and discrete data for environmental and animal-based measurements, respectively. In-barn heterogeneity was observed for the prevalence of environmental and animal-based problems. There was a pattern for the spatial distribution, heading from the house centre to the West end of both house types, with worse results for three environmental indicators (higher temperature, and NH3 and CO2 concentrations) and three animal-based indicators (higher prevalence of hock burn, bird soiling and footpad dermatitis). In CS, illuminance was very restrictive (4.4 to 6.7 lx) when compared to OS houses (119.8 to 145.3 lx); in both house types the prevalence of lameness was high (50.9 to 78.0%), even though both illuminance and lameness prevalence were evenly distributed inside all houses. The kriging maps allowed for the identification of worse welfare problems in the West direction, which in CS means near exhaust fans and in OS houses the direction of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation by fans. Our results show that attention is needed for the variation of bird welfare conditions inside each barn, and allow for the adoption of strategies to spread best conditions throughout the internal barn area in both house designs. Principally, the original findings on in-barn bird welfare heterogeneity suggest the relevance of constant bird welfare monitoring in key locations within the barns, minimally for the indicators with known different in-barn spatial distributions.

AB  - The changes in precipitation and temperature regimes brought on by the current climate change have influenced ecosystems globally. The consequences of climate change on plant phenology have been widely investigated during the last few years. However, the underlying causes of the timing of autumn phenology have not been fully clarified yet. Here, we focused on the onset (10%) of leaf colouring-LCO-(Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie (BBCH) 92) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica, L.) as an important native tree species growing throughout Europe. Studied beech stands are located along the natural distribution range of the European beech in Western Carpathians (Slovakia) at different altitudes from lowlands (300 m a.s.l.) to uplands (1050 m a.s.l.) and climatic regions from warm to cold. To define limiting climate conditions for LCO, we established several bioclimatic indices as indicators of meteorological drought: climatic water balance (CWB), standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), dry period index (DPI), and heat waves (HW). In addition, meteorological variables such as monthly mean temperatures and precipitation totals were taken into account. Throughout the 23-year period (1996-2018) of ground-based phenological observations of temperate beech forests, the timing of LCO was significantly delayed (p <= 0.05) in the middle to high altitudes, while in the lowest altitude, it remained unchanged. Over the last decade, 2009-2018, LCO in middle altitudes started at comparable to low altitudes and, at several years, even later. This resulted mainly from the significant negative effect of drought prior to this phenological phase (p <= 0.01) expressed through a 1-month SPI in September (SPIIX) at the stand at the low-altitude and warm-climatic region. Our results indicate that the meteorological drought conditioned by lower total precipitation and higher evapotranspirative demands in the warmer climate advance leaf senescence. However, at present time, growth in rising temperature and precipitation is acceptable for most beech stands at middle to high altitudes. Beech utilizes these conditions and postpones the LCO by 0.3-0.5 and 0.6-1.2 day per year at high and middle altitudes, respectively. Although we show the commencing negative effect of drought at mid-altitudes with lower (below 700 mm) total annual precipitation, the trend of LCO in favourable warm climates is still significantly delayed. The ongoing warming trend of summer months suggests further intensification of drought as has started to occur in middle altitudes, spreading from the continual increase of evapotranspiration over the next decades.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the article is to provide a theoretical and methodological justification of the completeness, accessibility and transparency of indicators of environmental and economic reporting of forestry enterprises as an indicator of the state of forestry land use in the context of sustainable development (on the example of Male Polissya of Ukraine); to find out the causal relationships between individual indicators that characterize the course of certain processes in forestry.
   Methodology / approach. Theoretical and methodological bases of the research are based on the analysis of a set of ecological and economic indicators of reporting of forestry enterprises as indicators of the state of use of forest lands in the context of balanced development. Such methods were used: dialectical method of cognition for the analysis of laws and regulations and scientific works of scientists on the issue of sustainable use of forest lands; method of analogies (transfer of influences that were found in other areas with similar objects and properties, to the area under consideration); analysis of the most pressing problems of accessibility to the public of indicators of the state of forest land use; correlation analysis - in determining the closeness of the relationship between statistical characteristics indicators of forest use; synthesis and logical generalization of conceptual bases of necessity and preconditions of improvement of ecological and economic indicators; monographic to identify factors for improving indicators; abstract-logical theoretical generalizations and formulation of conclusions. In the study we used quantitative analysis with data from primary and secondary sources to assess the availability of information on the state of forestry land use. In this study, there were analyzed not the values of the indicators, but how they were structured and what information they contained.
   Results. The article summarizes the completeness, accessibility and transparency of the system of indicators of ecological and economic reporting of forestry enterprises on the example of Male Polissya of Ukraine. The work investigates in terms of sustainable land use practices in the field of reporting using data from state and municipal forestry enterprises of Male Polissya of Ukraine, online service ProZvit (freely available database of enterprises since 2016). The studied value of the correlation between the statistical characteristics of individual indicators of forest land use makes it possible to identify the course of certain positive or negative processes in forest land use on the basis of the objectively existing causal relationship between phenomena and indicators. Based on the analysis of the data published on the Internet, some shortcomings of the set of indicators available to the public are highlighted, in particular the need to update them in accordance with the legislation of the European Union. The results of this study indicate the need to rethink the national focus of reporting from a purely economic to environmental and economic.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The structural scheme of public information access to ecological and economic indicators of forest land use is proposed, which will ensure completeness and transparency, openness and accountability to the public of information on environmental consequences of forest land use. We propose to introduce additional environmental reporting indicators, which can be further used as indicators of the balance of forestry land use in the country, in particular: the accumulation of carbon in forests and changes in such accumulation; degree of soil erosion; humus content; indicators of productivity (quality) of forest lands depending on soil conditions in different areas of Ukraine; indicators of the state of populations of species of fauna and flora to be protected and preserved; diversity of types of natural resources used by the population in the territory of the planned activity and in the zone of its influence; diversity of ecosystem services; in addition to absolute data, apply relative indicators per 1 ha of forest land. We propose to include these indicators in the reporting for the following blocks: the impact on land and soil; impact on fauna, flora, biodiversity; impact on surface waters; impact on landscapes; impact on atmospheric air; carbon accumulation; volumes of reforestation, silvicultural works.
   Practical value / implications. On the example of forestry enterprises located in the territory of Male Polissya, it is proved that the set of economic and environmental reporting indicators available online is an indicator of the state of use of forestry lands. Based on research, the bases for improvement of the information base of the reporting are prepared at different scales, both in the country and in each forest enterprise in a particular region, as regional sectoral improvements will help achieve balanced land use at the national level.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) seek to conserve valuable genes, species and ecosystems by applying a legal regime that restricts some socioeconomic activities and also offers opportunities for new ones. As a result, PAs have been claimed by some authors to boost socioeconomic conditions in rural areas mainly through tourism activities. However, others have claimed that PAs contribute to rural depopulation through the worsening of living conditions of local residents because of restrictions resulting from protection regulations. Here, we applied a multiple-paired BeforeAfter-Control-Impact (BACI) research design on a census on protected rural municipalities (cases; N = 52) versus unprotected rural municipalities (controls; N = 55) in Spain to ascertain whether PAs had positive or negative effects on rural populations using three indicators on depopulation with official municipal data from 1996 until 2019: Compound annual growth rate (CAGR); Proportion of reproductive individuals (REP); and Proportion of reproductive females (WREP). We controlled for some confounders such as biophysical characteristics and regional regulations by carefully selecting our sample of municipalities spatially. Our results show that depopulation figures were worse in cases than in controls, with some exceptions whose characteristics should be further explored. Municipalities in Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) perfomied best against rural depopulation and generally better than their controls, whereas municipalities in Biosphere Reserves and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) showed mostly worse figures. Our findings suggest that while necessary and important for biocliversily, multiple-use PAs generally entailed negative consequences for Spanish rural populations that need Lo be offset by Siale's intervention.

AB  - The development of smart packaging and innovation in common food packaging technology will greatly help to meet market needs, including consumer preference for "safe" foods, high-quality products and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of food packaging. In addition, consumers' tendency to use natural ingredients such as pigments and biopolymers has provided the basis for their application in the food industry, including smart food packaging. Hence, smart packaging in addition to protecting food products against environmental damage can also reveal a sign (colorimetric, chemical, electric, etc.) in real time in response to any changes in the packaging conditions and food quality. This comprehensive review emphasizes on the gas/temperature-sensitive smart films based on natural colorants and their key applications in the food packaging systems. Technological considerations associated with the natural colorant-responsive films, smart packaging, biopolymers, and importance of natural colorants versus synthetic dyes are investigated. In practice, the most common designed colorimetric indicators for monitoring gas and temperature changes and application of relevant smart films in real food models have also been discussed. Gas and time-temperature indicators provide a rapid, reliable, and online assessment and a visual indication of the food product quality level, usually through a color change, which is directly related to gas and temperature conditions during distribution and storage of relevant food products. However, future studies need to consider main points such as cost, consumers' acceptance, and confidence, regulatory aspects (i.e., labeling) and multifunctionality of smart packaging to be commercially sustainable.

AB  - The cationic surfactant diethyldialkylester dimethyl ammonium chloride (DEEDMAC) is an active ingredient in liquid fabric softeners and, as such, is disposed of down the drain after consumer use. A monitoring program was conducted across the continental United States to measure the concentration of DEEDMAC in the effluent and sludge from 41 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The concentration in the effluent ranged from 32.4 to 2660 ng/L, with a mean and standard deviation of 232 +/- 450 ng/L. The concentration in the sludge ranged from 0.707 to 314 mg/kg dw, with a mean and standard deviation of 292 +/- 50 mg/kg dw. The distribution of measured effluent concentrations was combined with a distribution of mixing zone dilutions factors to predict the distribution of DEEDMAC concentrations in mixing zones and sediments under mean flow and 10-year, 7 consecutive day lowest flow (7Q10 low flow) conditions. Additionally, the distribution of measured sludge concentrations was combined with a distribution of land applied sludge volumes and US tilling practices to obtain a predicted distribution of DEEDMAC concentrations in sludge amended soils. The 90th percentile concentrations of DEEDMAC in mixing zones and sediments under mean flow conditions was 10.3 ng/L and 451 ng/kg, respectively. The 90th percentile concentration in sludge amended soils was 1.92 mg/kg. These predicted exposure concentrations were compared to published eco-toxicity data and showed that DEEDMAC has a wide margin of safety and poses negligible ecologic risk to aquatic, sediment, or terrestrial compartments.

AB  - Within the framework of European Union chemical legislations an extensive data set on the chronic toxicity of sediment nickel has been generated. In the initial phase of testing, tests were conducted with 8 taxa of benthic invertebrates in 2 nickel-spiked sediments, including 1 reasonable worst-case sediment with low concentrations of acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and total organic carbon. The following species were tested: amphipods (Hyalella azteca, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus), mayflies (Hexagenia sp.), oligochaetes (Tubifex tubifex, Lumbriculus variegatus), mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea), and midges (Chironomus dilutus, Chironomus riparius). In the second phase, tests were conducted with the most sensitive species in 6 additional spiked sediments, thus generating chronic toxicity data for a total of 8 nickel-spiked sediments. A species sensitivity distribution was elaborated based on 10% effective concentrations yielding a threshold value of 94mg Ni/kg dry weight under reasonable worst-case conditions. Data from all sediments were used to model predictive bioavailability relationships between chronic toxicity thresholds (20% effective concentrations) and AVS and Fe, and these models were used to derive site-specific sediment-quality criteria. Normalization of toxicity values reduced the intersediment variability in toxicity values significantly for the amphipod species Hyalella azteca and G. pseudolimnaeus, but these relationships were less clearly defined for the mayfly Hexagenia sp. Application of the models to prevailing local conditions resulted in threshold values ranging from 126mg to 281mg Ni/kg dry weight, based on the AVS model, and 143mg to 265mg Ni/kg dry weight, based on the Fe model.

AB  - Variation in large-scale climatic conditions can have profound effects on local weather patterns and ecological processes. For example, it is well known that a positive shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the last 2 decades has coincided with warmer, wetter winters over Northern Europe and advances in spring phenology, including both migration and breeding of birds. However, the effect of the NAO is not evident throughout the Northern Hemisphere and the same is true of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which has been linked to survival of northern birds wintering in Africa. Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests that an independent ocean circulation system in the Indian Ocean, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), is partly responsible for driving climate variability in the surrounding landmasses. The IOD had traditionally been viewed as an artefact of the ENSO system, although increasingly evidence is accruing that it is a separate and distinct phenomenon. Here we present some results on the causes of the IOD, how it develops within the Indian Ocean, its relationships with the ENSO, and the consequences for East African climate dynamics and associated impacts on ecosystems, in particular along the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania. In this opinion article we evaluate current research initiatives focused on characterizing the IOD, and examine how effective these will be in determining climate change impacts on East African ecosystems, particularly with respect to avian lifecycles.

AB  - Shrews (Soricomorpha) are among the most numerous small forest dwelling mammals in boreal forests ecosystems. In Norway large areas of sub-Arctic birch (Betula pubescens) forests have gradually been replaced by non-native spruce (Picea abies) plantations during the last century. This conversion has led to changes in forest floor vegetation and soil conditions which negatively influence invertebrates serving as prey for shrews and intermediate hosts for shrew endoparasites (helminths). In this trapping study we assessed if abundance and individual condition of common shrews (Sorex araneus) and prevalence and species richness of associated helminths, responded to spruce plantations in a manner that could indicate community level changes. Shrews colonized plantations in autumn, but never attained abundances comparable to the birch forest types. Shrews in plantations had lower body mass compared to those trapped in the birch forests. We identified 15 helminth species, and detected large differences in prevalence. Only one common helminth had significantly higher prevalence in the birch forest. By analysing prevalence of all species jointly, the highest prevalence was in moist birch forests and lowest in spruce plantations. Species richness estimates were lower in plantations, however not statistically significant. Although prevalence and species richness of helminths in common shrews were affected by tree species conversion, we judge the responses to be too weak and uncertain and the sampling and analysis too laborious to make shrew endoparasites suitable for monitoring purposes. However, monitoring abundance of common shrews is likely an efficient way of detecting changes in the forest floor fauna resulting from modern forestry practices.

AB  - Predatory mites, that are important natural enemies of Tetranychus spider mites, are less hindered by complex webs of the spider mites than are other predatory mites that are natural enemies of other pest herbivores. This can be partly explained by their chaetotaxy, a morphological protection against the webs. However, it has up to now been unclear whether the ability to penetrate complex webs is related to the ability of thread-cutting behavior to reduce the effects of the webs. The two predatory mites Neo-seiulus cucumeris and Typhlodromus vulgaris, that are natural enemies of other pest herbivores, were often entrapped by the sticky silken threads while moving within the complex web produced by the two-spotted spider mites Tetranychus urticae. Once captured, their movements and foraging activities were hindered until their escape from entrapment. In contrast, N. womersleyi and Phytoseiulus persimilis, that are important natural enemies of Tetranychus mites, were significantly less frequently entrapped by the web and for shorter periods. Furthermore, N. womersleyi and P. persimilis cut significantly more silken threads within the web than did N. cucumeris and T. vulgaris. The different behavioral activities exhibited by N. cucumeris and N. womersleyi could not be explained by their rearing conditions (i.e., past experience with complex webs). These results supported the hypothesis and might offer an ecological indicator for distinguishing potential important natural enemies of Tetranychus mites from less useful types.

AB  - Two-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) seedlings were exposed to traffic emissions along roadsides with three different traffic densities and speed limits; highway, street and a quiet local road. The responses of the exposed seedlings as a host plant and those of spruce shoot aphid (Cinara pilicornis Hartig) were studied. The concentrations of soluble N and free amino acids, defence chemicals (total phenolics, monoterpenes) were analysed, and aphid growth and reproduction were studied. Along the highway, street and at the local road control site, the atmospheric concentrations of black carbon (BC) and oxides of N (NO,) were measured for 1 week during the experiment. The BC data indicate deposition of organic particulate compounds along the highway and street. The NO, concentrations along the highway and street showed great diurnal variation, but the average NO, concentrations were relatively low. Thus, no changes in N metabolism or growth of the exposed Norway spruce seedlings were found. Along the street, the concentrations of many individual free amino acids, such as proline, as well as total amino acid concentrations, were lower than at the associated control site. Correspondingly, there was also no increase in spruce shoot aphid mean relative growth rate. The aphid reproduction, however, increased along the highway and is suggested to be due to more conducive microclimatic conditions at the exposure site or lack of natural enemies. No changes in defence chemicals (total phenolics, monoterpenes) in relation to the traffic exposure were found. Instead, the microclimatic conditions (temperature, solar irradiation) seemed to affect the concentration of total phenolics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An improved understanding of the vegetation and microbial diversity across different coastal landscape and it's interlink with ecosystem multifunctionality are vital for sustaining the ecosystem services. In view of this, the present study was carried out in Andaman Island, India creating three representatives transects covering four major ecosystem types by subplot sampling and ecosystem multifunctionality was computed from eleven related soil properties after Z-score transformation. We have estimated the vegetation and soil microbial diversity, examined individual effects of edaphic factors on vegetation and soil microbial diversity, extracellular enzyme activities and also investigated the combined effects on ecosystem multiple functions as matrices by Mantel tests. The results suggested that above ground vegetation diversity (2.4-4.9) exhibited significant effect on soil microbial diversity (1.07-1.47) due to difference in species richness and organic matter addition. In turn microbial diversity played a critical role in enzyme activities and nutrient recycling, both constituted the vital coastal ecosystem functions. Amongst the different ecosystems, highest species richness and microbial diversity was found in littoral forest and moist deciduous forest, respectively whilst agro-ecosystem recorded the lowest values. Soil organic carbon, excluding agriculture, increased downward the topography from moist deciduous forest in the hill top to the mangroves in the coastal lowlands while soil enzymes, total N and microbial biomass C and N followed the trend as in soil organic C. The study also observed large endemism and constraints to diversity in mangrove ecosystem due to specific environmental conditions. Our findings provided empirical evidence that above ground and below ground diversity conditioned by edaphic factors constituted the primary drivers for ecosystem multifunctionality in different coastal ecosystem types.

AB  - Channel reconfiguration is one of the most common and costly stream restoration techniques, though its effectiveness is frequently questioned. Project monitoring often tracks changes in macroinvertebrate communities and other responses for a 5-year period. However, channel reconfiguration is a documented disturbance to stream ecosystems, suggesting that this form of restoration initiates succession over longer time frames than monitoring typically captures. To address the role of succession in stream ecosystem recovery, we developed the Phased Recovery Framework (PRF) which proposes benchmarks represented by predictable habitat structure and community composition based on project age. The PRF was tested across nine stream restoration projects in western Montana, ranging in age from 1 to 18 years, each paired with an established reference system. We tested for differences in channel form, habitat character, and macroinvertebrate community composition. While restoration established desired channel form, most biotic variables had not recovered to reference condition even for the oldest projects. Across all sites, phases of the PRF were poor predictors of response. However, analyzing responses to reconfiguration independently for sites in watersheds with unimpaired water quality versus those experiencing excessive nutrient enrichment (i.e. impaired sites) indicated that biological variables converged on reference conditions at unimpaired sites, but diverged across impaired reaches. These large-scale anthropogenic influences may play a stronger role in recovery than do changes to channel form and need to be incorporated into project design and success criteria. Assessment of the PRF suggests that short-term monitoring is not likely to produce reliable indicators of effectiveness without incorporating locally appropriate change associated with watershed impairment and successional progression.

AB  - Andean highland ecosystems (known as paramos) have a great potential to store water and organic carbon, which fulfill the inherent functions associated to the regulation of carbon and water cycles, characteristics linked to their parent material (volcanic ash). However, paramos are at high risk of degradation associated with land use dynamics that affect organic carbon quality in the surface soil. Changes in vegetation cover, with transition from natural forest to tillage and then pasture, make the soil vulnerable to degradation by compaction, erosion, and carbon dioxide emissions associated with increased anthropogenic activity. Despite this cover change, information on soil carbon dynamics in paramos is scarce, impeding conservation management strategies in these ecosystems. This study evaluates the impact of different soil uses within a transect in the Guerrero paramo estimated from soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in the upper meter and carbon condition (expressed as stratification ratio, SR) in the surface soil. Carbon storage varied from 165.2 to 721.9 t ha(-1) in the upper meter of soil with SR1 ((0-10/10-20cm)) between 0.92 and 2.01 and SR2 ((0-10/20-30cm)) between 0.99 and 2.05. Results of this study highlighted that in the fragile ecosystems than Andean paramos, the geomorphological position in relation to soil uses and management practices conditioned soil carbon availability, affecting pedogenetic processes. SR of SOC associated to anthropogenic intervention activities it does not indicate by itself C sequestration. In future researches it is necessary include additional parameters than net primary productivity and historic vegetation.

AB  - Situated at the interface of Central European and Illyrian vegetation, the mesic forests of southwestern Hungary occupy a special position. Despite their importance in vegetation science and conservation, a comprehensive study of the Illyrian mesic forests of the Villany Mts, the southernmost mountain region in Hungary, has not been provided yet. In this study 60 phytocoenological releves were prepared in the beech, oak-hornbeam, ravine and scree forests of the Villany Mts. To compare the individual associations, we performed a PCoA-ordination, calculated the per plot species number and the per plot protected species number, computed the percentage constancy values of the protected species, identified significant diagnostic species, and prepared the spectra of the coenological preference groups. We used relative ecological indicator values to assess habitat conditions. The PCoA-ordination, the coenological preference group spectra, and to a certain extent the ecological indicator values suggested that the different mesic forests of the Villany Mts show certain similarities. This is probably due to the fact that beech forests and ravine forests are confined to small and atypical stands by the suboptimal environmental conditions. Nonetheless, the number of diagnostic species and the constancy values of protected plants indicated that significant differences do exist between the four associations, the scree forest being the most distinct. We conclude that oak-hornbeam forests and scree forests of the Villany Mts have a regional conservation importance, while the beech and ravine forests are locally important, enhancing the structural, floristical and habitat diversity of the Villany Mts.

AB  - Growing demand of resources increases pressure on ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity. Monetary valuation of ES is frequently seen as a decision-support tool by providing explicit values for unconsidered, non-market goods and services. Here we present global value transfer functions by using a meta-analytic framework for the synthesis of 194 case studies capturing 839 monetary values of ES. For 12 ES the variance of monetary values could be explained with a subset of 93 study-and site-specific variables by utilizing boosted regression trees. This provides the first global quantification of uncertainties and transferability of monetary valuations. Models explain from 18% (water provision) to 44% (food provision) of variance and provide statistically reliable extrapolations for 70% (water provision) to 91% (food provision) of the terrestrial earth surface. Although the application of different valuation methods is a source of uncertainty, we found evidence that assuming homogeneity of ecosystems is a major error in value transfer function models. Food provision is positively correlated with better life domains and variables indicating positive conditions for human well-being. Water provision and recreation service show that weak ownerships affect valuation of other common goods negatively (e.g. non-privately owned forests). Furthermore, we found support for the shifting baseline hypothesis in valuing climate regulation. Ecological conditions and societal vulnerability determine valuation of extreme event prevention. Valuation of habitat services is negatively correlated with indicators characterizing less favorable areas. Our analysis represents a stepping stone to establish a standardized integration of and reporting on uncertainties for reliable and valid benefit transfer as an important component for decision support.

AB  - In fields, the timing of weed emergence flushes is mostly related to the timing and rate of seed germination, which depend on soil temperature and water potential as well as soil tillage and crop sowing date. Base temperature and base water potential for seed germination are parameters required in weed dynamics models to take into account the effects of soil conditions on weed demography. Since these parameters are difficult to measure, our objective was to develop a method for estimating them from easily accessible information.
   Data on base temperature and base water potential for germination were collected from the literature for 28 weed species. Correlations were then searched for between these parameters and (i) the species ecological indicator values of Landolt and Ellenberg for temperature and moisture and (ii) dates of the onset and end of weed emergence based on experts' knowledge.
   Both base temperature and base water potential for germination were partially correlated with the species indicator values found in the literature. These correlations explained however only a small proportion of the variance of base temperature and water potential. In contrast, the base temperature of spring-emerging species was highly correlated with the mean soil temperature at the mean onset date of each species' spring emergence flush. Water potential for germination was higher for species requiring high base temperature. The date of spring emergence onset of a species, which can be easily assessed from experts' knowledge, can thus be used to estimate their base temperature and then their base water potential for germination.

AB  - Deer overabundance reduces forest ground-layer vegetation and can cause cascading impacts on a forest ecosystem. To predict these effects, we must elucidate the relationship between deer density and the status of ground-layer vegetation. This relationship was studied in the Boso Peninsula, where the deer population density exhibits a clear geographical gradient. We examined species richness and cover of ground-layer vegetation at several cedar plantations and hardwood forests in the Boso Peninsula. We also examined whether deer impacts were altered by light condition, soil water content and forest type (cedar and hardwood). Species richness of ground-layer vegetation was maximized at an intermediate level of deer density, suggesting an intermediate disturbance effect. This phenomenon was compatible with the observation that evergreen species, which were competitive dominants, decreased with increasing deer density, whereas less competitive deciduous species increased until herbivory was intermediate. As deer density increased, cover of ground-layer vegetation gradually decreased, but species unpalatable to deer increased in abundance, suggesting indirect positive effects of deer for unpalatable species. Cedar plantations tended to have greater species richness and ground-layer cover than hardwood forests with similar deer levels. Canopy openness, an indicator of light conditions, increased species richness of hardwood forests and ground-layer cover of cedar plantations, even under deer herbivory. Topographic wetness index, an indicator of soil water content, significantly increased the ground-layer cover of cedar plantations under deer herbivory. These results emphasize the importance of environmental productivity and forest type in the management of ground-layer vegetation experiencing deer overabundance.

AB  - The development and distribution of Northern mires, including minerotrophic fens and ombrotrophic raised bogs, frequently are presumed to be strongly controlled by the interplay of regional climate and site geomorphology and history. Investigations of these relationships provide insights into long-term trends in ecosystem development by linking geological and landscape-scale processes. In this study, a theoretical model for raised-bog development integrates internal bog hydrodynamics with external factors, including local substrate characteristics, and regional temperature and moisture conditions. The model is used to interpret the development of raised bogs in the Bergslagen region, which coincides with the modern northern distributional limit of those mires in central Sweden. The development of minerotrophic fens that precede bog formation is also considered. Basal radiocarbon dates along surveyed transects are used to assess the pattern and timing of peatland formation and rates of lateral expansion. Previous palynological and lake-level studies from the same region provide independent evidence for changes in Holocene climate.
   Fen initiation in the region occurred throughout the Holocene under a broad range of environmental conditions. Once established, fens appear to expand faster during moister periods. Locally, substrate slope is an important mediator of fen development, with slopes >0.5% inhibiting lateral expansion. Accumulation of Sphagnum peat, an indicator of raised-bog initiation, occurred from approximate to 4000 to 5000 yr BP during relatively dry phases. Rates of lateral expansion were not significantly affected by increasing moisture or by decreasing temperatures until at least 2000 yr BP. However, modern geographic trends in cross-sectional shape of mires suggest that, at the northern limit of their range today, raised bogs are limited by low temperatures.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an adverse adoptive home environment on adoptee conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, and two measures of aggressivity, all of which are behaviors that contribute to adult antisocial personality disorder and that also are associated with increased vulnerability to drug abuse and/or dependence.
   Methods: The study used an adoption paradigm in which adopted offspring who were separated at birth from biologic parents with documented (by prison and hospital records) antisocial personality disorder and/or alcohol abuse or dependence were followed up as adults. They and their adoptive parents were interviewed in person. These adoptees were compared with controls whose biologic background was negative for documented psychopathologic behavior. Subjects were 95 male and 102 female adoptees and their adoptive parents.
   Results: Multiple regression analysis was used to measure separately genetic and environmental effects. It showed that (1) a biologic background of antisocial personality disorder predicted increased adolescent aggressivity, conduct disorder, and adult antisocial behaviors, and (2) adverse adoptive home environment (defined as adoptive parents who had marital problems, were divorced, were separated, or had anxiety conditions, depression, substance abuse and/or dependence, or legal problems) independently predicted increased adult antisocial behaviors. Adverse adoptive home environment interacted with biologic background of antisocial personality disorder to result in significantly increased aggressivity and conduct disorder in adoptees in the presence of but not in the absence of a biologic background of antisocial personality disorder.
   Conclusions: Environmental effects and genetic-environmental interaction account for significant variability in adoptee aggressivity, conduct disorder, and adult. antisocial behavior and have important implications for the prevention and intervention of conduct disorder and associated conditions such as substance abuse and aggressivity.

AB  - Goal-To establish regularity of transformation of drained peat bog soils, also changes in the water duty to floodplains in the process of agricultural use. Determine the ways of their rational use in the conditions of the Left-Bank Forest-Steppe.
   Research methods. General scientific and special, empirical and theoretical, historical - for a retrospective synthesis of scientific achievements of domestic and foreign scientists on the study of the formation of indicators of fertility and productivity of drained soils; analytical - for analysis of conditions and processes of changing fertility indicators; laboratory - for determination of agrochemical and water-physical properties of soil; field - to establish the botanical composition of the grass stand, accumulation of the amount of root and crop residues in the soil, to establish the intensity of mineralization of organic matter and crop productivity; mathematical statistics - to assess the reliability of the research results.
   Many years of experience summarized and scientific estimates of the transformation of drained peat bog soils with long-term agricultural use are presented. It has been established that over 80 years of use of these soils in agricultural production, peat deposits wear amounted to 100 cm (in the early years, an annual decrease in peat depth was 1, 63, subsequent - 1, 45, and the last - 0, 88 cm). Decrease the depth of the peat bed also occurs due to their compaction.
   Qualitative and quantitative changes in peat soils under the influence of drainage and long-term agricultural use we researched. We have established the patterns and directions of soil processes depending on the influence of the duration of development of peat soils. We also identified scientific and methodological approaches to assessing the conditions and factors affecting the formation of fertility and productivity of drained soils. We have analyzed existing approaches to rationalizing nature management, taking into account the characteristics of the economic development of drained lands.
   Regularities and directions of transformation of drained peat bog soils under the influence of long-term agricultural use are justified. We have identified trends in the indicators of fertility and productivity of drained peat bog soils. We have implemented a systematic approach to the spatiotemporal study of the soil potential of drained soils in order to rationalize nature management in the risky farming zone. We also found that the high-productivity use of organogenic soils provides for the functioning of agrophytocenoses from perennial crops with the aim of creating conservation agrolandscapes and improving the ecological balance in the floodplains of small rivers.

AB  - The extent of male mate choosiness is driven by a trade-off between various environmental factors associated with the costs of mate acquisition, quality assessment and opportunity costs. Our knowledge about natural variation in male mate choosiness across different populations of the same species, however, remains limited. In this study, we compared male mate choosiness across 10 natural populations of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeselii (Gervais 1835), a species with overall high male mating investments, and evaluated the relative influence of population density and sex ratio (both affecting mate availability) on male mate choosiness. We investigated amplexus establishment after separating mating pairs and presenting focal males with a novel, size-matched female from the same population. Our analysis revealed considerable effects of sex ratio and (to a lesser extent) population density on time until amplexus establishment (choosiness). Male amphipods are able to perceive variable social conditions (e.g., sex ratio) and modify their mating strategy accordingly: We found choosiness to be reduced in increasingly male-biased populations, whereas selectivity increases when sex ratio becomes female biased. With this, our study expands our limited knowledge on natural variations in male mate choosiness and illustrates the importance of sex ratio (i.e., level of competition) for male mating decisions in natural environments. Accounting for variation in sex ratios, therefore, allows envisioning a distinctive variation of choosiness in natural populations and highlights the importance of considering social background information in future behavioral studies.

AB  - Bioretention is a commonly used stormwater control measure that, through biogeochemical processes, can improve water quality and reduce runoff volume generated from impervious surfaces. Vegetation has been shown to improve bioretention treatment performance and lifespan, yet guidance for plant selection in bioretention systems remains relatively general, particularly for trees. While numerous benefits of urban trees are understood, including heat island mitigation, air quality improvement, and the like, knowledge of their potential contributions to stormwater management as a component of bioretention is minimal. Critical to tree function in these systems is the trees' ability to maintain health in the unique substrate and hydrologic regime found in the bioretention environment. This study investigated tree health in bioretention systems in the southeastern United States using three-dimensional composite indicators of crown volume and surface area. Five tree species were found to be in a less-healthy state when planted in bioretention practices compared with similar urban trees, whereas only bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) exhibited greater health in bioretention. Differences in tree health were attributed to a lack of alignment between typical bioretention conditions and species-specific growing preferences. Regression models were created using random forest methods to identify bioretention parameters that impact tree health. Parameters relating to bioretention media composition, media chemistry, and tree species selection and planting location (upslope, midslope, or bottom of the bioretention system) were found to have the most influence on tree health. Results from this study suggest that tree health in bioretention may be improved if species selection is based on bioretention media analysis and consideration of species compatibility with the growing conditions found in bioretention.

AB  - The fitness consequences of joining a group are highly dependent on ecological context, especially for non-kin. To assess the relationships between cooperation and environment, we examined variation in colony reproductive success for a harvester ant species that nests either solitarily or with multiple, unrelated queens, a social strategy known as primary polygyny. We measured the reproductive investment of colonies of solitary versus social nesting types at two sites, one with primarily single-queen colonies, and the other with a majority of polygynous nests. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that cooperative nesting by unrelated ant queens is likely a selection response to difficult environments, rather than a strategy to maximize reproduction under favorable conditions. Fewer colonies at the primarily polygynous site reproduced than at the site with primarily single queen nests, and those that did had lower reproductive investment, as measured by number and total mass of reproductives. Assessment of ecological conditions also support the harsh environment hypothesis. Colony density in the multi-queen population was higher, and nearest neighbor distances were lower for non-reproducing than reproducing colonies. To more directly test the hypothesis that colony reproduction was ecologically constrained, we experimentally supplemented food resources for a subset of colonies at the primary polygyny site. Supplemented colonies increased reproductive investment levels to equal that of colonies at the single-queen population, further indicating that environmental pressures are severe where primary polygyny is dominant, and may drive the evolution of non-kin cooperation in this context.

AB  - In this study, we measured the effects of temperature (9 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 28 degrees C), metal contamination (cadmium and nickel) and their interaction on yellow perch (Perca flavescens) using liver enzymatic and transcriptomic endpoints and biometric indices. Kidney metal concentrations increased with a rise of temperature. The biometric indices analysed (Fulton condition factor, pyloric caeca, hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices) generally decreased with an increase of temperature but not with metal contamination. At the enzymatic level, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), involved in antioxidant response, was affected by both temperature and metal contamination, whereas the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), involved in energy accumulation but also in antioxidant response, was only affected by metal exposure. The response of perch to the stressors at the transcriptional level differed from the metabolic response. In particular, the transcription level of the cco and g6pdh genes sharply decreased with increasing temperature, while the activities of the corresponding enzymes remained stable. The normal response of the transcription level of the apoptotic gene (diablo) to heat stress was also altered in metal-contaminated fish. The combination of metal and temperature stresses also modified the response of antioxidant metabolism induced by these stressors individually. This study contributes to a better understanding of the influences of natural stressors like temperature on biomarkers commonly used in ecotoxicological studies and will facilitate their interpretation in the context of multiple stressors characteristic of field situations.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Spring-ephemeral forest-herbs emerge early to take advantage of the high-light conditions preceding canopy closure; they complete their life cycle in a few weeks, then senesce as the tree canopy closes. Summer greens acclimate their leaves to shade and thus manage to maintain a net carbon gain throughout summer. Differences in phenology among life stages within a species have been reported in tree saplings, whose leaf activity may extend beyond the period of shade conditions caused by mature trees. Similar phenological acclimation has seldom been studied in forest herbs.
   METHODS: We compared wild-leek bulb growth and leaf phenology among plants from seedling to maturity and from under 4 to 60% natural light availability. We also compared leaf chlorophyll content and chl a/b ratio among seedlings and adult plants in a natural population as an indicator of photosynthetic capacity and acclimation to light environment.
   KEY RESULTS: Overall, younger plants senesced later than mature ones. Increasing light availability delayed senescence in mature plants, while hastening seedling senescence. In natural populations, only seedlings acclimated to the natural reduction in light availability through time.
   CONCLUSIONS: Wild-leek seedlings exhibit a summer-green phenology, whereas mature plants behave as true spring ephemerals. Growth appears to be more source-limited in seedlings than in mature plants. This modulation of phenological strategy, if confirmed in other species, would require a review of the current classification of species as either spring ephemerals, summer greens, wintergreens, or evergreens.

AB  - Land use changes within watersheds can have large effects on stream ecosystems, but the mechanistic basis of those effects remains poorly understood. While changes to population size presumably reflect underlying variation in organismal health and condition, such individual-level metrics are rarely evaluated in the context of ecosystem disturbance. To address this deficiency, we combined physiological sampling with geographic information systems to quantify the effects of land use on physiological indicators of health in largemouth bass. More specifically, we first quantified blood metrics relating to nutrition, oxidative stress, and the glucocorticoid stress response from largemouth bass residing in eight watersheds. We then used Akaike's information criterion to define relationships between these blood metrics and land cover, including forests, agricultural areas, urban areas, and wetlands. The proportion of forest cover in a watershed was the best predictor of blood metrics representing recent feeding and resistance to oxidative stress, whereas the proportion of wetlands was the best predictor of glucocorticoid function; however, further investigation is needed, as the explanatory power of the models was relatively low. Patterns in energy reserves were not influenced by any land use practices. Interestingly, anthropogenic land use categories, such as urban and agricultural areas, were not the best predictor for any blood metrics. Together, our results indicate that fish health is most related to natural features of a landscape rather than anthropogenic land uses. Furthermore, these findings suggest that physiological methods could supplement traditional population and community assessments to develop a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem interactions and improve stream management.

AB  - Telomeres are an increasingly studied component of physiological ecology. However, in long-lived birds a large telomere loss with chronological age is not the norm. Telomeres are now regarded less as a chronological aging tool and more as an indicator of individual quality, residual lifespan, or biological age. If telomeres indicate biological aging processes, then they should also be associated with other variables that change with age, especially foraging and reproductive behaviors. This study compared telomere length to a suite of foraging parameters in Thick-billed Murres breeding on three colonies in the Bering Sea. Telomere length, environmental conditions at colonies, and sex played pivotal roles in determining foraging habitat selection. Spatial habitat use, foraging efficiency, and prey selection variables all changed with telomere length. The behavioral evidence indicates that despite losing telomeres, birds with short telomere length retain their ability to use the environment efficiently. This indicates that aging birds remain behaviorally flexible, despite paying physiological costs. Changes in spatial use were largely sex-dependent: females and males differed in their use of the environment as telomere lengths declined. Prey selection was related to telomere length and colony; changes in murre trophic level depended on telomere length, but their direction also depended on habitat quality. We found much support for the continued able functioning of birds with shorter telomeres, indicating that physiological aging does not carry only costs. Murres appear to modify their behavior depending on environmental conditions as their physiological reserves decline.

AB  - Plant functional traits built the relationships between plant diversity, species composition, and physiology along with the environmental changes, thus influencing soil microbial community. As the sensitivity indicators, soil microbial biomass and plant functional traits responses soil micro-organism and plant characteristics in direct way. Ten plant functional traits of 149 species and soil microbial biomass (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) were analyzed across the different vegetation types (forest, forest-steppe, and steppe) that are divided by environmental gradient (temperature and precipitation), aimed to find the correlations among them. Our results confirmed the greatest values of plant functional traits (except the leaf density and the fine root density) that were distributed in the steppe zone, mainly due to the different mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation conditions. For different plant growth forms, the plant functional traits were significant differences among the vegetation zones. The advantages of higher rate nutrient cycling, plentiful biomass supplements, and favorite habit conditions lead to the forest-steppe zone with the highest C-mic and N-mic concentrations. The canonical correlation analysis indicated that leaf nitrogen, root nitrogen, and fine root densities were correlated with root exudate and tissue which affected the concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N), consequently impacting soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (N-mic). Soil is the medium that connects micro-organism and plant root system that influenced leaf nitrogen, root nitrogen, and fine root density of plant functional traits, the concentrations of SOC and total N that plant feedback are consequently influencing C-mic and N-mic.

AB  - The microfauna communities present in the mixed liquor and biofilm of an Anoxic/Oxic Shortcut Biofilm Nitrogen Removal moving-bed biofilm process were characterised in order to optimise process control through the use of bioindicators. The system operated at high ammonium concentrations, with an average of 588 +/- 220 mg N-NH4+ L-1 in the influent, 161 +/- 80 mg L-1 in the anoxic reactor and 74 +/- 71.2 mg L-1 in the aerobic reactor. Up to 20 different taxa were identified, including ciliates (4), flagellates (11), amoebae (4) and nematodes (1). Compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs), this process can be defined as a flagellates-predominant system with a low diversity of ciliates. Flagellates were mainly dominant in the mixed liquor, demonstrating high tolerance to ammonium and the capacity for survival over a long time under anoxic conditions. The data obtained provide interesting values of maximum and minimum tolerance ranges to ammonium, nitrates and nitrites for the ciliate species Cyclidium glaucoma, Colpoda ecaudata, Vorticella rnicrostoma-complex and Epistylis cf. rotans. The last of these was the only ciliate species that presented a constant and abundant population, almost exclusively in the aerobic biofilm. Epistylis cf. rotans dynamics showed a high negative correlation with ammonium variations and a positive correlation with ammonium removal efficiency. Hence, the results indicate that Epistylis cf. rotans is a good bioindicator of the nitrification process in this system. The study of protozoan communities in unexplored WWTPs sheds light on species ecology and their role under conditions that have been little studied in WWTPs, and could offer new biological management tools.

AB  - Assessing the ecological risks of toxic chemicals is most often based on individual-level responses such as survival, reproduction or growth. Such an approach raises the following questions with regard to translating these measured effects into likely impacts on natural populations. (i) To what extent do individual-level variables underestimate or overestimate population-level responses? (ii) How do toxicant-caused changes in individual-level variables translate into changes in population dynamics for species with different life cycles? (iii) To what extent are these relationships complicated by population-density effects? These issues go to the heart of the ecological relevance of ecotoxicology and we have addressed them using the population growth rate as an integrating concept. Our analysis indicates that although the most sensitive individual-level variables are likely to be equally or more sensitive to increasing concentrations of toxic chemicals than population growth rate, they are difficult to identify a priori and, even if they could be identified, integrating impacts on key life-cycle variables via population growth rate analysis is nevertheless a more robust approach for assessing the ecological risks of chemicals. Populations living under density-dependent control may respond differently to toxic chemicals than exponentially growing populations, and greater care needs to be given to incorporating realistic density conditions (either experimentally or by simulation) into ecotoxicological test designs. It is impractical to expect full life-table studies, which record changes in survival, fecundity and development at defined intervals through the life cycle of organisms under specified conditions, for all relevant species, so we argue that population growth rate analysis should be used to provide guidance for a more pragmatic and ecologically sound approach to ecological risk assessment.

AB  - The first experiment of the ECOMARGE programme (ECOsystemes de MARGE continentale) was initiated in 1983-1984, in the Gulf of Lions (northwestern Mediterranean Sea). The objectives of the ECOMARGE-I experiment were: to quantify the transfer of particulate matter, in general, and organic carbon, in particular, from its introduction to and formation in the waters of the continental shelf-to its consumption or sedimentation on the shelf or its transfer to the slope and deep sea; and to understand the processes involved in that transfer, consumption and sedimentation together with their variability in space and time. The results of that experiment, from 1983 to 1988, are presented in this Special Issue. The highlights of the results are summarised in this paper.
   These results indicate that, of the particles formed in the waters of the continental shelf and those introduced by rivers, some are deposited as sediments on the shelf. A portion is transported offshore, however, to the slope and deep sea. The Rhone River, in the northeastern part of the study area, is the major source of continental material; this is transported to sea in a benthic nepheloid layer and, mostly, alongshore to the southwest. Here, it largely leaves the shelf through the canyons, especially the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon. In the offshore waters, particle concentrations and distributions show surficial, intermediate and benthic nepheloid layers. These turbid structures increase towards the southwest, corresponding to the seaward shift of the front between the coastal waters and the Liguro-Provencal cyclonic gyre, a major forcing function in the Gulf of Lions.
   Considering the source and fate of particles (largely biogenic from the euphotic zone and abiogenic from deeper waters) a layered system is described, which is emphasized by the concentrations of natural and artificial elements and compounds.
   Of the flux of particles to the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon, on a decadal scale, about 30% (as a minimum) is estimated to be stored as sediment; the remainder is transported down-canyon, towards the deep sea. The temporal variability of processes affecting this net seaward transport, of both biogenic and abiogenic material, is from hours, days to seasonal, and probably interannual, time scales. The response of the system to these variations is rapid, with pulses of increased discharge of particles from the adjacent shelf being detected in sediment traps in the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon in less than 16 days (the temporal resolution of the traps). Based upon the study of tracers of particulate matter and environmental factors (i.e. river discharge and climatic conditions), it appears that the contribution from the Rhone River and its adjacent area is maximal during the winter; at this time, the flow of the Liguro-Provencal Current also increases. In contrast, the maximum relative contribution of the adjacent southwesterly area to the flux in the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon occurs in summer, during storm events.
   Flux budgets of the four major constituents are presented, which demonstrate the advective transfer model; this implies decreasing recycling processes in the water column, from particulate organic carbon (POC), to opal, carbonate, and silicates. The same sequence is seen across the sediment-water interface in terms of flux to the bottom, which is stored in the recent sediments [from the more labile POC (15 mg m-2 day-1), through opal (60 mg m-2 day-1), to carbonate (600 mg m-2 day-1) and silicates (1400 mg m-2 day-1)].
   The response of the benthic ecosystem is studied, by examining the distribution and temporal variability of meiofauna abundances and the reproductive biology of echinoderms. The quantitative distribution of meiofauna along the margin of the Gulf of Lions reflects clearly the distribution of "food indicators", organic carbon and nitrogen contents, chloroplastic pigment levels and bacterial numbers. The data suggest the existence of two different ecosystems: the shelf and slope-canyon benthos (< 1700 m), influenced strongly by the relatively high coastal productivity; and the lower slope and basin, where meiobenthos densities decrease substantially. The meiofaunal densities increase by a factor of 2, from summer to autumn, due to the seasonal increase in the advective input of fresh organic matter. Concerning the possible response of organisms to ecological variations on the continental margin, the reproductive biology of two species of echinoderms (living over the depth range of 60-1000 m) is examined. One of the main factors responsible for the cyclic activity could be the increase of organic carbon and amino-acid fluxes in winter, which are synchronous with gametogenesis.

AB  - Analysing the effects of environmental variation on species assemblages is a key topic in community ecology. However, the outcome may strongly depend on the focal species group. Moths have often been used as the target in ecological studies due to their fast response to environmental change. Yet, some moth subgroups might be more sensitive than others to reflect environmental differences, depending on their functional and physiological characteristics. We investigated which moth subsets are especially suitable to mirror responses to subtle variation in vegetation. We analysed the susceptibility of different subsets to local weather conditions and inter-annual fluctuations. Finally, we checked for the importance of including abundance information. We analysed moth communities (392 species, 23.870 individuals) at 60 sites within two Mediterranean forest reserves and investigated relationships between community composition and environment of (1) all moths (with and without taking abundances into account), and of subsets comprising only (2) small-sized species, (3) host-plant specialists, (4) moss, lichen and detritus feeding species, (5) 'microlepidoptera', (6) 'macro-moths' and (7) random subsets of 50, 100 and 200 species. Incidence data performed similarly to abundance data in matrix regression models. Host plant specialists responded especially sensitive to small-scaled variation in vegetation composition. Macro-moth samples in contrast were highly prone to local weather conditions and to inter-annual abundance fluctuations. Accordingly, a focus on host-specialists and micro-moths is the best way to analyse relationships between shallow environmental gradients and insect communities.

AB  - The ecological environment is the foundation of human survival and development. China's ecological environment has undergone a historic transition from partial improvement to overall improvement. In this paper, long time series NDVI data (1998-2018) are used to evaluate the ecological environment change and spatiotemporal change that has taken place in China over the last 20 years, at different scales (regional, provincial, county, and grid scales). Combined with typical areas, the causes of ecological environment change are revealed. The results show that in about one-third of China, the ecological environment improved, and in 10%, the ecological environment deteriorated. Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi are the provinces in which the improvement of the ecological environment is most pronounced. However, the ecological environments with vegetation as the core in Shanghai and Jiangsu Province have deteriorated significantly. The areas with the fastest improvement in their ecological environment are those with precipitation of 200-600 mm. The Yellow River Basin is an area where the ecological environment has significantly improved. Forestry projects and the development of oasis agriculture effectively promote the improvement of the ecological environment. In the past 20 years, the main reason for the degradation of the ecological environment in eastern coastal areas is urban expansion. China should continue to strengthen its overall layout of forestry projects and improve its ecological environment. When planning its ecological construction, China should fully consider the associated physical and geographical conditions, and adjust measures to local conditions accordingly. China should coordinate the relationship between development and protection and avoid the "pie spread" expansion witnessed in eastern coastal areas.

AB  - Vegetation patch patterns, which are used as indicators of state, functionality, and catastrophic changes in the arid ecosystem, have received much attention. However, little is known about the controlling factors and indicators that underlie vegetation patch patterns in the alpine grassland ecosystem. Here, we firstly studied characteristics of vegetation patch patterns with aerial photography by using an unmanned aerial vehicle and evaluated the vegetation patch-size distribution with power law (PL) and truncated power law (TPL) models on the central part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We then investigated the effects of environmental factors and biotic disturbances on vegetation patch patterns. The results showed that (1) there were four typical vegetation patch patterns, i.e. spot, stripe, sheet, and uniform patterns; (2) soil water content and air temperature were major environmental factors affecting vegetation patch patterns; (3) biotic disturbance of plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) affected vegetation patch patterns by changing the number, area, and connectivity of vegetation patches; and (4) vegetation patch-size distribution parameters were significantly related to soil hydrothermal variables (P < 0.01). We concluded that the development of alpine vegetation patch patterns was controlled by soil hydrothermal conditions and plateau pika's disturbance. We also proposed that gamma (TPL-PL) (difference between absolute values of slopes of TPL and PL curve fits) could serve as an effective indicator for monitoring alpine grassland conditions, and preventing patchiness was a critical task for the alpine ecosystem management and restoration.

AB  - In the last decades, there have been large areas of agricultural land that were abandoned in Europe, producing significant social and environmental impacts. Land abandonment is a dynamic process, which is influenced by a complex range of drivers that vary over time and space. This process is driven by a combination of socio-economic, political, and environmental factors by which formerly cultivated fields are no longer economically viable under existing land-use and socio-economic conditions. The implications of land abandonment on biodiversity and other ecosystem services can be positive or negative depending on the conservation status of the area, agro-climatic conditions, and local factors. Therefore, the scope and extent of environmental impacts vary over time and location. Considering that land abandonment is a contentious issue in Europe, there is still growing need for research on this topic. This paper reviews (i) drivers and consequences of farmland abandonment in Europe, (ii) policy measures and tools developed by the European Union in relation to land abandonment process, (iii) the impacts and indicators that are used to assess ecosystem services that are related to land abandonment, and (iv) the methods by which socio-economic, environmental, and cultural values can be assessed. An overview of key impacts and indicators and the impact assessment methodologies will guide policy-making and planning processes that focus on sustainability impact assessment of land abandonment related to ecosystem services in Europe.

AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) imaging provides a potentially powerful tool for ecological and biometeorological research, but the accuracy of TIR imaging of plant surface temperature in a variable outdoor environment has been poorly characterized. This study evaluated the accuracy of TIR measurements of a conifer tree that were made using the thermal camera's factory default settings, and developed a post-collection data processing method to correct measurements for ambient conditions that depart from the factory default settings. We conducted a 42 day measurement campaign in Corvallis, Oregon during spring 2014 that focused on the canopy temperature of a noble fir (Abies procera) and included the simultaneous collection of meteorological data and leaf temperature measurements with an array of thermocouples. We then developed empirical functions for temperature corrections that better accounted for emissivity, and atmospheric and reflected temperature. The original TIR temperatures using the factory settings averaged 8.6 +/- 5.6 degrees C (-4.2 to 25.4 degrees C in range), and the original TIR temperatures differed from the thermocouple temperatures by 1.4-1.6 K. The TIR temperatures were generally accurate, except for a low temperature bias at leaf temperatures below 5 degrees C. TIR temperature corrections reduced this bias to a < 1.0 K mean error relative to the thermocouples. Our results show that TIR measurements can be corrected to more accurately quantify canopy temperature, and that the importance of this correction increases under more extreme ambient conditions, such as colder periods.

AB  - Global projections of climate change are generally linked to an increase in extreme weather events like extreme precipitation. Thus, improving risk management strategies depends on knowing what the most vulnerable to natural disasters areas and populations are. In this study, the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI), created by Cutter et al. (Soc Sci Q 84(2):242-261, 2003) is used to identify those areas and populations in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This flood-prone area has high levels of social inequality and has not been evaluated from the perspective of vulnerability to natural disasters, but from the economic one. The study is focused on examining the basin-level social vulnerability in the city of Sao Paulo in the year 2010. Based on the principal component analysis, a SoVI was computed for the city. Results were displayed on maps and then analyzed to monitor trends in spacial distribution. Five main components were found in the analysis: 'Urbanization level and vulnerable populations' that explains 21 % of all social vulnerability, 'Favorable environmental and social conditions' explaining 18 %, 'Alternative basic sanitation solutions' (14 %), 'Unfavorable social conditions' (10 %) and 'Development indicators' that explain 8 %. Vulnerability increases in the center-periphery direction. Sixty-nine point seven percent of the basins were classified within the medium vulnerability score, 23.2 % within medium-high or medium-low vulnerability and 7 % within very low, low, high or very high vulnerability. These results show that the components contributing to social vulnerability are different for each basin and represent how social fragmentation of the city hinders efforts of risk management strategies.

AB  - Brazil has one of the largest mangrove surfaces worldwide. Due to a wide latitudinal distribution, Brazilian mangroves can be found within a large range of environmental conditions. However, little attention has been given to the description of environmental variables driving the distribution of mangrove species in Brazil. In this study, we present a novel and unprecedented description of environmental conditions for all mangroves along the Brazilian coast focusing on species limits. We apply a descriptive statistics and data-driven approach using Self-Organizing Maps and we combine data from terrestrial and marine environmental geodatabases in a Geographical Information System. We evaluate 25 environmental variables (21 bioclimatic variables, three sea surface temperature derivates, and salinity). The results reveal three groups of correlated variables: (i) air temperature derivates and sea surface temperature derivates; (ii) air temperature, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation derivates; and (iii) precipitation derivates, aridity and salinity. Our results unveil new locations of extreme values of temperature and precipitation. We conclude that Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa are more limited by precipitation and aridity and that they do not necessarily follow a latitudinal gradient. Our data also reveal that the lowest air temperatures of the coldest month are not necessarily found at the southernmost limits of mangroves in Brazil; instead they are localized at the Mesoregion of Vale do Itajai. However, the minimum sea surface temperature drops gradually with higher latitudes in the Brazilian southern hemisphere and is probably a better indicator for the decrease of species at the latitudinal limits of mangroves than the air temperature and precipitation.

AB  - The capacity to communicate effectively with other individuals plays a critical role in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage coloration, indicators of individual's quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual's oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to OS. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic [persistent organic pollutants (POPs)] contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) in order to stimulate research in this area. We have finally provided suggestions and warnings for future work on the links among OS, sexual signaling, and contaminant exposure.

AB  - Filamentous fungi are important model organisms to understand the eukaryotic process and have been frequently exploited in research and industry. These fungi are also causative agents of serious diseases in plants and humans. Disease management strategies include invitro susceptibility testing of the fungal pathogens to environmental conditions and antifungal agents. Conventional methods used for antifungal susceptibilities are cumbersome, time-consuming and are not suitable for a large-scale analysis. Here, we report a rapid, high throughput microplate-based fluorescence method for investigating the toxicity of antifungal and stress (osmotic, salt and oxidative) agents on Magnaporthe oryzae and compared it with agar dilution method. This bioassay is optimized for the resazurin reduction to fluorescent resorufin by the fungal hyphae. Resazurin bioassay showed inhibitory rates and IC50 values comparable to the agar dilution method and to previously reported IC50 or MICs for M.oryzae and other fungi. The present method can screen range of test agents from different chemical classes with different modes of action for antifungal activities in a simple, sensitive, time and cost effective manner.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyA simple fluorescence-based high throughput method is developed to test the effects of stress and antifungal agents on viability of filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. This resazurin fluorescence assay can detect inhibitory effects comparable to those obtained using the growth inhibition assay with added advantages of simplicity, time and cost effectiveness. This high throughput viability assay has a great potential in large-scale screening of the chemical libraries of antifungal agents, for evaluating the effects of environmental conditions and hyphal kinetic studies in mutant and natural populations of filamentous fungi.

AB  - Amphibians and reptiles are key bioindicators of environmental health and habitat quality and can be used to provide baseline information to help assess habitat conditions and evaluate restoration success. In 2011 and 2012 we conducted comprehensive herpetological surveys throughout the Saginaw Bay area and assessed community composition, species richness, and spatial distribution. We also compared current distributions to historic observations and habitat conditions. A total of 25 taxa (13 species of reptiles and 12 species of amphibians) were observed within the Saginaw Bay area during this study. Herpetofauna were conspicuously unobserved in areas where Phragmites australis dominates the vegetation community and were concentrated in remaining areas of suitable habitat adjacent to Phragmites. Herpetofauna observations were clustered in areas where Phragmites and other invasive plant species were rare or absent. We were able to relate categorization of Phragmites invasion (i.e., 1 = 0-10% colonization detected, 2 = 10-50%, 3 > 50%) to both a biologically and statistically significant decrease in amphibian and reptile species richness. Our results indicate that Saginaw Bay can support a diverse herpetofauna community and there is potential to restore and improve this region for rare and common amphibian and reptile species. Removal of invasive plant species would greatly improve herpetofaunal communities within Saginaw Bay. Our results will help this region's resource professionals assess the quality of habitat and set goals for restoration of amphibian and reptile habitats.

AB  - Although the polycyclic musk 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[gamma]-2-benzopyran (HHCB) is frequently detected in aquatic sediments, very little is known about its effects on sediment-feeding organisms. Effects of sediment-associated HHCB on growth, feeding rate, survival and reproduction in the gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum were measured in the laboratory. Snails were exposed to six nominal HHCB concentrations: 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 30 and 100 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw) sediment. Adult survival and growth were not affected by HHCB. However, juvenile growth and survival, reproduction, time to first reproduction and adult feeding rate were more sensitive endpoints and declined with increasing HHCB concentration. Individual-level endpoints for P. antipodarum were integrated into a population model to investigate the effects of HHCB on population growth rate. Under otherwise favorable laboratory conditions, population growth rate was slightly (by ca. 2%). but not significantly, reduced with increasing HHCB exposure concentration. Model simulations were performed to explore the consequences of HHCB exposure under more ecologically realistic conditions (i.e., survival and reproduction of unexposed snails were markedly reduced relative to the laboratory). The results suggest that despite detectable effects of HHCB on individual-level endpoints measured in the laboratory, impacts on population dynamics of this deposit feeder are not likely to occur at environmentally relevant exposure concentrations.

AB  - Lysosomal destabilization assays have been used as valuable biomarkers of pollutant exposures in a variety of marine organisms. It is accepted by water quality monitoring programs (UNESCO) as useful in environmental quality assessment. However, for the correct use of a stress index, it is necessary to know whether the investigated response exhibits natural fluctuations related, for example, to seasonal cycle, short-term natural environmental changes associated to tidal cycle or episodic events. The aim of this study, carried out on two different beaches, in the Santa Catarina, Brazil, was to evaluate the effects of a storm event upon the populations of Donax hanleyanus, using lysosomal destabilization assay. The selected beaches are exposed to wave action and represent different morphodynamic types. Samples were taken before, during and after the storm event. At theses times, the beach profiles, water temperature and salinity were monitored. Lysosomal stability was measured using the Neutral Red dye retention time assay (NRR) in which stress-induced pathological alteration of the lysosomal compartment was viewed by microscopy in live haemocytes exposed to neutral red. Both beaches showed a reduction in the lysosomal retention capacity during the storm period, indicating cells injury. However, significant differences between the control and the storm periods were observed only in the Taquara beach, which showed the highest sediment erosion rate. There weren't significant changes on temperature or salinity during the studied period. These results suggest that D. hanleyanus can be stressed by storm condition, but with different magnitudes conditioned by intensity of environmental alteration.

AB  - The effect of natural canopy gaps on the performance cf naturally occurring tree seedling populations was studied in a tropical rain forest in French Guiana. This was done at two levels of scale. :Firstly, on a 20 m x 250 m forest transect intersecting four canopy gaps, it was investigated how patterns of recruitment, growth and survival of seedlings of Cecropia obtusa, Dicorynia guianensis and Pourouma bicolor differed between canopy gaps and closed forest. Secondly, for one large natural canopy gap, performance of seedling cohorts established before ('pre-gap' cohorts) and after ('post-gap' cohorts) gap formation was studied in relation to environmental heterogeneity. The direct site factor (DSF) was used as an indicator of light availability in the gap zone. Cecropia specialised in large gaps, and also in specific sites within the large gap: seedling performance was increased by light, and by dead wood. Pourouma mainly germinated under closed forest conditions, where it can survive for a long period until a canopy gap is formed nearby. Pourouma seedlings adjusted well to the new gap environment but they did not specialise in specific places within the gap. Seedling location of Pourouma seedlings was mainly determined by accidental positioning before gap formation. Dicorynia was able to germinate both in gaps and under closed for est conditions. Although the number of gaps studied in this study was low, the results show that seedling establishment, early growth and survival of the three tree species were affected by canopy gaps and by the environmental heterogeneity within a large gap.

AB  - The massive and uncontrolled use of food packaging derived from petroleum-based plastics has created a serious environmental problem. Hence, the food packaging industry needs to develop packaging from biodegradable polymers. Among the many raw materials studied in the literature, chitosan is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in the nature. Chitosan has attracted attention due to its non-toxicity, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties. Because of this, chitosan is considered a perfect material for the development of films for food use. In this review, recent studies on active and/or intelligent chitosan-based films has been evaluated. Active packaging maintains or improves the condition of packaged food or extends its shelf-life meanwhile intelligent packaging monitors the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food. The effect of the addition of active compounds on the mechanical, barrier and functional properties of chitosan-based films has been assessed. The antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, as well as the potential application of these active and intelligent composite films have also been revised. Literature shows that the presence of phenolic compounds improves both mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan films. The antimicrobial and antioxidant capacity of the films improved significantly by the addition of essential oils, phenolic compounds, and other fruit extracts. Intelligent pH-indicator chitosan-based films have been extensively studied. Further research on chitosan and its combinations with other materials is needed to study which type of foodstuffs could be in contact with chitosan packaging.

AB  - It is well known that temperatures across the globe are rising, but climatic conditions are becoming more variable as well. Forecasts of species range shifts, however, often focus on average climatic changes while ignoring increasing climatic variability. In particular, many species distribution models use space-for-time substitution, which focuses exclusively on the effect of average climatic conditions on the target species across a geographic range, and is blind to the possibility of range-wide population collapse with increasing drought frequency, drought severity, or climate effects on other co-occurring species. Relegated to assessments of broad demographic patterns that ignore underlying biological responses to increasing climatic variability, this prevalent method of distribution forecasting may systematically underpredict climate change impacts. We compare six models of survival and abundance of a subcanopy tree species,Taxus brevifolia, over 40 years of past climate change to disentangle multiple sources of uncertainty: model formulation, scale of climate effect, and level of biological organization. We show that drought extremes increasedTaxusindividual- and population-scale mortality across a wide geographic climate gradient, precluding detection of a monotonic relationship with average climate. Individual-scale climatic extremes models derived from longitudinal data had the highest predictive accuracy (82%), whereas mean climate models had the lowest accuracy (< 65%). Our results highlight that conclusions drawn from forecasts of average warming alone likely underpredict climate change impacts by ignoring indicators of range-wide population declines for species sensitive to increasing climatic variability.

AB  - Although crabs are effective indicator species for evaluating the health of estuarine environments, the relationship between crab communities and environmental conditions in temperate river estuaries is poorly investigated. This study aimed to clarify the physicochemical factors that affect crab fauna in temperate areas, as well as classify and characterize habitat based on the similarity of crab fauna. Data of crab fauna and physicochemical environmental factors were collected at 199 sites in two temperate rivers. These survey sites were spatially arranged to cover the estuarine zone (i.e., tidal freshwater to polyhaline water) and the intertidal zone (i.e., the high tide to low tide line). The result of a direct gradient analysis showed that salinity and median particle size, in particular, affected crab fauna. Moreover, the survey sites were classified into seven groups based on the similarity of crab fauna, which were modeled with moderate accuracy using three variables: salinity, elevation, and percentage of silt. From these variables, we were able to identify seven different habitat types: salt marshes covered with fine or coarse sediment, upstream zones with gravelly sediment, intermediate zones between salt marshes and tidal flats, sand tidal flats with scattered hard structures, monotonous sand flats, and mud flats. Our findings suggest that maintaining the salinity gradient and diversity of sediment grain size is necessary to conserve crab species diversity in temperate river estuaries. Effective ecosystem conservation in these areas needs to take into account the physicochemical conditions in the seven identified habitat types.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) residue (straw) has been identified as a promising feedstock for bioenergy production, but excessive straw removal may impair soil macrofauna and related ecosystem services. To quantify straw removal effects on abundance, richness, and diversity of soil macrofauna, four experiments were conducted in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, under different edaphoclimatic conditions. A secondary goal was to evaluate seasonal changes on soil macrofauna and identify linkages between those changes and soil chemical and physical attributes. Four straw removal treatments (NR, no removal, LR, low removal, HR, high removal, and TR, total removal) were evaluated. Macrofauna and other soil attributes were sampled within the 0- to 0.30-m depth increment. Soil macrofauna were impaired by TR with the magnitude of response being related to both edaphoclimatic conditions and management practices. Numerous interactions among seasons, straw removal rates, and soil macrofauna were found, especially for total abundance and diversity of organisms. Partial straw removal (HR and LR) may be a strategy to protect soil health and increase bioenergy production with minimal effects on soil macrofauna, although long-term experiments are needed to confirm our hypothesis. The NR treatment generally had better soil quality as indicated by greater soil moisture, macropore number, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and soil fertility, which led to a higher abundance of most macrofauna organisms. Total removal resulted in greater soil compaction and decreased macrofauna abundance, especially in clay soils. Our findings confirm that an integrated approach using soil indicators as guidelines should be adopted to better predict sustainable straw management practices for sugarcane in Brazil.

AB  - Taro (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott) is an important staple food crop in tropical and developing countries, having high water requirements. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) as a physiological indicator of taro response to drought, and elucidation of the relationship between the water use efficiency (WUE) under drought conditions and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13). As an alternative to WUE determination, obtained by measuring plant growth and water loss during an entire vegetative cycle, we have used Delta C-13 to determine the tolerance of C-3 taro plants to drought Seven taro accessions from Madeira, Canary Islands and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (Fiji) collections were grown under greenhouse conditions and subjected to different watering regimes during a one-year cycle. Total plant biomass (TPB), WUE and delta N-15 were determined at the whole-plant level (WP). Corms and shoots were evaluated separately for nitrogen content (N), delta C-13, Delta C-13 and delta N-15. WUE showed positive correlation with TPB (r = 0.4) and negative with delta C-13 (r = -0.3); Corm delta N-15 showed positive correlations with WP delta N-15 (r = 0.6) and corm N (r = 0.3). Accordingly, the taro plants with enhanced WUE exhibited low Delta C-13 and delta N-15 values as a physiological response to drought stress. The approach used in the present study has developed new tools that could be used in further research on taro response to environmental stresses.

AB  - Aim : This research is based on vegetation elaboration of Elmacik Mountain in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey, which has a quite rich floristic and vegetation diversity.
   Methodology : Since varied ecological conditions cause a diverse vegetation in the region, vegetation environment relation was analyzed with multivariate statistical techniques. In the context of the study, syntaxonomical scheme of the region was introduced and ecological characteristics of the main forest types and vegetation data were analyzed using environmental variables and Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs) derived from species composition.
   Results : The forest vegetation was presented by 2 classes and 2 orders which contained 4 alliances and 11 associations. Constrained ordination revealed that the altitude is the most important factor affecting species composition (23.1 %), followed by soil depth (19.1 %). However, when conditional effects of variables are considered, forest cover (16.7 %) had the highest contribution following altitude (23.1 %). Hyperico calycini-Quercetum petraea had the highest species diversity because of one-storied and light penetrating leaf structure. However, Rhododenro pontici-Fagetum orientalis had the lowest species diversity due to a dense shrub cover consisting of Rhododendron ponticum. Average EIVs for continentality, soil nutrient and light were positively correlated with altitude and nutrient EIVs with soil depth, stand height and cover. Radiation index calculated from latitude, slope degree and aspect showed correlation with light and continentality EIVs.
   Interpretation : Altitudinal distribution of forest communities was mainly affected by exposure and soil conditions (soil depth, soil type) in the region. Species variation in each unit was well explained with the average EIVs, which were also supported with the measured environmental variables.

AB  - Although population models are recognized as necessary tools in the ecological risk assessment of pesticides, particularly for species listed under the Endangered Species Act, their application in this context is currently limited to very few cases. The authors developed a detailed, individual-based population model for a threatened plant species, the decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens), for application in pesticide risk assessment. Floods and competition with other plant species are known factors that drive the species' population dynamics and were included in the model approach. The authors use the model to compare the population-level effects of 5 toxicity surrogates applied to B. decurrens under varying environmental conditions. The model results suggest that the environmental conditions under which herbicide applications occur may have a higher impact on populations than organism-level sensitivities to an herbicide within a realistic range. Indirect effects may be as important as the direct effects of herbicide applications by shifting competition strength if competing species have different sensitivities to the herbicide. The model approach provides a case study for population-level risk assessments of listed species. Population-level effects of herbicides can be assessed in a realistic and species-specific context, and uncertainties can be addressed explicitly. The authors discuss how their approach can inform the future development and application of modeling for population-level risk assessments of listed species, and ecological risk assessment in general.

AB  - Plants inhabiting extreme environments may possess features allowing them to tolerate sudden abrupt changes in their environment, a phenomenon often known as 'adaptability.' However, ability or success in developing adaptability varies among plant populations. Adaptability can be quantified by measuring variation in the response to the same environmental challenges between plant populations. In this study, we evaluate the adaptability of the iconic Antarctic plant, Deschampsia antarctica, based on traits reflecting three levels of organization: the population level (S, D. antarctica land cover), individual level (Ph, biometrics), and cell level (relative DNA content, rcDNA, in cells of the leaf parenchyma). We sampled a total of six D. antarctica populations in the Admiralty Bay region, King George Island (South Shetland Islands, maritime Antarctic), during the austral summer of 2005-2006, and analyzed pairwise interrelations between various indices reflecting plant population adaptability. The results of these pairwise comparisons were then used to estimate a pooled measure of each population's adaptability, designated as united latent quality indicator (ULQI). Our results demonstrated that the responses of individual adaptability indices were seldom synchronized, although one population from the central part of the Point Thomas oasis did show some degree of synchronicity. This population also demonstrated the highest ULQI, consistent with the relatively favorable microenvironmental conditions at this location. Two other populations located closer to the shoreline also demonstrated detectable synchronicity and moderate levels of ULQI, while the remaining populations revealed no synchronized responses and negative ULQI values. As the ULQI value obtained will be strongly influenced by the conditions experienced by any given population during a particular season, evaluation of population dynamics requires annual monitoring over multiple seasons.

AB  - The Pasture Condition Score (PCS) system, developed by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, is a monitoring and assessment tool for pastureland enrolled in conservation programs. Ten indicators of vegetation and soil status are rated on a 1 to 5 scale and are summed to give an aggregate score, which is interpreted for management recommendations. Information is lacking, however, on how PCS results vary within and among environments and farms. We applied the PCS on two farms in Pennsylvania (one dairy, one beef), two dairy farms in New York, and an organic dairy in Maryland. All pastures (25 to 63 per farm) on each farm were evaluated according to PCS methodology in spring, summer, and autumn of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Aggregate PCS scores ranged from 30 to 40 (indicating some improvements were needed to pasture management) and were relatively stable within management recommendation categories across seasons in 2004 and 2006. The PCS scores in 2005, however, plummeted (below 25 to 30-indicating major management changes to prevent degradation) on the Pennsylvania and Maryland farms because of drought. Pastures used for heifers and dry cows or as wintering areas often had lower scores than other Pastures. Typically, these pastures were on less productive soils, steep slopes, and were stocked intensively. There was much overlap among individual score categories for some indicators, which suggests that fewer but broader score categories (e.g., low, medium, high) Would simplify the system for farmers. The monitoring workload could be reduced by assessing representative subsets of pastures managed similarly or in similar landscape positions instead of all pastures on a farm.

AB  - Simple Summary
   To prevent pigs from redirecting their exploratory natural behavior to their penmates, so as to prevent tail biting and promote pig welfare, the Council Directive 2008/120/EC has made environmental enrichment in pig farming mandatory. Possible enrichments can be varied: objects that are edible or not or bulk material. However, the enrichments need to be compatible with slatted floors, the main type of floor in pig housing. Here, we assessed the impact on pig welfare of a material made of an algae-based cylinder, compatible with slatted floors and edible, and which is categorized as suboptimal enrichment materials according to Commission Recommendation (EU) 2016/336 classification. The assessment was done in comparison with metal chains, an enrichment material commonly used in farms, and with wood logs, a bio-sourced object too. Enrichment material made from algae had no negative effect on pig health. Performance and body condition were similar between groups that were given different materials. When provided during the suckling period, the algae material did not appear to promote manipulating behavior in piglets after weaning. Regarding their characteristics, the algae cylinders can be categorized as suboptimal enrichment materials, although it does not significantly improve pig welfare when compared to a metal chain, which is categorized as a material of marginal interest.
   In barren housing conditions, enrichment materials are given to pigs to improve their welfare. Here, we assessed the suitability of an algae-based cylinder as an enrichment material on the behavioral, physiological, health and productivity welfare indicators of pigs. Algae was compared with metal chains and wood logs. The study involved 444 pigs from two successive batches on one single farm. During the suckling period, half of the pigs received algae and the control pigs received no material. After weaning and until the end of fattening, algae, wood or chains were equally distributed among the pigs. Consumption of algae cylinders was different between pens and between batches. After weaning and during the fattening period, although the results differed between batches, no significant difference was observed in the object manipulations. Salivary cortisol, used as biomarker to measure the stress levels after pig transfers, were similar between the treatments. Enrichment material made from algae had no negative effect on pig health and no effect on performance and body condition. Regarding their characteristics and according to Commission Recommendation (EU) 2016/336 classification, algae cylinders can be categorized as suboptimal enrichment materials, although the present results suggest that it does not significantly improve pig welfare compared to a metal chain, which is categorized as a material of marginal interest.

AB  - Despite their high genomic diversity, all known viruses are structurally constrained to a limited number of virion morphotypes. One morphotype of viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes is the tailless icosahedral morphotype with an internal membrane. Although it is considered an abundant morphotype in extreme environments, only seven such archaeal viruses are known. Here, we introduce Haloarcula californiae icosahedral virus 1 (HCIV-1), a halophilic euryarchaeal virus originating from salt crystals. HCIV-1 also retains its infectivity under low-salinity conditions, showing that it is able to adapt to environmental changes. The release of progeny virions resulting from cell lysis was evidenced by reduced cellular oxygen consumption, leakage of intracellular ATP, and binding of an indicator ion to ruptured cell membranes. The virion contains at least 12 different protein species, lipids selectively acquired from the host cell membrane, and a 31,314-bp-long linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The overall genome organization and sequence show high similarity to the genomes of archaeal viruses in the Sphaerolipoviridae family. Phylogenetic analysis based on the major conserved components needed for virion assembly-the major capsid proteins and the packaging ATPase-placed HCIV-1 along with the alphasphaerolipoviruses in a distinct, well-supported clade. On the basis of its virion morphology and sequence similarities, most notably, those of its core virion components, we propose that HCIV-1 is a member of the PRD1-adenovirus structure-based lineage together with other sphaerolipoviruses. This addition to the lineage reinforces the notion of the ancient evolutionary links observed between the viruses and further highlights the limits of the choices found in nature for formation of a virion.
   IMPORTANCE Under conditions of extreme salinity, the majority of the organisms present are archaea, which encounter substantial selective pressure, being constantly attacked by viruses. Regardless of the enormous viral sequence diversity, all known viruses can be clustered into a few structure-based viral lineages based on their core virion components. Our description of a new halophilic virus-host system adds significant insights into the largely unstudied field of archaeal viruses and, in general, of life under extreme conditions. Comprehensive molecular characterization of HCIV-1 shows that this icosahedral internal membrane-containing virus exhibits conserved elements responsible for virion organization. This places the virus neatly in the PRD1-adenovirus structure-based lineage. HCIV-1 further highlights the limited diversity of virus morphotypes despite the astronomical number of viruses in the biosphere. The observed high conservation in the core virion elements should be considered in addressing such fundamental issues as the origin and evolution of viruses and their interplay with their hosts.

AB  - The research focuses on the assessment of the main agro-productive properties and the evolution of the mollic reddish (red-brown) preluvisol between the Jiu and Olt rivers, under the new conditions of soil formation and exploitation, created after radical transformations in Romanian agriculture, when most of the lands were passed from state to private ownership. The first comparative analysis of the properties of the soil that evolved on the terrains utilized for crop culture on farms and agritourist households, with soil that evolved forest vegetation, attests to the impact of the anthropic factor - intense modification in the morphological, physical and chemical (deeper profile due to the eluviation - illuviation process, compaction and sealing of lower horizons and an irreversible decrease in natural fertility). The second analysis, of the soil utilized for crop culture, reveals that the morphology, contents, architecture, physical, hydric indicators and chemical proprieties have not undergone any positive or negative modification in a period of 23 years. Relevant for the farms and agritourist households that practice touristic activities is the presence and concertation of heavy metals. The identified heavy metals do not pose any threat to plants or humans, as their concentration does not exceed the normal permitted values, except for chromium, which is still well below the alert threshold. Current conditions enable the mollic reddish preluvisol to support an ecologically based agricultural production, thus ensuring the safety and traceability of the agrifoods offered to tourists.

AB  - Plants in the high Arctic are exposed to a 24-h photoperiod for several months. These conditions can be damaging for plants at lower latitudes. When common crops are artificially maintained under continuous light (CL), photosynthetic processes maintain endogenous circadian rhythms, but it is unclear whether plants naturally acclimated to CL also maintain such rhythmicity. Alternatively, Arctic plants have to utilise the favourable conditions during the short Arctic summers. In this study, we evaluate the existence of daily cycles in pigment composition in three Arctic plants in a tundra ecosystem at 78 degrees N that display examples of different growth forms: the bryophyte Polytrichum hyperboreum, the herb Bistorta vivipara and the dwarf shrub Salix polaris. Changes in pigment composition are excellent indicators of the restructuring of the light-harvesting apparatus. Most pigment parameters analysed did not show any consistent pattern of variation between subjective noon and midnight. P. hyperboreum had the highest level of rhythmicity, while S. polaris was the most stable. Despite these subtle changes, the primary effects observed were induced by light and its effect on the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments (AZ/VAZ). Both short- and long-term adjustments of the AZ/VAZ correlated with changes in photochemical efficiency (phi(PSII)). When the plants were artificially darkened during the night, it became evident that the midnight sun prevents the complete relaxation of the xanthophyll cycle. These results indicate that light is the primary driver of photochemical efficiency in Arctic plants, and consequently, photosynthesis is not completely interrupted at night.

AB  - A passive sampling device, based on molecularly imprinted membranes (MIM), was fabricated and optimised for sampling polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in aquatic ecosystems. The newly-developed passive sampler was subjected to in-situ calibration studies to determine PCB sampling rates under various conditions of water turbulence and temperature. This was carried out by exposing the passive samplers to water spiked with PCBs in a continuous-flow exposure setup. The samplers were preloaded with known concentrations of performance reference compounds (PRCs) prior to exposure. Sampling rates of seven indicator PCBs' congeners (PCBs 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) ranged between 15.3 and 95.6 L/d for the different environmental conditions investigated. To determine the field suitability, the samplers were preloaded with PRCs and deployed for 10 days at the Roodeplaat and Hartbeespoort Dams, in South Africa. Water samples were taken at the end of the deployment period to compare the spot-and-grab samples to the developed samplers. PCBs 28, 101 and 138 were detected in the samplers deployed at Hartbeespoort Dam. The samplers deployed at the Roodeplaat Dam had quantifiable amounts of PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138 and 180 (0.047-0.828 ng mL(-1) d(-1)). The sampler enhanced the detectability of PCB 52 and PCB 180, which were not detected in water samples. The field suitability trials indicated that the developed sampler could successfully be used for PCB monitoring. The sampler enhanced the detection of PCBs that would otherwise be too low to detect in samples collected through the traditional spot-and-grab sampling technique.

AB  - Biosolid application is considered a sustainable management tool as it positively contributes to recycle nutrients and to improve soil properties and fertility. Nevertheless, this waste management technique involves an important input source of emerging organic pollutants in soil. To evaluate the environmental potential risk related to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) due to the biosolid application to soil, a quantitative ecotoxicological risk assessment was conducted. The analyte concentrations were employed to perform an estimation of the exposure levels to contaminants in the receiving media, defining predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for terrestrial and aquatic compartments (PECsoil, PECwater, PECsed) and for secondary poisoning via the terrestrial and aquatic food chain (PECoral, (predator) ((T)), PECoral, (predator (Aq))) The risk characterization ratios (RCRs) were calculated based in the comparison of the PEC values obtained with concentrations with no effect (PNECs) on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Based on the chosen scenarios and experimental conditions, no environmental risk of PFASs and HFRs released from biosolid amended soils to different environmental compartments was detected (RCRsoil, RCRoral, (worm), RCRwater, RCRsed and RCRoral, (fish) were below 1 in all cases). Besides, the potential health risk of PFASs and HFRs to local people who live in the scenario studied and are fed on horticultural crops grown in biosolid amended soil was also below 1, indicating that the risk is not considered significant to human health in the conditions studied. This approach provides a first insight of the risks relative to biosolid amendments to further research based on fieldwork risk assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Relevance of the work is caused by the need to assess and monitor the ecological condition of atmospheric air in Gorno-Altaisk as the most urbanized area of the Altai Republic.
   The main aim of the study is the research of chemical composition and characteristics of distribution of elements in the lichen Caloplaca sp. (scale) on the slate as a bioindicator of the specificity and intensity of anthropogenic activities in Gorno-Altaisk.
   The methods: lichen Caloplaca sp. (scale) and conjugate slate sampling from the roof of buildings, determination of content of 28 chemical elements using instrumental neutron activation analysis, processing and interpretation of the data obtained by the methods of applied statistics.
   The results. The authors have obtained the data on the levels of contents of chemical elements in the lichen Caloplaca sp. (scale) on the slate near Gorno-Altaysk and compared them with local background and darke in the biosphere. Close relationship between the elements of As, Sb, Cr, Zn, Ba, Br, Co, Fe, U association, rare earth elements in lichen, as well as their level of concentration and content in coals of the Kuznetsk basin was determined. The paper introduces the argument in favor of admission of these elements in the lichen Caloplaca sp. from atmospheric air. The authors revealed the scope of their elevated concentrations in lichen, spatially coincident with areas of high dust load within the Metropolitan area. The conclusion is made about the possibility of using the elemental composition of the epilithic lichen Caloplaca sp. on the slate for bioindication of specificity and intensity of anthropogenic activities, as well as an additional indicator for monitoring the condition of surface atmosphere of the settlements within Gorno-Altaisk area.

AB  - Predatory aquatic beetles are common colonizers of natural and managed aquatic environments. While as important components of the aquatic food webs they are prone to accumulate trace elements, they have been largely neglected from metal uptake studies. We aim to test the suitability of three dytiscid species, i.e. Hydroglyphus pusillus, Laccophilus minutus and Rhantus suturalis, as trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn) bioindicators. The work was carried out in a case area representing rice paddies and control sites (reservoirs) from an arid region known for its land degradation (Monegros, NE Spain). Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) was tested as a nonlinear approach to identify significant relationships between metals, species and habitat conditions so as to examine the ability of these species to reflect differences in metal uptake. Except Se and As, the average concentrations of all other elements in the beetles were higher in the rice fields than in the control habitats. The CATPCA determined that H. pusillus had high capacity to accumulate Fe, Ni and Mn regardless of the habitat type, and hence may not be capable of distinguishing habitat conditions with regards to these metals. On the other hand, L. minutus was found less sensitive for Se in non-managed habitats (i. e. reservoirs), while R. suturalis was good in accumulating Al, Mo and Pb in rice fields. The latter seems to be a promising bioindicator of metal enrichment in rice fields. We conclude that predatory aquatic beetles are good candidates for trace elements bioindication in impacted and non-impacted environments and can be used in environmental monitoring studies. CATPCA proved to be a reliable approach to unveil trends in metal accumulation in aquatic invertebrates according to their habitat status.

AB  - The functional groups of planktonic protist communities and their responses to the changes of environmental conditions were investigated in a semi-enclosed shrimp-farming pond in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, during a six-month study period (a complete shrimp-culture cycle) from May to October 2002. The results reveal that: (1) the protist communities represented five trophic and functional groups of the species identified, about 60% were photoautotrophs, 20% algivores, 12% bacterivores, 5% raptors and about 3% non-selectives; (2) the photoautotrophs, algivores and bacterivores were the primary contributors to the changes in the protist communities in short temporal scales, the succession of dominance typically being bacterivores -> photoautotrophs -> algivores, with the raptors dominating the protist communities in a single sample (early June); (3) the photoautotrophs and non-selectives were the primary contributors to the peak of protist abundance in early October whereas the photoautotrophs, bacterivores, raptors and non-selectives mainly gave rise to two bimodal peaks of biomass in July and October respectively; (4) five functional groups of protist communities represented significant correlations with water nutrients (i.e., NH(3)-N, NO(3)-N, and PO(4)), either alone or in combination with temperature, of which algivores and raptors were strongly correlated with phosphate and the concentration of Chl a, while bacterivores were strongly related to nitrogen and the concentration of bacteria. These findings confirm that planktonic protists are potentially useful bioindicators of water quality in the semi-enclosed mariculture system.

AB  - Distribution patterns of mangrove pollen taxa in recent surface sediments of the lagoon system of Cispata are compared with geomorphological and vegetational patterns. The pollen spectra of 51 samples show the floral composition and structure of mangrove stands in three main geomorphic units in the study area. The oldest mangrove stands, with the highest tree mean diameter at breast height and total height, are represented in the pollen spectra by the highest mean percentages (>65%) mainly Rhizophora mangle. The area with estuarine conditions shows, mean mangrove pollen percentages between 35 and 50% reflecting the mangrove colonization process since 1930, as well as current anthropogenic disturbance. Lowest proportions of mangrove pollen (<25%) are found in the foothills, reflecting high disturbance of mangroves and the transition from mangroves to terra firme forest. Distribution patterns of the pollen and spores indicate that water transport is more important than wind transport over short distance and reflect local vegetation. Fern spores and pollen grains of secondary forest taxa and grasslands are widely distributed and reflect regional vegetation. Rhizophora pollen proportions reflect its relative abundance in the forest stands. Even low proportions of Avicennia pollen indicate this species' dominance in sparse stands and saline back swamp conditions. Conocarpus presence provides evidence of supratidal location of stands. An inverse relationship between proportions of Laguncularia pollen and Acrostichum spores demonstrates successional processes triggered by anthropogenic disturbance. This is the first report on pollen in surface sediments in the Colombian Caribbean. As such, the data should prove valuable in efforts to apply interpretations of marine records to reconstruct past environmental and climate changes in the Caribbean. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of increased biodeposition within mussel (Mytilus edulis) farms on the benthic environment were investigated using surface sediment samples collected from 11 coastal embayments in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. The degree of organic enrichment, determined using geochemical indicators (total free sulfides (S), redox potentials (Eh(NHE)), water content (WC) and organic matter (OM)), was significantly greater in mussel leases compared to reference sites located both outside lease boundaries and in inlets not used to culture mussel (MANOVA, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed that mean WC and OM, EhNHE potentials and S concentration were all significantly different between lease and reference sites (p <= 0.009). Temporal changes in organic enrichment conditions were detected by comparing our 2001 data to those previously reported from a 1997 survey of the same sampling sites (MANOVA, p < 0.001). This multivariate effect resulted primarily from a 39% increase in mean S concentration between 1997 and 2001 (p = 0.029). Surface sediment variables at reference sites were similar between years. Benthic conditions were discriminated along an oxic-anoxic enrichment gradient using multidimensional scaling analysis. Mussel lease sites sampled in 1997 were clustered within predefined oxic sediment classifications along with the majority of reference sites, but were grouped farther along the enrichment gradient in 2001. The significant increase in hypoxic and sulfidic sediments within mussel farms between 1997 and 2001 is consistent with the 43% increase in PEI mussel production-a classic response to excessive organic biodeposition in shallow coastal inlets with relatively low dispersive capacity.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) often exerts various environmental pressures on nearby water courses: chemical stress from low pH and dissolved metals; physical stress from metal oxide deposits. Affected streams can thus display a spatially variable combination of stress agents that may complicate its biomonitoring using native communities such as periphyton. Here, we have measured water and periphyton variables in four streams that surround an abandoned copper mine to determine which periphyton attributes consistently detected AMD impact in a complex environmental setting. Seventeen years after the end of commercial exploitation, the abandoned mine still decreases water quality in nearby streams: moderate acidification, very high metal load (Al, Ni, Cu, Zn), and a conspicuous presence of metal oxide deposits with diverse composition. Even under the resultant complex pattern of polluted conditions, periphyton was a reliable bioindicator of AMD. Epilithic diatom taxa tolerant of acidic conditions increased in AMD sites and, at severely impacted locations, species richness decreased. Also, algal biomass may have been negatively affected in some stream reaches affected by metal oxide deposits. Other periphyton attributes (total biomass, diatom diversity) seemed mostly unrelated to AMD. Diatom assemblage composition was the most sensitive and consistent bioindicator of mine drainage; besides, it rendered a biological assessment of AMD impact that largely coincided with the physicochemical evaluation. Still, including other taxonomic (proportion of acid-tolerant diatom species, diatom richness) and non-taxonomic (algal biomass) attributes in the biomonitoring procedure rendered a more comprehensive assessment of the negative consequences generated by AMD.

AB  - We studied Cnidoscolus stimulosus and Ipomoea pandurata, two common herbs of the Fall Line Sandhills to assess their potential as ecosystem level stress indicators. We focused on plants because they are among the most persistent organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. We used developmental instability as an indicator of plant population stress. Developmental instability is usually measured as deviations from symmetry, in traits that normally develop symmetrically. Thus, symmetry represents an idealized a priori phenotype. Stress presumably causes perturbations during development that may exceed the capacity of the organism to buffer or correct, resulting in developmental instability, and hence deviations from this ideal. Soil disturbance imposed by different land use patterns at Fort Benning, Georgia provided a gradient of soil disturbance. In 2000-2002 we collected plants from nine different sites representing three levels of disturbance. In addition, in 2002 we collected microhabitat data in 1 m quadrats surrounding each plant whose developmental stability we also assessed. The developmental instability of both species was influenced by land use patterns, whether or not the sites had been previously burned, and microhabitat variables. Developmental instability increased with soil disturbance, burning in the prior year, and as the percentage of bare ground increased around the target individual. To some extent, favorable microhabitat conditions reduced developmental instability in sites with medium and high soil disturbance, whereas unfavorable conditions at low soil disturbance sites increased developmental instability. As an indicator of community level stress, developement instability is best used in conjunction with other indices of environmental quality. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The distribution of life forms, life strategies and selected ecomorphological adaptations is studied in submontane and montane epiphytic bryophyte communities in order to record the 'ecological response' of species groups towards environmental demands. This method can be used for rapid monitoring because the defined 'functional types'reflect prevalent key conditions (humidity, water supply, desiccation risk, light climate). Mat-forming 'passive' perennial stayers and perennial shuttle species with a similar 'basic architecture' predominate in the lowland sector of the study area (submontane, bryophyte alliance: Symbiezidio transversalis-Ceratolejeunion cubensis). In the cooler, more humid montane forests (bryophyte alliance: Omphalantho filiformis-Plagiochilion apicedentis) often enshrouded in mist, they are replaced by fan and weft-forming 'vegetative' perennial stayers and perennial shuttle species. Species of those habitats demonstrate ecomorphological structures which further water uptake and condensation of fog- and mist-derived water-vapour. Higher up, in the ecotone between the Lower and Upper montane forests, an 'oreal' pattern is evident: an increased proportion of cushion, short and especially tall turf-forming 'generative' perennial stayers and perennial shuttle species which show the necessity of overcoming xeric conditions during cloudless periods. Species of increasingly open habitats often have a dense rhizoid tomentum and central strand for rapid and effective water conduction. As expected, the clearing community in terms of structure and life strategy stands apart from its counterpart of virgin forest at the same elevation, allowing interpretation of the different life history and ecomorphological sets recorded as indicators of disturbance.

AB  - Over the years, various psychologists have issued calls for greater attention to a science of positive psychology, which focuses on studying conditions that promote optimal human and societal development. Recent calls (e.g., McCullough and Snyder, 2000; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) have furthered interest in studies of the nature and determinants of the good life. Such a science, along with the creation of prevention and intervention programs informed by the expanded scientific framework, is expected to improve the quality of life for all individuals, not just individuals who are at risk or who already demonstrate psychopathological conditions. To contrast with the previous emphasis on psychopathology, the development of a positive psychology requires constructs and measures that reflect the full range of human functioning, incorporating indicators of high levels of wellness as well as psychopathological functioning. This article discusses one such construct, life satisfaction, that has been studied extensively in adulthood (see Diener et al., 1999), but which has only recently gained attention with children and adolescents (see Bender, 1997; Huebner, 1997). This article reviews life satisfaction assessment research with children and adolescents, specifically with regard to construct validity. In doing so, the following areas are addressed: models of life satisfaction; convergent validity; discriminant validity; relationships with other well-being measures; relationships with external, environmental circumstances; relationships with demographic variables; cultural factors; group differences on life satisfaction measures; predictive relationships; and stability of life satisfaction reports. Conclusions regarding the validity of the life satisfaction construct are formulated. Recommendations for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Patterns of vegetation across Great Britain (GB) between 1990 and 1998 were quantified based on an analysis of plant species data from a total of 9596 fixed plots. Plots were established on a stratified random basis within 501 1 km sample squares located as part of the Countryside Survey of GB. Results are primarily conveyed in terms of a classification of national land-cover into 22 mutually exclusive Broad Habitat types. Each of the fixed vegetation plots could be assigned to the Broad Habitat in which they were located in either year. Two types of analysis are reported, both based on changes in plant species composition within monitoring plots. The first examined turnover and net change between Broad Habitat types. The second quantified more subtle changes that had occurred within each Broad Habitat using a series of condition measures that summarized multivariate plant species data as a single scalar value for each plot at each time. There are major difficulties in using uncontrolled, large-scale surveillance data to unravel causal linkages and no attempt was made to quantitatively partition variation among competing causes. However, it was clear that results were broadly consistent with environmental drivers known to have operated prior to and during the survey interval. Large-scale vegetation changes could be summarized in terms of shifts along gradients of substrate fertility and disturbance. Changes implied increased nutrient availability across upland and lowland ecosystems while, in lowland landscapes, linear features and small biotope fragments saw a marked shift to species compositions associated with greater shade and less disturbance.

AB  - The landscape of the intermountain west has changed dramatically in the last 150 years, particularly in the state of Washington, where over half the native shrubsteppe ecosystem has been converted to agricultural lands, resulting in a fragmented landscape with few extensive tracts of shrubsteppe. We examined the historical and current distribution of shrubsteppe on different soil types in eastern Washington, and we censused bird communities at 78 sites in shrubsteppe from 1991 to 1993. We compared abundance of species among soil types and range conditions and developed models of species occurrence using site-specific vegetation and landscape variables. The pattern of shrubsteppe conversion has resulted in a disproportionate loss of deep soil communities. Eight bird species showed strong relationships with soil type and three with range condition. These associations likely resulted from the influence of soil type and range history on the vegetation of these communities. Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri) and Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) reached their highest abundances in deep, loamy soils, whereas Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) were most abundant in deep, sandy soils. Sage Sparrows occurred more frequently in landscapes dominated by shrubsteppe, indicating a negative relationship with fragmentation. Our results suggest that fragmentation of shrubsteppe and the pattern of agricultural conversion among soil types have had detrimental effects on numerous shrubsteppe species. The landscape for species with an affinity for deep, loamy soil communities has changed considerably more than the overall loss of shrubsteppe would indicate. Conservation practices that emphasize retention of shrubsteppe communities on deep soils and that reduce further fragmentation will be critical to the maintenance of avian biological diversity in this system.

AB  - The proportion of organic matter and mineral composition are important factors determining the formation and type of non-extractable residues (NERs) of pesticides in soil. In this study, we investigated the enantioselectivity in degradation and NER formation of the chiral fungicide metalaxyl in soil particle size fractions (silt and clay). Microbial and extracellular enzyme activities during these processes were monitored in incubation of silt and clay samples isolated from sterilized and non-sterilized soil samples collected from a long-term agricultural field experimental site in Ultuna, Sweden. The temporal influence on the fate of the fungicide was noted by short-term (10-d) and long-term (92-d) incubations. Besides the acquisition of quantitative data with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), stereoselective analyses were performed with chiral GC/MS. Quantitative results pointed to a higher metabolism rate of the pesticide through microbial activity than through extracellular enzyme activity. This was also confirmed by the enantioselective depletion of R-metalaxyl and the subsequent formation of R-metalaxyl acid in microbially active samples from non-sterilized soil. The silt fraction containing a high amount of organic matter exhibited a significant hydrolyzable proportion of metalaxyl NERs that was releasable under alkaline conditions. On the contrary, the clay fraction showed an enhanced affinity for covalently bound residues. Based on our results, we recommend differentiating between reversibly and irreversibly bound proportions of pesticides in persistence and environmental risk assessment because the reversible fraction contained potentially bioavailable amounts of residues that may be released under natural conditions.

In this study, the primary controlling mechanism of the groundwater chemistry evolution for the Carboniferous groundwater in the Huaibei coalfield, North China was proposed based on the hydrogeochemical indicators combining with multiple isotope tracers. The diversity of hydrochemical types indicates the complexity of the hydrogeochemical environment in the groundwater, which is recharged by precipitation infiltration with minimal evaporation according to the distributions of delta D and delta O-18. Additionally, ion correlation analysis suggests that minerals dissolution and cation exchange between Na+ and Ca2+ are the dominant processes within that groundwater. The hydrochemical and delta C-13(DIC) characteristics of the groundwater demonstrate that HCO3- is mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate minerals and soil CO2, and the proportion of the latter is believed to be dominated by the hydrogeologic conditions. Similarly, the values of SO42- and delta S-34(SO4) indicate that a small portion of SO42- in the groundwater in the northern part originates from the meteoric precipitation, while it is mainly derived from the dissolution of gypsum in the southern part. Furthermore, mining activities also alter the groundwater level and flow conditions through pumping and drainage, which enhances the interaction between groundwater and aquifer lithologies, thereby affects the hydrogeochemical processes. The findings of this work are of great significance for promoting the safe exploitation of deep coal resources and the sustainable utilization of groundwater in the Huaibei coalfield, as well as the most of other coalfields in North China.

AB  - Biotic global change agents, such as non-native plants ('weeds'), non-native earthworms ('worms'), and overabundant herbivores (white-tailed 'deer'), can be major stressors in the forest understory. The status and relationships among these global change stressors across large spatial extents and under naturally varying conditions are poorly understood. Here, through an observational study using a network of U.S. National Park Service forest health monitoring plots (n = 350) from eight parks in seven northeastern states, we modeled causal pathways among global change stressors through model selection in a structural equation (SEM) framework. Weeds, worms, and, deer were common across all parks in the study-46% of plots had non-native plants, 42% of plots had evidence of earthworms, and all parks had plots with high deer browse damage. All biotic global change stressors were significantly and positively correlated with one another (all Spearman rank correlations >= 0.44). Consequently, 28% of plots had a combination of earthworms absent, low deer browse, and no non-native plants, and 29% of plots included earthworms, non-native plants, and moderate or greater browse damage. Through SEM, we found strong support for pathways among global change stressors, e.g., deer browse positively influenced earthworm presence and both deer and earthworms promoted non-native plants. Warmer air temperatures and higher soil pH also facilitated non-natives. This research highlights the tremendous multipronged management challenge for areas already experiencing the combined effects of weeds, worms, and deer and the future vulnerability of other areas as temperatures warm and conditions become more amenable to biotic global change stressors.

AB  - AimsThe encroachment of tree and shrub species in high mountains is an increasing worldwide phenomenon, which is expected to dramatically alter high-mountain ecosystems and their functioning. Moreover it indicates in some cases a reforestation process, which will result in important ecological and social benefits, including carbon sequestration and protection against landslides. We therefore examined the spatial extent of forest growth and shrub encroachment mainly of birch (Betula litwinowii) in the sub-alpine belt of the Central Greater Caucasus between 1987 and 2010 and its relation to topographic site conditions.
   LocationKazbegi district, Central Greater Caucasus, Georgia.
   MethodsWe analysed 155 vegetation releves sampled in 2009, 2011 and 2015, mainly derived from the Caucasus Vegetation Database, to obtain information about topographic site conditions and structure of B.litwinowii stands. B.litwinowii forest growth was assessed by digitizing the forest outlines from aerial and space-borne imagery (1987, 2005 and 2010). To identify areas of B.litwinowii encroachment as an indicator for different encroachment stages, we modelled the tree and shrub cover using the Random Forest algorithm.
   ResultsWe found four types of B.litwinowii stands, characterized by different tree and shrub coverage (initial Bromus variegatus-Betula litwinowii encroachment indicating the first stage of succession, Aconitum nasutum-Betula litwinowii forest, Rubus idaeus-Betula litwinowii forest and Rhododendron caucasicum-Betula litwinowii tree line scrubs). B.litwinowii forest increased 25% compared to 1987 mainly in an uphill direction. Furthermore the modelled tree and shrub cover (R-2=.69) could be related to the four vegetation types.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate a recent trend towards shrub encroachment and consequently reforestation in the Kazbegi region.

AB  - Boric acid and sodium borates have been considered as being "toxic to reproduction and development", following results of animal studies with high doses. Experimentally, a NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) of 17.5 mg B/kg-bw/day has been identified for the (male) reproductive effects of boron in a multigeneration study of rats, and a NOAEL for the developmental effects in rats was identified at 9.6 mg B/kg-bw/day. These values are being taken as the basis of current EU safety assessments. The present study was conducted to investigate the reproductive effects of boron exposure in workers employed in boric acid production plant in BandA +/- rma, Turkey. In order to characterize the external and internal boron exposures, boron was determined in biological samples (blood, urine, semen), in workplace air, in food, and in water sources. Unfavorable effects of boron exposure on the reproductive toxicity indicators (concentration, motility, morphology of the sperm cells and blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone) were not observed. The mean calculated daily boron exposure (DBE) of the highly exposed group was 14.45 +/- A 6.57 (3.32-35.62) mg/day. These human exposures represent worst-case exposure conditions to boric acid/borates in Turkey. These exposure levels are considerably lower than exposures, which have previously led to reproductive effects in experimental animals. In conclusion, this means that dose levels of boron associated with developmental and reproductive toxic effects in animals are by far not reachable for humans under conditions of normal handling and use.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to help to inform policy development for the Australian rangelands, and provide a proof of concept for application of a multi-criteria analysis approach to assessment of competing resource use at continental scale. The study aimed to identify and locate key natural resource and agricultural production assets in the rangelands, define a number of measures of potentially threatening processes, and use a multi-criteria approach to identify areas where threatening processes, agricultural production problems, or valuable natural resources coincided. The analysis used 35 readily available, continental spatial data layers at 5-km pixel resolution ranked from 1 (low) to 5 (high) under three themed groupings: natural resource base, production base, and threatening processes. These measures were aggregated into composite indicators to define attributes such as environmental sensitivity and total grazing pressure. The composites were then compared in a two-way analysis to explore particular interactions between threatening processes such as pastoralism and mining, and the condition of production and natural resource assets. These interactions were defined as "tensions" for purposes of this analysis. Example "tensions" included the association of high grazing intensity with areas of high environmental sensitivity, indicating a risk of land degradation under adverse climatic conditions. A summary of patterns of tension was obtained by extracting area proportions of high-tension classes for selected Natural Heritage Trust Regions, which are a basis for Australian Government funding of improved environmental management. The study provides a basis for further examination of trade-offs in the use of natural assets, opportunities for improved productivity and sustainability, and social and economic implications.

AB  - Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) can be used as an indicator to schedule greenhouse irrigation. VPD can be estimated as a function of relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T). The objective of this work was to analyze spatial variation in VPD as an indicator of water stress influenced by concentration of water vapor and intensity of near infrared (NIR). The study was carried out in an empty three-span sawtooth greenhouse with natural ventilation under the local climate in Montecillo, Mexico; these findings established a base value to analyze greenhouse field conditions prior to the influence from a crop. The experimental phase consisted of recording data (3 February 2019-24 February 2019) on temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, which were used for developing a model in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Then, this model was used to estimate VPD, considering changes in mass fraction of water vapor and the intensity of NIR. Scenarios with 50, 70, and 90% external RH were evaluated. It was found that without a crop, temperature was not affected by the variation in the mass fraction of water vapor and the intensity of NIR in the simulated scenarios, each of which generated a thermal gradient within the range of 4 degrees C. When considering the scenario of 90% external RH, we found the best VPD range along the greenhouse (2-3 kPa) that would be a favorable field condition for crops. Differences between VPD with and without a crop can be used to estimate the water quantity needs for crop growth based on the climate variables examined in this study, where higher VPD values require more water for irrigation.

AB  - Halyomorpha halys is an Asian pentatomid that has recently invaded several countries worldwide, where it has become a severe pest. Classical biological control focused on the scelionid egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus appears to be the most promising long-term solution. However, non-target risks need to be included in cost/benefit analyses. Physiological host range tests were conducted by offering T. japonicus females a single hemipteran egg for short (2 h) and long (24 h) exposure periods, and recording the behavior and parasitization acceptance/success during the short exposures. Of the 16 different hemipteran species tested in no-choice experiments, 9 species were accepted and suitable for T. japonicus development. Among pentatomids, Palomena prasina and Rhaphigaster nebulosa were accepted at rates comparable to H. halys, while species accepted at lower rates included Acrosternum heegeri, Carpocoris mediterraneus, C. purpeiripennis, Dolycoris baccarum, Piezodorus lituratus and Peribalus strictus. The other 7 hemipterans tested, including two coreids and one reduviid, were never parasitized. The use of a short-term exposure of 2 h revealed no differences with the 24-h exposure that has been widely used in physiological host range testing. Thus, T. japonicus oligophagy observed in other studies was confirmed by using our extremely simplified laboratory protocol. Moreover, the host egg morphology was correlated with the acceptance rates, permitting us to propose a new predictive approach for non-target studies. However, further research with more complex experimental designs that account for environmental conditions is needed to confirm laboratory predictions of host specificity under actual field conditions.

AB  - The paper presents a thermo-ecological analysis of a liquefied natural gas regasification system equipped with a Stirling engine. The proposed system includes an alpha configuration machine, working as a cold engine with the heat sink acting as the evaporator for the LNG and the upper heat source being at ambient temperature (sea water) or moderately higher. The engines are modelled using two approaches developed by the authors, that is a CFD model and a second-order one-dimensional model. First a small engine is modelled by both CFD and the second order approach to compare results and after confirming their similarity, due to a lower computational cost a larger machine is modelled with the second order model. Due to the heat transfer conditions being crucial for a Stirling cycle machine's performance, those are investigated. It is shown that the internal, convective heat transfer coefficients are much higher in cryogenic conditions than in typical ones. The results of engine assessment are used for the Thermoecological cost (TEC) analysis. Within the thermo-ecological analysis, the influence of selected parameters is demonstrated. Additionally the TEC of electricity generated in cold power plant is presented for different configurations. In the case of analysed Stirling systems savings of natural gas reach the level of only 0.5%. However, when TEC of electricity is calculated, the savings are at the level of 72%. The proposed theoretical investigations are the base for the acquisition of new knowledge in the field of possible ways of converting cryogenic exergy of LNG into electricity and optimization of this cycle with strong focus on ecological effects, including the TEC.

AB  - The capacity for ascidians to inhabit coastal sea floor worldwide relies on their peculiar tolerance to environmental variables and pollution, which is considered, together with high levels of genetic diversity, among the main drivers of their invasive potential. In spite of the continued interest in the genetics of invasive species, little attention has been paid toward the microevolutionary processes that drive structure and fate of ascidian populations over time under chemically polluted conditions. Understanding the interplay between environmental and population dynamics is critical to predict the biodiversity of marine coastal ecosystems. In the present study, a local population of the ascidian Ciona robusta living in the Fusaro Lagoon has been monitored over a 13-month period of sampling. Physico-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, heavy metals), genetic composition (microsatellites, ITS-2), abundance and biomass (wet and dry weight) were assessed with the aim to infer fine-scale temporal variation of population structure with respect to rapid environmental change. Analysis of biomass showed that C. robusta is highly sensitive to salinity and oxygen concentrations. Further, genetic analysis suggested a highly dynamic population structure, likely due to the strong clustering of temporal samples and distinct responses to environmental conditions, including bio-accumulation of heavy metals. Here, we hypothesize that rapid variation in allele frequencies of neutral markers in C. robusta populations may increase the ability of the species to colonize habitats that are subject to strong variation and are under heavy human pressure.

AB  - Endotherms foraging at temperatures outside of their thermal neutral zone (TNZ) pay an increased energetic cost. We asked if thermally-induced changes in foraging costs influence quitting harvest rate (QHR) of mice. We predicted that mice foraging during the winter would have a higher QHR in more costly colder conditions. We conducted our study with wild caught Peromyscus leucopus in an enclosure located in West Terre Haute, Indiana. We assayed changes in QHR using the forager's giving up density (GUD), which is the amount of uneaten seeds reaming in a tray after foraging activity. Each night from January 12th to March 13th, we assigned 4 trays as "cold trays" (at ambient temperature), and 4 trays as "hot trays" (trays with a ceramic heat element that increased the temperatures of feeding trays ca. 10-15 C). GUDs (and therfore QHRs) increased as a function of decreasing ambient temperature. Furthermore there was an interaction between tray temperature and ambient temperature; namely, on cool nights mice had lower GUDs in the "hot trays", but on warm nights mice had lower GUDs in the "cold trays". The TNZ for P. leucopus actively foraging during winter may be closer to the environmental average temperature than typically measured in the laboratory. Overall, these results support the idea that QHR is related to an animal's foraging in thermally challenged conditions. We present a unique way of measuring an animal's TNZ in the field using behavioral indicators. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Freshwater habitats are under stress from agricultural land use, most notably the influx of neonicotinoid pesticides and increased nutrient pressure from fertilizer. Traditional studies investigating the effects of stressors on freshwater systems are often limited to a narrow range of taxa, depending heavily on morphological expertise. Additionally, disentanglement of multiple simultaneous stressors can be difficult in field studies, whereas controlled laboratory conditions do not accurately reflect natural conditions and food webs. To overcome these drawbacks, we investigated the impacts of two agricultural stressors (the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid and fertilizer) in full-factorial design in a semi-natural research site, using environmental DNA sampling to study three different taxonomic groups representing three trophic levels: bacteria (decomposers), phytoplankton (primary producers), and chironomids (consumers). The results show considerable impact of both stressors across trophic levels, with an additive effect of fertilizer and thiacloprid on community composition at all levels. These findings suggest that agricultural stressors affect the entire food web, either directly or through cascade reactions. They are also consistent with morphological assessments that were performed in the same study site, even at a lower number of replicates. The study presented shows that the use of multimarker environmental DNA provides a more comprehensive assessment of stressor impacts across multiple trophic levels, at a higher taxonomic resolution than traditional surveys. Additionally, many putative novel bioindicators for both agricultural stressors were discovered. We encourage further investigations into stressors impacts at different trophic levels, which will lead to more effective monitoring and management of freshwater systems.

AB  - Herbicide drift may cause adverse effects on natural and seminatural plant communities, and it has been debated whether the current ecological risk assessments are adequate to protect nontarget terrestrial plant species. In the present study, 9 nontarget terrestrial plant species with different lifespans (3 annual/6 perennial) belonging to 6 different plant families were exposed to 4 herbicides with different modes of action at the vegetative (6-8 leaf) and reproductive (bud) stages separately. The plant tests were conducted under controlled conditions in 2 greenhouses, 1 located in Denmark and 1 in Canada. For both growth stages, effects were recorded on vegetative (above-ground biomass 3 wk after treatment) and reproductive endpoints (number and germinability of seeds). In most cases, responses following exposure at the juvenile stage were greater than responses following exposure at the reproductive stage. For the combinations of herbicides and plant species included in the present study, we found that the sensitivities of vegetative and reproductive endpoints were equal, or else vegetative endpoints were more sensitive than reproductive endpoints. We also found that annual species were more sensitive than perennial species. The overall conclusions cover many different response patterns, and it is evident that some effects may not be found in the currently used standard tests. Generally, more pronounced effects were obtained in Denmark compared with Canada, highlighting the fact that even under standardized test conditions and following common guidelines, several uncontrollable factors can still induce variable results.

AB  - 1. Nutrient over-enrichment increasingly threatens global water resources. Stressor-response studies specifically designed to identify levels of nutrients strongly associated with undesirable ecological conditions are needed to inform numeric nutrient criteria that protect inland waters.
   2. Diatoms are important components of aquatic life, which support higher trophic levels and are sensitive to nutrient enrichment. We tested a framework that relies on stressor-response modelling of phosphorus (P) enrichment and stream diatom assemblages across many field locations, multiple years and seasons within years, and under controlled experimental conditions to inform nutrient criteria development.
   3. Diatom species composition was nonlinearly correlated with total phosphorus (TP) throughout the 2-year field study. This occurred despite temporal shifts in species composition between two hydrologically distinct years and over eight seasons.
   4. Species assemblages on rocks transplanted from a low P stream to mesocosms representing a P enrichment gradient (8, 20 and 100 mu g/L) shifted into two groups over time. Species composition on rocks in low (20 mu g/L) and high (100 mu g/L) P mesocosms was consistent with assemblages at P-enriched field sites, whereas rocks in control (8 mu g/L) mesocosms had significantly different species composition, consistent with low P field sites. Species composition on rocks transplanted from high P streams did not shift as dramatically and were not significantly different after exposure to different P treatments in mesocosms.
   5. Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis identified synchronous declines in several diatom species that culminated in assemblage thresholds associated with TP concentrations >20 and 25 mu g/L for 2006 and 2007 respectively.

AB  - To understand how species will respond to environmental changes, it is important to know how those changes will affect the ecological stress that animals experience. Time constraints can be used as indicators of ecological stress. Here we test whether time constraints can help us understand group sizes, distribution patterns, and community sizes of forest guenons (Cercopithecus/Allochrocebus). Forest guenons typically live in small to medium sized one-male-multifemale groups and often live in communities with multiple forest guenon species. We developed a time-budget model using published data on time budgets, diets, body sizes, climate, and group sizes to predict maximum ecologically tolerable group and community sizes of forest guenons across 202 sub-Saharan African locations. The model correctly predicted presence/absence at 83% of these locations. Feeding-foraging time (an indicator of competition) limited group sizes, while resting and moving time constraints shaped guenon biogeography. Predicted group sizes were greater than observed group sizes but comparable to community sizes, suggesting community sizes are set by competition among guenon individuals irrespective of species. We conclude that time constraints and intraspecific competition are unlikely to be the main determinants of relatively small group sizes in forest guenons. Body mass was negatively correlated with moving time, which may give larger bodied species an advantage over smaller bodied species under future conditions when greater fragmentation of forests is likely to lead to increased moving time. Resting time heavily depended on leaf consumption and is likely to increase under future climatic conditions when leaf quality is expected to decrease.

AB  - Like its British prototype (Biological Monitoring Working Party score system), the Polish benthic invertebrate-based BMWP-PL index is commonly regarded as an indicator of river water quality. This interpretation of the index has been verified in a study of the gravel-bed Biaa River. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at 10 sites and compared in one channelized and one unmanaged cross-section per site. The resulting taxa richness and BMWP-PL index scores were compared with water quality and physical habitat characteristics in the cross-sections. Channelized and unmanaged cross-sections clearly differed in their physical habitat conditions, and water quality characteristics mostly varied in the downstream direction. Particular cross-sections hosted between 3 and 26 invertebrate taxa, with the respective BMWP-PL scores indicating the water in the surveyed cross-sections varied between high and poor quality. However, the BMWP-PL scores were unrelated to physicochemical characteristics of the river water, which consistently pointed to high water quality. Instead, the scores were significantly related to several physical habitat variables, with the number of low-flow channels in a cross-section explaining the largest proportion of the variance in the index values. The relationship of the scores with the complexity of flow pattern in the river and a lack of their dependence on physicochemical water characteristics show that the BMWP-PL index should not be regarded as an indicator of water quality but rather as an indicator of the ecological status of rivers, dependent both on their hydromorphological and water-quality characteristics.

AB  - This study was performed to verify whether the exchange of the fuel used in the boilers of a crude oil refinery located in Cubatao (SE Brazil) would result in alterations on gas exchange, growth and leaf injuries in saplings of Psidium guajava 'Paluma'. The purpose of the refinery was to reduce the SO2 emission, but using natural gas as fuel could increase the concentrations of O-3 precursors in the atmosphere. Thus a biomonitoring was performed with a native species sensitive to O-3. The plants were exposed in five areas (CM1, CM5, CEPEMA, Centro, and RP) at different distances to the refinery, both before and after the fuel exchange. We performed six exposures under environmental conditions, with length of ca. 90 days each. With the utilization of natural gas, the saplings presented reductions in carbon assimilation rate under saturating light conditions (Asat, mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and the stomatal conductance (gs, mol H2O m(-2) s(-1)), and increase in height, number of leaves, and dry mass of leaves and shoots. There were also reductions in root dry mass and in the root/shoot ratio. The saplings also presented O-3-induced leaf injuries. The responses of P. guajava 'Paluma' were altered after the fuel exchange as a result of a new combination of pollutants in the atmosphere. The fuel exchange has not resulted in environmental benefit to the surrounding forest; it has only altered the contamination profile of the region. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diatom-based bioassessment in wetlands requires quantitative characterization of spatial and temporal variability of the diatom assemblages within each wetland. The purpose of this study was to examine surface-sediment diatom distributional patterns in a wetland to determine how best to sample these systems to capture spatial variability in the assemblage. Diatoms and environmental conditions were characterized from 29 sampling points within a wetland in the floodplain of the Columbia River, Oregon, USA. A total of 159 diatom taxa were identified in the surface-sediment samples. Species richness was high at each sampling point (median: 42, range: 23-57), and relative abundances of common taxa varied between 15 and 39% throughout the wetland. Assemblages contained taxa with both benthic (e.g., Staurosira construens, Nitzschia palea, Fragilaria capucina, Achnanthidium minutissimum) and planktonic (e.g., Aulacoseira granulata and Tabellaria spp.) preferences. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) techniques detected differences in the low marsh and upper marsh sediment diatom assemblages. Geostatistical analysis showed spatial autocorrelation of the diatom assemblage in the wetland, measured as sernivariance and Moran's I. A simulation procedure indicated that changes in diatom species richness stabilized after approximately five samples were composited. Our results suggest that the wetland surface sediment diatom assemblage is heterogeneous and that hydrologic gradients may be an important structuring force. Diatom-based bioassessment has the potential to be a useful tool in assessing wetland environmental conditions; however, the shallow nature and complex hydrology of these systems require careful sampling design to adequately characterize the diatom assemblage.

AB  - Leaf breakdown, a key functional process, was examined in 3 glacial streams, 3 alpine springbrooks, and a rock-glacier stream in the Swiss Alps. Environmental conditions within each stream type were expected to significantly affect leaf breakdown rates among streams. Individual leaf packs (7 g fresh mass) of alder (Alnus viridis) were immersed in each stream and replicate samples were collected at periodic intervals over 49 d. Collected leaves were assessed for N and P, ergosterol (a measure of fungal biomass), % lignin (an indicator of recalcitrance), and aquatic macroinvertebrates. Leaf breakdown was faster in the springbrooks (k = -0.0085) and rock-glacier stream (k = -0.0073) than in the glacial streams (k = -0.0027) when expressed in terms of time. However, leaf breakdown rates based on degree days were similar among streams, ranging from k -0.0011 to -0.0020. Leaf P levels increased over time in all sites, and reflected respective increases in ergosterol. Leaf ergosterol levels increased from 62 mu g/g to similar to 300-500 mu g/g leaf dry mass during the study, and were highest in the springbrooks and rock-glacier stream. The % lignin of leaves displayed a similar pattern as breakdown rates, reaching 20 (glacial streams) to 30% (springbrooks) leaf dry mass by day 49. Chironomids dominated leaf packs in glacial streams, whereas leaf packs in springbrooks were additionally colonized by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. We conclude that differences in environmental conditions (interaction between abiotic and biotic properties) strongly influence ecosystem functioning, as inferred from leaf breakdown characteristics, among alpine streams.

AB  - The "quotient method" (QM), a pesticide risk-assessment model used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,, assumes that the expected exposure concentration of: a contaminant is a function of application rate immediately after pesticide application. The QM does not take into account weather conditions (eg, rainfall) at the time of spray. We used gray-tailed voles (Microtus canicaudus) as an experimental model species to field-test this assumption of the QM by simulating a 0.25-cm rainfall. In June 1999, we placed voles into 16, 0.2-ha enclosures planted with a mixture of pasture grasses. In early August, we applied 2.44 kg/ha of the insecticide Guthion 2S (azinphos-methyl) in four treatments; a dry control, a wet control ("rain"),a dry treatment (sprayed with Guthion 2S, no "rain"), and a wet treatment (sprayed with Guthion 2S and "rain" within 24 h). We used four replicate populations for each treatment. Survival rates of male voles in dry-treatment enclosures declined throughout the rest of study following pesticide application, while male survival rates displayed short-term increases in other treatments. Rainfall improved male survival and may have mitigated the adverse effects of Guthion 2S. We also detected significant time X treatment interactions on population size and population growth rates of voles. Guthion 2S treatment depressed population size and growth rate in the dry treatment; however, rainfall may have reduced the risk of Guthion 2S to voles. The interaction between rainfall and Guthion 2S application resulted in a deviation from the risk predicted by the QM.

AB  - The spatial variation of nitrogen availability, mineralization, and immobilization was studied in heavily grazed areas of the Larrea divaricata and Stipa spp. steppe in northern Patagonia in order to identify the interactions between the nitrogen pool and vegetation. For this purpose, four of the,nest predominant types of vegetation patches and neighboring bare soil patches were selected for study. Soil samples were taken, during 1 year, in the external crown of each patch type, and inorganic N, in situ mineralization, and N in microbial biomass were analyzed. Nitrogen stores in the soil were related to canopy characteristics. Soil beneath undisturbed patches of vegetation held higher stores of available N and N retained in microbial biomass than bare soil. Small patches with incipient vegetation cover represented an intermediate situation between undisturbed patches and bare soil. In situ N mineralization rates were low, and no significant differences were detected among patches. This was attributed to the limiting water conditions prevailing during the study. Labile N retained in microbial biomass was an important source of N readily mineralizable in the soil of undisturbed vegetated patches, under optimal laboratory conditions of soil temperature and moisture. This characteristic makes undisturbed patches and incipient vegetated patches key structures in the dynamics of these ecosystems. Information on future structural and functional changes that may operate under different environmental and managerial scenarios could be inferred from these trends between N availability and vegetation dynamics. The N vegetation trends can also be used for monitoring purposes, as indicators of the state of conservation of these ecosystems.

AB  - A detailed, multi-disciplinary investigation of the Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone (ABFZ) was carried out in the austral autumn of 2004. Both satellite remote monitoring and hydrographic observations demonstrate an unusually stable state of affairs before and during this survey, suggesting that it was representative of the frontal system during undisturbed - or average - conditions at the time. Sea surface temperatures from satellite were mirrored by distributions of near surface salinities and nutrients. Upwelled water was Eastern South Atlantic Central Water (ESACW) at the two southern transects, and thermocline water in the north. Between the thermocline and the level of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIM, South Atlantic Central Waters (SACW) were oxygen-deficient and nutrient-rich along the two northern transects, and also within gyral disturbances at the offshore parts of the southern transects. In the southwest ESACW occurred, and Angola Current water covered the offshore and upper part of the northernmost transect. Seaward of the upwelling front the depth of the thermo- and halocline decreased toward the north, and their vertical gradients increased. The predominant meridional geostrophic flow was northward, except for the area within and north of the ABFZ. Isopleths indicate a poleward undercurrent along the shelf edge. This undercurrent was shallow at the two northern transects, and at shelf-edge depth in the south. The undercurrent's direction stayed constant during the cruise and transported oxygen-deficient, nutrient-rich SACW as well as tropical fish larvae - adapted to low oxygen conditions - southwards to at least 22 degrees S. This is in contrast to earlier theories of spawning here.
   Geostrophy and distribution patterns of indicator species indicate transport offshore within and along the ABFZ. Except for the undercurrent and gyral disturbances, the offshore ABFZ separates the tropical fish larval community from temperate and Southern Ocean ones. These gyral disturbances had an anticyclonic surface expression, and on the basis of water mass, nutrients, and biological composition they were most likely spawned from the undercurrent. A comparison with earlier surveys made during a Benguela Nino showed that the ABFZ responded hydrographically and faunistically to that warm event by a southward displacement of at least four degrees of latitude and the intrusion of tropical, shallow-living fish larvae into Namibian waters. Historical abundance data of fish larvae for species of commercial importance were in part overestimates, and some historical cumulative distributions seem to have been mistaken for "higher abundances" in the past. When compared with our autumnal data, historical data do not indicate any decadal decline. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Solid waste transfer stations (SWTS) play an essential role in the municipal waste management system as the interface between the collection and waste transportation to the final disposal. SWTS are often not good conditions in residential areas and may have environmental pollution and public complaints from citizens. Environmental impacts assessment (EIA) is a solution to minimize the environmental impact of SWTS and provide a solution to the urban manager and planners. The rapid impact assessment matrix (RIAM) was conducted in this research to evaluate the impacts of the four various options defined for SWTS in Ardabil city. These options include SWTS in enclosed space and with the construction of green space and without it (option 1 and 2), SWTS in open space with the establishment of green space (option 3), and without the establishment of green space (option 4) (the current condition of the SWTS). For a project to be consistent with sustainability principles, should be considered aspects of sustainability such as social, economic, and environmental. This paper applies a mathematical model of sustainability based on the obtained results from the RIAM analysis to determine whether the options are potentially sustainable or unsustainable and calculate the level and nature of sustainability. By results (option 1), the priority for establishing transfer stations, compared to other options, has the highest score (0.068) regarding sustainability and the adverse environmental impacts. However, the current environmental status of Ardabil SWTS (option 4) has the lowest score (- 0.215) was found to be the last priority in the establishment of SWTS.

AB  - Purpose of Review Society is concerned about the long-term condition of the forests. Although a clear definition of forest health is still missing, to evaluate forest health, monitoring efforts in the past 40 years have concentrated on the assessment of tree vitality, trying to estimate tree photosynthesis rates and productivity. Used in monitoring forest decline in Central Europe since the 1980s, crown foliage transparency has been commonly believed to be the best indicator of tree condition in relation to air pollution, although annual variations appear more closely related to water stress. Although crown transparency is not a good indicator of tree photosynthesis rates, defoliation is still one of the most used indicators of tree vitality. Tree rings have been often used as indicators of past productivity. However, long-term tree growth trends are difficult to interpret because of sampling bias, and ring width patterns do not provide any information about tree physiological processes. Recent Findings In the past two decades, tree-ring stable isotopes have been used not only to reconstruct the impact of past climatic events, such as drought, but also in the study of forest decline induced by air pollution episodes, and other natural disturbances and environmental stress, such as pest outbreaks and wildfires. They have proven to be useful tools for understanding physiological processes and tree response to such stress factors. Tree-ring stable isotopes integrate crown transpiration rates and photosynthesis rates and may enhance our understanding of tree vitality. They are promising indicators of tree vitality. We call for the use of tree-ring stable isotopes in future monitoring programmes.

AB  - 1. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is hypothesized to be a useful predictor of population canalization, especially for organisms at risk from environmental change.
   2. Identification of traits that meet statistical criteria as FA measures remains a challenge.
   3. Here, a laboratory experiment subjected immature butterflies (Vanessa cardui) to diet and temperature conditions of varying stress levels. Variation in dietary macronutrient ratio (protein: carbohydrate) and rearing temperature (optimal: 25 degrees C; elevated: 32 degrees C) was introduced as stressors. Temperature and nutrition are key variables influencing ectotherm growth and fitness and so are likely to be important stressors that influence FA.
   4. Individuals subjected to stressful conditions were predicted to show elevated FA of three wing size traits, as well as increased mortality and decreased adult body size.
   5. Trait FA did not vary across treatments. Instead, treatment levels impacted viability: The combined incidence of pupal death and expression of significant wing malformations increased in treatment levels designated as stressful. Variation in adult dry mass also reflected predicted stress levels. Results suggest that individuals predicted to display increased FA either died or displayed gross developmental aberrations.
   6. This experiment illustrates important constraints on the investigation of FA, including selection of appropriate traits and identification of appropriate levels of stressors to avoid elevated mortality. The latter concern brings into question the utility of FA as an indicator of stress in vulnerable, natural populations, where stress levels cannot be controlled, and mortality and fitness effects are often not quantifiable.

AB  - Soil aggregate stability (SAS) is an indicator for soil condition and is greatly influenced by land use or land cover (LULC) type and other soil and environmental attributes. This study investigated the soil aggregate-size distribution, SAS, aggregate-associated organic carbon (AAOC) and the relative importance of factors affecting SAS and AAOC. Based on conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, soil aggregate samples were collected from the "A" horizon and wet sieved into large macroaggregates (>2.0 mm), small macroaggregates (0.25-2.0 mm), microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) and mineral fraction (<0.053 mm). The large macroaggregates accounted for 86% to 93% of the total aggregates under all LULC types except under dry land (64%) and paddy land (35%). The SAS under different LULC decreased in the order fir > shrubland > natural grassland > orchard > blue pine > broadleaf > mixed conifer > dry land > paddy land. The AAOC of the large macroaggregates constituted for 76%-90% of the total AAOC under all LULC types except under dry land (65%) and paddy land (38%). While SAS was largely influenced by the AAOC of small macroaggregates, microaggregates and large macroaggregates and LULC type, the AAOC of different aggregate fractions was mostly affected by LULC type, altitude and slope. SAS did not exhibit any significant relationship with the AAOC of different aggregate fractions under the natural LULC types but showed a strong relationship under the agricultural land indicating that AAOC is more critical for SAS under the agricultural land than under the natural LULC.

AB  - The restoration of grasslands is a key management practice that supports biodiversity across Europe. On species poor grasslands and ex-arable fields, the establishment of plant species is often limited by the availability of habitat niches, in particular space to germinate. We investigated the impacts of full inversion tillage and its interaction with site conditions and functional traits on the abundance of 51 plant species sown into a 2 ha exarablesite in Poland. Soils of the donor site were characterized by high levels of heterogeneity in terms of water content and plant availability of N, P and K. One year after sowing the cover of species typical of semi-natural grasslands was significantly higher on the tilled plots than on the non-tilled plots. However, in the case of widespread generalist species the tillage of soil resulted in no significant effect on their establishing percentage cover. The establishment of plants on the tilled area was more successful where soils were relatively rich in mineral N. It was also more successful for species with low Ellenberg's N values. Species indicative of moist soil established poorly where the soil was tilled. This study has clear implications for the applied restoration of grasslands, demonstrating a vital role of soil tillage to promote the establishment of species typical of seminatural grasslands. This is particularly important where seed mixtures may contain both desirable and undesirable competitive species that would disproportionately benefit from the absence of tillage management.

AB  - The eutrophication of sediments underlying marine fish farms is one of the major environmental concerns of the industry and regulatory agencies. In this study, a mechanistic model of sediment geochemistry was developed to: (1) determine maximum organic loads that can be degraded without leading to eutrophicated conditions, (2) predict the transition to suboxic conditions as a result of organic enrichment, and (3) predict sulfide levels in surface sediments, a key regulatory variable in Canada. A new definition is proposed for sediment assimilative capacity (AC) of marine fish farms, as the gross deposition rate of organic wastes that maximizes total organic carbon (C-org) degradation rates while preventing sediment sulfide accumulations in surface sediments (upper 2 cm) above regulatory limits (AC-H2S). Model results were consistent with empirical observations and highlight the influence that organic loading history, hydrodynamics, and microbial activity have on assimilative capacity. AC-H2S varied between 0.6 to 22.1 g C-org m(-2) d(-1) in poorly flushed environments, with no upper limit defined in environments exposed to mean tidal currents >9.5 cm s(-1) (dispersion scenarios), where most fish farm organic wastes are dispersed to the far-field or resuspended after deposition below fish cages. The combination of diagenetic modelling and geochemical indicators may contribute significantly to the development of more effective tools for site selection and environmental management of marine fish farms. At this stage, the model should be considered as a proof of concept, developed with the purpose of verifying the utility of assimilative capacity for real-world application. Further validation is still required.

AB  - Long-term studies of predator food habits (i.e., predator-based sampling') are useful for identifying patterns of spatial and temporal variability of forage nekton in marine ecosystems. We investigated temporal changes in forage fish availability and relationships to ocean climate by analyzing diet composition of three puffin species (horned puffin Fratercula corniculata, tufted puffin Fratercula cirrhata, and rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata) from five sites in the North Pacific from 1978-2012. Dominant forage species included squids and hexagrammids in the western Aleutians, gadids and Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes personatus) in the eastern Aleutians and western Gulf of Alaska (GoA), and sand lance and capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the northern and eastern GoA. Interannual fluctuations in forage availability dominated variability in the western Aleutians, whereas lower-frequency shifts in forage fish availability dominated elsewhere. We produced regional multivariate indicators of sand lance, capelin, and age-0 gadid availability by combining data across species and sites using Principal Component Analysis, and related these indices to environmental factors including sea level pressure (SPL), winds, and sea surface temperature (SST). There was coherence in the availability of sand lance and capelin across the study area. Sand lance availability increased linearly with environmental conditions leading to warmer ocean temperatures, whereas capelin availability increased in a non-linear manner when environmental changes led to lower ocean temperatures. Long-term studies of puffin diet composition appear to be a promising tool for understanding the availability of these difficult-to-survey forage nekton in remote regions of the North Pacific.

FX  - The data analyzed in this paper are contained in a composite database ('puffin_diet_ALASKA_NPRB1213', version date February 2014) and reflect a compilation of ongoing studies on Alaskan seabird food habits (e.g., prey species, length and mass) by the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (AMNWR, Homer, AK), the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center (USGS, Anchorage, AK), and Institute for Seabird Research and Conservation (ISRC, Anchorage, AK). Data from these original sources were harmonized and merged by the Farallon Institute, with the resulting derived database presenting standardized information on puffin diet composition and prey metrics. Because studies of puffin food habits are continuing as part of ongoing AMNWR, USGS, and ISRC research, we note that newer data are available than what are contained in the database used in this paper (contact the primary data holders listed above). Support for analysis of these data was provided by the North Pacific Research Board under project 1213. To the multitude of people who sampled puffin food habits in the region over the years we offer sincere gratitude. In addition to authors S.A.H. and M.A., puffin diet samples were processed (identified and measured in the field or lab) by Kathy Turco, Rick Hibpshman, and Sarah Schoen.

AB  - An acute sensitivity of ecotone vegetation to environmental changes makes ecotone vegetation dynamics as one of the prime aspects in vegetation ecology. Understory vegetation of ecotone can indicate the changing environmental conditions of the region by showing its own growth pattern, abundance, and assemblages. Our study aims at investigating the compositional pattern of herbaceous species of a subalpine ecotone in Langtang National Park, central Nepal and analyzing their responses to the different environmental factors. We performed multivariate analyses to study species composition, and for analyzing individual plant species responses logistic regression was used.
   It was observed that profound variation in the canopy cover and soil organic carbon along the ecotone significantly influenced the species composition of the herbaceous vegetation. Response curve analysis showed the most significant response of eleven least tolerance species to the environmental variables. Gentiana argentea, Geranium donianum, Kobresia sp., Potentilla griffithii, Rubia wallichiana, Rubus nepalensis, Thalictrum chelidonii and Thalictrum cultratum were particularly important because these species had narrow amplitude to both the studied environmental variables - canopy cover and soil organic carbon. As these species could be critically sensitive to even minor fluctuation in the environmental factor(s), can be regarded as potential indicator species of the respective environmental variable. These indicator species could be vital in understanding community dynamics of the vulnerable ecotone vegetation within the National Park via their use in long-term assessment of the habitat conditions. Replicated studies at broader scales would further be important for understanding the dynamics of the other ecotone plant communities of Nepal Himalaya.

AB  - Soil health assessment is an important step toward understanding the potential effects of agricultural practices on crop yield, quality and human health. The objectives of this study were to select a minimum data set for soil health evaluation from the physical, chemical and biological properties and environmental pollution characteristics of agricultural soil and to develop a soil health diagnosis model for determining the soil health status under different planting patterns and soil types in Chongming Island of Shanghai, China. The results showed that the majority of the farmland soils in Chongming Island were in poor soil health condition, accounting for 48.9% of the survey samples, followed by the medium healthy soil, accounting for 32.2% of the survey samples and mainly distributed in the central and mid-eastern regions of the island. The indicators of pH, total organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and Cd exerted less influence on soil health, while the soil salinization and nitrate accumulation under a greenhouse cropping pattern and phosphate fertilizer shortage in the paddy field had limited the development of soil health. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes, hexachlorocyclohexanes and Hg contributed less to soil health index (SHI) and showed no significant difference among paddy field, greenhouse and open-air vegetable/watermelon fields. The difference of the SHI of the three soil types was significant at P = 0.05. The paddy soil had the highest SHI values, followed by the gray alluvial soil, and the coastal saline soil was in a poor soil health condition, indicating a need to plant some salt-tolerant crops to effectively improve soil quality.

AB  - Six treatments of eastern Kansas tallgrass prairie - native prairie, hayed, mowed, grazed, burned and untreated - were studied to examine the biophysical effects of land management practices on grasslands. On each treatment, measurements of plant biomass, leaf area index, plant cover, leaf moisture and soil moisture were collected. In addition, measurements were taken of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements. Measurements were taken in mid-June, mid-July and late summer of 1990 and 1991. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were differences in the set of variables among treatments and years. Follow-up tests included univariate t-tests to determine which variables were contributing to any significant difference. Results showed a significant difference (p < 0.0005) among treatments in the composite of parameters during each of the months sampled. In most treatment types, there was a significant difference between years within each month. The univariate tests showed, however, that only some variables, primarily soil moisture, were contributing to this difference. We conclude that biomass and % plant cover show the best potential to serve as long-term indicators of grassland condition as they generally were sensitive to effects of different land management practices but not to yearly change in weather conditions. NDVI was insensitive to precipitation differences between years in July for most treatments, but was not in the native prairie. Choice of sampling time is important for these parameters to serve effectively as indicators.

AB  - To better understand growth and age-pigment (lipofuscin) accumulation rates of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus under natural conditions, juveniles (33 to 94 mm carapace width) were reared in outdoor ponds for over 1 yr. Growth rates, measured by carapace width, during summer and fall exceeded all those reported in the literature; the initial carapace width of 59 +/- 14 mm (mean +/- SD) increased to 164 +/- 15 mm within a 3 mo period. No growth occurred during winter months (November to April) at low water temperatures. Growth rates of crabs in ponds were substantially higher (von Bertalanffy growth parameter K = 1.09) than those of crabs held in laboratory environments, and than rate estimates for natural populations of mid-Atlantic blue crabs. Model comparisons indicated that seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth models (r(2) > 0.9) provide a better fit than the non-seasonalized model (r(2) = 0.74) for pond-reared crabs and, by implication, are more appropriate for field populations. Despite growth rates that varied strongly with season, lipofuscin (normalized to protein concentration) accumulation rate was nearly constant throughout the year. Although the lipofuscin level in pond-reared crabs was significantly correlated with size (carapace width), it was more closely correlated with chronological age. Lipofuscin accumulation rates were also similar to those observed for laboratory-reared crabs, despite very large differences in growth rates and temperature regimes. The constancy of normalized-lipofuscin accumulation rates of blue crabs across seasons and environmental conditions suggests that lipofuscin concentration can be a more robust indicator of age than carapace width alone.

AB  - Estuaries and coastal areas support highly productive fisheries and aquaculture operations. The high productivity is partly supported by inputs of nutrients from land; consequently, these areas are sensitive and vulnerable to human activities. Excess anthropogenic nutrient input can lead to accelerated phytoplankton growth and associated environmental problems. Good management practices are needed to achieve high productivity and healthy environmental conditions simultaneously. This requires close monitoring of environmental conditions and productivity, especially at lower trophic levels. Although environmental conditions, especially water quality, are widely monitored, primary production (PP) and secondary production (SP) are rarely monitored even though these basic parameters govern the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. In this study, we developed methods to estimate PP and the SP from commonly collected water quality indicators and without the use of any information on phytoplankton or zooplankton except chlorophyll a (Chl.a) concentration. For this purpose, we developed the method to determine the half-saturation constants as a function of nutrient concentration, and the method to determine the SP from Chl.a concentration. Then, we used our newly developed methods to estimate the temporal distribution of PP and SP in the Seto Inland Sea from the 1980s to the present. To do so, we monitored water quality at three sites with different levels of eutrophication. We also measured PP by using C-13-labeled sodium bicarbonate ((NaHCO3)-C-13) incubation method, and calculated copepod SP based on the species and body size of copepods collected in a survey. To estimate PP from water quality data, we modeled PP using a half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake that was allowed to vary as a function of nutrient concentration. Seasonal differences in PP could be successfully estimated by using this method. The estimation error for PP was within -16% to 23%. We found that SP calculated from copepod species and body size data was significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentration. Therefore, we proposed a model to estimate SP from chlorophyll a concentration. Then, we used our newly developed models to estimate the temporal distribution of both PP and SP in the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal water quality data. According to our estimates, annual mean PP and SP peaked in the late 1990s and have trended downward since around 2000 or 2005. No significant inter-decadal changes in autumn or winter PP were observed during our study period; by contrast, spring and summer PP decreased significantly from the 1990s to the present. Estimated annual mean PP and SP over the most recent 5-year period were 73% and 88%, respectively, of equivalent values estimated for the 1990s.

In the present paper, the analysis for trend is considered as part of the larger task of characterizing the variability of an environmental quality indicator when data are available from a monitoring programme. The features of several parametric and non-parametric methods are discussed with respect to methods of accounting for seasonality, inherent models for trend, the ability to handle changes of different forms, the inclusion of concomitant variables in the analysis and the assumptions of the method. Examples of the analysis of water quality data using these methods axe given.

   Chronic liver disease is a major life-threating problem worldwide. Deaths due to liver disease constituted 2.4% of total deaths globally in 2017. Yet most of the available drugs for improving liver conditions are of natural origin. More research is necessary to discover agents that are more effective. Previously, the extract of Scrophularia hypericifolia showed promising protection of liver and kidney tissues against induced toxicity in experimental animals. The current phytochemical study aimed to identify the active molecules in the extract. Nine iridoid glycoside derivatives were identified from the plant extract, including four new compounds after extensive chromatographic purification. The structures were identified by applying various spectroscopic methods. Biological evaluation for protective effect on liver and kidney tissues was conducted on compounds isolated with a high enough yield. Serum and tissue parameters as well as histopathological studies were conducted for efficacy evaluation. Two of the new compounds showed the best protection of liver and kidney tissues as indicated by the studied parameters. These findings indicated that natural products could provide solutions to health problems. The role of nutraceuticals in managing liver problems is a promising field for further studies.
   Phytochemical investigation of the chloroform fraction obtained from Scrophularia hypericifolia aerial parts led to the isolation of nine acylated iridoid glycosides. The new compounds were identified as 6-O-alpha-L(2 ''-acetyl, 3 '',4 ''-di-O-trans-cinnamoyl) rhamnopyranosyl-6 '-acetyl catalpol (6 '-acetyl hypericifolin A) (1), 6-O-alpha-L(2 '', 4 ''-diacetyl, 3 ''-O-trans-cinnamoyl) rhamnopyranosyl-6 '-acetyl catalpol (6 '-acetyl hypericifolin B) (2), 6-O-alpha-L(2 ''-acetyl, 3 '',4 ''-di-O-trans-cinnamoyl) rhamnopyranosyl catalpol (hypericifolin A) (3) and 6-O-alpha-L(2 '', 4 ''-diacetyl, 3 ''-O-trans-cinnamoyl) rhamnopyranosyl catalpol (hypericifolin B) (4). Previously reported compounds were identified as laterioside (5), 8-O-acetylharpagide (6), 6-O-alpha-L(4 '-O-trans-cinnamoyl) rhamnopyranosyl catalpol (7), lagotisoside D (8) and harpagoside (9). Identification achieved via analyses of physical and spectral data including 1D, 2D NMR and High Resolution Electrospray Ionization Mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS). Compounds 2-4 and 6 were subjected to biological evaluation against paracetamol-induced toxicity. The biochemical parameters aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) as well as total bilirubin were used to access the liver condition. Measurement of serum levels of urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium cations were indicators for kidney condition. Liver and kidney samples were subjected to histopathological study. The best protection was found in the group treated with 3 followed by 4 and 6, while 2 was almost inactive.

AB  - Efficient nutrient use is critical to ensure economical crop production while minimizing the impact of excessive nutrient applications on the environment. Nitrogen (N) is a key component of agricultural production, both as an input to support crop production and as a waste product of livestock production. Increasing concern for future sustainability of agricultural production and preservation of the natural resource base has led to the development of nutrient budgets as indicators and policy instruments for nutrient management. Nutrient budgets for N have been developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as agri-environmental indicators to compare the evolving conditions in member states, and are also used by the US Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) to develop nutrient management plans. Here, we examine the crop and animal production systems, drivers impacting management choices, and the outcome of those choices to assess the utility of gross annual N balances in tracking the progress of management decisions in minimizing the environmental impact of agricultural production systems. We use as case studies two very different agronomic production systems: Mississippi, USA and Poland. State and country level data from the US Department of Agriculture and OECD databases are used to develop data for the years 1998-2008, and gross annual N balances are computed. Examination of agricultural production practices reveals that the gross annual N balance is a useful tool in identifying differences in the magnitude and trends in N within agricultural systems over large areas. Significant differences in the magnitude of the N budget were observed between the highly diversified, small-scale agriculture common to Poland, and the large-scale, intensive agriculture of Mississippi. It is noted that use of N balance indices can be problematic if the primary intent is to reveal the impact of economic drivers, such as crop prices, or management choices, such as tillage or crop rotation. Changes in cropping systems in response to commodity prices that improve N balance can be masked by detrimental growing conditions, including edaphic, biotic and weather conditions, that are outside of the producers' control. Moreover, use of large area-scale indices such as country or state-wide balances may mask the severity of localized nutrient imbalances that result from regionalized production systems that overwhelm the nutrient balance, such as confinement livestock production. Development of a policy to address environmental impact and establish sustainable production systems must consider the year-to-year variability of drivers impacting agricultural production, and the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient imbalance.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a complex set of pools, and to understand its dynamics it is necessary to know which of these pools are sensitive to the edaphic and climatic conditions or the agricultural practices, or to both. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relationships between permanganate oxidizable C (POX-C) and various soil organic carbon fractions in different land-uses and soil types, and to examine whether the POX-C fraction is sensitive to different agricultural management practices in soils under no-tillage. Three treatments were identified at four sites located in the Argentine Pampas region: two different agricultural scenarios in terms of crop rotation, fertilizers and use of agrochemicals (Good Agricultural Practices and Poor Agricultural Practices, GAP and PAP, respectively) and an undisturbed natural (NE) environment adjacent to the agricultural sites as the control treatment. The following organic fractions were quantified: SOC, coarse and fine particulate organic carbon (POCc and POCf, respectively), hot water and acid extractable organic carbon (HWC and HAC, respectively) and POX-C. Soil POC values ranged from 0.46 to 7.29 g kg(-1), HAC values ranged from 1.50 to 6.73 g kg(-1), HWC values ranged from 0.20 to 1.10 g kg(-1) and POX-C values ranged from 0.41 to 1.04 g kg(-1) soil, POCc being the most variable fraction (CV = 72%) and PDX-C the least (CV = 22%). Soil POCc and POCf at 0-10 cm, and POCc at 10-20 cm were largely explained by management practices with a component of variance > 50%. The relationship between POX-C and SOC was generally stronger (R-2 = 0.76-0.92) than POX-C with other organic fractions and where depth and site factors have a greater influence on this relationship than management practices. Among the labile fractions, the most sensitive indicators of soil quality in agricultural soils were POCf and HWC, which displayed the highest F-statistic values. Despite the dilute solution used (0.02 mol L-1 EMnO4) the POX-C demonstrated limited sensitivity to different agricultural practices. However, this methodology could be used to estimate SOC regarding site conditions and depths. The POCf was the fraction most affected by agricultural practices, indicated by high relationships with both the soil physical attributes (macroporosity, bulk density, and density, volume and stability of aggregates) and the agronomic parameters (soybean and maize yields).

AB  - An assessment is given for the contemporary state of zooplankton community in the waters of the upper reaches of the Kenti River system under the conditions of long-term potash-sulfate industrial pollution. This article presents a number of structural indicators of the zooplankton community that show simplification in the structure of species diversity and its reduction, as well as the disappearance of a number of systematic groups. It is noted that the number of zooplankton taxa increases with distance from the source of pollution (Kostomukshskoe and Kento lakes), and the average quantitative indicators also increase in this case. A comparison with the results that were previously obtained for the reservoirs of the studied environment has been carried out.

AB  - In this article a contribution concerning the development of a hierarchization of investments in sanitation model is presented. The technique of the linear programming is used, based on an environmental health indicator, the ISA/JP1 (Silva, 2006). The aim is the maximization of the environmental health conditions in the communities to be benefited. In this way, it is attempted to interfere in the allocation of the benefits related to the sub-indicator variables corresponding to basic sanitation. The model was applied in five periurban communities of Lower Gramame River Basin, on the Southern Littoral of Paraiba State, Brazil. In this case, the proposed benefits would result in significant changes, even reaching the salubrious condition, according to values of available investments.

AB  - Four major species of Chinese carp, namely black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), are important economic freshwater fish varieties in China. They primarily inhabit and breed in the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, the construction and operation of the Gezhouba Dam and the Three Gorges Dam have dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, leading to a sharp decline in the reproduction rates of these carp. The egg abundance of the four species of carp downstream from the Three Gorges Dam reached 8.35 billion in 1965, but abundance during 2005-2012 was only 0.25 billion. One of the main reasons was that the hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning ground could not meet the four species' breeding requirements. However, due to the limitations of traditional detection tools, the spawning characteristics of these four species of carp were still unclear. In this study, the ultrasonic telemetry and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model were utilized to build the habitat suitability index (HSI) curves for the four species of carp. The habitat suitability model was then built based on HSI curves to assess spawning habitat quantity under different flow conditions. Finally, the habitat suitability model in the Yidu spawning ground was validated using 32 groups of sampling data in 2015 and 2017. The statistical results showed that the most suitable velocity ranged from 0.78 m/s to 0.93 m/s. The most suitable water depth ranged from 14.56 m to 16.35 m, and the most suitable Froude number ranged from 0.049 to 0.129. The habitat suitability model simulation results indicated that when the discharge was between 15,000 m(3)/s and 21,300 m(3)/s, the weighted usable area (WUA) values in both the Yidu and Zhicheng spawning grounds would remain at a high level. The validation results showed that most spawning activities occurred at a high level of WUA, and that the daily spawning egg numbers increased with the WUA value. Therefore, discharges of between 15,000 m(3)/s and 21,300 m(3)/s could be recommended as ecological operation target flows. We propose a feasible ecological operation scheme by setting the initial flow at 15,000 m(3)/s and maintaining the daily discharge increase at 1500 m(3)/s for 4 days.

AB  - Stream temperature is an important indicator for biodiversity and sustainability in aquatic ecosystems. The stream temperature model currently in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) only considers the impact of air temperature on stream temperature, while the hydroclimatological stream temperature model developed within the SWAT model considers hydrology and the impact of air temperature in simulating the water-air heat transfer process. In this study, we modified the hydroclimatological model by including the equilibrium temperature approach to model heat transfer processes at the water-air interface, which reflects the influences of air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and streamflow conditions on the heat transfer process. The thermal capacity of the streamflow is modeled by the variation of the stream water depth. An advantage of this equilibrium temperature model is the simple parameterization, with only two parameters added to model the heat transfer processes. The equilibrium temperature model proposed in this study is applied and tested in the Athabasca River basin (ARB) in Alberta, Canada. The model is calibrated and validated at five stations throughout different parts of the ARB, where close to monthly samplings of stream temperatures are available. The results indicate that the equilibrium temperature model proposed in this study provided better and more consistent performances for the different regions of the ARB with the values of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE) greater than those of the original SWAT model and the hydroclimatological model. To test the model performance for different hydrological and environmental conditions, the equilibrium temperature model was also applied to the North Fork Tolt River Watershed in Washington, United States. The results indicate a reasonable simulation of stream temperature using the model proposed in this study, with minimum relative error values compared to the other two models. However, the NSE values were lower than those of the hydroclimatological model, indicating that more model verification needs to be done. The equilibrium temperature model uses existing SWAT meteorological data as input, can be calibrated using fewer parameters and less effort and has an overall better performance in stream temperature simulation. Thus, it can be used as an effective tool for predicting the changes in stream temperature regimes under varying hydrological and meteorological conditions. In addition, the impact of the stream temperature simulations on chemical reaction rates and concentrations was tested. The results indicate that the improved performance of the stream temperature simulation could significantly affect chemical reaction rates and the simulated concentrations, and the equilibrium temperature model could be a potential tool to model stream temperature in water quality simulations.

AB  - A simplified kinetic model of the chemistry of NO reduction by the action of natural gas has been obtained. This model consists of 87 elementary reactions and 38 chemical species. It takes into account the natural gas decomposition and oxidation, the interaction between NO and hydrocarbons, and the conversion of the intermediate nitrogenous species. The concentrations of the species calculated with the model have been compared with those obtained experimentally using the operating conditions for which a good efficiency in the reburning zone is achieved. The comparison between the theoretical and experimental data of NO, HC,N, CO, and CO2 has been extended to the results obtained over a wide range of values of the operating conditions in the reburning zone.

AB  - This study developed, cross-validated and applied a regression-based model to predict concentrations of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) under different environmental conditions in the North and South bays of Santa Catarina, South of Brazil. The model was developed using a database of HO concentrations in seawater sampled at 50 sites and the validation was performed using a different database by comparing 288 pairs of measured and modelled results for 15 sites. The index of agreement between the model outputs and the FIO concentrations measured during the validation period was 66%; the mean average error was 0.43 log(10) and the root mean square error was 0.58 log(10) MPN.100 mL(-l). These validation results indicate that the model provides a fair representation of the FIO contamination in the bays for the meteorological conditions under which the model was trained. The simulation of different scenarios showed that under typical levels of resident human population in the catchments and median rainfall and solar radiation conditions, the median FIO concentration in the bays is 0.4 MPN.100 mL(-l). Under extreme meteorological conditions, the combined effect of high rainfall and low solar radiation increased FIO concentrations up to 5 log(10) MPN.100 mL(-1). The simulated scenarios also show that in- creases in resident population during the summer tourist season and average rainfall concentrations do not increase median FIO concentrations in the bays relative to periods of time with average population, possibly because of higher bacterial die-off in the waters. The models can be an effective tool for management of human health risks in bathing and shellfish waters impacted by sewage pollution. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel test method for the condition assessment of dielectric fluids is proposed based on measurement of the fluid's partial discharge (PD) characteristics in a needle-plane electrode geometry under AC field using a tungsten needle of 20 mu m tip radius and a low-field electrode blocked by a dielectric barrier. This system facilitates acquisition of partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV), streamer repetition rates, and phase resolved PD (PRPD) patterns without the risk of needle-damaging breakdowns. To demonstrate the approach, PD experiments were conducted on thermally and electrically aged hexadecane and on commercially available paraffinic and naphthenic base oils with typical field-aged concentrations of naturally occurring degradation products.

AB  - This article discusses the aspect of modeling weather conditions in marine environment for implementation in the offshore wind farm domain. It is clear that harsh sea weather conditions influence many characteristics of any offshore installation. The accessibility to the infrastructure, maintenance procedures, failure ratios of components, energy provision levels, or utilization of vessels-are the examples of weather-related issues connected to the offshore wind industry. Regarding the growing popularity of digital twin methodology, authors present a novel view to generate weather data with copula-based method. The results obtained are compared to selected historical data and implemented into the maintenance model. The selected indicators of maintenance service are used for usability assessment of proposed copula-based method.

AB  - Covariance matrices play an important role in many multivariate techniques and hence a good covariance estimation is crucial in this kind of analysis. In many applications a sparse covariance matrix is expected due to the nature of the data or for simple interpretation. Hard thresholding, soft thresholding, and generalized thresholding were therefore developed to this end. However, these estimators do not always yield well-conditioned covariance estimates. To have sparse and well-conditioned estimates, we propose doubly shrinkage estimators: shrinking small covariances towards zero and then shrinking covariance matrix towards a diagonal matrix. Additionally, a richness index is defined to evaluate how rich a covariance matrix is. According to our simulations, the richness index serves as a good indicator to choose relevant covariance estimator.

AB  - Hirudinida comprise a constant component of benthofauna in running waters and their taxonomic composition is often analyzed to evaluate the environmental quality. However, the indicatory role of particular species is still arguable. Thus, it is very important to provide more detailed information on the impact of environmental parameters on the species structure within this group of invertebrates. Representatives of nine species were found in the investigated upland stream including mainly Erpobdella vilnensis and E. octoculata. The research has demonstrated that the hydromorphological conditions and feeding behavior are the main factors determining the taxonomic composition of leeches in particular sections of a watercourse.

AB  - Microbial activity measurements (oxygen transfer rate, OTR, carbon dioxide transfer rate CTR and respiratory quotient, RQ) are used to monitor and control biological processes. In this study, the digestion of activated sludge in microaerobic conditions was evaluated. The changes of biological activity during digestion were monitored by respiration activity. The sludge mixtures used were primary plus activated sludge, and baker's yeast plus activated sludge. The biological activity was triggered during the experiments by feeding sugar to the mixtures. The results show that increased activity by adding sugar to digested sludge can be monitored by OTR and CTR, whereas RQ can not be used as an indicator.

AB  - The impact of tunnel drainage on local water resources has attracted increasing attention in the past decades. The potential impacts of tunnel drainage on terrestrial vegetation have been evaluated from a groundwater environment perspective. However, previous attempts did not consider the atmospheric and climatic conditions along with the change to the regional groundwater table. To address the lack of atmospheric influence, this study proposes a vulnerability assessment method focused on the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum by taking tunnel drainage, atmospheric and climatic impacts into account. The proposed method consists of five stages: (1) groundwater seepage model for water table distribution, (2) topsoil model based on a single column perspective for soil water pressure distributions, (3) dynamic root-zone wilting for the transient model, (4) Budyko-type analysis for the soil water storage under longer-term climatic changes, and (5) summary based on the outcomes of vulnerability analysis. The case study was located in the Yuexi county (Anhui, East China) and was investigated based on different soil textures, weather conditions, and groundwater table drawdown scenarios. Transient intraannual water pressure dynamics were simulated for one year, and aggregate variations of soil water storage were summarized using the Budyko framework. The assessment method demonstrated that the textural differences and climatic changes are more impactful on plant vulnerability compared to the drainage effect in the specific case. The increase in aridity towards the sub-humid dry climate drives the soil columns to decrease the water storage, where the significant loss of water storage was also observed in the Budyko-type framework. The outcomes suggest that under sub-humid dry conditions when combined with tunnel drainage, the drawdown on shallow groundwater levels leads the vegetation to be vulnerable.

AB  - The ratio between chrysophycean cysts and diatom valves (CD ratio) in lake sediments has been suggested as a useful indicator of changing trophic state conditions in oligotrophic lakes. Other environmental factors, however, may influence the CD ratio because chrysophycean cysts usually reflect conditions in the planktonic environment and diatoms reflect benthic conditions. We investigated the CD ratio in 76 mountain lakes in the Pyrenees to determine the environmental drivers that influence the ratio and assess its value for paleoenvironmental inference. The lakes surveyed included a broad range with respect to bedrock type, altitude and surface area, characteristics that cover much of the variability that can be found in cold, oligotrophic mountain lakes. Lake depth and Ca2+ concentration explain most of the variation in the CD ratio. Trophic state factors (e.g. total phosphorus, TP) play a secondary role. As a predictor, CD ratio performs primarily as a lake depth indicator. The predictive models can be improved if trophic state (i.e. TP) and chemical conditions (Ca2+) are known or can be estimated independently. Use of the CD ratio for inferring Ca2+ oscillations only makes sense in lakes with Ca2+ < 200 A mu eq/L or in those that oscillate below and above this threshold through time. Other interpretations of the CD ratio (e.g. lake trophic state changes, ice-cover duration) make sense if complementary paleolimnological evidence indicates that neither water depth nor Ca2+ concentration changed significantly. Indeed, paleolimnological interpretation of the CD ratio requires considering the particular characteristics of the lake and may vary depending on the temporal scale considered. This study provides some guidelines for evaluating critically the use of the CD ratio.

AB  - The potential impact of willow/poplar SRC on groundwater recharge (GWR) of arable lanc is an important issue for spatial environmental assessments, The approach presented in this study aims at an impact assessment for regional planning purposes Based on a linear regression of annual precipitation to actual evapotranspiration (V(ET)), an upper L(h) (r(2) = 0 89) and lower L(l) (r(2) = 0 74) boundary of annual SRC water use was determined The impact assessment made use of public available data on land cover (ATKIS) soil properties (BUK50) and regional climate (precipitation grids). The methodology refers to well established rule-sets applied to the soil information system of Lower Saxony, Germany (NIBIS) Results are presented for two municipalities in the district of Uelzen, Northern Germany The study area is characterized by sandy soils, a low groundwater table and precipitation ranging from 607 to 777 mm a(-1)
   V(ET) calculated for the study area ranges from 560 to 714 mm a(-1) for (L(h)) and from 488 to 544 mm a(-1) for (L(l)), respectively A considerable water deficit calculated for (L(h)) conditions bears a high risk of yield decline. Compared to current agricultural land use, GWR of (L(h)) substantially decreases by about 70 % In case of (L(l)), GWR is reduced by about 5 to 10 % compared to current agricultural land use Thus, from the perspective of ground water protection the focus should be on SRC systems representing (L(l)) conditions.
   The underlying data indicate that willow (poplar) SRC with 2 to 4 year rotation period is typical for (L(l)) conditions There is, however, considerable uncertainty and an urgent need to improve the data base Representing (L(l)) conditions, SRC could be an interesting land use option due to its potential positive impact on soil erosion groundwater quality and landscape structure

AB  - Multiple indicators (trace fossils, trace metals, and delta C-13(org)) are used to assess the depositional environments and controls on organic carbon accumulation in the Lower Carboniferous Nanmingshui Formation, Junggar Basin, NW China. The majority of trace fossils belong to the Nereites ichnofacies, representing low energy, oxygen-poor, and relatively quiet bottom water environments. However, the shallow water trace fossil Planolites also appears in the strata, possibly reflecting variations in the bottom water oxygen contents of the turbidite succession. Redox proxies Th/U, V/Sc, and V/(V + Ni) reveal variable redox conditions; most of the samples are in the range from suboxic to anoxic depositional conditions. Ni and Cu show a positive correlation with TOC, but U and V have no correlation with TOC, also suggesting the redox conditions were mainly suboxic. The P/Al and Cu/Al ratios of all samples are higher than those of Post-Archean Australian Shales (PAAS), and about two-thirds of the samples' Ba/Al and Ni/Al ratios are close to or higher than PAAS, suggesting the Early Carboniferous Junggar Basin had relatively high palaeo-productivity levels. delta C-13(org) values average - 23.75 parts per thousand, reflecting a mixture of terrestrial organic and marine organic matter. The indexes of Ba/Al, Cu/Al, Ni/Al, and delta C-13(org) show good positive correlations with TOC, indicating the palaeo-productivity played an important role for the organic matter accumulation. On the other hand, the TOC correlates inversely with redox proxies (Th/U, V/Sc, and V/(V + Ni)), suggesting the preservation conditions (anoxia) are not the control factor of organic matters accumulation. Using these multiple approaches, our results indicate that productivity was the primary factor controlling organic matter accumulation.

AB  - In modern conditions of global climate change towards warming, in order to guarantee the provision of an increasing population of the planet with food, and especially grain, the issue of selecting the most productive, drought-resistant and heat-resistant crops becomes very urgent. One of such promising plants is sorghum grain, the main products of which are used for food, fodder and technical purposes. Almost every year, this crop in the steppe arid regions significantly exceeds traditional spring crops - oats, barley, corn and millet. In the State Register of Breeding Achievements Approved for Use in Russia for 2019, 120 domestic and foreign varieties and hybrids of grain sorghum were registered. The purpose of the research is to study the productivity of modern hybrids of sorghum grain in the soil and climatic conditions of the steppe zone on the basis of the Lugansk National Agrarian University in the crop rotation of the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Ecology (2016-2018). As a result of the studies, the most productive and maximally adapted crop varieties were established, which have the highest manufacturability and guaranteed maturation by the end of the growing season. In all the studied hybrids, no shedding of grain from panicles was recorded, even when the plants were stopped. The greatest damage to the leaves of cereal aphids was found in the wetter 2016. The average productivity of grain sorghum in the favorable year was 6.2 t / ha, in the arid year 2018 - 5.01 t / ha. On average, in 2016-2018, the highest yields (over 6.0 t / ha of grain) were obtained for early-ripening hybrids Frisket and PR88Y20 and mid-early Puma Star, Solarius and Bianka. These developments can be successfully implemented in agricultural production of the steppe regions of the North Caucasus region.

AB  - Kinetic characteristics play an important role in anaerobic digestion system for representing biogas production performance, however, its relationship with anaerobic digestion process parameters (i.e., volatile fatty acids, total ammonia nitrogen, pH and total alkalinity) and operational conditions remains poorly understood. To illustrate the linkage of kinetic parameters with process parameters and swine manure content and initial pH, and the effects of swine manure content and initial pH on anaerobic digestion performance, substrate properties, accumulative biogas production, specific biogas production rate and process parameters were analyzed under different treatments. Additionally, the effects of swine manure and initial pH on hydrolysis constant, lag phase, biogas production potential and the maximum biogas production rate were investigated. The results revealed that volatile solid and C:N ratio were significantly decreased with swine manure content increased which were considered as operational conditions with initial pH following the linkage illustration. Furthermore, accumulative biogas production, biogas production rate, final pH, total ammonia nitrogen and hydrolysis constant were increased with swine manure content and initial pH increased, while volatile fatty acids and lag phase showed the opposite trend. The results showed that these operational conditions significantly influenced process parameters and kinetic parameters, with close correlations were observed. Lag phase closely correlated with VFA which was closely correlated with C:N ratio. Therefore, C:N ratio impacted kinetic parameters via effecting VFA, while initial pH directly influenced kinetic parameters. Meanwhile, the correlation of kinetic parameters with C:N ratio was stronger than initial pH. Therefore, C:N ratio should be an indicator for estimating process performance, time the bacteria's acclimatization to the new environment and biogas production. Taken together, these findings provide a scientific theory for estimating anaerobic digestion performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural mortality (M) is both a highly consequential and difficult process to estimate in stock assessments. Because of its correlation with other influential parameters, and the inadequacy of data to understand how it varies with time and ontogeny, estimates of M from integrated assessment models are often considered implausible. This has lead to the assumption that estimates of M are highly uncertain within integrated assessments and it is commonly fixed at values consistent with understanding about the stock's life history or derived from external analyses. Researchers recently used simulation analysis to challenge this assumption and provided evidence that M might be estimable under certain conditions. Our research builds upon those results by using the recently proposed age-structured production model diagnostic to help identify the conditions under which M might be estimable. This diagnostic aims to determine if changes in the scale and trend of stock abundance can be explained by catch alone, which is a key indicator of the presence of a production function. We apply the production model diagnostic to the same suit of assessments used in the aforementioned simulations to determine if a relationship between estimability of M and the presence of a production function can be identified. Statistical and subjective approaches to interpreting the production model diagnostic were developed with the aim of providing guidance on when M might be estimable. Statistical approaches to identifying the presence/absence of a production function did not outperform the subjective measure, but meaningful guidance about estimating M is still apparent. Our results provide more weight to the notion of M being estimable under certain conditions, and we provide guidance on identifying those conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sedimentary processes in the paleocoastal part of the Bengal basin that occured in the Tertiary and Quaternary have been addressed. Three indicators were used: sedimentary bedding forms, microstructure of the sediment, and trace fossils. Various forms of sedimentary structures developed under the influence of dynamic geomorphic processes in the study area in the Quaternary. The microstructure analysis of the sedimentary materials was made by two methods: microphotography and Digital Color Analysis (DCA). The microstructure analysis shows that the geomorphic process remained very dynamic in the Quaternary, influencing the form, thickness, and mineral composition of the sediment strata. The enrichment of the sediments in heavy minerals evidences either oscillating or combined flow sedimentation, while under stable conditions light-mineral deposition took place. The digital data of microfabric study by the DCA method also show that larger particles deposited in the oscillating or high-flow environment and evidence a greater amount of heavy minerals like ferruginous materials. Trace fossils found in the sediments of this area also strongly support the concept that the environment remained dynamic during the Tertiary and Quaternary. The Late Tertiary deposition shows that, during these periods, the sediments were transported from tide-dominated marine coast with low flow energy, which is typical of hot and humid conditions. From Late Tertiary to Early Quaternary, the macrotidal coast became mesotidal (wave-dominated). The second phase is the Middle Pleistocene, when the environment was stable, favoring the continuous deposition of finer particles under low-to medium-flow energy conditions. The third phase, the Recent, is marked by the shoreline shift and modification of the environment. In the Early-Middle Holocene, the shoreline started to shift, which modified the geomorphic conditions of this place from coastal to estuarine and, finally, inland fluvial.

KW  - JAPAN
AB  - A new principle of geochemical conditions within a landslide slip zone is presented based on the concept of a self-sealing closed system for which newly formed pyrite should be considered as a potential indicator. Once slip zones occur, a series of water-rock interactions may take place, particularly, a change in redox conditions simultaneously with progression of the landslide. This change induces weathering of the debris and bed rocks, and leads to accumulation of newly formed sliding mud within the slip zone. Pyrite formation along with clay mineral accumulation occurs under a weak alkaline-strong reducing environment along with landslide development. Thus, formation of neogenetic pyrite, iron speciation, and clay mineralization are all important factors for a better understanding of landslide progression.

   For that purpose, numerical simulation and experimental investigations on the performance of the environment support system in a typical broiler poultry house according to technological conditions have been conducted. In the course of the experiment, quality indicators of the air medium and the process energy performance have been determined.

AB  - Qualities of the light environment are important for good welfare in a number of species. In chickens, UVA light is visible and may facilitate flock interactions. UVB wavelengths promote endogenous vitamin D synthesis, which could support the rapid skeletal development of broiler chickens. The aim of the study was to investigate the impacts of Ultraviolet wavelengths (UV) on welfare indicators in broiler chickens.
   Day-old Ross 308 birds reared under commercially representative conditions were randomly assigned to one of three lighting treatments: A) White Light Emitting Diode (LED) and supplementary UVA LED lighting (18-hour photoperiod); B) White LED with supplementary UVA and UVB fluorescent lighting providing 30 micro watts/cm(2) UVB at bird level (on for 8 h of the total photoperiod to avoid over-exposure of UVB); C) White LED control group, representative of farm conditions (18-hour photoperiod).
   Welfare indicators measured were; feather condition (day 24, n = 546), tonic immobility duration (day 29, n = 302), and gait quality, using the Bristol Gait Score (day 31, n = 293). Feather condition was improved in male broilers in the UVA treatment (A), compared to the control treatment (C). Birds in the UVA treatment had shorter tonic immobility durations compared to the control treatment (C), suggesting lower fearfulness. Broilers reared in UVA (A) and UVA + UVB (B) had better Bristol Gait Scores compared to the control (C).
   Together these results suggest UV may be beneficial for broiler chicken welfare. While treatment A and B both provided UVA, the improvements in welfare indicators were not consistent, which may be due to exposure time-dependent beneficial effects of UVA.
   The modification of commercial lighting regimes to incorporate UVA wavelengths for indoor-reared broiler chickens would be an achievable change with significant positive impacts on bird welfare.

AB  - We evaluated the temporal variation of microbial biomass C, beta-glucosidase, acid phosphomonoesterase (acP), alkaline phosphomonoesterase (alP), and protease activity over 18 consecutive months. The likely causes for the seasonal variability at a non-degraded and a degraded site in south-western Nigeria were identified. Microbial biomass, alP, and beta-glucosidase activity were sensitive indicators of soil quality changes over time. Microbial biomass C correlated significantly with soil moisture conditions and soil organic matter-related parameters. AlP and beta-glucosidase activities were not controlled by climatic conditions over the course of two rainy seasons and one dry season but were temporally related to microbial biomass C and total C and N. Due to the steadiness of the alP activity over time the enzyme is considered a suitable indicator with which to monitor long-term changes of soil quality. Single sampling during the course of a year is adequate. Both microbial biomass and beta-glucosidase activity fluctuated highly. They were sensitive indicators to monitor short-term variations of soil quality with. Sampling for microbial biomass ought to be limited to the rainy seasons, whereas the measurement of beta-glucosidase activity need not be restricted seasonally. Due to the short-term variability found, sampling should be repeated. AcP and protease activity fluctuated highly during the course of a year and exhibited pronounced inter-seasonal differences. The marked seasonal changes could not be ascribed to soil moisture conditions and only poorly to major ecological C soil processes. This was more pronounced for acP than for protease. Hence, neither parameter was considered a sensitive and meaningful indicator of soil quality changes over time.

AB  - Seasonal reductions in food availability may cause animals to catabolize endogenous tissue and the resulting loss of lean mass can hinder their ability to forage and reproduce. While several studies have considered nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15) as an indicator of catabolism, relationships between protein intake, body condition, and tissue delta N-15 have not been assessed simultaneously in controlled conditions. We conducted a feeding experiment on laboratory mice (Mus musculus) to test the effects of low (5%) versus high (30-40%) dietary protein content on lean mass, fat mass, and tissue delta N-15. This approach enables the distinction between use of exogenous and endogenous nitrogen, illuminating a framework of protein metabolism and tissue synthesis. As expected, lean mass and body fat were lower in mice fed low-protein diets. Nitrogen isotope discrimination (Delta N-15) between blood plasma-diet and liver-diet did not differ between diet treatments. In contrast, Delta N-15 for hair decreased while Delta N-15 for muscle and RBC increased in the low-protein treatment. These patterns suggest that animals in negative nitrogen balance catabolize labile endogenous protein (e.g., muscle) to maintain vital tissues (e.g., liver) required to survive. Consequently, muscle and RBC delta N-15 values appear to be the most useful in assessing the nutritional state of animals. Our combination of direct measurements of body condition with delta N-15 analysis suggest how nitrogen isotopes can be better used as tracers of catabolic and anabolic activity by demonstrating connections between tissue-specific metabolic processes and Delta N-15, thus refining the application of delta N-15 as a tool for assessing nitrogen balance in wild animals.

AB  - Chrysanthemum stock plants and cut flowers were grown in the greenhouse under different root zone conditions. Proline levels in the leaves were measured as an indicator of the relative stress and related to the yields of cuttings and flowers. The plants were grown in pear-based substrates or in the cultivation system plant plane hydroponic (PPH), using different fleeces as substrate. PPH plants contained higher proline levels with higher temporal variation and had lower yields as compared with the non-hydroponic systems. Proline levels and the corresponding yields indicated similiar proline threshold ranges for the yield reduction of both stock plants and cut flowers. (C) Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Assessing and mapping ecosystem services (ES) became an integral part of coastal and marine management practices. hence, quantitative and validated approaches are lacking, especially to address future conditions. The objective of this study is to apply further existing and develop new methodological frameworks to quantitatively assess and map the current and future supply of 3 ES in the coastal zone of Lithuania: coastal flood protection, nutrient regulation, and maintenance of nurse!) , conditions. For coastal flood ES modelling, 2 time periods (1990 and 2018) and 4 scenarios (A0, A1 A2, A3 - based on future socio-economic changes in Lithuania) were analysed. The coastal flood protection ES model was validated (r(2) = 0.30) using tree cover density. The results showed spatial differences among the analysed periods but no statistical differences. High supply areas are located in the southern coastal area, while the central part displays a low supply. For nutrient regulation and maintenance of nursery conditions, 7 time periods were analysed: a historical period and 6 scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 and 3 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The nutrient regulation ES model was validated (r(2) = 0.85) using in situ nutrient. Statistical differences were observed for this ES, but a similar spatial distribution of high and low supply areas. A decrease in the supply was observed comparing the historical period and future scenarios. Maintenance of nursery conditions was validated (r(2) = 0.72) based on the protection status of the coastal zone. Results show no statistical differences and similar spatial patterns among the periods. Rocky and sandbank areas show a high supply for this ES. Limitations of our work are mainly related to the resolution of the utilised indicators. Nevertheless, the information obtained from our models can support spatial planning and decision-making processes.

AB  - A variant of constructed wetland using artificial carriers for bacterial growth as support medium (High Rate Constructed Wetlands (HRCW)) has been developed to depurate high organic loads (45 g BOD5 m(-2) d(-1)). The metabolic state of vegetation in this phytodepuration system affects the treatment processes; therefore, its optimum adaptation is necessary. A comparative study, in mesocosms scale, was undertaken to test the capacity of adaptation of three plant species (Cyperus alternifolius, Heliconia burleana, and Zantedeschia aethiopica) in HRCW. 25 units of each species were planted in three lines of HRCW (one species per line), named for ease of understanding as L1, L2, L3 respectively, and monitored during the start-up phase of the system under climatic conditions of intersection between dry tropical forest and premontane sub-humid. Quantitative epidemiology was used to determine incidence, infection rate, and the relative area under the disease progress curve for each type of plant. The relationship between these epidemiology variables and the environmental conditions was determined. Vegetative stress was observed in all species, followed by a phase of high phytopathology, with infection rates of 0.0049-0.0183; 0.1085-0.1821; 0.0911-0.1158 (units/day) for L1, L2, and L3, respectively. The combination between the high organic load, water volume (94% v/v), and weather conditions favoured this behaviour. This study indicated that Cyperus alternifolius is a type of plant suitable for HRCW; highlighted the importance of studies on plant adaptation in CW with particular conditions; and showed epidemiological analysis as a tool for performing this selection in a low cost and user-friendly way.

AB  - Background: In temperate-breeding birds, individuals must adjust their physiological states from one life-history stage to another in response to changing conditions to maximize ecological fitness. Previous evidences have shown that body mass, size-corrected mass (SCM), and hematocrit (Hct) could be used as estimates of the energetic state of individuals to illustrate life-history trade-offs and individual quality in field physiology. Plasma alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) plays critical roles in regulating the metabolism of energy but very limited information is known on its link with body mass or Hct.
   Methods: We determined the changes of plasma ALP levels in both early breeding and wintering stages of male Eurasian Tree Sparrows (Passer montanus), and examined the relationships between ALP and body mass, SCM, and Hct of the birds.
   Results: Our study showed that (1) in male Eurasian Tree Sparrows, body mass did not vary with life-history stage but plasma ALP activity significantly increased in the wintering stage compared to the breeding stage; (2) ALP activity was not correlated with individual body mass but was positively correlated with individual SCM and Hct. Such positive correlations, however, only occurred in the wintering but not in the breeding stages.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that plasma ALP activities in free-living birds can be used as one of the indicators of body condition or nutritional status for analyzing individual variation in the wintering but not in the breeding stages. The life-history dependent relationships between plasma ALP activity and body condition may contribute to our better understanding of the trade-off between individual survival and reproduction in free-living animals.

AB  - Variability in iron species in marine deposits are excellent geochemical archives for exploring variations in redox conditions during early diagenesis and seepage dynamics over dine. Two sediment cores (DS07 and DS08) were collected in the Jiulong Methane Reef, a typical cold seep site that is located in the South China Sea (SCS), and analyzed for iron species using Mossbauer spectrometry and magnetic procedures. Excluding the surface layer (0.10 cm) in DS07, Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios indicated that core sediments were under anoxic conditions. The Fe2+/Fe3+ and frequency-dependent susceptibility (chi(fd)) at this site were higher while the total organic matter content (TOC) and magnetic susceptibility (chi) were significantly lower at approximately 170 cm depth. Combined with chromium reducible sulfur (CRS), Fe/Al and sulfur to organic content (S/C) ratios suggested that there was a sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) at approximately 170 cm. Moreover, thermomagnetic analyses indicated that magnetite was the dominant ferrimagnetic mineral at 21-23 cm, 165-185 cm, 213-233 cm and 285-295 cm depths, however, magnetite content was relatively lower between the 165 and 185 cm depth, which suggested that magnetite had been largely transformed to paramagnetic iron minerals during the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) process. The DS08 sediment core was also mostly anoxic, however, no obvious methane seepage activity was observed because the maximum values of Fe2+/Fe3+, Fe/Al, CRS, S/C and the minimum values of TOC and chi did not simultaneously occur at the same depth. The study revealed that the speciation of Fe in sediment cores varied under different redox conditions which was of interest when utilizing iron speciation and magnetic minerals as indicators of historical environmental conditions and seepage activities.

AB  - The effect of light on different understory plant groups (herbs, ground floor bryophytes, trunk-dwelling bryophytes and seedlings) was studied in a deciduous-coniferous mixed woodland in Western Hungary. The correlation of cover and species richness in each group and the cover of individual species to relative diffuse light were analyzed at different spatial scales. The study was carried out in 34 forest stands with different tree species composition. The importance of light in determining species composition was investigated by redundancy analysis. Species within each plant group were classified based on their light response. Light was positively correlated with species richness of herbs, cover of ground floor and trunk-dwelling bryophytes, and species richness and cover of seedlings. In redundancy analysis, the variance explained by light was 13.0% for herbs, 15.0% for bryophytes and 8.6% for seedlings. Within the group of herbs, species preferring open conditions and light-flexible (gap) species were separated on the basis of the spatial scale of the analysis, while shade-tolerant species were not correlated positively with light. Among bryophytes mainly terricolous, opportunistic and mineral soil-inhabiting species showed significant positive correlations with light, while epiphytic and epixylic species did not respond to light. Seedlings of Quercus petraea and Pinus sylvestris were positively related to light, while most other seedling species were shade-tolerant. In case of vascular plants, the species' correlations with light were in agreement with their light indicator values; however, they were independent in the case of bryophytes. This study proved that the extent and spatial pattern of light influenced strongly the understory plant groups. Species within each group respond to light conditions differently, concerning the strength, direction and spatial scale of the relationships.

AB  - Precision irrigation requires a method of quantifying the crop water status or root zone depletion of water to determine when and how much water to apply, to the soil. Changes in canopy resistance (r(c)) and canopy temperatures have the potential of being used as a crop water status indicator for irrigation management. A study was conducted on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) grown in northern Egypt at Shibin El-Kom on an alluvial loamy soil for winter (20 Sept. 2001 through 20 Jan. 2002) and spring (1 Feb. 2002 through 20 May 2002) seasons to determine if r(c) derived from energy balance and plant parameters could be used to determine the onset of water stress and the amount of water required to refill the soil profile. Diurnal r(c) was determined for well-watered conditions and achieved minimum values of 20 and 10 s m(-1) at noontime during winter and spring periods, respectively. A power relationship of -0.86 for well-watered conditions was developed between r(c) and net radiation (R-n) at various plant growth stages. In deficit soil water conditions, r(c) increased linearly with decreasing available soil water (ASW), with a change in potato r(c) of 0.75 and 0.39 s m(-1) per percentage ASW for 1 and 2 MJ m(-2) h(-1) of R-n at midgrowth, respectively. A ratio of actual/potential canopy resistance (r(c)/r(p)) was derived to normalize the meteorological differences between growing seasons. This ratio was 2.5 when 50% of ASW was removed and can be used as a parameter to determine the need for irrigations using weather factors and canopy temperature. Canopy resistance increased linearly with increasing soil solution salinity, electrical conductivity, when the soil solution was above the threshold soil salinity value. A ratio of r(c)/r(cp) was found to normalize the effects of different environments across saline and water deficit conditions.

AB  - The skin has many important roles in dairy cattle, and skinfold thickness could be used as an indicator of body fat deposition. The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic parameters of skinfold thickness and to explore its association with body condition score (BCS) and milk production traits in a Chinese Holstein population. Skinfold thicknesses over the neck (STN) and the last rib (STR), BCS, and test-day records of milk production traits were available for 6,416 lactating Holstein cows in the summers of 2015 and 2016 in Beijing, China. Multi-trait animal models were used to estimate variance and covariance components using the DMU software. The average STN was 7.15 +/- 1.28 mm, and the average STR was 11.76 +/- 1.95 mm (mean 1 standard deviation). Estimated heritability was 0.13 +/- 0.03 for STN and 0.26 +/- 0.04 for STR. We detected a high genetic correlation (0.79 +/- 0.08; heritability +/- standard error) between STN and STR. Genetic correlations between skinfold thickness and BCS were low to moderate: 0.18 between STR and BCS, and 0.33 between STN and BCS. Genetic correlations between skinfold thickness and milk yield, milk fat percentage, and milk protein percentage were negligible, ranging from -0.02 to 0.15. Collectively, skinfold thickness is characterized as a trait with moderate heritability. Skinfold thickness is sensitive to changes in body condition or fat deposition across parities and lactation stages in milking cows, and we confirmed the complementary nature of skinfold thickness and BCS genetically as well as phenotypically by comparing their changing trends throughout lactation and across lactations. The use of skinfold thickness, together with BCS, can assist in the monitoring of changes in body fat deposition to achieve higher management precision.

AB  - The freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritzfera) is a highly specialized and sensitive freshwater bivalve, whose survival in the juvenile phase is indicative of high quality habitats. This contribution investigates the use of juvenile freshwater pearl mussels as bioindicators, considering the influence of mussel stock and study stream conditions on juvenile performance, as described by survival and growth rates. A standardized cross experiment was carried out investigating juvenile performance in four different pearl mussel stocks originating from the Rhine, Danube and Elbe drainages, representing distinct genetic conservation units. The juveniles were exposed in five study streams which were selected to integrate pearl mussel streams with different water qualities and recruitment status of the mussel population. Per study stream, five standard mesh cages containing an equal number of 20 (10 x 2) juvenile pearl mussels per stock in separate chambers were installed. Survival and growth rates of juveniles were checked after three months (i.e. before their first winter) and after nine months (i.e. after their first winter). Mussel stock and study stream conditions significantly influenced juvenile performance. Growth rates were determined by study stream conditions and increased with stream water temperature, organic carbon and C/N ratios. Survival rates varied stock-specifically, indicating different levels of local adaptation to their native streams. Due to the detection of stream-specific differences in juvenile performance, freshwater pearl mussels appear suitable as bioindicators. However, a careful consideration of stock-specificity is necessary to avoid false interpretation of bioindication results. The comparison of stock-specific survival in native versus non-native streams implicates that exposure of juveniles outside their native habitats is able to increase breeding success or else serve for risk spreading in breeding programs.

AB  - As part of a larger gait adaptability training study, we designed a program that presented combinations of visual flow and support-surface manipulations to investigate the response of healthy adults to walking on a treadmill in novel discordant sensorimotor conditions. A visual dependence score was determined for each subject, and this score was used to explore how visual dependency was linked to locomotor performance (1) during three training sessions and (2) in a new discordant environment presented at the conclusion of training. Performance measures included reaction time (RT), stride frequency (SF), and heart rate (HR), which respectively served as indicators of cognitive load, postural stability, and anxiety. We hypothesized that training would affect performance measures differently for highly visually dependent individuals than for their less visually dependent counterparts. A seemingly unrelated estimation analysis of RT, SF, and HR revealed a significant omnibus interaction of visual dependency by session (p < 0.001), suggesting that the magnitude of differences in these measures across training day 1 (TD1), training day 3 (TD3), and exposure to a novel test is dependent on subjects' levels of visual dependency. The RT result, in particular, suggested that highly visually dependent subjects successfully trained to one set of sensory discordant conditions but were unable to apply their adapted skills when introduced to a new sensory discordant environment. This finding augments rationale for developing customized gait training programs that are tailored to an individual. It highlights one factor-personal level of visual dependency-to consider when designing training conditions for a subject or patient. Finally, the link between visual dependency and locomotor performance may offer predictive insight regarding which subjects in a normal population will require more training when preparing for specific novel locomotor conditions.

AB  - 1. Pulmonary hypertension syndrome followed by ascites is a metabolic disorder in broilers that occurs more often in fast-growing birds and at cool temperatures.
   2. Knowledge of the genetic relationships among ascites-related traits and performance traits like carcase traits or feed efficiency traits is required to design breeding programmes that aim to improve the degree of resistance to ascites syndrome as well as production traits. The objective of this study was to estimate these genetic correlations.
   3. Three different experiments were set up to measure ascites-related traits (4202 birds), feed efficiency traits (2166 birds) and carcase traits (2036 birds). The birds in different experiments originated from the same group of parents, which enabled the estimation of genetic correlations among different traits.
   4. The genetic correlation of body weight (BW) measured under normal conditions and in the carcase experiment with the ascites indicator trait of right ventricle to total ventricle ratio (RV:TV) measured under cold conditions was 0.30. The estimated genetic correlation indicated that single-trait selecting for BW leads to an increase in occurrence of the ascites syndrome but that there are realistic opportunities of multi-trait selection of birds for improved BW and resistance to ascites.
   5. Weak but positive genetic relationships were found between feed efficiency and ascites-related traits suggesting that more efficient birds tend to be slightly more susceptible to ascites.
   6. The relatively low genetic correlation between BW measured in the carcase or in the feed efficiency experiments and BW measured in the ascites experiment (0.49) showed considerable genotype by environment interaction. These results indicate that birds with high genetic potential for growth rate under normal temperature conditions have lower growth rate under cold-stress conditions due to ascites.

AB  - This study concerns firstly the methodology to describe the climate of vineyards, on a macroclimate scale of viticultural regions worldwide. Three synthetic and complementary viticultural climatic indices (potential water balance of the soil over the growing cycle, heliothermal conditions over the growing cycle and night temperature during maturation), validated as descriptors, are used: (1) dryness index (DI) which corresponds to the potential water balance of the soil of Riou's index, here adapted using precise conditions to calculate it, as an indicator of the level of presence-absence of dryness; (2) heliothermal index (111) which corresponds to Huglin's heliothermal index; (3) cool night index (CI) an index developed as an indicator of night temperature conditions during maturation. These indices are representative of the variability of the viticultural climate worldwide, related to the requirements of varieties, vintage quality (sugar, colour, aroma), and typeness of the wines. A Multicriteria Climatic Classification System (Geoviticulture MCC System) for the grape-growing regions worldwide is formulated based on classes for each of the three climate indices, with elements to explain the results. Three formulated concepts provide the system base: viticultural climate, climatic group and viticultural climate with intra-annual variability (for warm regions with more than one harvest a year in natural climate conditions). The application of the Geoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System is presented for 97 grape-growing regions in 29 countries. The system is a research tool for grape-growing and wine-making zoning. It also enables work at different levels on the scale, on a world-wide scale or larger - the large grape-growing region, the small grape-growing region, as shown by the studies performed. It allows relating the viticultural climate to the elements of grape quality and the typeness of the wines considering the climatic zone. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The trace elements Re and Mo both behave conservatively in seawater yet are strongly enriched in reducing sediments. Their potential for authigenic enrichment above crustal concentrations is greater than for many other elements, due to the high ratio of [metal](sw)/[metal](crust). We present sedimentary Re and Mo data from box- and multi-cores spanning a range of redox conditions, from well-oxygenated sites to locations with substantial sulfide concentrations. At the oxic sites, Re and Mo, as expected, accumulate at concentrations close to their crustal abundances. Re shows substantial enrichment in suboxic (absence of O-2 and H2S) sediments of the Sea of Japan, in sediments within the oxygen minimum of the Pakistan margin, as well as in sediments underlying the sulfide-bearing waters of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet. Re enrichment occurs in these cores just below the depths of Fe and U reduction. only in the sediments underlying the sulfidic waters of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet is there substantial authigenic Mo accumulation Absence of Re and Mo enrichments in sediment trap samples from the sulfide-bearing basins suggests that the addition of both metals occurs at or below the sediment-water interface. The Re and Mo concentration profiles are modeled to hindcast the removal depth of Re and Mo in the sediments which, along with the Re/Mo ratio, determine whether oxic, suboxic or sulfidic conditions were present in the water column or in the sediments in the past. Using this approach, historical redox conditions can be inferred even in environments such as continental margins where a substantial lithogenic component can obscure authigenic enrichments of other metals.

AB  - The recent decline in the condition of coral reef communities worldwide has fueled the need to develop innovative assessment tools to document coral abundance and distribution rapidly and effectively. While most monitoring programs rely primarily on data collected in situ by trained divers, digital photographs and video are used increasingly to extract ecological indicators, provide a permanent visual record of reef condition, and reduce the time that divers spend underwater.
   In this study, we describe the development and application of a video-based reef survey methodology based on an algorithm for image registration and the estimation of image motion and camera trajectory. This technology was used to construct two-dimensional, spatially accurate, high-resolution mosaics of the reef benthos at a scale of up to 400 m(2). The mosaics were analyzed to estimate the size and percent cover of reef organisms and these ecological indicators of reef condition were compared to similar measurements collected by divers to evaluate the potential of the mosaics as monitoring tools.
   The ecological indicators collected by trained divers compared favorably with those measured directly from the video mosaics. Five out of the eight categories chosen (hard corals, octocorals, Palythoa, algal turf, and sand) showed no significant differences in percent cover based on survey method. Moreover, no significant differences based on survey method were found in the size of coral colonies. Lastly, the capability to extract the same reef location from mosaics collected at different times proved to be an important tool for documenting change in coral abundance as the removal of even small colonies (< 10 cm in diameter) was easily documented.
   The two-dimensional video mosaics constructed in this study can provide repeatable, accurate measurements on the reef-plot scale that can complement measurements on the colony-scale made by divers and surveys conducted at regional scales using remote sensing tools.

AB  - This article brings together two Geographical Information Systems (GIS) datasets - building-level land-use data from the 1852-54 Perris Fire Insurance Atlas, and geocoded home addresses from the 1854 city directory - to explore how desirable and undesirable conditions of the built environment accounted for new dynamics of residential separation in mid-nineteenth-century New York. Using spatial analysis, it shows how early forms of residential separation were driven by the desire of elites to create secluded residential neighbourhoods. Further, although stark contrasts delineated the extremes of wealth and poverty, the city's dominant landscape was defined by in-between conditions and subtle variations in built environment and residential distance.

AB  - The third (Es-3) member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation is the main hydrocarbon source rock interval in the Raoyang Sag of the Bohai Bay Basin. The lower Es-3 (Es-3(L)) and upper Es-3 (Es-3(U)) submembers display clear differences in source rock quality. The formation mechanisms of the source rocks are investigated via geochemical methods using 60 samples from three wells to reconstruct the paleo-environment during deposition. The major element parameters exhibit changes in paleoclimate from humid to arid. Indicators such as Sr/Ba, B/Ga, the gammacerane index and isotopic data suggest fresh-brackish and hydrological open lakes with unstable water column stratification likely occurred during deposition of the Es-3(L) submember and saline and hydrologically closed lakes with stable water column stratification likely during deposition of the Es-3(U) submember. Carbon isotope values of organic matter, trace elements and biomarker parameters suggest that the Es-3(L) submember had moderate productivity, with a significant contribution from terrigenous organic matter whereas the Es-3(U) submember had slightly enhanced productivity, with no or minor contributions from terrigenous organic matter. Furthermore, the pristane/phytane ratio and the enrichment of Mo and U indicate that the euxinic bottom-water conditions (sulfidic) of the lakes during deposition of the Es-3(U) submember were best for preserving organic matter. Comparison of the models of source rock deposition of the Es-3(L) and Es-3(U) submembers indicates that the redox conditions play an important role in the formation of organic-rich source rocks in the Raoyang Sag.

AB  - The Water-associated Disease Index (WADI) was developed to identify and visualize vulnerability to different water-associated diseases by integrating a range of social and biophysical determinants in map format. In this study vulnerability is used to encompass conditions of exposure, susceptibility, and differential coping capacity to a water-associated health hazard. By assessing these conditions, the tool is designed to provide stakeholders with an integrated and long-term understanding of subnational vulnerabilities to water-associated disease and contribute to intervention strategies to reduce the burden of illness. The objective of this paper is to describe and validate the WADI tool by applying it to dengue. A systemic ecohealth framework that considers links between people, the environment and health was applied to identify secondary datasets, populating the index with components including climate conditions, land cover, education status and water use practices. Data were aggregated to create composite indicators of exposure and of susceptibility in a Geographic Information System (GIS). These indicators were weighted by their contribution to dengue vulnerability, and the output consisted of an overall index visualized in map format. The WADI was validated in this Malaysia case study, demonstrating a significant association with dengue rates at a sub-national level, and illustrating a range of factors that drive vulnerability to the disease within the country. The index output indicated high vulnerability to dengue in urban areas, especially in the capital Kuala Lumpur and surrounding region. However, in other regions, vulnerability to dengue varied throughout the year due to the influence of seasonal climate conditions, such as monsoon patterns. The WADI tool complements early warning models for water-associated disease by providing upstream information for planning prevention and control approaches, which increasingly require a comprehensive and geographically broad understanding of vulnerability for implementation.

AB  - With ageing populations, it becomes increasingly important to understand the determinants of cognitive ability among the elderly. We apply survey data of 17,070 respondents from ten countries to examine several domains of cognitive functioning at ages 60+, and we link them to the macro-economic deviations in the year of birth. We find that economic conditions at birth significantly influence cognitive functioning late in life in various domains. Recessions negatively influence numeracy, verbal fluency, recall abilities, as well as the score on the omnibus cognitive indicator. The results are robust; controlling for current characteristics does not change effect sizes and significance. We discuss possible causal social and biological pathways.

AB  - Well-controlled electromagnetic exposure conditions were set up at a representative societal GSM radiation intensity level, 1.5 V/m, which is the legally allowed level in Brussels. Two nests of the ant species Myrmica sabuleti were repeatedly irradiated during 10 min. before their behavior was observed, based on the analysis of the ant trajectories. Under these exposure conditions, behavioral effects were detected. The ants' locomotion slightly changed. The ants' orientation towards their attractive alarm pheromone statistically became of lower quality. The ants still presented their trail following behavior but less efficiently. In this controversial issue, ants could be considered as possible bioindicators.

AB  - The study investigated the influence of maturity, biomass type, and depositional settings on the distribution and relative abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for lacustrine sediments collected from depths up to 1000 m of Prebreza and Cucale stratigraphic units (the northwest part of the Toplica Basin). A recently proposed benzo[ghi]perylene/(perylene + benzo[ghi]perylene) parameter, along with commonly used Phenanthrene Alkylation Index and benzo[e]pyrene/(perylene + benzo[e]pyrene) indices, pointed out differences in maturity levels between stratigraphic units by displaying a positive linear relationship with vitrinite reflectance. However, in several immature Prebreza sediments, a substantial presence of algae and/or anoxic, mesosaline/hypersaline conditions were suitable for forming beta-substituted methylphenanthrenes and 6-ring benzo[ghi]perylene. Generally, high molecular weight unsubstituted PAHs (HMWPAHs), particularly perylene, predominated Prebreza sediments. Anoxic conditions appeared to be decisive for accumulating and preserving the perylene carbon skeleton in studied stratigraphic units. Besides, more intense volcanism in the Cucale unit favored combustion processes, which prompted the accumulation of low molecular weight unsubstituted PAHs (LMWPAHs), especially phenanthrene. A general prevalence of retene over cadalene in Prebreza sediments, in which alginite and liptodetrinite predominated, implied algae as retene precursor. Selective degradation of retene or hindered demethylation of 9-methylphenanthrene under anoxic and more saline environmental settings had occurred notably in the Prebreza unit, which led to the formation of 1-methylphenanthrene and/or pimanthrene (1,7-dimethylphenanthrene). Cucale sediments with substantial amounts of vitrinite macerals or saturated diterpenoids had a predominant simonellite derived from conifers. Non-degraded and well-preserved Pinaceae conifers predominated in Prebreza sediments deposited under semi-arid climatic conditions, whereas mixed degraded/non-degraded conifers characterized Cucale sediments deposited in a wide range of climatic conditions, from semi-arid to semi-humid.

AB  - Sediments contained in lake basins positioned along the eastern front of the Teton Mountain Range preserve a continuous and datable record of deglaciation and postglacial environmental conditions. Here, we develop a multiproxy glacier and paleoenvironmental record using a combination of seismic reflection data and multiple sediment cores recovered from Jenny Lake and other nearby lakes. Age control of Teton lake sediments is established primarily through radiocarbon dating and supported by the presence of two prominent rhyolitic tephra deposits that are geochemically correlated to the widespread Mazama (similar to 7.6 ka) and Glacier Peak (similar to 13.6 ka) tephra layers. Multiple glacier and climate indicators, including sediment accumulation rate, bulk density, clastic sediment concentration and flux, organic matter (concentration, flux, delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N ratios), and biogenic silica, track changes in environmental conditions and landscape development. Sediment accumulation at Jenny Lake began centuries prior to 13.8 ka and cores from three lakes demonstrate that Teton glacier extents were greatly reduced by this time. Persistent ice retreat in Cascade Canyon was slowed by an interval of small glacier activity between similar to 13.5 and 11.5 ka, prior to the end of glacial lacustrine sedimentation similar to 1.15 ka. The transition to non-glacial sediments marks the onset of Holocene conditions at Jenny Lake and reflects a shift toward warmer summers, increased vegetation cover, and landscape stability in the Tetons. We discuss the Teton lake sediment records within the context of other regional studies in an effort to construct a comprehensive overview of deglaciation and postglacial environmental conditions at Grand Teton National Park.

AB  - Information on soil conditions in New Zealand is needed to assess soil quality at a national scale. We tested a standard set of 16 primary indicators at 29 sites (0-10 cm depth) across nine soil great groups with matched examples of indigenous forest, plantation forest, pastures, and crops. Soils under indigenous forest were acidic (pH 5.55.7), low in Olsen P (5-14 mu g cm(-3)), with high microbial C (814-1228 mu g. cm(-3)), respiration (1.1-1.4 mu g C cm(-3) h(-1)), total C (31.8-52.9 mg cm(-3)), macroporosity (9.6-11.7% v/v), and total available water (29.2-31.5% v/v). Plantation forest soils had generally similar characteristics. Pasture soils were less acidic (pH 5.3-6.9) than forest soils, but with more available P (5.5-43.0 mu g cm(-3)), higher total C (30.7-141.5 mg cm-3), total N (2.7-9.0 mg cm(-3)), and mineralizable N (68-175 mu g cm(-3)). The physical condition was similar to forest soils. Cropped soil had low total C (20-34 mg cm(-3)), microbial C (160-956 mu g cm(-3)), respiration (0.29-1.33 mu g C cm(-3) h(-1)), and total available water (6.7-30.1% v/v), but high pH (5.8-7.2), Olsen P (11.2-199 mu g cm-3), and hulk density (0.96-1.3 g cm(-3)). Principal component analysis identified outlier sites and grouped land uses independently of soil great groups. Some indicators were less useful because of high variability (unsaturated hydraulic conductivity), correlation to other indicators (microbial C) or interpretation difficulties (respiration). Overall, the standardized approach provided useful information about soil conditions on a national scale.

AB  - In dynamic selection regimes, an honest signal that indicates high quality in favorable environments might be negatively related to quality in unfavorable environments, though empirical evidence is scarce. Here, we studied the relationship between plumage ornaments and physiological state in the Pacific swallow Hirundo tahitica on Amami Oshima Island in 2years with contrasting weather conditions: a once-in-a-century severe winter and a mild winter in the following year. Previous studies have shown that, during the severe winter, many Pacific swallows, particularly those with long tails, died whereas no carcasses were found in the next year, indicating relaxed selection during mild years. Here we showed that after the severe winter, the offspring generation had shorter tails than the parental generation, which could not be explained by age or yearly difference in tail length, indicating the evolution of short tails. Moreover, the relationship between tail length and body condition differed between years: longer-tailed swallows had a better body condition in the mild winter, whereas the reverse tendency was found in the severe winter. A similar relationship was found between plasma corticosterone level, an indicator of physiological stress, and tail length (i.e., swallows with longer tails tended to have lower corticosterone levels during the mild winter while the reverse pattern was found during the severe winter). In contrast, another plumage ornament, pheomelanin pigmentation, was positively linked to body condition during the two study years and had no detectable relationship with the plasma corticosterone levels. Differences in the relationship between specific plumage traits and physiology may help to explain the diversity of tail length and plumage coloration in hirundines.

AB  - Swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. This study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south Florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. Twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. The analyses performed included analyses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers (human polyomaviruses [HPyVs] and Enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (Vibrio vulnificus, Staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.). The enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative PCR were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. The FIB concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and MST markers were also generally undetectable. The FIB levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one event, and this was accompanied by detection of HPyVs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium V. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans Giardia spp. in water, and detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. The elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. Additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.

AB  - Increasing temperature and aridity predicted by climate change models in the Mediterranean region will pose a significant challenge for the survival of some plant species. The mechanisms by which species modify their phenotype across generations in response to the environment have been identified as essential to cope with the new climatic conditions. However, this transgenerational transfer remains unexplored for species with contrasted resource-use strategies (fast-growing or acquisitive versus stress-tolerant or conservative species). For this purpose, transgenerational responses to warming and drought of annual plant species with different resource-use strategies were assessed by conducting three experiments. In a field experiment, climatic treatments of increased temperature and rainfall exclusion were imposed on five herbaceous species typical of Mediterranean grasslands. The descendants of the individuals sampled in the field were employed in two greenhouse experiments to: (1) analyze the transgenerational response by re-imposing warming and drought conditions, and (2) identify possible maternal effects by maintaining them at optimal conditions of air temperature and water availability and comparing with maternal performance. We measured reproductive output, plant growth and survival variables as plant performance indicators. We found contrasting transgenerational responses to warming and drought depending on the functional strategy of the species. Direct effects of the abiotic stressors on parental plants were retained or new ones appeared in their offspring, with special negative impact on one of the most acquisitive species (Crepis capillaris). In contrast, the most conservative species (Bromus madritensis) highly tolerated increased climatic stress but deleterious maternal effects were registered, given the high negative impact on the performance of the descendants of maternal plants that were subjected to climatic treatments. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating plant responses to stress across generations to better understand their potential ability to face new environmental conditions in species with different functional strategies.

AB  - Climate change effects on vegetation will likely be strong in the southwestern U.S., which is projected to experience large increases in temperature and changes in precipitation. Plant communities in the southwestern U.S. may be particularly vulnerable to climate change as the productivity of many plant species is strongly water-limited. This study examines the relationship between climate and vegetation condition using a time-series of Landsat imagery across grassland, shrubland, and woodland communities on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We improve on poorly understood inter-annual climate-vegetation relationships by exploring how the responses of different plant communities depend on climate legacies (>12 months) and lag behind shorter-term (3-12 month) changes in water availability. Our results show a prolonged drying trend on the Colorado Plateau since the early 1990s that was punctuated in several years by intense droughts. In areas that experienced sustained dry conditions or a drying trend, vegetation greenness (a proxy for production) increased linearly when conditions were interrupted by wetting events. In contrast, in areas that experienced sustained wet conditions or a wetting trend, vegetation greenness was weakly or not related to wetting events, indicating that production may saturate if vegetation experiences sufficient water availability. Shrubland and woodland communities had stronger relationships with climate at long lags (6-12 months) and many maintained greenness under sustained water deficit, whereas grassland communities had stronger relationships at short lags (3-6 months) and lost greenness even in periods of short-term drought. The results of our study show the importance of identifying climate legacies and lags when assessing indicators of ecological drought, which can be used to improve forecasts of which plant communities will be vulnerable under future climate change.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages have been widely used over the Arctic Ocean to reconstruct sea-surface parameters on a quantitative basis. Such reconstructions provide insights into the role of anthropogenic vs natural forcings in the actual climatic trend. Here, we present the palynological analysis of a dated 36 cm-long core collected from the Mackenzie Trough in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Dinocyst assemblages were used to quantitatively reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea ice) and freshwater palynomorphs fluxes were used as local paleo-river discharge indicators over the last similar to 150 yr. Dinocyst assemblages are dominated by autotrophic taxa (68 to 96 %). Cyst of Pentapharsodinium dalei is the dominant species throughout most of the core, except at the top where the assemblages are dominated by Operculodinium centrocarpum. Quantitative reconstructions of sea-surface parameters display a series of relatively warm, lower sea ice and saline episodes in surface waters, alternately with relatively cool and low salinity episodes. Variations of dinocyst fluxes and reconstructed sea-surface conditions may be closely linked to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and to a lesser degree, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Positive phases of the PDO correspond to increases of dinocyst fluxes, warmer and saltier surface waters, which we associate with upwelling events of warm and relatively saline water from Pacific origin. Freshwater palynomorph fluxes increased in three phases from AD 1857 until reaching maximum values in AD 1991, suggesting that the Mackenzie River discharge followed the same trend when its discharge peaked between AD 1989 and AD 1992. The PDO mode seems to dominate the climatic variations at multi-annual to decadal timescales in the western Canadian Arctic and Beaufort Sea areas.

AB  - We examined the variations in vegetation, organic carbon isotopic compositions and biomarker distributions spanning a well-constrained climatic shift in a Sub-Boreal Dutch raised bog. The macrofossils record a vegetation shift from a predominance of degraded Ericaceae rootlets to a predominance of well-preserved Sphagnum species, first S. cuspidatum, followed by S. imbricatum. This shift, as well as evidence from other macrofossils and fungal spores, indicates that the local climatic conditions changed from relatively dry to relatively wet, with the wettest local conditions occurring at the base of the transition. At this boundary, a positive shift occurs in the delta(13)C values of bulk peat (c. 4parts per thousand) and compounds derived from specific peat-forming plants (1 to 2parts per thousand). This is attributed to a combination of factors, including selective preservation of certain compound classes, changes in precipitation and its effect on the water table, and plant growth rates. The changes in peat preservation also indicate that redox changes occurred across the climatic change event. Indeed, biomarker transformations thought to reflect past redox conditions or bog water acidity - the 1,2,9-trimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropicene to ursolic acid ratio, diacid to hydroxy acid ratio, and 17beta,21beta(H)-homohopane to total homohopane ratio - all exhibited shifts spanning the climatic change transition. Although some of these trends indicate the need for more fundamental research on biomarker transformations in peat, some, such as the 17beta,21beta(H)-homohopane to total homohopane ratio, show promise as indicators of past bog water conditions that could complement macrofossil analyses.

AB  - Outcrop sections from the Swiss Jura, consisting of carbonate-siliciclastic deposits spanning the Middle-Late Oxfordian boundary, provide a palaeogeographical cross-section ranging from coastal to shallow platform and intra-platform basin environments. Using a sedimentological and a 3rd order sequence stratigraphic framework based on those sections, the distribution of sedimentary organic matter (palynofacies) has been spatially studied in relation to sequence stratigraphy.
   The main factors influencing the spatial variations of sedimentary organic matter are the proximity of land, organic productivity, level of biodegradation and hydrodynamic conditions of the palaeoenvironment. These factors determine the distribution of the land-derived, relatively allochthonous organic constituents (phytoclasts, pollen and spores), and marine, relatively autochthonous constituents (phytoplankton and foraminifera linings).
   Five main palynofacies parameters appear as good indicators of proximal-distal trends: the relative proportion of total phytoclasts; the proportion of fresh, translucent fragments among these phytoclasts; the ratio of marine to continental palynomorphs; and the relative amount and species diversity of dinoflagellate cysts. In lowstand deposits, high-energy hydrodynamic conditions may affect these trends on the shallow platform, where storms tend to increase the proportion of the marine organic fraction landwards. These five palynofacies parameters are largely related to water depth. Therefore, when compared with the established 3rd order sequence stratigraphic framework, their stratigraphic variations indicate relative sea-level changes or, alternatively, proximality changes. Parameters indicative of more distal conditions increase in the transgressive and early highstand, and decrease in the late highstand. The opposite occurs for parameters indicative of more proximal conditions. Foraminifera linings seem to be particularly concentrated near the shelf edge and on the slope, Finally, bisaccate pollen may display cyclicity associated with alternating humid and dry periods. This palaeoclimatic signature may be related to orbital cyclicity.

AB  - The frequency of recurrence of drought has major societal, economical, and environmental impacts. However, our ability to capture drought conditions accurately are limited due to the uncertainties in current drought indices. In the present study, we proposed a Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage (TWS) based drought severity index (DSI) using the detrended GRACE-TWS time series, to eliminate the effect of non-climatic factors on drought estimation and reflect true drought conditions. Based on the improved GRACE-DSI, we characterized the drought conditions over major basins in China during 2002-2017. Our results indicate that the improved GRACE-DSI can reasonably capture the drought process compared to existing non-detrended GRACE-based drought indices. The observed behavior of GRACE-DSI time series agrees reasonably well with the Palmer drought severity index, standardized precipitation index, and standardized runoff index, although differences exist due to intrinsic differences in the indicators of drought. Spatially, the Yellow River Basin, Huai River Basin, Hai River Basin, Southwest River Basin, and Continental River Basin share a similar pattern with droughts prevailing after 2013, and with both increases in duration and severity of the drought episodes. Moreover, pixel-based drought assessment also suggests an increasing trend in drought frequency in most basins in China during the GRACE era, with a prominent drought event in the Southwest River Basin beginning in April 2015 and ending in May 2016, with a severity of -25.38 and affecting 39.47 % of the total basin area. Our analyses demonstrate that the proposed GRACE-DSI can serve as a useful tool for integrated drought monitoring and provide a better understanding of drought conditions in major basins in China during 2002-2017.

AB  - Floodplains are inhabited by diverse and abundant ground beetle assemblages that are adapted to the frequently changing habitat conditions. While there have been many studies on the composition of riparian ground beetle communities in individual floodplains, the general patterns responsible for their composition remained obscure. We used data on 352 ground beetle samples taken at 224 sites along rivers and their floodplains in Germany to analyse how natural large-scale descriptors and floodplain morphological status (near-natural vs. degraded vs. restored sites) determine the composition of ground beetle assemblages. For each site we compiled data on region, slope and dominant floodplain substrate, and on floodplain morphological status (near-natural, degraded or restored conditions). Hierarchical clustering revealed eight main clades and a clear hierarchy of parameters, with floodplain slope being responsible for the two main clades, followed by 'region' and 'dominant floodplain substrate' that structure the second and third orders of division. Some of the third-order clades are exclusively or predominantly composed of near-natural or restored sites, indicating that sites of high morphological status are inhabit by a distinct ground beetle community in a given region. Indicator species analysis resulted in indicators for all regions (132 indicators species) and slope (122 indicator species) categories and for almost all classes of dominant floodplain substrate (117 indicator species). Most of the indicator species with high predictive values and sensitivities belong to the genus Bembidion. For the morphological status categories, we identified 126 indicator species in total: 112 related to near-natural conditions, 13 for restored sites and only a single species for degraded conditions. Our results underline that slope, region and dominant floodplain substrate are among the main natural drivers of riparian ground beetle community composition and the suitability of ground beetles to indicate degradation and restoration processes.

This review focuses on the recent researches on the metabolism of these compounds in fruits and berries in response to the variation of environmental conditions, including temperature, radiation, and water supply. A great deal of investigations indicates that the influence of environmental factors on the composition of fruits/berries depended largely on the genetic background. Moreover, the metabolic regulation in response to environmental changes also varies between different plant developmental stages. Nevertheless, some general trends, like the positive correlation between light intensity and sugar content, were observed in most investigations. In grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), the content of malic acid always decreases as light intensity increases, and as the water supply decreases. Practical applications The contents of sugars and organic acids, and especially their relative ratio, are important indicators determining the taste and quality of fruits and fruit products. In this review, we summarized the investigations carried out on the regulation of these sensory contributing primary metabolites in fruits and berries in relation to the variation of environmental conditions. It was indicated that various factors, such as plant genotype, growing period, and interaction between environmental factors, might contribute to the impact of environmental changes on the composition of fruits/berries. The article not only provides comprehensive knowledges in food chemistry and plant physiology but also provide important background knowledge for berry cultivation and breeding, as well as useful guidelines for utilization of fruits and berries in food industry.

AB  - This study looks at two facets of dominant phytoplankton classes during phytoplankton succession. A detailed assessment of this issue is of special interest with regard to realized niches from a theoretical point of view but also for lake management as practical application.
   A realized niche mirrors the functional adaptability of an organism in a lake-specific constellation of environmental parameters. Therefore, the characterization of realized niches could be a key factor for management of problematic waters. Different strategies exist to control eutrophication and the risk of blooms by harmful algae. During the last decades, many restoration measures were initiated to manage eutrophicated inland lakes. In the past, it has become evident several times that restoration strategies do not necessarily lead to a reduction of biomass of undesirable cyanobacteria but can even promote their development.
   Due to this uncertainty of success and the high costs for remediation strategies, new prediction tools are required - ideally, based on routine monitoring data. Therefore, we developed a new method to extract potential optimal growth conditions (POGC) as indicators of realized niches for different phytoplankton taxa from existing data to improve existing strategies used in lake remediation and restoration.
   The analysis presented in this work is based on dominance pattern of different phytoplankton groups relative to environmental variables. Interpretation of these dominance patterns as indicators of POGC showed distinct pattern for several phytoplankton classes for all investigated objects. We identified low nitrogen and phosphate concentrations as favorable condition for cyanobacteria in Lake Auensee and Lake Feldberger Haussee. The reservoir Bleilochtalsperre showed a high NAP-concentration and cyanobacteria dominance was generally very low. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper analyses the performance of new Extremum Seeking Control scheme which has two adaptive control loops: (1) the searching loop locates the Global Maximum Power Point by sweeping the Photovoltaic pattern based on an asymptotic dither; (2) the tracking loop finds and tracks accurately the Global Maximum Power Point based on similar loop used in Perturbed-based Extremum Seeking Control schemes proposed in the literature. The advantages of the Asymptotic Perturbed-based Extremum Seeking Control scheme in comparison with other Extremum Seeking Control proposals are evaluated as (1) cost and complexity of implementation, and (2) performance obtained based on four indicators: the searching resolution, tracking accuracy, tracking efficiency, and tracking speed. Four solutions are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink software to evaluate the most efficient method to obtain the asymptotic dither based on the first harmonic of the output signal from controlled process, the Photovoltaic Array under Partially Shaded Conditions. The chosen variant from the four schemes was further analyzed as performance, robustness to Partially Shaded Conditions, fast changes of the irradiation, and environmental noise. Different patterns for the irradiance profile were used to test this control scheme in tracking of the Global Maximum Power Point generated by different Photovoltaic arrays. Two normalization gains are used to adapt the proposed control scheme to different Photovoltaic arrays. The other two gains (the dither's gain and the loop's gain) are designed for best performance in sweeping and tracking of Global Maximum Power Point. The performance obtained is similar or superior to the other algorithms used for tracking the Global Maximum Power Point. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under natural conditions, woody roots contribute over 80% of the fine-root system of slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliotii) and have the potential to play a major role in nutrient uptake of field grown trees. However, although nutrient uptake by 'woody roots' of trees has been reported, these studies have used brown coloration to define woodiness of roots, despite color being a poor indicator of anatomical attributes that defines secondary growth. Nutrient uptake by brown roots has also generally been measured using excised roots or intact roots from tree seedlings grown under laboratory or greenhouse conditions and which may have little relevance to field conditions. This study documented P and K depletion of intact fine roots for 12-year old slash pines growing under field conditions. The objectives were: (i) to compare P and K depletion between whole root systems and woody root systems of slash pine (Pinus elliotii Engelm. var. elliotii); and (ii) to compare P and K depletion between the whole-root system and woody-root systems when N-2 gas was used as a metabolic inhibitor of ion absorption. Woody-root components were isolated from whole-root systems (woody and non-woody) by waxing or cutting. Nz gas was also used as a metabolic inhibitor of P and K depletion and compared to P and K depletion when air gas was used. We concluded that woody roots function in P and K uptake, and that an active uptake mechanism is implicated. Rates of P and K uptake for woody roots were similar per unit root length to rates of ion uptake of whole (woody and non-woody) roots. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent decades, the use of heavy machinery in forest management has increased, causing compaction and alternations in soil morphology. As soil vulnerability to compaction is highly dependent on the type of soil and the current soil water content, rapid assessment of the suitability of the conditions for the use of machinery is of great importance for practice. The article discusses methods for rapidly determining the mechanical properties of soil. We tested the soil clump method, which was supplemented by the assessment of the appearance of the hand and handprint during preparation of the soil clumps, soil water content measurements and determination of the lower and upper limits of soil plasticity. The following soil types, which are common in Slovenian forest stands, were selected: brown soil on limestone and dolomite (Eutric Cambisol), dystric brown soil (Dystric Cambisol) and hypogley (Eutric Gleysol). The results of the study showed that, when dropped, the surface area of the clump increases with the water content of the soil, while at the same time the appearance of the clump, the soil residue on the hands and the appearance of the handprint change. Evaluation of the appearance of the hands and handprint represent supplements to the existing clump method, but can also be an alternative to it, as they can be both used independently. By determining the lower and upper limits of plasticity or soil strength, we indirectly assessed the risk of soil damage in forest production. Through the use of soil condition indicators, such as the appearance of the soil clump, the soil residue on the hands and the appearance of the handprint, we can quickly and easily assess the current working conditions in practise and thus prevent excessive soil deformation in forest operations.

AB  - Wastewater discharges lead to the deterioration of receiving waters through treated effluents and bypasses, combined and sanitary sewer overflows, and cross-connections to storm sewers. The influence of weather conditions on fecal indicator bacteria, pathogens and wastewater micropollutants on raw and treated sewage concentrations has not been extensively characterized. However, such data are needed to understand the effects of by-pass discharges and incomplete treatment on receiving waters. A water resource recovery facility was monitored for pathogenic parasites (Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts), fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens), and wastewater micropollutants (caffeine, carbamazepine, 2-hydroxycarbamazepine, acesulfame, sucralose, and aspartame) during 6 events under different weather conditions (snowmelt and trace to 32 mm 2-day cumulative precipitation). Greater intra-and inter-event variability was observed for Giardia, E. coli and C perfringens than for studied WWMP5. Even with the addition of inflow and infiltration, daily variations dominated concentration trends. Thus, afternoon and early evening were identified as critical times with regards to high concentrations and flows for potential by-pass discharges. Peak concentrations of Giardia were observed during the June wet weather event (1010 cysts/L), with the highest flowrates relative to the mean monthly flowrate. Overall, Giardia, E. coli and C perfringens concentrations were positively correlated with flowrate (R > 0.32, p < 0.05). In raw sewage samples collected under high precipitation conditions, caffeine, carbamazepine and its metabolite 2-OH-carbamazepine were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with Giardia, E. coli, and C perfringens demonstrating that they are useful markers for untreated sewage discharges. Data from the study are needed for estimating peak concentrations discharged from wastewater sources in relation to precipitation or snowmelt events. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Outdoor group housing is increasingly recognized as an appropriate housing system for domesticated horses. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of potential feed shortage in semi-natural horse keeping systems in winter on animal health and welfare. In 10 female Shetland ponies blood concentrations (NEFA, total protein (TP), total bilirubin (TB), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and thyroxine (T-4)), body mass and the body condition score (BCS) were monitored for 7 months including a 4 months period of feed restriction in five of the 10 ponies. Restrictively fed animals lost 18.4 +/- 2.99% of their body mass and the BCS decreased by 2.2 +/- 0.8 points (BCS scale: 0 = emaciated, 5 = obese). Feed restriction led to a continuous increase in TB (P < 0.001) and NEFA (P < 0.01) concentrations compared to control ponies. The TP and BHB values only differed at the end of the trial with lower concentrations in restricted fed mares (P < 0.05). Feed restriction had no effect on thyroxine concentrations. TB concentrations in the feed restricted group were out of the reference range during the entire feeding trial. The increased NEFA concentrations in feed restricted compared to control ponies suggest that fat was mobilized. The BCS, as well as plasma NEFA and TB concentrations were good indicators for a rapid detection of possible health problems caused by undernourishment in horses when kept under semi-natural conditions. In contrast, blood parameters of the control animals were within the reference ranges, suggesting that a year round outdoor housing with additional feed supply is an adequate housing system for a robust horse breed like the Shetland pony.

AB  - Over the past five decades, a reproductive failure related to thiamine deficiency, referred to as thiamine deficiency complex (TDC), has been observed in valuable salmonine fishes in the Great Lakes and Finger Lakes in North America and the Baltic Sea in Europe. The cause of TDC has been linked to the consumption of clupeid fish, which contain high levels of a thiamine-destroying enzyme called thiaminase I (hereafter referred to as thiaminase). High activities of thiaminase have been reported from clupeids such as Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Atlantic (Baltic) Herring Clupea harengus, but no consistent explanation has accounted for the wide range of observed variation in levels of thiaminase in clupeids. Chronic stress can suppress the immune systems of Alewife and other fishes, thereby reducing the number of circulating white blood cells available to suppress bacteria. Because the presence of thiaminase has been associated with thiaminolytic bacteria isolated from Alewife viscera, we hypothesized that stressful conditions, which can potentially limit clupeid immune response or alter internal physiological conditions, could allow for thiaminase to be produced more efficiently by bacteria or thiaminolytic bacteria could proliferate, or both events could occur, resulting in a subsequent increase in thiaminolytic activity. In this study, Alewives and Gizzard Shad were exposed to severe winter temperatures and low food availability, respectively, in replicated pond experiments to evaluate the influence of stressful conditions on clupeid thiaminase activity. Though responses in circulating white blood cell counts and metrics of fish condition indicated that experimental treatments affected these clupeids, these effects were not related to increased thiaminase activity. The only significant treatment effect on clupeid thiaminase was an increase in mean thiaminase activity in Gizzard Shad from ponds where only high quality energy sources were available. These data indicate that variability in clupeid thiaminase may be related to diet composition. Received June 19, 2012; accepted January 15, 2013

AB  - Extreme weather events, such as droughts and heat waves, are expected to become more severe and more frequent in the coming years, and understanding their impacts on demographic rates is of increasing interest to both evolutionary ecologists and conservation practitioners. An individual's breeding probability can be a sensitive indicator of the decision to initiate reproductive behavior under varying environmental conditions, has strong fitness consequences, and can be considered the first step in a life history trade-off between allocating resources for breeding activities or self-survival.
   Using a 14-year time series spanning large variation in climatic conditions and the entirety of a population's breeding range, we estimated the effects of extreme weather conditions (drought) on the state-specific probabilities of breeding and survival of an endangered bird, the Florida Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). Our analysis accounted for uncertainty in breeding status assignment, a common source of uncertainty that is often ignored when states are based on field observations. Breeding probabilities in adult kites (> 1 year of age) decreased during droughts, whereas the probability of breeding in young kites (1 year of age) tended to increase. Individuals attempting to breed showed no evidence of reduced future survival. Although population viability analyses of this species and other species often implicitly assume that all adults will attempt to breed, we find that breeding probabilities were significantly < 1 for all 13 estimable years considered. Our results suggest that experience is an important factor determining whether or not individuals attempt to breed during harsh environmental conditions and that reproductive effort may be constrained by an individual's quality and/or despotic behavior among individuals attempting to breed.

AB  - The concepts of soil quality and soil health are widely used as soils receive more attention in the worldwide policy arena. So far, however, the distinction between the two concepts is unclear, and operational procedures for measurement are still being developed. A proposal is made to focus soil health on actual soil conditions, as determined by a limited set of indicators that reflect favourable rooting conditions. In addition, soil quality can express inherent soil conditions in a given soil type (genoform), reflecting the effects of past and present soil management (expressed by various phenoforms). Soils contribute to ecosystem services that, in turn, contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and, more recently, to the EU Green Deal. Relevant soil ecosystem services are biomass production (SDG 2 - zero hunger), providing clean water (SDG 6), climate mitigation by carbon capture and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13 - climate action), and biodiversity preservation (SDG 15 - life on land). The use of simulation models for the soil-water-atmosphere-plant system is proposed as a quantitative and reproducible procedure to derive single values for soil health and soil quality for current and future climate conditions. Crop production parameters from the international yield gap programme are used in combination with soil-specific parameters expressing the effects of phenoforms. These procedures focus on the ecosystem service, namely biomass production. Other ecosystem services are determined by soil-specific management and are to be based on experiences obtained in similar soils elsewhere or by new research. A case study, covering three Italian soil series, illustrates the application of the proposed concepts, showing that soil types (soil series) acted significantly differently to the effects of management and also in terms of their reaction to climate change.

AB  - In this paper the feasibility to extract the proportion of pigs located in different areas of a pig pen by advanced image analysis technique is explored and discussed for possible applications. For example, pigs generally locate themselves in the wet dunging area at high ambient temperatures in order to avoid heat stress, as wetting the body surface is the major path to dissipate the heat by evaporation. Thus, the portion of pigs in the dunging area and resting area, respectively, could be used as an indicator of failure of controlling the climate in the pig environment as pigs are not supposed to rest in the dunging area. The computer vision methodology utilizes a learning based segmentation approach using several features extracted from the image. The learning based approach applied is based on extended state-of-the-art features in combination with a structured prediction framework based on a logistic regression solver using elastic net regularization. In addition, the method is able to produce a probability per pixel rather than form a hard decision. This overcomes some of the limitations found in a setup using grey-scale information only. The pig pen is a difficult imaging environment because of challenging lighting conditions like shadows, poor lighting and poor contrast between pig and background. In order to test practical conditions, a pen containing nine young pigs was filmed from a top view perspective by an Axis M3006 camera with a resolution of 640 x 480 in three, 10-min sessions under different lighting conditions. The results indicate that a learning based method improves, in comparison with greyscale methods, the possibility to reliable identify proportions of pigs in different areas of the pen. Pigs with a changed behaviour (location) in the pen may indicate changed climate conditions. Changed individual behaviour may also indicate inferior health or acute illness.

AB  - Recently, residual pharmaceuticals are generally recognized as relevant sources of aquatic environmental pollutants. However, the toxicological effects of these contaminants have not been adequately researched. In this study, the chronic toxic effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical commonly present in surface and ground water, on physiological condition status and muscle-based biomarkers of rainbow trout were investigated. Fish were exposed at sublethal concentrations of CBZ (1.0 mu h l(-1), 0.2 mg l(-1) and 2.0 mg l(-1)) for 42 days. Compared with the control, there was a significant lower (P < 0.05) condition factor in fish exposed at the highest concentration of CBZ (2.0 mg l(-1)), but the hepatosomatic indices in all groups were not significant changes. At lower CBZ concentration (1.0 mu g l(-1), 0.2 mg l(-1)), the antioxidant enzyme activities were induced slightly, except catalase, while at the highest concentration (2.0 mg l(-1)) oxidative stress was apparent as reflected by the significant higher lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls in the fish muscle, associated with a significant inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activities. Moreover, energy metabolic parameters (RNA-DNA ratio, Na+-K+-ATPase) were significantly inhibited in muscle of the fish exposed at the highest concentration (2.0 mg l(-1)), compared with the control. In short, CBZ-induced physiological and biochemical responses in fish were reflected in parameters measured in this study, which suggest that these biomarkers could be used as potential indicators for monitoring residual pharmaceuticals present in aquatic environment.

AB  - It has been known that rodents exhibit the immobility when tested in the same environment in which they had been previously exposed to aversive stimuli. This behavior is called conditioned fear stress-induced freezing behavior, and has been used as a model of anxiety. Using this animal model, the present study tried to characterize the anxiolytic-like effects of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, milnacipran, a serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic in mice. Fluvoxamine (1.25-10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and milnacipran (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.p.) each dose-dependently and significantly suppressed the conditioned fear stress-induced freezing behavior in mice, an indicator of anxiety, and milnacipran had a weaker effect than fluvoxamine. While risperidone also significantly suppressed freezing behavior at a low dose (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.), a high dose (0.04 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased spontaneous motor activity. On the contrary, sulpiride, a typical antipsychotic (2-8 mg/kg, i.p.), did not affect freezing behavior. In a combination study, the suppressive effect of a low dose of risperidone (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) on freezing behavior was significantly antagonized by the co-administration of low/middle doses of fluvoxamine (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), whereas a high dose of fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was unaffected. Additionally, the co-administration of milnacipran (0.5-2 mg/kg, i.p.) also tended to inhibit the suppressive effect of risperidone (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings indicate that fluvoxamine, milnacipran and risperidone may each be clinically effective at treating anxiety disorders, but their effects may be attenuated in combination with other medications.

AB  - During Messinian time, the Mediterranean underwent hydrological modifications culminating 5.97 Ma ago with the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC). Evaporite deposition and alleged annihilation of most marine eukaryotes were taken as evidence of the establishment of basin-wide hypersalinity followed by desiccation. However, the palaeoenvironmental conditions during the MSC are still a matter of debate, chiefly because most of its sedimentary record is buried below the abyssal plains of the present-day Mediterranean Sea. To shed light on environmental change at the advent and during the early phase of the MSC, we investigated the Govone section from the Piedmont Basin (NW Italy) using a multidisciplinary approach (organic geochemical, petrographic, and carbon and oxygen stable isotope analyses). The Govone section archives the onset of the crisis in a succession of organic-rich shales and dolomite-rich marls. The MSC part of the succession represents the deep-water equivalent of sulphate evaporites deposited at the basin margins during the first phase of the crisis. Our study reveals that the onset of the MSC was marked by the intensification of water-column stratification, rather than the establishment of widespread hypersaline conditions. A chemocline divided the water column into an oxygen-depleted, denser and more saline bottom layer and an oxygenated, upper seawater layer influenced by freshwater inflow. Vertical oscillations of the chemocline controlled the stratigraphic architecture of the sediments pertaining to the first stage of the MSC. Accordingly, temporal and spatial changes of water masses with different redox chemistries must be considered when interpreting the MSC event.

AB  - Engineered sulfate injection has been introduced as an effective technology to enhance the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. While some studies indicate that sulfate injection is a promising method for the treatment of hydrocarbon-contaminated subsurface systems, its application in the brackish soil environments is unknown. In this study, we explored related geochemical indicators along with soil adsorption and dissolved phase concentrations to provide an improved understanding of the hydrocarbon-contaminated subsurface responses to the sulfate injection in brackish environments. A series of flow-through experiments representing in situ groundwater anaerobic bioremediation were conducted and two sulfate injection episodes were applied to examine the degradation of dissolved naphthalene under low salinity and brackish conditions. As opposed to the substantial body of previous studies that salinity restricts biodegradation, the results from this study showed that naphthalene anaerobic degradation was more stable once the salinity was as high as that at the sampling location in the coastal brackish environment. While increasing naphthalene concentration from 4 to 12 mg L(-1)did not limit biodegradation efficiency under brackish condition similar to the sampling location, it adversely restricted the developed reducing conditions and biodegradation process under low salinity conditions. This highlights the adaption of the microbial communities within the soil to the brackish environment at the sampling location suggesting that changing the salinity during engineered sulfate application can make the remediation process more susceptible against the environmental stresses and substrate toxicity. The results of this study provide insight into the engineered sulfate application as a remediation strategy for potential removal of dissolved naphthalene from the contaminated brackish groundwater.

AB  - Developmental stability of an individual is often evaluated by means of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in bilaterally paired morphological characters. Even though FA has been widely investigated in ungulates, its connection with the condition of individuals and their environment is still debated. In this study we investigated factors contributing to FA in horn length in the sexually monomorphic Alpine chamois. We measured right and left horn length of 1682 Alpine chamois (N-females = 734; N-males = 948) shot during 2 consecutive hunting seasons (2015 and 2016) in 7 neighbouring districts in Central-Eastern Alps (Italy). We found no consistent left or right bias. Within our study population, FA values were normally distributed around a mean value that was not significantly different from zero (Skewness = - 0.107, SE = 0.06; Kurtosis = - 0.055, SE = 0.119). We also found that absolute FA in horn length was affected by environmental and climatic conditions experienced by the individuals during their first year and half of life. Statistically significant differences between right and left horn length were found with higher local population density and lower forage quality (i.e., siliceous substrate). Moreover, snow cover duration during the individuals' first winter increased horn length asymmetry. No individual characteristics played a role in promoting horn length asymmetry. The associations between exposure to stressors and deviations from bilateral symmetry suggest that absolute FA can be used to identify populations whose individuals experienced stressful conditions early in life. We found in this relatively monomorphic species that both male and female horns were equally affected by climate, substrate, and local population density, thus showing that large male secondary sexual characters, such as the antlers of deer stags, are not the only traits which can be influenced by a negative environment and exhibit increasing FA.

AB  - Simple Summary: The primary aim of this paper is to develop decision trees to predict rabbits' physiological responses, such as the respiratory rate or ear temperature, based on environmental variables (dry bulb temperature and relative humidity). The decision tree for ear temperature exhibited better statistical indices, indicating the benefits of using the ear temperature as an indicator of thermal stress. Our findings confirm that the resulting decision trees are powerful classifiers, and the results can be easily understood. Hence, the proposed decisions trees can aid in investigating the influence of environmental conditions on physiological responses and, consequently, the rabbits' welfare. These results can be used in practical situations and can be obtained in real time to support rabbit breeders in decision-making to improve environmental conditions for rabbits.
   The thermal environment inside a rabbit house affects the physiological responses and consequently the production of the animals. Thus, models are needed to assist rabbit producers in decision-making to maintain the production environment within the zone of thermoneutrality for the animals. The aim of this paper is to develop decision trees to predict the physiological responses of rabbits based on environmental variables. The experiment was performed in a rabbit house with 26 rabbits at eight weeks of age. The experimental database is composed of 546 observed data points. Sixty decision tree models for the prediction of respiratory rate (RR, mov.min(-1)) and ear temperature (ET, degrees C) of rabbits exposed to different combinations of dry bulb temperature (t(db), degrees C) and relative humidity (RH, %) were developed. The ET model exhibited better statistical indices than the RR model. The developed decision trees can be used in practical situations to provide a rapid evaluation of rabbit welfare conditions based on environmental variables and physiological responses. This information can be obtained in real time and may help rabbit breeders in decision-making to provide satisfactory environmental conditions for rabbits.

AB  - Carp (Cyprinidae) is one of the dominating and most valuable fish species in fish farming. Under conditions of high-intensity cultivation, fish are systematically exposed to extreme factors that cause stress reactions, accompanied by changes in the functional state of the defense of the body systems and exert impact, primarily, on hematological parameters. The hemostatic system is one such defense systems, which counteracts bleeding through a coagulation mechanism. Hemocoagulation follows the same pattern in all vertebrates, from jawless fish to mammals, and represents an ancient adaptation of animals to stressful conditions, often associated with blood loss in nature. This research aimed to study the effect of hormone-induced stress on plasma (secondary) hemostasis in fish. Given the data fragmentation and differences in methodology and conditions, the lack of standardization in studying hemostasis in fish, especially in critical conditions, this problem remains not fully disclosed in global science. The article presents the results of studying carp (Cyprinus carpio) coagulogram parameters under the influence of acute and chronic stress responses, simulated by injections of synthetic cortisol analogs (dexamethasone for short-term stress, and betamethasone for chronic stress) during 21 days. The dynamics of these indicators were analyzed in comparison to intact fish. It has been established that by accelerating the activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and increasing the amount of fibrinogen in the blood of fish, blood coagulation processes were clearly accelerated in all groups of animals tested by the last day of the experiment. The dynamics of other parameters, such as the content of soluble fibrin monomer complexes or antithrombin III content, indicated the simultaneous development of hypercoagulation processes in some groups. Assumptions have been made to explain the pattern of changes observed not only in treated fish but also in control animals.

AB  - The economic crisis, which started in late 2007, had a major impact on countries' labour markets, and triggered a rise in the number of non-standard contracts. Most European Union (EU) countries witnessed a significant increase in part-time jobs. This type of employment and its working conditions may have a negative impact on the health and well-being of workers, especially women. The aims of this paper are: 1) to determine whether there are differences in levels of part-time workers' health and well-being by gender for the EU as a whole as well as for each European country individually, and 2) to ascertain which determinants impact female part-time workers' health and well-being. A Synthetic Health and Well-being Indicator (SHWI) was designed using the measure of P-2 distance approach as a methodological tool. In order to explore the determinants for female part-timers, linear regressions were used adopting a multilevel analysis based on data from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey.
   The main results show that female part-time workers display lower levels of health and well-being than their male counterparts in the EU. Factors such as the nature of the work, difficulty making ends meet, perceived job insecurity, social support and work-life balance play an essential role in levels of female part-timers' health and well-being. We may conclude that, in addition to greater institutional support for the inclusion of women in the labour market, changes in public policies designed to improve working conditions (better schedules and a greater presence of non-manual skilled jobs) coupled with changes in family policy, could play a key role in reducing gender differences.

AB  - The Mun River Basin is the main grain-producing area of northeastern Thailand. Natural factors in this area have led to significant dry and rainy seasons, which, coupled with human influences, have further resulted in spatial and temporal differences in soil conditions, leading to low agricultural productivity. Therefore, an analysis of the soil conditions in the dry season and in the rainy season in the Mun River Basin is necessary for soil remediation and improvement, which will be good for regional agricultural development. This study used soil samples in the dry season and rainy season to determine the differences in indicators and soil quality at temporal and spatial scales in the Mun River Basin. The minimum dataset theory was used to screen evaluation indicators, a geographically weighted regression was selected to finish the spatial interpolations of soil indicators, and a fuzzy logic model was used to evaluate the soil quality. The results showed that the spatial distributions of different indicators and soil quality were similar, with the soil contents and quality decreasing from the west to east of the basin. However, the contents of soil organic matter and available phosphorus decreased, while total nitrogen increased at different times, and approximately 58% of the basin had an increase in the soil quality from the dry season to the rainy season. The overall soil condition of the basin was poor, and the soil quality in the rainy season was more uniform than that in the dry season. The soil quality in forests and dry fields was higher than in other land use types, while the soil conditions in most paddy fields were not ideal. In general, the results were helpful for soil improvement and for increasing the grain production in the Mun River Basin.

AB  - Transport and natural attenuation of contaminant plumes in groundwater are often controlled by transverse dispersion. The extent of mixing between dissolved reaction partners at the fringe of a plume determines its length and depends strongly on the groundwater flow field. Transient flow conditions as well as the focusing of the flow in high-permeability zones may enhance transverse mixing of dissolved species and, therefore, create favorable conditions for the natural attenuation of contaminant plumes. The aim of the present study is to experimentally test the influence of these processes on solute mixing and to directly compare the results with those under analogous homogeneous and steady-state conditions. We have performed conservative and reactive tracer experiments in a quasi two-dimensional tank filled with glass beads of different sizes. The experiments have been carried out in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media under steady-state and transient (i.e. oscillating) flow fields. We used fluorescein as conservative tracer; whereas an alkaline solution (NaOH) was injected into ambient acidic water (HCl) in the reactive experiments. A pH indicator was added to the reacting solutions in order to visualize the emerging plume. We simulated the laboratory experiments with a numerical model and compared the outcomes of the model with the measured concentrations at the outlet of the tank and with the observed tracer plumes. Spatial moments, a newly defined flux-related dilution index, the product mass fluxes and the reaction enhancement factors were calculated to quantify the differences in mixing and reaction extent under various experimental conditions. The results show that flow focusing in heterogeneous porous media significantly enhances transverse mixing and mixing-controlled reactions, whereas temporally changing flow fields appear to be of minor importance.

AB  - The high degree of microbial diversity found in soils is attributed to the highly heterogeneous pore space and the dynamic aqueous microenvironments. Previous studies have shown that spatial and temporal variations in aqueous diffusion pathways play an important role in shaping microbial habitats and biological activity in unsaturated porous media. A new modeling framework was developed for the quantitative description of diffusion-dominated microbial interactions focusing on competitive growth of two microbial species inhabiting partially saturated rough surfaces. Surface heterogeneity was represented by patches with different porosities and water retention properties, yielding heterogeneous distribution of water contents that varies with changes in relative humidity or soil matric potential. Nutrient diffusion and microbial growth on the variably hydrated and heterogeneous surface was modeled using a hybrid method that combines a reaction diffusion method for nutrient field with individual based model for microbial growth and expansion. The model elucidated the effects of hydration dynamics and heterogeneity on nutrient fluxes and mobility affecting microbial population growth, expansion, and coexistence at the microscale. In contrast with single species dominance under wet conditions, results demonstrated prolonged coexistence of two competing species under drier conditions where nutrient diffusion and microbial movement were both limited. The uneven distribution of resources and diffusion pathways in heterogeneous surfaces highlighted the importance of position in the landscape for survival that may compensate for competitive disadvantages conferred by physiological traits. Increased motility was beneficial for expansion and survival. Temporal variations in hydration conditions resulted in fluctuations in microbial growth rate and population size. Population growth dynamics of the dominant species under wet-dry cycles were similar to growth under average value of diffusion coefficients for dry and wet conditions, respectively, suggesting that the time-averaged diffusion coefficient could serve as a useful indicator for estimation of microbial activities in a highly dynamic system such as that found in soils.

AB  - Stacked denoising autoencoder is one of the most classic models of deep learning. However, there are two problems in the traditional stacked denoising autoencoder: (1) the parameter selection of stacked denoising autoencoder mainly depends on expert experience and (2) stacked denoising autoencoder is mainly restricted to learn automatically single-domain features from raw vibration signals while identifying the fault type, which implies that no linear mapping relationship located in other domains of vibration data is neglected, which may lead to the imperfect diagnostic results. Consequently, to address these issues, learn the well-rounded feature representation, and improve recognition accuracy, this article presents a novel approach called multi-domain indicator-based optimized stacked denoising autoencoder for automatic fault identification of rolling bearing. First, multi-domain indicator of the original vibration signal is constructed through calculating the expression of different domains (e.g. time frequency domain, and time frequency domain). Second, the constructed multi-domain indicator is regarded as the input dataset to train stacked denoising autoencoder architecture containing three hidden layers, and a recently reported nature-inspired algorithm named grasshopper optimization algorithm is employed to synchronously determine the model parameters of stacked denoising autoencoder, which is aimed at learning more robust and reliable feature representation. Finally, the feature representation learned in the testing set is fed into the trained stacked denoising autoencoder model containing softmax classifier for identifying bearing health conditions. The presented method is evaluated using two bearing vibration datasets. Experimental results indicate that our approach can provide high-accuracy recognition over 99% for bearing health condition, and it achieves more decent and precise classification results compared with some shallow learning model and standard deep learning architecture.

AB  - Alexandrium is a widely spread dinoflagellate genus throughout many regions of the world, which not only causes the harmful algal blooms (HABs) but also results in the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) throughout the world. This study compared protein profiles of A. catenella grown under different growth phases and conditions using a proteomic approach, and identified the differentially expressed proteins. The results showed that the expressions of proteins identified in three different regions of the gels, the groups 1, 2 and 3 proteins, varied significantly with the growth phases and conditions. Group 1 proteins and six Group 2 proteins were highly expressed at the initial, exponential and stationary growth phases, eight Group 2 proteins were highly expressed only at the initial phase, and Group 3 proteins were highly expressed at the exponential and/or stationary phases. However, all these proteins were expressed at low levels or were barely visible at the dissipation phase. The expressions of groups 1 and 2 proteins were low or barely visible in various growth conditions except in continuous darkness they were highly expressed. Group 3 proteins, on the other hand, were overexpressed in continuous illumination and expressed at low levels or barely visible in continuous darkness or under nitrate-starvation. The data from MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry demonstrated that these differentially expressed proteins were associated with macromolecular biosynthesis, photosynthesis, tRNA synthesis and DNA stability, stress response and cell division regulation. Synthetase was the major component of the altered proteins. This is one of the first comprehensive proteomic study of a dinoflagellate, A. catenella, that provides a fundamental understanding of the proteins involved in A. catenella growth and response to environmental stresses, and potential physiological indicator proteins related to growth and environmental stress have been identified.

AB  - Passive microwave soil moisture datasets can be used as an input to provide an integrated assessment of climate variability as it relates to agricultural production. The objective of this research was to examine three passive microwave derived soil moisture datasets over multiple growing seasons in contrasting Canadian agricultural environments. Absolute and relative soil moisture was evaluated from two globally available datasets from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) sensor using different retrieval algorithms, as well as relative soil wetness at a weekly scale from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensor. At a daily scale, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) provides a better estimate of surface soil moisture conditions than the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) dataset, with root mean squared errors ranging from 5 to 10% for LPRM and 12 to 18% for NSIDC soil moisture when a temporal smoothing is applied to the dataset. Both datasets provided better estimates of soil moisture over the temperate site near Elora, Ontario than the prairie site near Davidson, Saskatchewan. The LPRM dataset tends to overestimate soil moisture conditions at both sites, where the NSIDC dataset tends to underestimate absolute soil moisture. These differences in retrieval methods were independent of radiometric frequency used. At weekly scales, the LPRM dataset provides a better relative estimate of wetness conditions when compared to the NSIDC and the Basist Wetness Index (BWI) from SSM/I data, but the SSM/I dataset did provide a reasonably good relative indicator of moisture conditions. The high variability in accuracy of soil moisture estimation related to retrieval algorithms indicates that consistency is needed in these datasets if they are to be integrated in long term studies for yield estimation or data assimilation.

AB  - Drought events will become more frequent due the climate change. In floodplains, periphytic algae are responsible for part of the primary production, are the principal source of organic carbon deposition, play an important role in mineralization and nutrient cycling, and are the base of the food web for many organisms. As algae distribution in aquatic environments is a strong indicator of physical and chemical conditions of the sites, we aimed to determine the structure of periphytic algae in lentic and lotic environments during drought conditions and to uncover the main local abiotic factors in community structuring. We hypothesized diatoms would be more frequent than green algae and desmids at both sites, due to their resistance characteristics, and that higher periphyton algal richness, density and diversity would occur in the lake due to the greater availability of nutrients and the absence of flow. The study was carried out in the Finado Raimundo lake and the Ivinhema river in the Upper Parana river floodplain during the low water period of 2011. Petioles of the aquatic macrophyte Eichhornia azurea (Sw.) Kunth were used as a substrate for periphytic algae. We found a total of 171 species, 104 species in the lake and 80 in the river. Diatoms were predominant at both sites due to their strategic traits, and between sites, there were different patterns in the periphytic algal community structure, owing to the distinctive physical and chemical characteristics of the lake and the river. Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki and Nitzschia palea (Kutzing) W. Smith were the most abundant species in both environments. Our results showed patterns of periphytic algae in a floodplain during drought conditions, which will assist in understanding their structuring during future drought scenarios.

AB  - Sewage sludges are a rich underused source of phosphorus (P) which contributes to environmental degradation, yet if recaptured, could return significant amounts of P to agricultural systems. Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) can efficiently recover P, with the added ability to transform P species into potentially more desirable forms for direct application to crops. P dynamics in hydrochars have primarily examined P speciation and chemical extractability as indicators of P bioavailability, but few studies directly evaluate the agronomic effectiveness of hydrochars as P fertilisers. As such, there is a clear need to assess the suitability of hydrochar as a source of bioavailable P in plant systems and the influence of HTC synthesis conditions. Response Surface Modelling of HTC synthesis conditions (pH, temperature and time), revealed initial pH significantly influence P distribution. Mild conditions of 180 degrees C for 30 min at pH 8.0 maximised P recovery (99%) along with carbon (62%) and nitrogen (43%) in hydrochars. Systematic characterisation of hydrochar P by chemical extraction and P L2,3-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy revealed H2O, NaHCO3 and NaOH- P fractions were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in all hydrochars, while HCl-P fraction increased with HTC temperatures at pH 7. In contrast, P L2,3-edge XANES spectra were remarkably similar in raw sludges and corresponding hydrochars, regardless of HTC temperature or pH, revealing P was predominantly present as ferric phosphate with some hydroxyapatite. Multiple linear regression modelling suggested a significant relationship between chemical extractability and P bioavailability to wheat present in the raw sludges and hydrochars. This research provides further insight into the potential to use hydrothermal treatment for recovery and agricultural reuse of P, the importance of operational conditions on P transformation and the relationship between P speciation and bioavailability. The value of sewage sludge in a more sustainable global P cycle is also highlighted.

AB  - Decapod crustaceans are a valuable seafood product and although their price is typically gauged by their overall size, the quality of the product (organ/muscle mass and moisture content) is also important. The current study investigated the use of the serumprotein concentration (determined from the refractive index) as an indicator of the quality and physiological condition of the adult lobster Homarus americanus (Milne-Edwards, 1837). Lobsters were maintained in a variety of feeding regimes and environmental conditions for 6 mo in both the laboratory and in the field. A hand-held refractometer was used to determine serumprotein concentrations indirectly. At the end of the experimental period, the lobsters were killed and the hepatopancreas and heart mass, edible meat content, and moisture content of the hepatopancreas and muscle tissue were measured. In each case, there was a significant correlation with serum protein concentration. Serum protein concentration increased linearly with hepatopancreas mass, heart mass, and edible meat content. There was a concomitant decrease in serum protein concentration with increasing moisture content of the hepatopancreas and muscle tissue. Food intake had a significant effect, with higher serum protein concentrations and thus larger organs, in animals that were maintained on a high-feeding frequency regime. The serum protein concentration also changed during the molt cycle, reaching its highest levels during the premolt stage followed by a sharp decrease after the lobsters had molted. The serum protein concentration increased slowly thereafter and, 12 wk after molting, had reached levels that were similar to those measured at the start of the experiment. This rapid and noninvasive method has the potential to be a valuable tool for determining quality and physiological status of commercially important decapod crustaceans.

AB  - Direct-seeding of rice has become popular in recent years due to its low cost and convenience, however, hypoxic condition limits seedling establishment. In this study, weedy rice WR04-6 with high germination ability under anaerobic conditions was used as a gene donor, and we successfully improved the seedling establishment rate of rice cultivar Qishanzhan (QSZ) based on selection of a new rice line R42 from the recombinant inbred line population. R42 inherited high anaerobic germination (AG) ability, and was used for isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based comparative proteomic studies with QSZ to further explore the molecular mechanism of AG. A total of 719 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were shared by R42 and QSZ responded to AG, and thus defined as common response DAPs. A total of 300 DAPs that responded to AG were only identified from R42, which were defined as tolerance-specific DAPs. The common response and tolerance-specific DAPs had similar biochemical reaction processes and metabolic pathways in response to anoxic stress, however, they involved different proteins. The tolerance-specific DAPs were involved in amino acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, ethylene synthesis pathway, cell wall-associated proteins and activity of active oxygen scavenging enzyme. The in silico protein-protein interactions for the top 60 DAPs indicated that tolerance-specific DAPs had relatively independent protein interaction networks in response to an anoxic environment compared with common response DAPs. The results of physiological indicators showed alpha-amylase and superoxide dismutase activities of R42 were significantly increased under anoxic conditions compared with aerobic conditions. Multiple lines of evidence from western blot, physiological analysis and quantitative real-time PCR jointly supported the reliability of proteomics data. In summary, our findings deepened the understanding of the molecular mechanism for the rice response to AG.

AB  - Stoco Lake (Tweed, Ontario, Canada) has a history of industrial contamination and is heavily influenced by inflow from the Moira River. Stoco Lake is frequently affected by nuisance algal blooms (including cyanobacteria), which have largely been attributed to cultural eutrophication. To further our understanding of the environmental dynamics of Stoco Lake, we applied paleolimnological techniques to examine long-term trends in subfossil invertebrate assemblages, geochemistry, and inferred trends in whole-lake primary production from a sediment core representing similar to 70 years of environmental history. We examined past trends in Simuliidae abundance, geochemical variables, and historical river flow records to examine past hydrological conditions in Stoco Lake. Inferred whole-lake primary production and sediment core organic content increased between the late 1950s and early 1970s, likely reflecting increased eutrophication (e.g. from agricultural intensification and increased catchment activities), with some stabilization in the post-1970s sediments coinciding with the installation of a sewage treatment plant. The geochemical composition of the core highlighted the decrease in catchment-derived sediment inputs and an increase in percentage of organic content towards the top of the core. In addition, declines in the proportion of As and Ni coincided with the closure of the upstream Deloro Mine Site in the 1960s. Chironomidae and Chaoboridae (Diptera) assemblages indicate expansion of littoral habitat after the 1960s and a general stability of low-oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion over the past similar to 70 years. Several Simuliidae (Diptera: Nematocera) remains, indicators of fluvial conditions rarely discussed in paleolimnological studies, were present at their highest abundances in the pre- similar to 1975 sediments of the core, but disappeared after the early 1990s. Our findings suggest that changes in river flow (discharge, velocity, or seasonality) may have contributed to recent algal blooms. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Simuliidae in paleohydrological studies to help understand the role of river flow on lake conditions.

AB  - By comparing the compositions of glacial and interglacial intervals of the Late Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene from different parts of Lake Baikal, we demonstrate the use of the Baikal clay mineral associations as indicators of past changes of environment and climate. The methodical part of this work discusses the optimal sample preparation techniques and develops the previously suggested method for structural modeling of X-ray diffraction patterns as the most suitable for studying the Baikal sediments, The clay mineral associations in the Selenga delta area and at the Akademichesky Ridge are very similar, thus indicating a minor influence of local sediment sources on their formation. The similarities revealed by this comparison indicate uniformity of the Baikal catchment basin in terms of the processes of erosion, weathering, and supply of sediments.
   Despite the conditions of continuous hemipelagic sedimentation at the sites where deep drilling took place, both drill cores reveal a strong relation between the composition of clay mineral associations and paleoclimatic conditions. Intervals if glacial sediments during both the Late Pleistocene and the Late Pliocene are similar and are characterized by dramatic enrichment in well-crystallized mica (muscovite) and plagioclase, indicating intensification of physical weathering under cold climatic conditions, Interglacial intervals are enriched in fine illite, which suggests that it is a secondary mineral, the product of chemical weathering. In addition, the content of smectite layers in mire layer illite-smectite increases during interglacials, which is also likely to imply a warmer and more humid climate.
   The lower interval of the BDP-96 core with the age over 4.5 Ma is characterized by an anomalous composition: high content of illite-smectite with a high concentration of smectite component, the presence of chlorite-smectite, and low contents of illite and muscovite. This specific mineral association has formed under climatic conditions much warmer than at present.

AB  - It has been well established that carotenoid and melanin pigmentation are often condition-dependent traits in vertebrates. Expression of carotenoid coloration in birds has been shown to reflect pigment intake, food access and parasite load; however, the relative importance of and the potential interactions among these factors have not been previously considered. Moreover, carotenoid and melanin pigmentation have been proposed to signal fundamentally different aspects of individual condition but few data exist to test this idea. We simultaneously manipulated three environmental conditions under which American goldfinches (Cardeulis tristis) grew colorful feathers and developed carotenoid pigmentation of their bills. Male goldfinches were held with either high or low carotenoid supplementation, pulsed or continuous antimicrobial drug treatment, or restricted or unlimited access to food. Carotenoid supplementation had an overriding effect on yellow feather coloration. Males given more lutein and zeaxanthin grew yellow feathers with hue shifted toward orange and with higher yellow chroma than males supplemented with fewer carotenoids. Parasites and food access did not significantly affect yellow feather coloration, and there were only minor interaction effects for the three treatments. By contrast, bill coloration was significantly affected by all three treatments. Carotenoid supplementation had a significant effect on yellow chroma of bills, drug treatment and food access both had a significant effect on bill hue, and food access had a significant effect on the yellow brightness of bills. Neither the size nor blackness of the black caps of male goldfinches was affected by any treatment. These results indicate that pigment intake, food access and parasite load can have complex and variable effects on color displays, and that feather and bill coloration signal different aspects of male condition.

AB  - In the machining of heat resistant super alloys used in aeronautical applications and classified as difficult-to-machine materials, the consumption of cooling lubricant during the machining operations is very important. The associated costs of coolant acquisition, use, disposal and washing the machined components are significant, up to four times the cost of consumable tooling used in the cutting operations. To reduce the costs of production and to make the processes environmentally safe, the goal of the aeronautical manufacturers is to move toward dry cutting by eliminating or minimising cutting fluids. This goal can be achieved by using coated carbide tools at high cutting speeds. To achieve this goal, different coated tools and different cutting conditions were tested in dry conditions. The elementary orthogonal cutting process was chosen, the cutting and feed cutting forces components were measured and the cutting force ratio calculated. This ratio is shown to be as an interesting indicator of tool wear. The tool wear mechanisms tool were analysed by using white light interferometer and scanning electron microscopy coupled to an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS-system. The EDS was very useful to analyse the elements deposited on the cutting tool faces. The ability of the different coatings to increase the carbide tool performance were analysed, the main wear modes were depicted. An optimisation of the cutting conditions was finally proposed and the efficiency of the coatings was shown. The results coming from uncoated tools were compared with those obtained with coated tools under the same conditions of machining. At the end, a choice of coatings is proposed and an extension of this study to an industrial machining operation is presented for future developments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recognized widely as emerging contaminants. Sulindac has received additional attention as a prodrug in cancer treatment and because of its detection in drinking water and wastewaters. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about its kinetic behaviour and fate in the aquatic environment. In this work, the direct photolysis of sulindac, in which photochemical reactions were monitored and phototransformation products identified, was investigated under prolonged periods using UV-A and UV-B radiation and pH conditions (2 and 7) to evaluate the effect of the protonation state and the efficiency of the photolytic process. A novel kinetic mechanism has been proposed in which sulindac exhibits a consecutive reaction pathway, with pseudo-first order kinetics for rapid and reversible Z to E isomerization. Once photoequilibrium was reached, second-order degradation of the isomers in the presence of the new photodegradation products was observed. Photochemical transformation was faster under UV-B irradiation and lower pH, which suggests greater persistence of sulindac at more relevant environmental conditions of UV-A and pH 7. Two novel and major byproducts were identified, corresponding to the oxidative cleavage of the alkene exo to the indene system. The degradation pathway is mainly photoinduced, enhanced by acidic conditions and presumes the double bond as the most reactive site for the parent compound. This research demonstrates an approach for determining kinetics of compounds under challenging conditions, including, absorption from multiple electronic transitions, photoinduced products with unknown extinction coefficients, concentration dependence, photoinduced sensitizing intermediates, and speciation effects. Our work greatly improves our understanding of the degradation process of sulindac and will contribute to exposure assessments and treatment methodologies for this compound in impacted waters.

AB  - Within the drinking water distribution system (DWDS) using chloramine as disinfectant, nitrification caused by nitrifying bacteria is increasingly becoming a concern as it poses a great challenge for maintaining water quality. To investigate efficient control strategies, operational conditions including hydraulic regimes and disinfectant scenarios were controlled within a flow cell experimental facility. Two test phases were conducted to investigate the effects on the extent of nitrification of three flow rates (Q = 2, 6, and 10 L/min) and four disinfection scenarios (total Cl-2=1 mg/L, Cl-2/NH3-N=3:1; total Cl-2=1 mg/L, Cl-2/NH3-N=5:1; total Cl-2=5 mg/L, Cl-2/NH3-N=3:1; and total Cl-2=5 mg/L, Cl-2/NH3-N=5:1). Physico-chemical parameters and nitrification indicators were monitored during the tests. The characteristics of biofilm extracellular polymetric substance (EPS) were evaluated after the experiment. The main results from the study indicate that nitrification is affected by hydraulic conditions and the process tends to be severe when the fluid flow transforms from laminar to turbulent (2300<Re<4000). Increasing disinfectant concentration and optimizing Cl-2/NH3-N mass ratio were found to inhibit nitrification to some extend when the system was running at turbulent condition (Q = 10 L/min, Re = 5535). EPS extracted from biofilm that was established at the flow rate of 6 L/min had greater carbohydrate/protein ratio. Furthermore, several nitrification indicators were evaluated for their prediction efficiency and the results suggest that the change of nitrite, together with total organic carbon (TOG) and turbidity can indicate nitrification potential efficiently.

AB  - The restoration of meadowland using the pond and plug technique of gully elimination was performed in a 9-mile segment along Last Chance Creek, Feather River Basin, California, in order to rehabilitate floodplain functions such as mitigating floods, retaining groundwater, and reducing sediment yield associated with bank erosion and to significantly alter the hydrologic regime. However, because the atmospheric and hydrological conditions have evolved over the restoration period, it was difficult to obtain a comprehensible evaluation of the impact of restoration activities by means of field measurements. In this paper, a new use of physically based models for environmental assessment is described. The atmospheric conditions over the sparsely gauged Last Chance Creek watershed (which does not have any precipitation or weather stations) during the combined historical critical dry and wet period (1982-1993) were reconstructed over the whole watershed using the atmospheric fifth-generation mesoscale model driven with the US National Center for Atmospheric Research and US National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. Using the downscaled atmospheric data as its input, the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model was applied to this watershed. All physical parameters of the WEHY model were derived from the existing geographic information system and satellite-driven data sets. By comparing the prerestoration and postrestoration simulation results under the identical atmospheric conditions, a more complete environmental assessment of the restoration project was made. Model results indicate that the flood peak may be reduced by 10-20% during the wet year and the baseflow may be enhanced by 10-20% during the following dry seasons (summer to fall) in the postrestoration condition. The model results also showed that the hydrologic impact of the land management associated with the restoration mitigates bank erosion and sediment discharge during winter storm events.

AB  - In general terms, plant managers of sites producing construction wastes assess materials according to concise, legally recommended leaching tests that do not consider the compaction stage of the materials when they are applied on-site. Thus, the tests do not account for the real on-site physical conditions of the recycled aggregates used in civil works (e.g., roads or embankments). This leads to errors in estimating the pollutant potential of these materials. For that reason, in the present research, an experimental procedure is designed as a leaching test for construction materials under compaction. The aim of this laboratory test (designed specifically for the granular materials used in civil engineering infrastructures) is to evaluate the release of pollutant elements when the recycled aggregate is tested at its commercial grain-size distribution and when the material is compacted under on-site conditions. Two recycled aggregates with different gypsum contents (0.95 and 2.57%) were used in this study. In addition to the designed leaching laboratory test, the conventional compliance leaching test and the Dutch percolation test were performed. The results of the new leaching method were compared with the conventional leaching test results. After analysis, the chromium and sulphate levels obtained from the newly designed test were lower than those obtained from the conventional leaching test, and these were considered more seriously pollutant elements. This result confirms that when the leaching behaviour is evaluated for construction aggregates without density alteration, crushing the aggregate and using only the finest fraction, as is done in the conventional test (which is an unrealistic situation for aggregates that are applied under on-site conditions), the leaching behaviour is not accurately assessed.

AB  - In aquaculture, fish are exposed to unavoidable stressors that can be detrimental for their health and welfare. However, welfare in farmed fish can be difficult to assess, and, so far, no standardized test has been universally accepted as a welfare indicator. This work contributes to the establishment of behavioural welfare indicators in a marine teleost in response to different water quality acute stressors. Groups of ten fish were exposed to high Total Ammonia Nitrogen concentration (High TAN, 18 mg.L-1), Hyperoxia (200 % O-2 saturation), Hypoxia (20 % O-2 saturation), or control water quality (100% O-2 saturation and TAN < 2.5 mg.L-1) over 1 hour. Fish were then transferred in a novel environment for a group behaviour test under the same water quality conditions over 2 hours. Videos were recorded to assess thigmotaxis, activity and group cohesion. After this challenge, plasma cortisol concentration was measured in a subsample, while individual behavioural response was measured in the other fish using novel tank diving test. Prior to this study, the novel tank diving test was validated as a behavioural challenge indicative of anxiety state, by using nicotine as anxiolytic drug. Overall, all stress conditions induced a decrease in activity and thigmotaxis and changes in group cohesion while only fish exposed to Hypoxia and High TAN conditions displayed elevated plasma cortisol concentrations. In post-stress condition, activity was still affected but normal behaviour was recovered within the 25 minutes of the test duration. Our work suggests that the activity, thigmotaxis and group cohesion are good behavioural indicators of exposure to degraded water quality, and could be used as standardized measures to assess fish welfare.

AB  - Compound dry and hot conditions frequently cause large impacts on ecosystems and societies worldwide. A suite of indices is available for the assessment of droughts and heatwaves, yet there is no index available for incorporating the joint variability of dry and hot conditions at the sub-monthly scale. Here we introduce a daily-scale index, called the standardized compound drought and heat index (SCDHI), to assess compound dry-hot conditions. The SCDHI is based on a daily drought index (the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index - SAPEI), the daily-scale standardized temperature index (STI), and a joint probability distribution method. The new index is verified against real-world compound dry and hot events and associated observed vegetation impacts in China. The SCDHI can not only capture compound dry and hot events at both monthly and sub-monthly scales, but is also a good indicator for associated vegetation impacts. Using the SCDHI, we quantify the frequency, severity, duration, and intensity of compound dry-hot events during the historical period and assess the ability of climate models to reproduce these characteristics in China. We find that compound events whose severity is at least light and which last longer than 2 weeks generally persisted for 20-35 d in China. Southern China suffered from compound events most frequently, and the most severe compound events were mainly detected in this region. Climate models generally overestimate the frequency, duration, severity, and intensity of compound events in China, especially for western regions, which can be attributed to a too strong dependence between the SAPEI and STI in those models. The SCDHI provides a new tool to quantify sub-monthly characteristics of compound dry and hot events and to monitor their initiation, development, and decay. This is important information for decision-makers and stakeholders to release early and timely warnings.

AB  - Body mass is an important measure for ungulate management because it reflects the status of a wildlife population. A monitoring of body masses can help to identify changes in deer populations. In this study, the body masses of 990 age-known roe deer were analysed to better understand how body mass monitoring can be used to inform population management decisions. Our results show that roe deer increase in mass until they reach 19 months of age. The point at which individual animals reach adult mass differs by up to 38 days depending on environmental conditions (Figure 2). Within the same age class, body mass varies considerably, with juvenile animals weighing up to three times as much as others (Table 1). This difference can be explained by the high sensitivity of juvenile roe deer to weather conditions and to forage availability, quality and access. Among five month-old bucks, those born in the Alps had higher body masses than those born on the Swiss Plateau. This is likely due to the ability of mountain-born fawns to more easily access high-nutrient plants by moving up and down the mountain according to the phenology of their preferred forage. Although the body masses of fawns vary considerably due to environmental conditions (Figure 3), this difference disappears (in both does and bucks) when the animals reach adult status (Figure 4). Our results indicate that fawn body mass monitoring is useful for making timely population management decisions based on changed environmental conditions. Finally, body mass studies should be complemented by additional information related to body constitution, morphometry and parasite infections. A monitoring program that includes such indicators will better enable wildlife managers to detect stealthy changes in roe deer populations and to make well-formed management decisions.

AB  - It is important to assess the freezing and thawing condition of ground surface for understanding the impacts of frozen ground on surface and subsurface hydrology, the surface energy and moisture balance, ecosystem conservation, and engineering construction on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, assessing the changes of ground surface freezing and thawing condition on the QTP still remains a challenge owing to data sparseness and discontinuous observations. The annual ground surface freezing index (GFI) and ground surface thawing index (GTI) could be used to predict changes of the thermal regime of permafrost and can be good indicators of climate change on the QTP, which has important engineering applications. In this study, we first calibrated the reanalysis ground surface temperature (GST) data using the methods of elevation correction on the QTP. After calibration, the quality of reanalysis data has been improved significantly. For the annual time series, the root mean square error decreased from 7.7 to 1.6 degrees C, the absolute value of mean bias error decreased from 7.5 to 0.0 degrees C, and the correlation coefficient increased from 0.62 to 0.86. Second, we estimated the annual and seasonal spatial distributions of GST. The spatial distribution of spring and autumn GST closely resembled the annual mean pattern. The long-term mean GFI and GTI from the calibrated reanalysis dataset were 1322.3 and 2027.9 degrees C/day, respectively. The GFI and GTI were presented as latitude and elevation zonation; it can also be seen that permafrost mostly occurred in the high GFI and low GTI regions. Estimating the GFI and GTI precisely will be utilized to model the permafrost distribution and estimate active layer thickness in the future.

AB  - This paper reports the results of sedimentary facies analysis and organic geochemical investigations of the middle Member of the Jurassic Jhuran Formation of Kutch which is conspicuous by the occurrence of organic-rich shales. Five lithofacies have been identified for lower part of the Middle Member, e.g. Facies A: Black shale, Facies B: Black shale with siltstone inter-bedding, Facies C: shale and siltstone alternations with minor sandstones, Facies D: siltstone-sandstone alternations and Facies E: plane laminated and hummocky cross-stratified sandstone. The average TOC content of the shales decreases from facies A (av. TOC- 3.4%), to facies D (av. 0.6%) through facies B (av. 1.75%) and facies C (av. 1.34%). The Facies E comprises dominantly of hummocky cross-stratified sandstones. The facies study indicates storm-influenced, shallow marine depositional conditions. Organic geochemical study of shale samples collected from several outcrops from Bhuj to Zara suggests a mixture of type III and type IV kerogen, supplied from higher plant sources. Although most organic matters are mildly matured (av. Tmax c. 427 degrees C), some of the samples reflect overheating related to extrusion of Deccan basalt (av. Tmax c. 604 degrees C). V, Ni, and Co concentrations are indicative of anoxic condition within the depositional settings. The Ni/Co ratio (av. 2.5) and V/(V+Ni) ratio (av. 0.82) as well as size of pyrite framboids (7 to 20 micron), advocates intermittent anoxic and sulfidic conditions in the depositional setting. Black shales within the Jhuran Formation possibly suggest intermittent anoxia related to late Jurassic Oceanic anoxic event (OAE). Detailed investigations are needed to explain the factors causing anoxia in shallow marine conditions.

AB  - The applicability of microwave non-destructive testing (NDT) technique in characterization of matrix property of pharmaceutical films was investigated. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and loratadine were selected as model matrix polymer and drug, respectively. Both blank and drug loaded hydroxypropylmethylcellulose films were prepared using the solvent-evaporation method and were conditioned at the relative humidity of 25, 50 and 75% prior to physicochemical characterization using microwave NDT technique as well as ultraviolet spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FF-IR) techniques. The results indicated that blank hydroxypropylmethylcellulose film exhibited a greater propensity of polymer-polymer interaction at the O-H and C-H domains of the polymer chains upon conditioned at a lower level of relative humidity. In the case of loratadine loaded films, a greater propensity of polymer-polymer and/or drug-polymer interaction via the O-H moiety was mediated in samples conditioned at the lower level of relative humidity, and via the C-H moiety when 50% relative humidity was selected as the condition for sample storage. Apparently, the absorption and transmission characteristics of both blank and drug loaded films for microwave varied with the state of polymer-polymer and/or drug-polymer interaction involving the O-H and C-H moieties. The measurement of microwave NDT test at 8 GHz was sensitive to the chemical environment involving O-H moiety while it was greatly governed by the C-H moiety in test conducted at a higher frequency band of microwave. Similar observation was obtained with respect to the profiles of microwave NDT measurements against the state of polymer-polymer and/or drug-polymer interaction of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose films containing chlorpheniramine maleate. The microwave NDT measurement is potentially suitable for use as an apparent indicator of the state of polymer-polymer and drug-polymer interaction of the matrix. C (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural crack propagation analysis in thermal-fatigue fracture problem is a challenging problem. Reliable predictions for the crack path and residual live of structure provide essential information for the structural integrity assessment and repairment. Various conventional predictive fatigue models have been proposed to evaluate the remaining life, but most of them can't build an explicit relation between damage degree and fatigue life. In recent years, the advanced techniques on crack propagation analyses were proposed, which were used to simulate the fatigue crack growth, but no coupling thermal-fracture function existed in the commercial finite element codes. Fortunately, the extended finite element method (XFEM) in ABAQUS has the coupling permeation diffusion-fracture model. In this paper, an analogy method from coupling permeation diffusion-fracture to coupling thermal-fatigue is proposed to compute fatigue fracture, which is applied for predicting the fatigue life in a specific steam turbine by directly using ABAQUS. Typical fatigue experiments by compact specimens of cast iron are carried out for the fatigue parameters measurement. By using analogy method and Paris' Law, an entire analysis process for the turbine units is built to estimate the thermal-fatigue life. The simulation results predicting remaining life and analyzing fatigue crack growth for the pressurized cylinder are agreed well with the measured engineering data.

AB  - Herein, we explored resistance to fouling and the bactericidal potential of a functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT)-based polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Humic acid (HA), a main constituent in natural organic matter was used as an indicator for the estimation of organic fouling, while Escherichia coli was employed as a model bacterium for biofouling investigation. In-situ fouling characterization was performed using a non-destructive optical coherence tomography. Results revealed that a thin CNT layer on the PVDF surface effectively prevented HA molecules from interacting directly with the porous structure of membrane, thereby averting the possibility of pore blockage (irreversible fouling). Moreover, the CNT membranes offered higher permeability, increased HA rejection, and better flux restoration capacity as compared with pristine PVDF membrane. This superior anti-HA-fouling performance of CNT membrane was accredited to the electrostatic repulsions between the CNT layer and HA molecules, both carrying a strong negative charge and high density of hydrophilic functional groups on the CNT surface. Antibacterial results from the ultrastructural examination of cell membrane integrity authenticate the bactericidal potential of CNT membrane toward biofouling causing bacteria. Finally, when tested with real sea water, CNT membrane with less organic and biofouling propensity outperformed commercial PVDF, indicating their suitability for seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) pretreatment.

AB  - The Silurian-age organic-rich and organic-lean shales, located within Aydincik, Gulnar and Silifke districts of Mersin province in central Taurides, southern Turkey, is considered as an unconventional resources. These organic-rich and-lean shales are controlled by the similar geological, tectonic and sedimentary processes, as the passive margin basin has acted as the provenance region throughout the deposition of these shales. Geochemical data of major and trace elements obtained for a total of 39 outcrop samples were interpreted to determine the depositional model, water column productivity, amount of organic matter and preservation conditions. Total organic carbon (TOC) values of these organic-rich and-lean shales range from 0.56 to 4.06 wt. % and 0.01 to 0.38 wt. %. Several redox indicators, such as V systematics (V/Sc, V/Ni) as well as ratios of Ni/Co, Th/U and Mo/Mn, showed that the organic-rich shales were deposited in suboxic to anoxic environments, as opposed to oxic-dysoxic conditions for organic-lean ones. However, organic matter enrichment is not restrained by water column productivity, as indicated by a lack of correlation between TOC and productivity indexes (P/Ti and Ba/Al), but rather probably controlled by dysoxic-anoxic water column environment. In addition, a detrital material input cannot be ignored for its influence on organic matter enrichment in the shale deposition. The increase in the elastic fluxes probably resulted from the deposition in the extended shelf with coastal upwelling. A lack of correlation between K2O, Al2O3, SiO2 and TOC contents among these shales imply that clay minerals may not influence organic matter preservation. According to w(La)(N)/w(Yb)(N) and Sigma REE values, a high sedimentation rate is determined during the shale deposition, which would result in a dilution of organic matter. Furthermore, slight marine influences with sulphur limitation and low salinity, semi-arid/warm to humid-warm climatic conditions are widespread, according to total sulphur (TS), Sr/Ba, Sr/Cu, chemical index of alteration (CIA), C-value and related discrimination diagrams. In the end, a depositional model of the central Taurides shales is established to display an excellent preservation condition as the major controlling factor for organic matter enrichment in the Silurian shales.

AB  - The Barremian - Aptian boundary interval in northern Germany is characterized by a major lithologic turnover from dark-coloured, organic matter-rich towards light-coloured, organic matter-lean sedimentary rocks. To derive information on the respective environmental conditions and their development through time, organic matter from this interval was studied by petrographic and geochemical methods. The study was performed on five cored boreholes each recovering the Barremian - Aptian boundary interval, and also on two research wells in the same area covering the Late Albian for comparative purpose.
   The geochemical and petrographical data allow the differentiation of two organofacies. The lower succession is characterized by variable organic carbon contents which reach maximum values of up to 7% C(org) in the paper shale units ('Blattertone') and in the early Aptian Fish Shale ('Fischschiefer'; a possible product/equivalent of the Oceanic Anoxic Event la). Petrographically, the organic matter is mainly alginite and bituminite. It is moderately well preserved according to Hydrogen Index (KI) values between 150 and 450 mg HC/g C(org) far most of the samples. The n-alkane distribution reveals a contribution of both marine algae and terrestrial higher land plants. To explain these analytical results, a depositional model has been developed which is based on limited water exchange with the adjacent oceans having caused oxygen deficiency and deposition of numerous organic carbon-rich sediment layers. As revealed by HI values above 300 mg HC/g C(org) and by an n-alkane maximum at n-C(15), the organic matter in the Fischschiefer is mostly of marine origin. Furthermore, the 28,30-dinor-hopane detected in only one sample probably indicates slight variation in redox conditions during Fischschiefer deposition.
   The major change of environmental conditions began before Fischschiefer deposition, i.e., in the earliest Aptian. A decrease in organic carbon content and HI values and a higher ratio of reworked vitrinite and inertinite over primary vitrinite indicate gradually changing conditions. The observed environmental change is related to the Aptian transgression leading to a clear domination of terrigenous organic matter in the sediments above the Fischschiefer (Hedbergella Marl and above). Completely different oceanic conditions existed in the Lower Saxony Basin from then on until the Late Cretaceous, when organic matter-poor sediments were deposited under oxygen-rich water.

AB  - A better knowledge on soil development under different land use cover is critical for restoring eco-environmental integrity in degraded mining areas. This study aims at evaluating the impacts of different reclaimed land uses on topsoil properties over time in an opencast coalmine located at Pingshuo, Shanxi province, China. Over two hundred soil samples at the depth of 0-30 cm were collected and analyzed by using descriptive statistic, spatial statistic, and geostatistical method. The results showed that significant differences existed in soil particle distribution, organic carbon (CC), total nitrogen (N), available potassium (AK), and cation exchangeable capacity (CEC) between reclaimed And unmined lands. However, pH, N, total phosphorus (P), available phosphorus (AP) and AK significantly differentiated from each other under different reclaimed land uses, while OC and N were the highest in cultivated soil, followed by forest, grass and barren soils. In addition, the results showed a strong global autocorrelation for pH, OC, N, P, AP and AK. Moreover, the changes of OC and N exhibited U-shape trajectory under forest and grass land, indicating that approximate 20 years were required for reclaimed forest and grass land to restore OC and N comparable to unmined land.

AB  - Oxygen indication is a new technique for non-destructive testing (NDT) of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Damage may occur at any time during the transportation and storage of MAP, resulting in increased oxygen concentration. This may lead to food quality decline and even food spoilage. However, it is difficult to judge whether the package is undamaged without professional equipment. A visible colorimetric oxygen indicator that can accurately identify an intact packaging system to ensure food safety is reported. The indicator consists of an Ag-loaded titanium dioxide nanotube (Ag-TNT), glycerol, methylene blue (MB), and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). According to X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and UV-vis results, the Ag-TNT showed efficient photocatalytic performance, increased specific surface area (from 85 to 227 m(2) g(-1)), and an increased band gap of 3.30 eV. These results dramatically improved the performance of Ag-TNT as an oxygen indicator. Additionally, it demonstrated two outstanding properties: blocking indicator response to natural light (wavelength > 380 nm) and shortening the bleaching time during activation. Such an oxygen indicator can considerably enhance the accuracy of NDT for packages. Furthermore, it can be used in the packaging of different foodstuffs, ensuring food safety.

AB  - Considering the precarious conservation status of the grassland biome in South Africa, effective assessment and monitoring is imperative. The potential use of terrestrial arthropods in ecological assessment has received much attention, but little headway has been made in formulating standardised bioassessment protocols. A suggested reason for this lack of progress is the high diversity of terrestrial arthropods and the high taxonomic expertise required. Sampling was carried out across 12 months in the Bloemfontein Dry Grassland vegetation type and the potential of using functional feeding groups (FFG) as taxonomic surrogates for family level arthropods was investigated. An F-test associated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found a significant correlation between FFG and families for measures of richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity. Accumulation curves indicated that a higher proportion of FFG than families could be assessed with the same sampling intensity. Both families and FFG best fitted the stochastic normal and geometric series relative abundance distribution models, implying that there is no distinction between the taxonomic units with regard to abundance distributions. The reality remains that information does become lost when using surrogacy, so there will continue to be a need for specialist ecological proficiency for the highest risk assessments. It was concluded that for rapid monitoring and snap-shot assessments, FFG could be used as a valuable and reliable taxonomic surrogate.

AB  - Understanding how anthropogenic pressures affect river ecological status is pivotal to designing effective management strategies. Knowledge on river aquatic habitats status in Europe has increased tremendously since the introduction of the European Union Water Framework Directive, yet heterogeneities in mandatory monitoring and reporting still limit identification of patterns at continental scale. Concurrently, several model and data-based indicators of anthropogenic pressures to freshwater that cover the continent consistently have been developed. The objective of this work was to create European maps of the probability of occurrence of river conditions, namely failure to achieve good ecological status, or to be affected by specific pervasive impacts. To this end, we applied logistic regression methods to model the river conditions as functions of continental-scale water pressure indicators. The prediction capacity of the models varied with river condition: the probability to fail achieving good ecological status, and occurrence of nutrient and organic pollution were rather well predicted; conversely, chemical (other than nutrient and organic) pollution and alteration of habitats due to hydrological or morphological changes were poorly predicted. The most important indicators explaining river conditions were the shares of agricultural and artificial land, mean annual net abstractions, share of pollution loads from point sources, and the share of upstream river length uninterrupted by barriers. The probability of failing to achieve good ecological status was estimated to be high (>60%) for 36% of the considered river network of about 1.6 M km. Occurrence of impact of nutrient pollution was estimated high (>60%) in 26% of river length and that of organic pollution 20%. The maps are built upon information reported at country level pursuant EU legal obligations, as well as indicators generated from European scale models and data: both sources are affected by epistemic uncertainty. In particular, reported information depend on data collection scoping and schemes, as well as national knowledge and interpretation of river system pressures. In turn, water pressure indicators are affected by heterogeneous biases due to incomplete or incorrect inputs and uncertainty of models adopted. Lack of effective reach- and site-scale indicators may hamper detection of locally relevant impacts, for example in explaining alteration of habitats due to morphological changes. The probability maps provide a continental snapshot of current river conditions, and offer an alternative source of information on river aquatic habitats, which may help filling in knowledge gaps. Foremost, the analysis demonstrates the need for developing more effective continental-scale indicators for hydromorphological alterations and chemical pollution.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to determine the level and distribution of the sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) listed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) in smoke from poplar wood pellets and sawdust combustion and thermal decomposition, respectively. Namely, the growth of selected poplar plantations, wood cultivation and production in the north part of the Republic of Serbia, Vojvodina Province, considerably increased. However, mechanical wood processing creates a lot of sawdust, which causes an occupational and environmental risk and also poses a fire hazard. Furthermore, in order to protect the environment and provide additional energy sources, sawdust is commonly pelletized and further used as a fuel. Thus, the assessment of environmental impact of its use becomes an important issue. Therefore, the intention of the authors was to determine the level and profile of PAH5 emitted by combustion and thermal decomposition under atmospheric conditions of poplar wood pellets and sawdust. The 16 US-EPA PAH5 were analyzed by gas chromatograph with mass selective detector. The level of total US-EPA 16 PAH5 formed during combustion of wood pellets was 4.7 mg kg(-1) whereas during the sawdust combustion it was 3.8 mg kg(-1), while the resulting total PAHs concentration during thermal degradation under atmospheric conditions of pellets and sawdust was 3.4 mg kg(-1) and 3.7 mg kg(-1), respectively. The most common PAH5 present in smoke from the combustion and thermal decomposition under atmospheric conditions of poplar wood pellets were phenanthrene, fluorene and naphthalene, while from the sawdust were phenanthrene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene and fluorene, respectively. BaPeq value obtained during the combustion of wood pellets was 0.081 mg kg(-1), whereas from the combustion of sawdust it was 0.047 mg kri, while the resulting BaPeq value during the thermal degradation under atmospheric conditions of pellets and sawdust was 0.057 mg kg(-1) and 0.049 mg kg(-1), respectively. Biomass densification process did not affect PAHs emission neither during the combustion process nor the thermal decomposition process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study which considers the level and profile of PAHs found in smoke from the combustion and thermal decomposition of poplar clone 1-214 (P. x euramericana c1.1-214) cultivated in the Republic of Serbia.

AB  - The key drivers controlling the redox state of seawater and sediment pore waters in low energy environments can be inferred from redox-sensitive trace elements (RSTE), molecular biomarkers and trace metal isotopes. Here, we apply a combination of these tools to the Upper Permian Kupferschiefer (T1) from the Thuringian Basin, deposited in the southern part of the semi-enclosed Kupferschiefer Sea. Enrichment patterns of the RSTEs molybdenum (Mo) and uranium (U) as well as biomarker data attest to the rapid development of euxinic conditions in basin settings during early T1 times, which became progressively less extreme during T1 deposition. The evolution of redox conditions in basinal settings, and the associated delay in the onset of euxinia at more shallow marginal sites, can be attributed to the interaction of sea-level change with basin paleogeography. Euxinia in the southern Kupferschiefer Sea did not lead to near-quantitative depletion of aqueous Mo, possibly due to short deepwater renewal times in the Thuringian Basin, low aqueous H2S concentrations, the continuous resupply of RSTE during transgression and declining burial rates of RSTEs throughout T1 times. Drawdown of RSTE is, however, indicated for euxinic lagoon environments. Moreover, admixture of freshwater supplied to these lagoons by rivers strongly impacted local seawater chemistry. The highest Mo-isotope compositions of similar to 1.70 parts per thousand in basin sediments allow a minimum Kupferschiefer Sea seawater composition of similar to 2.40 parts per thousand to be estimated. This composition is similar to the similar to 2.30 parts per thousand estimate for the Late Permian open ocean, and confirms a strong hydrographic connection between the epeiric Kupferschiefer Sea and the global ocean. The substantial variation in Mo-isotope signatures is paralleled by diagnostic shifts in biomarkers responding to oxygenation in different parts of the water column. Water column chemistry has been affected by variation in sea level, hydrodynamic restriction, riverine freshwater influx and evaporitic conditions in shallow lagoons. Elucidation of the relative role of each driving factor by a single geochemical proxy is not feasible but the complex scenario can be disentangled by a multiproxy approach.

AB  - Biomarkers are quantitative indicators of biological processes performed by an organ or system. In recent years, natriuretic peptides (NPs) have emerged as important tools in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of heart diseases. Research has shown that serum and plasma levels of N-terminal pro brain NP (NT-proBNP) in dogs and cats are the only biomarkers that afford to diagnose and monitor congestive processes and, indirectly, the myocardial function of small animals. The present review discusses the peer-reviewed specialized literature about NT-proBNP and presents and compares the potential clinical applications of this NP in veterinary medicine of small animals, considering diagnosis, follow-up, and prognosis of myocardial or systemic diseases. The relevance of NT-proBNP is associated with sample stability, easy determination in laboratory, sensitivity, accuracy, and the possibility to analyze myocardial function. These advantages are specially important when NT-proBNP is compared with other cardiac biomarkers, mostly those that indicate the integrity of the myocardial cell. Fast NT-proBNP assays are marketed today and may be used in association with complementary tests. Together, these methods are an important source of information in differential diagnosis of heart and lung diseases as well in the early diagnosis of cardiopathy in dogs and cats, proving valuable tools in treatment and prognosis.

AB  - The common bean is susceptible to drought conditions and the evaluation of plant responses to low water availability can be difficult. The quantification of chlorophyll fluorescence as a sensitive trait to environmental stresses is an important alternative in the characterization of drought-susceptible genotypes. The objective of this study was to evaluate mainly the use of chlorophyll alpha fluorescence (maximum efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), photochemical quenching (qP), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)) and rapid light-response curves (RLCs) (initial slope of the curve (alpha), minimum saturation irradiance (I-k) and maximum relative electron transport rate (ETRmax)) parameters as tools for the identification of susceptible or tolerant bush bean cultivars to water deficit stress conditions in two different phenological stages. Using a randomized block design in a factorial arrangement, five bush bean cultivars (Cerinza, Bachue, NUA35, Bacata and Bianca) were evaluated under water deficit conditions by the suspension of irrigation for 15 days from 40 to 55 Days after Emergence (DAE) (vegetative stage) or 50 to 65 DAE (reproductive stage). The results showed that F-v/F-m and NPQ recorded the highest variation due to water deficit conditions, especially in the vegetative stage. The greatest reductions in F-v/F-m (0.67) and NPQ (0.71) were evidenced in cultivar NUA35 compared to its control plants (0.78 and 1.07, respectively). The parameters obtained from RLCs showed that cultivar Bacata registered the lowest alpha (0.17) and I-k (838.19 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) values compared to its control plants (alpha 0.23; I-k 769.99 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)). Differences were only obtained in ETRmax in the reproductive stage (50-65 DAE) in which cultivar NUA35 reached values of 158.5 in stressed plants compared to control plants (251.22). In conclusion, the parameters derived from RLCs such as alpha and I-k can be used as tools to identify drought susceptibility in the vegetative stage, whereas ETRmax can be used in the reproductive stage. In addition, PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m and NPQ) can also help to understand the agronomic responses of common bush bean cultivars to drought conditions.

AB  - Dry forests in the Caatinga biome of Brazil are seasonal ecosystems where diversity is driven by water availability. Understanding how the distribution of communities is driven by temporal climate changes has intrigued researchers for decades. However, temporal diversity patterns should be more evident in dry environments, since seasonality is characterized by being highly limiting to insect activities. Cerambycid beetles are considered good ecological indicators because they respond well to impacts of environmental changes. Thus, we asked two questions: (i) How do climatic changes affect the diversity of these insects across seasons? (ii) Are diversity components correlated with increasing air humidity, rainfall, and temperature? Our results showed a marked seasonality of cerambycid beetles, with higher abundance and richness in the wet season. The mean temperature and relative humidity were predictors of the composition of beetle assemblages. However, the variation of cerambycid assemblages between seasons is related mainly to species turnover. Our study demonstrates that the combined effect of temperature and humidity drives the temporal distribution of the cerambycids in dry forests. Although thermal sensitivity was low, the decrease in air moisture during the dry season was the limiting factor for these insects. Species turnover increased continuously with air moisture and temperature rise, creating temporal segregation among cerambycid species and maintaining the stability of the assemblage. Thus, our results are consistent with mechanisms invoking activity patterns, desiccation resistance, and physiologic constraints that predict a decrease in richness and abundance of the cerambycids from warmer and moister to colder and drier conditions.

It could severely affect the treatment efficacy such as membrane fouling, dewaterability and the formation of carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs). The heterogeneous dissolved organic matter (DOM) with varying size and chemical nature constitute a primary proportion of EPS. In the last few decades, fluorescence spectroscopy has received increasing attention for characterizing these organic substances due to the attractive features of this low-cost spectroscopic approach, including easy sample handling, rapid, non-destructive and highly sensitive nature. In this review, we summarize the application of fluorescence spectroscopy for characterizing EPS and provide the potential implications for online monitoring of water quality along with its limitations. We also link the dynamics of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in EPS with operational and environmental changes in wastewater treatment systems as well as their associations with metal binding, membrane fouling, adsorption, toxicity, and dewaterability. The multiple modes of exploration of fluorescence spectra, such as synchronous spectra with or without coupling with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS), excitation-emission matrix (EEM) deconvoluted fluorescence regional integration (FRI), and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) are also discussed. The potential fluorescence indicators to depict the composition and bulk characteristics of EPS are also of interest. Further studies are highly recommended to expand the application of fluorescence spectroscopy paired with appropriate supplementary techniques to fully unravel the underlying mechanisms associated with EPS.

AB  - With tremendous biodiversity but increasing threats, Southeast Asia faces challenges in meeting its commitments to the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2020 Aichi Targets. The use of indicators to monitor, evaluate and guide conservation progress is increasingly urgent. We quantified indicator use by 10 Southeast Asian governments in the 4th and 5th national reports submitted to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010 and 2015. We found indicator use variable among nations but increasing. Use of quantitative trend indicators doubled from an average of 6-12. There was no change in the number of non-quantitative (mean of 2) or quantitative baseline indicators (those measured once; mean of 9). Indicators most frequently addressed habitat condition and extent, species diversity, protected areas, and agriculture (means of 2-6 indicators each). They were rarely used (mean < 1) to indicate trends in wildlife exploitation, information sharing, climate change, and invasive species. Species diversity indicators increased from the 4th to 5th reports, and there were marginal increases in indicators used for aquatic ecosystems. The results highlight a slow but noticeable increase in the use and quality of indicators in national biodiversity reporting in the region. However, for the region to accelerate progress towards agreed-upon targets of multilateral environmental agreements, a more relevant and diverse set of indicators will need to be employed. Paths to doing so include the use of disaggregated global indicators, increased regional coordination to improve the efficiency and quality of indicator generation, and increased efforts a growing national-level monitoring capacity.

AB  - The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters. Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males, fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture, secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters, Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental conditions.

AB  - Building the Belt and Road is initiatives of China to promote win-win international cooperation in the new era, aiming at green, health, intellect and peace and the joint development with people of the countries along the route. Systematic analysis on environmental characteristics, evolutionary tendency and future risks are certainly the scientific fundamentals of sustainable development for the Belt and Road construction. Applied remote sensing monitoring, statistical analysis, this paper investigates the regional characteristics of climate, topography, soil, hydrology, vegetation cover and terrestrial ecosystems production, as well as socio-economic conditions. Based on the regional characteristics, the Belt and Road is divided into 9 sub-regions: Central and Eastern Europe sub-region with cold and humid climate, Mongolia and Russia sub-region with cold and arid climate, Central and West Asia arid sub-region, Southeast Asia sub-region with warm and humid climate, Pakistan arid sub-region, Bangladesh-India-Myanmar sub-region with warm and humid climate, Eastern China monsoon sub-region, Northwest China arid sub-region and Tibetan Plateau sub-region. Combining modeling simulation with scenario projections, natural disaster assessment methodology is used to assess the risk of extreme events including heat waves, droughts and floods in the coming 30 years (2021-2050). Results show that, on the basis of the regional framework, the western Eurasia would be a warming trend; both sides of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in high temperature and heat waves risk; Central and Eastern Europe sub-region with cold and humid climate in high drought risk; Bangladesh-India-Myanmar sub-region with warm and humid climate as well as Eastern China in high risk of flooding.

AB  - In recent years, concerns have been raised about the potential environmental impacts of oil and gas (O&G) exploitation, especially regarding groundwater resources. However, there have been few studies carried out to assess the actual risk of O&G exploitation based on specific local conditions. This paper reports on a study aiming to assess the potential risk to groundwater quality related to the development of a tight sandstone petroleum reservoir underlying a shallow fractured rock aquifer system in the Haldimand sector of Gaspe, Quebec, Canada. In this generally rural setting, the drilling of a provincially permitted horizontal O&G exploration well was halted by new municipal regulations. Draft provincial environmental regulations were subsequently issued to define environmental requirements for hydrocarbon exploration wells. Our study thus also aimed to provide an example of how to comply with the new hydrogeological characterization requirements. This paper reports on the process followed to qualitatively assess the risk of O&G operations and natural oil seeps to groundwater quality. The assessment focused on indicators of potential preferential fluid migration paths between the reservoir level and shallow aquifers. Field work and data analysis were used to define geological, hydrogeological and geochemical contexts on which a numerical model was developed to represent groundwater flow, mass transport and groundwater residence time. The risk for groundwater quality was qualitatively assessed from the implications of the study area context relative to 1) the new provincial regulatory requirements; 2) potential contaminant release mechanisms related to O&G exploration drilling operations; and 3) the expected effects that contaminant releases could have on groundwater.

AB  - Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs), as bioindicators of primary environmental traits, are commonly applied in Europe; however, a problem exists with the appropriate interpretation of bioindication results in terms of ecological gradients. Very few studies have tested the predictive values of EIVs using validation data sets. In this study, we compared the results of bioindications of nitrogen content, soil reaction, light availability and soil moisture with measured environmental traits in Central European oak forests and assessed the ability of EIVs to predict environmental traits based on validation data sets. Additionally, the regression trees method was applied to determine which environmental traits influenced the values of EIVs. The results reveal that numerous linear correlations exist between the mean values of EIVs and measured traits. However, the correlations were rather low. The established regressions allow realistic predictions in case of Ca content and light conditions, while they did not perform satisfactory in case of moisture and nitrogen. The relatively low correlations were the result of several factors. Among these, the values of EIVs for species are inter-correlated, which might distort the results, especially for soil moisture and light availability. Moreover, the average values of EIVs assigned as an indication of particular environmental trait could be influenced by multiple ecological factors acting together and this could bias bioindication. The regression tree method, as a more flexible one, was able to detect such effect influencing average values of EIVs, while the linear method was not able to reveal it. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding how top predators respond to natural and anthropogenically induced changes in their environment is a major conservation challenge especially in marine environments. We used a multidisciplinary approach to explore the mechanisms through which a typical central-place forager, the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) from the Chubut province of Argentina, responds to variations in oceanic conditions and prey resources. We combined habitat and species distribution modeling with isotopic dietary reconstructions based on blood delta 13C and delta 15N values to quantify the role of bathymetry, sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration, abundance of conspecifics, and extent of fisheries activities in explaining the foraging and feeding ecology of individuals breeding at different colonies. The at-sea distribution of penguins was tightly coupled with the spatial distribution of their staple prey species, anchovies (Engraulis anchoita), especially in areas over the continental shelf (>200 m depth), with relatively warm water (from 16 degrees to 21 degrees C), and moderate abundances of conspecifics (from 50 to 250 individuals). Competition with conspecifics and human fisheries were also identified as important factors explaining penguin diet with decreasing relative contributions of anchovies with increasing abundance of conspecifics and fishing activity. Our multifactorial approach allowed us to simultaneously explore different physical, biological and anthropogenic features likely affecting marine resource availability, and, consequently, driving the feeding and foraging ecology of this central-place forager. Our approach can be extended to a large suite of central-place foragers, thus providing important advances in the way we investigate how to effectively conserve and manage these species.

AB  - Temporal environmental variability may confound interpretations of management actions, such as reduced fisheries mortality when Marine Protected Areas are implemented. To aid in the evaluation of recent ecosystem protection decisions in central-northern California, we designed and implemented multivariate ocean-climate indicators (MOCI) of environmental variability. To assess the validity of the MOCI, we evaluated interannual and longer-term variability in relation to previously recognized environmental variability in the region, and correlated MOCI to a suite of biological indicators including proxies for lower- (phytoplankton, copepods, krill), and upper-level (seabirds) taxa. To develop the MOCI, we selected, compiled, and synthesized 14 well-known atmospheric and oceanographic indicators of large-scale and regional processes (transport and upwelling), as well as local atmospheric and oceanic response variables such as wind stress, sea surface temperature, and salinity. We derived seasonally-stratified MOCI using principal component analysis. Over the 21-year study period (1990-2010), the ENSO cycle weakened while extra-tropical influences increased with a strengthening of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and cooling of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Correspondingly, the Northern Oscillation Index (NOI) strengthened, leading to enhanced upwelling-favorable wind stress and cooling of air and ocean surface temperatures. The seasonal MOCI related well to subarctic copepod biomass and seabird productivity, but poorly to chlorophyll-a concentration and krill abundance. Our results support a hypothesis of enhanced sub-arctic influence (transport from the north) and upwelling intensification in north-central California over the past two decades. Such environmental conditions may favor population growth for species with sub-arctic zoogeographic affinities within the central-northern California Current coastal ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We studied the environmental impact of geothermal activities in the Mt. Amiata area, using on-site spectral analyses of various ecological components. Analytical techniques were based on the study of the "red-edge", which represents the spectral feature of the reflectance spectra defined between red and infrared wavelengths (A) within the range 670-780 nm. Since in the study area the geothermal exploitation causes the drifting of contaminants such as Hg, Sb, S, B, As and H2S (hydrogen sulfide) from power plants, the spectral response of vegetation and lichens depends on their distance from the power stations, and also on the exposed surface, material type and other physical parameters. In the present research, the spectral radiance of targets was measured in the field using an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Field-SpecTmFR portable radiometer. Spectral measurements were made on vegetation and lichen samples located near to and far from geothermal areas and potential pollution sources (e.g., power plants), with the aim of spatially defining their environmental impact. Observations for vegetation and lichens showed correlation with laboratory chemical analyses when these organisms were under stress conditions. The evaluation of relationships was carried out using several statistical approaches, which allowed to identify methods for identifying contamination indicators for plants and lichens in polluted areas. Results show that the adopted spectral indices are sensitive to environmental pollution and their responses spatialstatically correlated to chemical and ecophysiological analyses within a notable distance.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is a shared ecosystem in which problems and solutions are a common responsibility among governments, primarily the United States and Mexico. Concepts about management of coastal systems suggest that GOM ecosystem-based management approaches should be coupled with ecological risk assessment and that quantitative modeling is a valuable tool for ecosystem-based management, which results in sound sustainable management. Sustainable management requires the consideration of a number of processes and issues. These include definition of ecological regions, description of processes controlling primary productivity, wetland restoration and coastal fisheries, and an understanding that pulsing is a fundamental characteristic of coastal systems, that climate change must be taken into consideration in management, and that environmental sustainability and socioeconomic development are strongly related. Throughout the 6,134 km of coastline stretching from Florida to Quintana Roo, there are several major geographic regions that include the warm-temperate GOM, the tropical GOM, and the Caribbean coast connected to the GOM. Within each geographic region, discrete complex systems can be defined as geographic/hydrological subregions, characterized by the interactions of geology, geomorphology, oceanography, climate, freshwater input, biogeochemistry, coastal vegetation, wildlife, estuary-shelf interactions, and human factors. We conclude: (a) system functioning should serve as a basis for sustainable coastal management; and (b) to sustain environmental and socioeconomic conditions, the GOM must be maintained as a healthy, productive, and resilient ecosystem. The challenge for future coastal management in the GOM should be towards an integration of coastal management with large marine ecosystem management.

AB  - Ecological risk assessments (ERAs) for mammals at chemically contaminated terrestrial sites conventionally apply a food-chain model to draw inferences about a population's reproductive condition. Very recently though, the ERA field was advanced beyond the desktop level with the introduction of Rodent Sperm Analysis (RSA), a direct health status assessment method for the actual chemically exposed site receptor. Here, the sperm parameters of rodents (count, motility, morphology) of contaminated sites and their habitat-matched noncontaminated reference locations are comparatively reviewed for a technically supported indication of reproductive capability. ERA's toxicological endpoint of greatest concern. With the extent to which sperm parameters need to be impaired in order to compromise reproduction being known, more definitive determinations are possible than with the food-chain model approach. We sought to adapt the RSA method to the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), recognizing that this commonly evaluated mammalian species of ERAs is one of a very few species that avails itself to regularly being removed (through hunting) from the field. We conclude that the adaptation is viable, although sperm motility and a few other measures routinely compiled in RSA applications cannot be collected. In the pilot application, the deer population we assessed, with exposures to Superfund and other sites of known contamination, was not found to have compromised reproduction. This finding is consistent with RSA's supporting theory as well as population census information. The outcomes of so-called deer sperm analysis applications for herds exposed to one or more environmental stressors, have the potential to serve as reliable indicators of reproductive status. Such outcomes also provide further weight-of-evidence that suspected contamination is not associated with adverse ecological effects. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Niche space is a useful indicator of trophic diversity in marine ecosystems. Here we describe the characteristics of realized niche space of 3 sympatric labrids (Notolabrus celidotus, Notolabrus fucicola, and Pseudolabrus miles) in Fiordland, New Zealand. We investigate physical niche through relationships between environmental parameters and patterns in abundance at a regional scale. Abundances of P. miles and N. fucicola were best associated with high salinity, wave-exposed areas (r(2) = 0.637, 0.372 respectively) while N. celidotus was positively correlated with calm semi-estuarine conditions (r(2) = 0.452). Variation in biological habitat descriptors of wrasse abundance provided evidence for differences in the environmental correlates for abundance among species, though all were positively correlated with abundance of macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata). Stable isotope analysis identified individual variability in trophic position among species by revealing that P. miles fed at a significantly higher trophic level and had a higher percentage of macroalgae in their composition of basal organic matter than N. celidotus and N. fucicola. N. celidotus had a significantly higher dispersion of individual trophic levels and percentage macroalgae than P. miles and N. fucicola, indicating a broader trophic niche. Isotopic results were supported by prey choices identified in gut content analysis and qualitative observations of tooth morphology. In Fiordland, N. celidotus is a generalist species, successfully exploiting a range of resources along the gradient from inner to outer fjord habitat, while P. miles and N. fucicola are relatively specialized to wave-exposed coastal habitats. These methods provide a useful approach to the quantitative comparison of niche breadth among species.

AB  - Participation by local communities in the assessment and monitoring of efforts to implement global environmental conventions (GECs), such as Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), is a topic of growing interest worldwide. Previous implementation efforts were constrained by the lack of a methodological framework that integrates local knowledge and ecological methods. This study, conducted with assistance from Maasai herders in northern Tanzania, evaluated a socio-economic and ecological framework for integrating local communities into assessments of the GECs. To reach decisions related to CBD, herders used livestock grazing suitability (GS) and proxy indicators of biodiversity, while to reach decisions related to CCD herders used potential grazing capacity (PGC) related to the risk of degradation. We proposed criteria for indicator selection and developed step-wise research methods to assess performance of the indicators at spatial scales. The ecological and anthropogenic indicators were then analysed using a correlation matrix to evaluate management decisions. We showed that changes in ecological indicators influenced herder decisions. The anthropogenic indicators for potential were more sensitive to changes in soil degradation, range conditions and trends; while the decisions related to GS were more sensitive to the majority of the proxy indicators of biodiversity. The decisions reflected the potential responses to management, which had implications for CBD and CCD. Because decisions constitute a multiplicity of activities, the responses by local communities could be related to the potential role played by each indicator in the implementation of the convention at the local level.

AB  - Substantial amounts of NOx (similar to 146 000 t/y) and total hydrocarbons (similar to 294 000 t/y) are released to the marine atmosphere by the large number of oil and gas operations over Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Under appropriate meteorological conditions these emissions react to form ozone (0-54 mu g/m(3) over-water) which can affect the marine environment. Using a dry deposition model, this work examines the amount of ozone derived from oil and gas offshore operations and deposited in the sea surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and assesses its impact on the neuston of the sea-surface microlayer. Surface integrated estimates of ozone deposited from oil and gas operations over the sea surface ranges from 400 kg to 1800 kg which results in sea surface concentrations of similar to 15 mu g/m(3). This estimate and the actual toxic ozone levels suggest no acute, toxic impacts to the neuston. However, indirect effects may occur through changes to the pelagic foodwebs and organic carbon pathways. Another potential pathway for ozone impacting the environment is through the production of bromate. Based on the concentrations and time scales (11-139 days) only sublethal effects appear to occur, but uncertainties associated with this assessment need to be further studied. From an ecological perspective, the environmental impacts and risks of NOx and VOC discharges from offshore platforms need to be assessed for neuston and other components of the marine ecosystem.

AB  - Selecting the right location for a den during the breeding season is a type of habitat selection in the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) that is likely to affect its reproductive success. A den's suitability likely depends on its ability to provide shelter, as well as its proximity to prey resources. Depending on the different relative risks that Arctic foxes may face across their broad circumpolar range, Arctic foxes may place different emphases on selection for shelter and prey resources in different ecosystems. Understanding the different requirements for reproduction under different ecological conditions is highly relevant to conservation efforts in areas where Arctic foxes are threatened by rapid environmental changes. Here, we investigated the relative selection for shelter and prey resources in southern Yamal Peninsula (Russia) using data from 45 dens collected over a 13-year period. Arctic foxes preferred to breed in dens with more den entrances; an indicator of shelter quality. Arctic foxes also preferred dens surrounded by more prey resources (quantified by the amount of river valley habitat), but this result was less conclusive. These results complement the findings reported from other study areas, illustrating that Arctic foxes in ecosystems with diverse predator communities may put emphasis on selection for shelter quality. In less productive ecosystems, Arctic foxes may rather put emphasis on selection for prey resources. As tundra ecosystems become more productive and generalist predators move north, the reproductive requirements and habitat selection of Arctic foxes may change accordingly, depending on the species' ability to adapt.

AB  - The paper reports the results obtained after 4 years of aquatic angiosperm transplants in areas of the Venice Lagoon (North Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean) where meadows almost disappeared due to eutrophication, pollution and overexploitation of clam resources. The project LIFE12 NAT/IT/000331-SeResto, funded by the European Union, allowed to recolonize the Habitat 1150* (coastal lagoons) in the northernmost part of the lagoon, by extensive manual transplants of small sods or single rhizomes of Zostera marina, Zostera noltei, Ruppia cirrhosa and, in some stations also of Cymodocea nodosa. Over the 4 years of the project more than 75,000 rhizomes were transplanted in 35 stations with the support of local stakeholders (fishermen, hunters and sport clubs). Plants took root in 32 stations forming extensive meadows on a surface of approx. 10 km(2) even if some failures were recorded in areas affected by outflows of freshwater rich in nutrients and suspended particulatematter. The rapid recovery of the ecological status of the involved areaswas the result of this meadow restoration, which was in compliance with Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EC) objectives. Moreover, the monitoring of environmental parameters in the water column and in surface sediments allowed to identify the best conditions for successful transplants. Small, widespread interventions and the participation of local stakeholders in the environmental recovery, make this action economically cheap and easily transposable in other similar environments.

AB  - The risk from naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) has been extensively assessed, and this has led to the integration of specific NORM radiation protection requirements within the latest EU Directive 2013/59. Nevertheless, it has been internationally recognised that remaining NORM knowledge gaps and uncertainties now present similarly significant issues in addressing recent regulatory requirements. The multi-tiered nature of environmental impact assessment (EIA) implies per se possibility for uncertainties, but when EIA at radiation exposure sites includes consideration of sites with multiple radiation and contamination sources, different ecosystem transport pathways, effects and risks by applying different parameters and models, level of overall uncertainty increases. The results of EIA study in the Fen area in Norway, comprised of undisturbed and legacy NORM sites, have been evaluated in this analysis, in order to identify all existing input uncertainties and how they may impact the final conclusions, and thus, influence any subsequent decision-making. The main uncertainties have been identified in the measurement and exposure analysis tier, and were related to the heterogeneous distribution of radionuclides, radionuclide speciation, as well as to generic variability issues in the concepts used for mobility and biota uptake analysis (such as distribution coefficient, transfer factors and concentration ratios) as well as radioecological modelling. The uncertainties in the input values to the calculation of the dose arising from radon exposure in the Fen area led to an overall elevated uncertainty of the magnitude of the radiation exposure dose of humans. It has been concluded that an integrated, ecosystem-based approach with consideration of complexity of prevailing environmental conditions and interconnections must be applied to fully understand possible radiation effects and risks.

AB  - Little is known about the ecological implications of high-magnitude, low frequency jokulhlaup events in proglacial systems. This study highlights how kettle lakes produced by jokulhlaups in proglacial areas create short-lived ecosystems and increase biodiversity. This research also demonstrates that as ice-margins retreat, creating new proglacial lakes and aquatic habitats, these sites may be increasingly important as sites of biogeochemical cycling and carbon fixing. Using diatoms from the base of former kettle hole lakes formed during the November 1996 jokulhlaup on Skeioararsandur, south-east Iceland, we investigate the record of changing conditions of these lakes over their short (similar to 15 year) life span. Diatom assemblages were investigated in sediment sections up to 0.36m deep from the base of two kettle holes, and across a profile of surface sediments in one kettle hole. The diatom assemblages across all kettle holes are dominated by small benthic species (e.g. Achnanthes, Navicula, Nitzschia and Fragilaria spp.), with planktonic species (Cyclostephanos, Stephanodiscus spp.) present in only one kettle hole. The diatom assemblages are characterized by species with high nutrient and alkalinity optima. The variation in the diatom assemblages between different sedimentary units in the kettle holes' basal stratigraphy reflect changes in the proportion of available habitat type (e.g. benthic, planktonic and littoral) resulting from changes in water levels, and changes in water chemistry relating to variations in sediment input (e.g. aeolian accumulation, slumping and re-working) and source of water (e.g. precipitation, ground water, snow melt). A conceptual model for typical kettle lake development in proglacial environments is also presented.

AB  - The context in which trees and forests grow in cities is highly variable and influences the provision of ecological, social, and economic benefits. Understanding the spatial extent, structure, and composition of forests is necessary to guide urban forest policy and management, yet current forest assessment methodologies vary widely in scale, sampling intensity, and focus. Current definitions of the urban forest include all trees growing in the urban environment, and have been translated to the design of urban forest assessments. However, such broad assessments may aggregate types of urban forest that differ significantly in usage and management needs. For example, street trees occur in highly developed environments, and are planted and cared for on an individual basis, whereas forested natural areas often occur in parkland, are managed at the stand level, and are primarily sustained by natural processes such as regeneration. We use multiple datasets for New York City to compare the outcomes from assessments of the entire urban forest, street trees, and forested natural areas. We find that non-stratified assessments of the entire urban forest are biased towards abundant canopy types in cities (e.g. street trees) and underestimate the condition of forested natural areas due to their uneven spatial arrangement. These natural areas account for one quarter of the city's tree canopy, but represent the majority of trees both numerically and in terms of biomass. Non-stratified assessments of urban forest canopy must be modified to accurately represent the true composition of different urban forest types to inform effective policy and management.

AB  - Historical strandings and sightings (1989 -2016) of Tursiops truncatus at 25 degrees S in the south-western Atlantic Ocean (Parana, Brazil) were assessed to (1) investigate temporal fluctuations; and (2) quantify biological, ecological and health parameters of regional populations. In total, 57 T. truncatus carcasses in mostly advanced stages of decomposition (similar to 80% of all specimens) were recorded. Standardized temporal strandings (per observational effort) varied considerably and with no clear annual relationship beyond a peak in 2007, but there were consistently more strandings in winter/spring (74%) than summer/ autumn (26%). While there was uncertainty over age estimation (i.e. not available for the population), individuals classified as juveniles/subadults were more frequent (80%) than calves (14%) and adults (6%). Of 28 carcasses assessed, 27 showed a positive linear relationship between TL and condyle-basal length, while one specimen had a clear southern skull morphotype. Suggestive lesions of Crassicauda sp. were recorded in 77% of assessed skulls and four types of tooth pathologies were observed. Nine individuals were more closely investigated for gross and histopathological alterations and had clear evidence of fishery interactions and various health issues associated with disease and oedema accompanied by alveolar fibrosis. While the regional frequency of T. truncatus strandings was lower than other more vulnerable cetaceans, the absolute numbers (e.g. 15 individuals in 2016) and some uncertainty concerning regional taxonomy are noteworthy, and justify ongoing spatio-temporal monitoring. Further, given the evidence of disease in some specimens, future work should not only encompass rigorous taxonomic assessments, but also health to comprehensively evaluate regional stocks. Small cetacean species are sentinels and their condition could inform ongoing environmental assessments.

AB  - The incursion of euxinic waters into the ocean-surface layer is hypothesized to have been an important killing agent during the end-Permian mass extinction. However, both the causes and extent of oceanic euxinia during this crisis remain poorly known, making assessment of its role in the mass extinction difficult. Here, we document the distribution of aryl isoprenoids (AIs), which are biomarkers of obligate anaerobic green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) that are indicative of photic-zone euxinia, in 12 Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) sections with a wide distribution globally. Profiles of Al abundance for the 12 study sections show significant spatiotemporal variation. No Als were identified in the shallowest sections, but Als are present both prior to and following the mass extinction in intermediate-depth sections and following the mass extinction in deep-water sections. This pattern suggests a combination of upward and oceanward expansion of photic-zone euxinia during the PTB crisis, possibly fueled by elevated riverine nutrient fluxes as a consequence of climatic warming, terrestrial ecosystem destruction, and enhanced erosion. This hypothesis is supported by the close association of AIs with elevated abundances of moretanes and dibenzofuran (DBF), which are biomarkers for terrestrial erosion. Expansion of oceanic euxinia at intermediate water depths may have established a long-term reservoir that fed episodic incursions of H2S-bearing waters into shallow-marine environments, delaying the recovery of marine ecosystems during the Early Triassic. The biomarker records of the present study thus provide significant evidence of terrestrial-marine linkage during the PTB crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A continued supply of ecosystem services (ES) from a system depends on the resilience of that system to withstand shocks and perturbations. In many parts of the world, climate change is leading to an increased frequency of extreme weather events, potentially influencing ES provision. Our study of the effects of an intense rainfall event in Gorce National Park, Poland, shows: (1) the intense rainfall event impacted heavily on the supply of ES by limiting potential recreation opportunities and reducing erosion prevention; (2) these negative impacts were not only restricted to the period of the extreme event but persisted for up to several years, depending on the pre-event trail conditions and post-event management activities; (3) to restore the pre-event supply of ES, economic investments were required in the form of active repairs to trails, which, in Gorce National Park, were an order of magnitude higher than the costs of normal trail maintenance; and (4) when recreational trails were left to natural restoration, loss of biodiversity was observed, and recovery rates of ES (recreation opportunities and soil erosion prevention) were reduced in comparison to their pre-event state. We conclude that proper trail design and construction provides a good solution to avoid smile of the negative impacts of extreme events on recreation, as well as offering co-benefits in terms of protecting biodiversity and enhancing the supply of regulating services such as erosion prevention.

AB  - The coastal wetlands of southwest Florida that extend from Charlotte Harbor south to Cape Sable, contain more than 60,000 ha of mangroves and 22,177 ha of salt marsh. These coastal wetlands form a transition zone between the freshwater and marine environments of the South Florida Coastal Marine Ecosystem (SFCME). The coastal wetlands provide diverse ecosystem services that are valued by society and thus are important to the economy of the state. Species from throughout the region spend part of their life cycle in the coastal wetlands, including many marine and coastal-dependent species, making this zone critical to the ecosystem health of the Everglades and the SFCME. However, the coastal wetlands are increasingly vulnerable due to rising sea level, changes in storm intensity and frequency, land use, and water management practices. They are at the boundary of the region covered by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), and thus are impacted by both CERP and marine resource management decisions. An integrated conceptual ecological model (ICEM) for the southwest coastal wetlands of Florida was developed that illustrates the linkages between drivers, pressures, ecological process, and ecosystem services. Five ecological indicators are presented: (1) mangrove community structure and spatial extent; (2) waterbirds; (3) prey-base fish and macroinvertebrates; (4) crocodilians; and (5) periphyton. Most of these indicators are already used in other areas of south Florida and the SFCME, and therefore will allow metrics from the coastal wetlands to be used in system-wide assessments that incorporate the entire Greater Everglades Ecosystem.

AB  - As part of the long-term strategy for addressing issues related to municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), Environment Canada is developing environmental quality objectives (EQOs) for the aquatic receiving environment. Recommended biological monitoring components of the aquatic ecosystem include fish communities, benthic macroinvertebrate communities, sentinel fish species and primary producers (macrophytes, attached algae, phytoplankton). A set of criteria was developed for measurable attributes (indicators) of each of those components. Recommended numeric and narrative criteria could be used to determine when MWWE should be managed. Warning-level criteria for indices of benthic community composition are considered effects on indices of composition that deviate from the mean reference response by more than +/- 2 standard deviations. For sentinel fish population parameters, warning-level effects are considered >25% differences from reference in gonad or liver size, growth, or age, or a >10% change in condition factor. For primary producers, warning-level effects are considered those that coincide with anticipated changes in fish communities based on existing models. Where warning-level criteria are exceeded, it is recommended that monitoring be repeated at two- to three-year intervals. Where continued monitoring demonstrates an increase in the extent or magnitude of effects on indices of benthic community composition, or sentinel fish population parameters, it is recommended that effects be considered unacceptable and that the cause of effects be identified and managed. Losses of non-rare species or shifts in dominance are considered severe fish-community effects that should trigger management (i.e., identification and elimination of causative agents). Domination of the benthic community by one or a few tolerant taxa normally coincides with effects on fish communities, and should also be considered a severe effect that triggers management.

AB  - Mexico City and its metropolitan area have suffered problems of sustainability in the water system. The main goals of this study were to assess the environmental and social impacts of the water system in Mexico City using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), identify the significant impacts and their sources, and provide a new perspective for a sustainable water system in the city. The entire water system was considered, including the following stages: water abstraction and treatment, transport, distribution, use, sewage collection and wastewater treatment. Social Life Cycle Assessment was performed considering the UNEP/SETAC Guidelines for the Social-LCA of products and the water system workers. We used five subcategories (working hours, fair wage, health and safety conditions, social security and professional development) and 30 indicators of labor conditions.
   The results of LCA show that the processes of abstraction, water treatment, transport and distribution combined to produce between 83.9 and 89.6% of the impacts in four of six categories. However, the transportation stage generates the highest environmental impacts due to energy consumption. The wastewater treatment stage avoids environmental impacts in freshwater eutrophication (-69.9%) and non-carcinogenic effects (-86.2%) due to Atotonilco, the new centralized WWTP. The social life cycle assessment results indicated that the transport stage had the best social performance score, with a value of 0.3 on a scale of zero to one. The total system exhibited regular performance in health and safety conditions, with a value of 0.6 in this category. Moving toward a sustainable water system in Mexico City requires analyze future scenarios on the decentralization of potable water services and the implementation of renewable energy technologies in water abstraction and transport to reduce electrical energy consumption and mitigate global warming impacts. Regarding the social dimension, the water system requires stricter policies to monitor the health and safety conditions of workers according to the definition of decent work toward recent sustainable development goals.
   This study allowed us to identify the stages with high and low environmental impacts with LCA and, with S-LCA, the best and worst social performance in working conditions. The next step is to complete a sustainability assessment that includes the economic dimension, develop a framework to integrate the three dimensions and propose scenarios to improve environmental and social performance.

AB  - Foundation species play a disproportionate role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Improved understanding of how environmental factors influence the distribution and population structure of foundation species therefore contributes to management and conservation of entire ecosystems. We surveyed subtidal kelp forests within four regions of the U.K., distributed over 9 degrees of latitude and a mean sea temperature gradient of similar to 2.5 degrees C. Our aims were: (1) to examine relationships between light availability and the structure and depth distribution of Laminaria hyperborea populations and (2) to determine whether depth-related patterns were consistent across regions with different temperature regimes. We recorded marked depth-related shifts in structure with decreasing light levels strongly correlated with declines in kelp density, cover, plant biomass, standing biomass, plant length, and age. We also recorded an effect of latitude; populations at our two colder, northernmost regions exhibited greater wet weight and length and higher standing biomass than populations in the warmer southern regions when under similar or even reduced light conditions, indicating an interactive effect of latitude, most likely related to temperature variability. We show that shifts in kelp population structure along depth gradients are strongly driven by light availability, although regional variability in the strength and nature of these relationships may be promoted by other factors such as temperature. Maximum depth penetration, standing biomass, plant density, and plant weight are useful indicators of light availability and, over time, could be monitored to detect changes in the quality of the overlying water column.

AB  - We present the development of a novel smart ink pen instrumented with force and motion sensors designed for the quantitative and ecological assessment of daily-life handwriting. This work aims at testing the pen's sensors and algorithms and the use of the smartpen to detect age-related changes in writing and tremor parameters during daily-life handwriting. A comparison against reference instruments was carried out to validate the pen tip force during static and dynamic conditions, the pen's tilt angle, and the algorithm for the segmentation of the force signal into strokes. The smartpen was tested on 43 healthy adults divided into three age groups (young, middle-old, and old) during unconstrained handwriting on paper. The validation of the pen's sensors and algorithms reported excellent results. A solid test-retest reliability was found in the writing and tremor indicators extracted from both young and old adults. As for the age-related analysis, the older age groups were characterized by an increase of temporal writing measures, a more uniform writing pressure, and more repetitive and predictable tremor oscillation components. The greatest accomplishment of our smart ink pen is the ability to combine the advantages of the digitizing tablet technology with the natural "feel," the ease of use, and the ecological validity of the traditional pen-and-paper approach. The proposed solution represents an important step toward a simple, ecologically valid, reliable quantitative assessment of daily-life handwriting. Our smartpen is particularly suitable for daily-life telemonitoring applications in a number of important health-related fields.

AB  - Abandoned mines cause serious environmental damage to their surroundings with considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems. These impacts occur mainly due to the uncontrolled discharge of polluted effluents, which may contain high concentrations of heavy metals. Currently, no real solution exists for this important environmental problem, leaving a legacy of global pollution. This study aimed to assess the impact of a metal mining effluent from an abandoned mine on freshwater ecosystems, using aquatic biofilms as an ecological indicator. At the same time, the efficiency of different innovative treatment technologies in reducing the ecological impacts caused by mining effluents was evaluated, consisting of nanofiltration and nanofiltration combined with electrocoagulation. To do that, aquatic biofilms obtained from a pristine stream, were exposed, under microcosms conditions, to a metal mining effluent, untreated or treated by the innovative treatment technologies and responses were compared with unexposed biofilm which served as control. The structural and functional responses of the biofilm were measured with throughout time. Biofilms that were exposed to the untreated mining effluent showed significant differences respect to the rest of treatments and the control, particularly exhibiting inhibitory effects on photosynthetic efficiency just after 24 h of exposure and a progressive shift of the photosynthetic community composition throughout the exposure period. The treatment technologies significantly reduced the ecological impact caused by the metal mining effluent. However, metal bioaccumulation in biofilm revealed a potential long-term impact. These observations evidenced the biofilm as a useful ecological indicator to assess the ecological impact caused by metal mining effluents on freshwaters and the efficiency of different treatment technologies to reduce it.

AB  - Formation of diatom frustules depends on the process of silicification. In many planktonic species of algae, ambient temperature and nutrients are already known to affect growth and morphology, making them suitable bioindicators. In this study, a similar indicator function of benthic diatoms is proposed based on the principle that cell wall thickness is inversely proportional to temperature and nutrients. Therefore, higher turnover rates at warmer temperatures are hypothesized to favour smaller and lighter diatoms due to their shorter regeneration time. Accordingly, benthic diatom species were classified into seven categories according to their intensity of silicification, referred to as 'Silicification Value'. For each diatom assemblage, an abundance-weighted average silicification value was calculated and tested for its applicability to assess global change impact on mountain lakes in the northern calcareous Alps of Europe. Surface sediment diatom samples and morphometric and ecological parameters of 41 lakes from a wide altitudinal range in the Bavarian and Tyrolian Alps were collected and analysed. Statistical tests revealed that temperature conditions in a lake and its altitude were the most decisive proxies related to the 'Silicification Value'. Moreover, trophic status and the presence of macrophytes had some influence. This supported the hypothesis that lakes, which are warmer and richer in nutrients, show a weaker average silicification in diatom assemblages. A dependence of silicification on valve size could be shown but appears to be negligible in climatological issues. In particular, the correlation with temperature makes the silicification value an applicable palaeoecological proxy to assess climate change impact in freshwater lakes.

AB  - 1. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that heterogeneous habitats may provide more niches and diverse ways of exploiting environmental resources, thereby allowing more species to coexist, persist and diversify. 2. We aimed to investigate how an edge-interior gradient related to forest complexity influences species composition, abundance and richness of dung beetles in the western Amazon rainforest. We expected dung beetle abundance and richness to increase along the forest edge-interior gradient, in accordance with the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. We also expected strong changes in species composition driven by species turnover in the forest interior and nestedness along the forest edges. We sampled dung beetles using baited pitfall traps across an edge-interior gradient. We also assessed the variation in forest features along the edge-interior gradient to identify changes in forest complexity. 3. Both species richness and abundance of dung beetles increased along the forest edge-interior, following the gradient of forest complexity. The Sorensen dissimilarity of dung beetle assemblages was higher among sampling units placed near the forest edge, although neither turnover, nor nestedness was different between the extremes of the forest edge-interior gradient. There was a clear compositional change along the edge-interior gradient mostly driven by species turnover. Individual indicator value analysis revealed that species were strongly associated with the forest interior conditions. 4. The simplification of the Amazon rainforest near clearings causes compositional changes in dung beetle assemblages. These changes are characterised by species-poor and low-abundance assemblages and may impair dung beetle ecological functions and therefore forest recovery.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight the design of solar storage tank integrating PCM modules for solar hot water production. The objective is to simulate working cycle of solar thermal energy storage systems with encapsulated PCM operating under realistic environmental conditions (Marrakech, Morocco) and typical consumption load profile. Thus, two numerical codes were built to predict the temperature evolution in a storage tank simulation filled by PCM. This research aims to compare two numerical procedures: the technique of apparent specific heat capacity (C-p(app)) and the Enthalpy method, basically used to simulate the phase change phenomena for latent storage inside a solar tank integrating spherical PCM capsules. Effects, advantages and limits of these numerical methods were examined via various numerical observations as well as a set of system thermal performance indicators. The assumptions, equations used in numerical modeling, the temperature profiles and the PCM liquid fraction evolution are presented and discussed as well. It was found that the time required for a complete melting inside the storage tank for the considered PCMs is 2.5 h and the increase in PCM amount decreases the melting velocity and enhance the heat losses to surrounding in dynamic mode. Results also show that the choice of a numerical method plays an important role in describing efficiently the phase change phenomena and system thermal performance. Based on the design and parameter studies performed, other suggestions and several numerical model improvements for further studies are as well addressed.

AB  - Fungicides in aquatic environments can impact non-target bacterial and fungal communities and the invertebrate detritivores responsible for the decomposition of allochthonous organic matter. Additionally, in some aquatic systems daily water temperature fluctuations may influence these processes and alter contaminant toxicity, but such temperature fluctuations are rarely examined in conjunction with contaminants. In this study, the shredding amphipod Hyalella azteca was exposed to the fungicide pyraclostrobin in three experiments. Endpoints included mortality, organism growth, and leaf processing. One experiment was conducted at a constant temperature (23 degrees C), a fluctuating temperature regime (18-25 degrees C) based on field-collected data from the S. Llano River, Texas, or an adjusted fluctuating temperature regime (20-26 degrees C) based on possible climate change predictions. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced leaf shredding and increased H. azteca mortality at concentrations of 40 mu g/L or greater at a constant 23 degrees C and decreased leaf shredding at concentrations of 15 mu g/L or greater in the fluctuating temperatures. There was a significant interaction between temperature treatment and pyraclostrobin concentration on H. azteca mortality, body length, and dry mass under direct aqueous exposure conditions. In an indirect exposure scenario in which only leaf material was exposed to pyraclostrobin, H. azteca did not preferentially feed on or avoid treated leaf disks compared to controls. This study describes the influence of realistic temperature variation on fungicide toxicity to shredding invertebrates, which is important for understanding how future alterations in daily temperature regimes due to climate change may influence the assessment of ecological risk of contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystems often experience multiple environmental stressors simultaneously that can differ widely in their pathways and strengths of impact. Differences in the relative impact of environmental stressors can guide restoration and management prioritization, but few studies have empirically assessed a comprehensive suite of stressors acting on a given ecosystem. To fill this gap in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where considerable restoration investments are currently underway, we used expert elicitation via a detailed online survey to develop ratings of the relative impacts of 50 potential stressors. Highlighting the multiplicity of stressors in this system, experts assessed all 50 stressors as having some impact on ecosystem condition, but ratings differed greatly among stressors. Individual stressors related to invasive and nuisance species (e.g., dreissenid mussels and ballast invasion risk) and climate change were assessed as having the greatest potential impacts. These results mark a shift away from the longstanding emphasis on nonpoint phosphorus and persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances in the Great Lakes. Differences in impact ratings among lakes and ecosystem zones were weak, and experts exhibited surprisingly high levels of agreement on the relative impacts of most stressors. Our results provide a basin-wide, quantitative summary of expert opinion on the present-day influence of all major Great Lakes stressors. The resulting ratings can facilitate prioritizing stressors to achieve management objectives in a given location, as well as providing a baseline for future stressor impact assessments in the Great Lakes and elsewhere.

AB  - This study, based on samples taken in seven cruises from February 2003 to November 2004, linked larval fish assemblages with mesoscale oceanographic features dominated by the monsoon-driven current system in the Taiwan Strait. A total of 7753 specimens of larval fish were identified from our samples, belonging to 467 taxa in 112 families and 230 genera. Engraulidae, Myctophidae, Scombridae, Carangidae, and Gobiidae were the five most abundant families. Three larval fish assemblages were distinguished by association respectively with the China Coastal Current, Kuroshio Branch Current, and South China Sea Surface Current, and accordingly designated as the cold-period northern Taiwan Strait (CNTS), southern Taiwan Strait (STS), and warm-period northern Taiwan Strait (WNTS) assemblages. The composition of larval fish differed significantly between assemblages, with the CNTS being the most dissimilar assemblage, probably due to the presence of neritic/oceanic taxa in the STS and WNTS and primarily neritic-associated taxa in the CNTS. The alternate intrusions of currents in the Taiwan Strait driven by seasonal monsoons play a pivotal role in the dispersal and community structure of larval fish. In addition, winter front turbulence and local topographic upwelling contributed to the increase in biological production; consequently resulting in high chlorophyll a concentrations and zooplankton biomass to provide abundant food for the survival of larval fish. The high correlation between the environmental variables and the larval fish assemblages offers the possibility to use the assemblages as indicators of the surface circulation in the Taiwan Strait and thereby improve our understanding of the ecosystems.

AB  - Substantial volcanism and associated volcaniclastic sedimentation took place in association with East African Rift formation, and in some cases this would have had substantial ecological impacts. Ethiopian Late Oligocene (27.36 +/- 0.11 Ma) fossiliferous volcanogenic strata provide opportunities to evaluate the magnitude of disruptive impact of volcanism on forest communities (before development of the Main Ethiopian Rift), and to assess their resilience. Fine-scale sampling and palynological analyses from the Magargaria River region of the northwestern Ethiopian Plateau tests the hypothesis that volcanism had a regional and significant disrupting effect on forest vegetation. These studies are compared with macrofossil and sedimentological data representing more local conditions previously reported from the same sediments. Results indicate that while some forests gave way to open environments dominated by herbaceous taxa, other communities remained or recovered quickly. Volcanic influences on sedimentary processes altered an existing forest ecosystem by creating a spatially heterogeneous landscape that also varied through time. This study supports the inherent significance of palynological data as indicators of ecological change at a regional scale relative to the more local view that macrofossils can provide, and underscores the importance of both kinds of fossils whenever possible for the study of the ecological dynamics of plant communities. The presence of forest taxa after repeated ashfalls indicates a degree of forest community resilience consistent with relatively limited burial by ash during the studied volcanic episodes. This study also suggests that taphonomic and diagenetic processes strongly affected the composition of palynomorph assemblages, skewing them towards thick-walled individuals, especially fungi.

AB  - South American savannahs cover a surface of 269x10(6)ha in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Bolivia. In a world scale savannahs are one of the most important land extensions with agricultural potential for crop and forestry production. These territories also constitute the main alternative to agriculturtral expansion into ecologically fragile tropical areas such as tropical rainforests and hillsides. Forty years ago anthropic activity had little effect on Latin American savannahs, since they were used for extensive cattle raising. In the last four decades, however, the natural herbaceous vegetation with low nutrient requirements in the savannahs (Ilanos) of Colombia and Venezuela. as well as in the Cerrado (Brazil) has been replaced by introduced African pastures, particularly from the genera Brachiaria and Andropogon. Furthermore, intensive reforestation programs for timber and pulpwood commercialization have introduced species able to cope with the environmental conditions. such as Pinus and Eucaliptus. The introduction of African pastures and annual and perennial crops has been possible with fertilization (N, P, K and lime). The landscape modifications caused by these land uses tire usually far from the urban areas and are still considered to be low. However, if the entire land surface currently affected by agriculture and agroforestry use and the land yet to be incorporated into projects is taken into consideration, a profound modification is expected to occur in these biomes. Herein is presented a preliminary comparative review of the agricultural colonization processes in the Llanos and Cerrados. In the need to generate indicators related to biogeochemical processes, three case studies from Venezuelan savannahs tire presented.

AB  - Aim. To understand the ecologic parameters of Sin Nombre virus (SNV; family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) infections in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), environmental variables impacting the rodent populations, and the conditions under which SNV is amplified. This may help us understand the antecedents of human risk for developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) as a consequence of SNV infection.
   Method. Each 6 weeks, we trapped, measured, tagged, bled, and released rodents at three widely spaced sites in Colorado, USA: Fort Lewis (1994-2001), Molina (1994-2001), and Pinyon Canyon Maneuver Site (1995-2001). The ELISA method was used to test rodent blood samples for IgG antibody to SNV antigen.
   Results. Where rodent species richness was high, the prevalence of infection of deer mice (as determined by the presence of antibody) with SNV was low, and vice versa. There was a higher prevalence of antibody to SNV in male than ill female rodents, and seasonal differences were observed in acquisition of SNV between male and female deer mice. Long-lived infected deer mice served as transseasonal, over-winter reservoirs for the virus, providing the mechanism for its survival.
   Conclusion. Prevalence of rodent infection appears to be associated with fluctuations in deer mouse populations and, indirectly, with timing and amount of precipitation and the resulting biologic events (a "trophic cascade"). Together with information regarding transseasonal maintenance of SNV, seasonal differences in acquisition of SNV between sexes, group foraging, and various other factors may expand our understanding of the risk factors for acquiring HPS. Taken together and applied, we anticipate developing methods for preventing this disease as well as diseases caused by other rodent-borne viruses.

AB  - To elucidate the effects of land-use types and afforestation age on litter decomposition, soil nutrient dynamics, and their relationship with substrate quality and soil environmental conditions, soil and litter samples were collected from farmland as well as four afforested land-use types (Robinia pseudoacacia: Rps; Caragana korshinskii: Cko; Pinus tabulaeformis: Pta; and Armeniaca sibirica: Asi), with each land-use type having three succession chronosequences (10, 25, and 40 a) in the Gaoxigou catchment area. These twelve afforested lands were converted from similar farmlands, and litterbag experiments were conducted in each land to determine litter decomposition rate (LDR). In addition, the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents and stoichiometry in soil and litter, soil properties, and litter biomass were determined. The results showed that soil environmental conditions such as soil water content, bulk density, pH, and temperature improved with afforestation age. Soil nutrient contents were higher in afforested lands and increased with afforestation age. The soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were positively correlated with the litter biomass, soil microbial carbon, and soil water content, but were negatively correlated with the soil bulk density, pH, and temperature. The litter OC, TN, and TP contents were mainly affected by the land-use types without being influenced by afforestation age. LDR is the main litter factor affecting soil nutrients, and is significantly influenced by substrate quality and environmental conditions, especially litter TN and N:P ratio, soil water content, and pH. The annual rates of increase for soil OC and TN during the initial (farmland-10a) and middle (10-25 a) periods were significantly higher than those during the later period (25-40 a) in Rps and Cko, but the Pta forest showed a completely opposite trend, which can be explained by a synchronous change in the LDR driven by the soil water content. In addition, the soil OC, TN, and TP contents were positively correlated with the litter TN, TP, and biomass, but had no correlation with the litter OC. The N:P ratio can be used as an indicator to reveal a tight coupling among soil and litter nutrients. Overall, these results provide evidence that litter decomposition in afforestation systems is linked to soil nutrient dynamics, and is mainly limited by substrate quality and environmental conditions.

AB  - Quantification of the physical and biological factors that influence the spatial structuring of food webs is central to inform effective resource management. We used baseline-corrected stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of 63 invertebrate and fish to investigate food web structure across a continental shelf gradient-the Celtic Sea Shelf in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Hierarchical clustering on delta C-13 and delta N-15 showed that the shelf food web is characterized by four trophic levels with trophic groups spread across pelagic and benthic trophic pathways. Four biomass-weighted isotopic diversity metrics provided indicators on the status of the system, showing a relatively complex food web with high trophic redundancy at intermediate trophic levels suggesting resilience to disturbances. Two sets of statistical models, at the community scale and for each trophic group, identified five distinct trophic assemblages associated with different chlorophyll a concentrations, water depth, and bottom temperature. A cold, vertically mixed-water assemblage over the outer shelf comprised the largest habitat and most diverse assemblage, highlighting the importance of cold productive conditions in the Celtic Sea. Trophic group model results were used to generate spatial area predictions to compare functioning of groups using isotopic overlap (similarity and nestedness) metrics. Isotopic niche area was larger (spanning two trophic levels) in shallow habitats, but not in habitats underlying high primary production or nutrient-rich water masses, suggesting stronger benthic-pelagic trophic coupling in inner shelf habitats. Results suggest that depth and intensity of pelagic production are major drivers of trophic structure and functioning of Celtic Sea communities.

AB  - Due to their unique flora, hydrology and environmental characteristics, peatlands are precious and specific habitats for microorganisms and microscopic animals. Their microbial network structure and their biomass are crucial for peatland carbon cycling, through primary production, as well as decomposition and mineralization of organic matter. Wetlands are one of the ecosystems most at risk from anthropogenic activities and climate change. Most recent scenarios of climate change for Central Europe predict an increase in air temperature and a decrease in annual precipitation. These changes may disturb the biodiversity of aquatic organisms, and the peat carbon sink. Considering the above climatic scenarios, we aimed to: i) assess the response of microbial community biomass to warming and reduced precipitation through the lens of a manipulative experiment in a peatland ecosystem ii) predict how global warming might affect microbial biodiversity on peatlands exposed to warmer temperatures and decreased precipitation conditions. Additionally, we wanted to identify ecological indicators of warming among microorganisms living in Sphagnum peatland. The result of a manipulative experiment carried out at Rzecin peatland (W Poland) suggested that the strongest reduction in microbial biomass was observed in heated plots and plots where heating was combined with a reduction of precipitation. The most pronounced changes were observed in the case of the very abundant mixotrophic testate amoeba Hyalosphenia papilio and cyanobacteria. Shifts in the Sphagnum microbial network can be used as an early warning indicator of peatland warming, especially a decrease in the biomass of important phototrophic microbes living on the Sphagnum capitula, e.g. Hyalosphenia papilio.

AB  - Aims Knowledge of invasive alien plant (IAP) ecology and plant community succession (synphytosociology) is crucial for successful restoration and prevention of (re)invasions; nevertheless, these two fields are rarely combined. Our case study aims to demonstrate how they can be integrated, by analysing the variation of IAP distribution within biogeographic territories, identifying the potential native plant communities and the ecological conditions that favour (or prevent) each IAP.
   Location Southern Portugal.
   Methods Several native plant indicators and nine selected IAPs were surveyed in 60 1-km(2) sampling plots across the four biogeographic sectors of the study area. The native plant indicators were then used to identify the vegetation series in which IAPs occurred. Ecological requirements favouring the establishment of each IAP were inferred based on expert knowledge and on the characteristics of published vegetation series and bioclimatic data.
   Results Littoral areas were more invaded, particularly those with sand dune habitats, which are highly dynamic and exposed to disturbance. The most frequent IAPs were Acacia dealbata, Arundo donax, Acacia longifolia and Opuntia ficus-indica. Riparian vegetation series were the most invaded, especially ash woodlands and willow galleries, as well as the littoral psammophilous cork oak and maritime turbinate juniper series. The most adequate native species to recover each of these invaded communities varies, and examples are provided for each situation.
   Conclusions Integrating knowledge about IAP ecological requirements and the dynamics of native vegetation series can help practitioners select native plants that are more likely to function as efficient natural barriers to (re)invasion, predict areas more prone to invasion by IAPs and establish management priorities.

AB  - The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a major pest of facilities where grain is processed because of its ability to find and colonize food resource patches. Traps baited with pheromone and kairomone lures are commonly used to monitor for the presence of insects in warehouses or flour mills, for example. However, two nonmutually exclusive components, environment and genetics, could influence insect responsiveness to volatiles, impacting the efficacy of monitoring. Intraspecific variation in attraction behavior to food and mates is largely unexplored in stored-product insects, but tapping into natural genetic variation could provide a baseline for identifying genetic mechanisms associated with finding resources. Here, we assess eight strains of T. castaneum for variation in response to kairomone- and pheromone-based lures using three behavioral assays: paired choice with no forced air flow, upwind attraction with forced air flow, and movement pattern in an arena with a single odor source. We find strain-specific responses to kairomones and pheromones and evidence for heritability in behavioral responses. However, environmental coefficients for behavioral responses to both lures are high, suggesting that environment, and its potential interaction with genotype, strongly influences behavioral outcomes in these assays. Furthermore, despite the different environmental conditions among the different behavioral assays, we find a correlation for volatile preference among the assays. Our results provide a baseline assessment of natural variation for preference to kairomone and pheromone lures and suggest that careful consideration of behavioral assay is key to understanding the mechanisms of attraction in these stored-product pests.

AB  - Discharge of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into aquatic ecosystems is inevitable due to their vast industrial applications. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of dietary curcumin supplementation against AgNPs toxicity to the gut microbiota of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) including total bacteria count, mesophilic, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae. Nine different treatments including different combinations of dietary AgNPs (0, 0.05 and 0.15 g/kg feed) and curcumin (0, 0.75 and 1.5 g/kg feed) in three respective replicates were designed. The trial was conducted under natural photoperiod condition for 60 days. Samples were taken on days 20, 40 and 60. Our results showed that dietary AgNPs contamination resulted in reduced intestinal bacterial count in a dose dependent manner, however, dietary curcumin inclusion level of 0.75 g/kg remarkably reduced the toxicity of AgNPs to intestinal microflora of common carp at least at 0.05 g/kg AgNPs (p < 0.05). The results also indicated that there were highly significant relationships (p < 0.001) between intestinal microflora count and dietary curcumin and AgNPs concentrations which were dependent upon exposure time. Beta values for different terms of regression equations implied that AgNPs concentration had remarkable effects on different bacteria classes of gut microbiota (-0.75, -0.89, -0.73 and -0.84 for total bacteria, mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae count, respectively). Conclusively, microflora population change might be assumed as an indication of environmental pollutions in aquatic ecosystems health assessment programs especially for newly emerging nano-materials. We also showed curcumin protected intestinal microflora against feed-born nanosilver particles.

AB  - Featured with a unique geographic position and climate conditions, Qinghai is abundant with natural resources, making significant contribution to China's or even the world's ecological security. In order to evaluate its current sustainability and provide useful policy suggestions to improve its sustainable development, a systematic study on Qinghai's socio-economic system was conducted by applying emergy synthesis. Results show that the total emergy use for supporting Qinghai's economy was 5.13 x 10(24) sej in 2015. The values of emergy to money, emergy density, and emergy used per person are 2.12 x 10(13) sej/RMB, 7.11 x 10(12) sej/m(2), and 8.72 x 10(17) sej/person, respectively. The holistic picture of Qinghai's socio-economic system is also uncovered based on the temporal analysis of emergy-based indicators. Results show that emergy yield ratio increased from 52.21 in 2002 to 164.10 in 2015. Similarly, the environmental loading ratio increased from 4.64 in 2002 to 57.99 in 2015. Correspondingly, the value of emergy-based sustainability index decreased from 11.25 in 2002 to 2.83 in 2015. These results indicate that Qinghai was highly dependent on local resources and its sustainability experienced a declining trend. In addition, the high absolute value of emergy to money ratio indicates that Qinghai was a net loser for its domestic and international trade. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the reliability of these results. Finally, policy recommendations based on such a systematic evaluation and local realities were proposed to improve its sustainable development.

AB  - Forests are socioeconomically and ecologically important ecosystems that are exposed to a variety of natural and anthropogenic stressors. As such, monitoring forest condition and detecting temporal changes therein remain critical to sound public and private forestland management. The National Parks Service's Vital Signs monitoring program collects information on many forest health indicators, including species richness, cover by exotics, browse pressure, and forest regeneration. We applied a mixed-model approach to partition variability in data for 30 forest health indicators collected from several national parks in the eastern United States. We then used the estimated variance components in a simulation model to evaluate trend detection capabilities for each indicator. We investigated the extent to which the following factors affected ability to detect trends: (a) sample design: using simple panel versus connected panel design, (b) effect size: increasing trend magnitude, (c) sample size: varying the number of plots sampled each year, and (d) stratified sampling: post-stratifying plots into vegetation domains. Statistical power varied among indicators; however, indicators that measured the proportion of a total yielded higher power when compared to indicators that measured absolute or average values. In addition, the total variability for an indicator appeared to influence power to detect temporal trends more than how total variance was partitioned among spatial and temporal sources. Based on these analyses and the monitoring objectives of the Vital Signs program, the current sampling design is likely overly intensive for detecting a 5 % trend center dot year(-1) for all indicators and is appropriate for detecting a 1 % trend center dot year(-1) in most indicators.

AB  - We tested the applicability of two available Water Framework Directive (WFD) compliant phytoplankton indices on three large peri-alpine lakes to analyze their suitability for trophic classification. We show that the indices vary in their final resulting Ecological Quality Ratios (EQRs) and are only appropriate to roughly distinguish lakes of different water quality according to OECD criteria (OECD, 1982). Annual mean TP concentration in Lake Geneva was 0.03 mg l(-1) in 2006 (Lazzarotto & Rapin, 2007), which marks mesotrophic conditions. According to the tested indices, the lake is of 'good' (0.60-0.80) quality after the German WFD method (PSI) and of 'moderate' quality according to the Austrian WFD method (BI). We prove that the way how to derive the per annum value of the metric 'Brettum Index' (BI) in the Austrian WFD method significantly influences the resulting index and the scatter of long-term data. We focused on improvement strategies for this index in terms of calculation and sampling frequency. Contrary to the tested bin, the modified index presents no significant differences between four and six sampling dates per year. In order to improve the significance of the available indices, we propose to modify the way of per annum index calculation for the Austrian WFD method as well as to focus on species composition to achieve a high relative proportion of indicator species. A phytoplankton index alone may not be sensitive enough to track the changes that occur within a lake. The results confirm the need to take into account other biological elements such as fish, macrophytes, attached diatoms and macrozoobenthos as suggested by the WFD.

AB  - As part of an environmental risk assessment study of exotic natural enemies used in inundative biological control, life-history characteristics of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Col., Coccinellidae) were quantified under laboratory conditions at 25degreesC on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) as prey. Comparative studies showed significant differences among pre-adult development times: H. axyridis developed slower ((X) over tilde = 19.8 days) than H. variegata ((X) over tilde = 18.1 days) and A. bipunctata ((X) over tilde = 18.4 days). Differences were also evident in the duration of egg, larval and pupal stages. No measurable differences among the three species were found for fecundity, oviposition rate and adult longevity. Harmonia axyridis exhibited the longest pre-oviposition ((X) over tilde = 7.4 days) and interoviposition ((X) over tilde = 3.6 days) periods and the shortest oviposition period ((X) over tilde = 13.7 days). The Bieri model was used to describe age-specific fecundity for the three species of coccinellids. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-0) and mean generation time (T) were higher for H. variegata (r(m) = 0.114, R-0 = 52.75, T = 41.88 days) than for H. axyridis (r(m) = 0.089, R-0 = 26.27, T = 38.81 days) or A. bipunctata (r(m) = 0.081, R-0 = 18.49, T = 40.06 days). Our findings show that the biological traits of H. axyridis do not seem to be factors that may contribute to the invasiveness of this coccinellid.

AB  - The relationship between fluoride-induced lesions, measured using an incremental scoring system, and fluoride concentration was investigated in the teeth of the field vole (Microtus agrestis). Both the magnitude of lesion score and the severity of observed lesions in both incisor and molar teeth was correlated with the respective tissue fluoride concentration. This: relationship was observed not only in animals trapped from sites contaminated by industrial fluorides, but also those bred and maintained under laboratory conditions and consuming fluoride in either diet or drinking water. Although some variation occurred between field and laboratory animals as to the mean fluoride concentrations in the incisor or molar for each specific lesion score, this may result in part from differences in the nature of the assimilable fluoride in laboratory diets compared to those consumed by wild animals. The practical application of the relationship between dental lesion score and tissue fluoride concentration to monitoring environmental fluoride contamination is discussed, Because the incisor and molar teeth of the field voles are open-rooted and grow throughout life, they are sensitive to even minor temporal changes in fluoride concentration in tissue fluids and blood and, by inference, in the diet and the environment. Therefore, assessment of visual lesions in the dentition of wild-caught field voles may provide the basis of a scheme to monitor the magnitude and effects of environmental fluoride contamination on populations of wild and domestic mammals. The development of nondestructive methods to allow the repeated examination of the teeth of captured field voles, and hence the dynamic monitoring of environmental fluoride contamination, is also considered.

AB  - Foraminifera are shelled single-celled protists that are found in all marine environments. Benthic foraminifera either live in sediments or attach to surfaces on the seafloor. Understanding the distribution and ecological response of benthic foraminifera is crucial, as they can indicate past and current ocean conditions. However, the benthic foraminifera distribution along the busy Strait of Malacca, which connects the Indian Ocean (north) to the Java Sea (south), is undersampled. In this study, we collected 24 surface samples from the northern Strait of Malacca to understand the distribution of foraminifera assemblages in shallow tropical waters. A total of 49 species of benthic foraminifera were identified. Calcareous hyaline species dominated the assemblages, with an extremely low occurrence of calcareous porcelaneous species. The common calcareous hyaline taxa were Asterorotalia pulchella, Pseudorotalia schroeteriana, Discorbinella bertheloti, Ammonia tepida, and Heterolepa praecincta. Cluster analysis categorised the foraminiferal assemblages into three major groups. The first cluster (Group A) consisted of a more diverse assemblage of hyaline and agglutinated species that inhabited a mean water depth of 45 m. The second cluster represented a population that inhabited deeper water environments (average water depth of 59 m). Finally, the third cluster (Group C) consisted of a foraminifera assemblage that inhabited shallow coastal environments (average depth of 22 m) with higher organic matter enrichment. The multivariate canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the foraminiferal assemblages reflected the shallow to deep water transition in the Malacca Strait. Water depth, which defines the depositional environment, had a greater influence on foraminifera distribution here than organic matter and salinity.

AB  - The current manuscript presents the main issues related to the "Clean Ocean" outcome that arose from the Regional South Atlantic (SA) Planning Workshop for the UN Decade of Ocean Science and five Brazilian Regional Planning Workshops. An interdisciplinary and trans-sectoral group constituted by the academia, non-governmental agencies, the private sector, decision-makers, the navy, and local communities discussed the main anthropogenic drivers compromising the current environmental status of the SA and its ecological services, and debated the main research gaps, priorities and needs for improving technical and structural capacities in order to roadmap the Brazilian actions for the Decade of Ocean Science. The aim of this review is to contribute to a social solution-driven understanding of the ocean ecosystems, to create conditions to promote sustainable development and to secure a clean, healthy ocean. We are proposing a list of actions to be implemented by the Decade of Ocean Science that will have the pivotal role to promote technical and scientific capacity development, increase research infrastructure and institutional frameworks, develop national public policies aimed at reducing the input of pollutants and management of impacts, and warranting food security and ecosystem health. The earlier the actions in controlling pollutants are implemented, along with the identification of key sources and prevention of crossing of thresholds will help to avert worst-case scenarios, reducing the socio-economic disparities of impacts across nations and social groups and supporting the sustainable development of a pollutant-free ocean.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the link between environmental conditions and the vegetation pattern of mountain peatlands drained for forestry. We assumed that (a) water chemistry and soil properties differ between the investigated peatlands types-from fen to bog, (b) the vegetation pattern is dependent on water chemistry and soil properties, and (c) water chemistry and soil properties play different roles in determining peatland patterning. For our study, five ecologically and topographically diverse forestry-drained shallow peatlands in Central Sudetes, Poland, were selected. A comparison between the studied peatlands and environmental variables was done by discriminant analysis, whereas vegetation-environmental relationship was analysed by canonical correspondence analysis. Results demonstrated that pH, HCO3-, NO3-, and Ca2+ best explained the variation in water chemistry (approximately 74%), whereas base saturation, pH(water), and plant-available phosphorus best explained the variation in soil properties. Plant assemblages within the peatlands exhibited three vegetation clusters that did not always correspond to peatland ecological type. The vegetation was mostly affected by water chemistry (explained up to 54% of variation), rather than by soil properties. Vegetation within such ecosystems seems to be a good indicator of differences in water chemistry, caused by differences in bedrock (soligenic fen peatlands) or atmospheric inputs (ombrogenic bogs). Our results will help improve our understanding of vegetation-environment relationships in degraded mountain peatland ecosystems in the temperate climate zone. They might also be useful for proper planning of restoration and monitoring of these ecosystems.

AB  - Increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution affects N deposition in alpine ecosystems. Moss often dominates these ecosystems and their N content (%N) and stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) are used as indicators of atmospheric N deposition. Here, we used a single moss species (Hylocomiwn splendens) as a bioindicator of atmospheric N deposition in the mountainous areas of Japan. The moss was collected from 38 sites on all slope aspects (east, west, south, and north) ranging from 1800 to 2800 m in altitude. The correlation between moss N variables (%N and delta N-15) and environmental conditions (altitude and slope aspects) was analyzed using linear models based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In the constructed models, %N showed a significant or weak negative correlation with altitude on all slope aspects. In contrast, delta N-15 was significantly and positively correlated with altitude, with high values on the western alpine slopes. When using delta N-15 as a marker of N sources, N in alpine moss on the west slope seemed to be influenced by transboundary N pollutants through particulate matter (PM), which is brought to Japan from mainland Asia by prevailing westerly winds and northwest monsoons. However, as moss N is also affected by other factors, such as different N chemical forms, fixed N from cyanobacteria, and seasonal differences in atmospheric N, further research should directly compare moss N with atmospheric N deposition to elucidate the influence of transboundary N pollutants on moss N.

AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most diverse biomes on Earth but human activities are transforming this ecosystem into one of the most endangered. Most remnant old-growth rainforest is embedded within a mosaic of regenerating forest, tree plantations, pastures, and agricultural production. This has left a large percentage of the region's endemic species threatened with extinction. Butterflies are considered as sensitive indicators of ecological conditions, especially in the Atlantic forest. This community can provide a window into animal response to restoration and how recovering habitats are used by native animal communities. The primary goal of this paper was to determine if butterfly communities respond to measures of structural recovery in naturally regenerating and re-forested pastures, and if this response increases the similarity of recovering butterfly communities relative to those of intact forests. Butterfly communities were sampled using two sampling methodologies, passive bait trapping and timed meander counts. These data sets were combined and correlated to assessment of habitat structure. We found that butterfly communities respond rapidly to structural changes in habitats as forest structure recovers on abandoned and restored pastures. While many species of mature forest inhabiting butterflies use regenerating forests as habitat, our young forests also retained an almost intact community of ruderal pasture inhabiting butterflies as well, indicating that these habitats retain many features of highly disturbed pastures. We suggest that measures of beta-diversity, which can be used to assess convergence in community structure, are far superior to the alpha-diversity measures that are typically used for assessing restoration recovery.

AB  - River estuaries and semi-enclosed bays with poor water exchange are considered as sensitive coastal areas. The determination of nutrients and potential toxicity in sediments represent important elements in their environmental quality assessment process. Sediments act both as sink and as a source of toxic environmental compounds. In this study, spatial variations of sediment nutrients and toxicity in coastal areas with limited water exchange (Rjecina River basin, Bakar Bay) in vicinity of the industrial and urban centre of Rijeka was examined. In sediment of Rjecina basin, both total nitrogen and total phosphorus exhibited a clear spatial pattern characterized by the natural and anthropogenic enrichment of the sediment along the river flow. The N:P ratio ranged from high upstream to low in marine sediments. Potential sediment toxicity varied from highly toxic to not toxic, in accordance to the river flow and the anthropogenic input. In Bakar Bay, nitrogen and phosphorus originated from different sources. The main sources of nutrients were situated in the northern part of the bay while a higher homogeneity of environmental conditions was present in its southern part. No correlation between the concentration of nutrients and sediment toxicity was found in both investigated areas. Therefore, the local impact of different contamination sources created a heterogeneous scenario from both the geochemical and ecotoxicological point of view. Moreover, this study confirmed the Microtox (R) assay as a sensitive sediment toxicity screening tool and supported the idea of sediment toxicity as an independent parameter considered as vital in assessing ecological risks for biota and describing the environmental quality of sites with multiple sources of contamination.

AB  - We analyzed responses of chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) communities to environmental factors in 124 natural, moderately, and highly disturbed springs in the Italian Prealps and Alps to investigate environmental factors influencing species distribution in springs and to evaluate chironomids as bioindicators of spring water quality. Self-Organizing Map analysis found differences among spring types and effects of anthropogenic pressures. Natural or little-disturbed springs at high altitude with low temperature, low conductivity, and high current velocity differed from lowland springs, including highly disturbed ones, with low current velocity and higher temperature, conductivity, and nutrient concentrations. Cold stenothermal intolerant species were clustered in the 1st group, tolerant and euriecious species in the 2nd group. Indicator value analysis detected species characterizing springs with different degrees of disturbance and of different types. Most species' distributions were related to water temperature and conductivity. Coinertia Analysis (CoA) detected relationships among species structure and environmental variables. CoA axis 1 represented a gradient of water temperature, altitude, alkalinity, and conductivity and separated cold stenothermal species (Pseudokiefferiella parva, Pseudodiamesa branickii, Diamesa spp.) from species tolerant of high temperatures (Polypedilum nubeculosum, Phaenopsectra flavipes, Paratrissocladius excerptus). Axis 2 represented a hydrologic (rheocrene-limnocrene) and anthropogenic disturbance (total disturbance, agriculture, organic debris) gradient and separated species by preference for water velocity and spring type (rheocrenes: Eukiefferiella spp.; limnocrenes: Prodiamesa olivacea, Natarsia sp.), and pollution tolerance (P. nubeculosum, Macropelopia spp.). Water temperature and chemical composition affected chironomid distribution. Some species were associated with degraded (P. nubeculosum) or pristine conditions (Diamesa spp., Stilocladius montanus).

AB  - Land use and land cover changes associated with urbanization have had a significant influence on ecosystem services (ESs), but previous studies have insufficiently focused on the relationships between ES supply and demand; these relationships are seldom considered in the science-policy frameworks of land use planning. In this study, a specific supply-demand indicator was constructed to measure ES supply and demand and their disparity across multiple scales in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2018. High spatial heterogeneity and mismatches of ES supply and demand were found in water yield, grain production, carbon sequestration, soil conservation, heat regulation, and recreation services. At provincial scale, the supplies of carbon sequestration and heat regulation services were smaller than their demands. At the 1-km(2) grid scale, the ES supply and demand mismatches in urban areas were more serious than those in surrounding areas, especially for carbon sequestration and recreation services. Five ES supply-demand risk zones were identified based on the current status and trends of all ES supply and demand. Southern Jiangsu generally had high risks of ES mismatch, which should be reduced by strategic planning. Constructing the ES supply-demand indicator is a novel practice that assists in evaluating environmental issues and integrating them into further development decisions. This paper suggests that governments should reduce ES mismatches with reference to local conditions (economic development, industrial type, and ecological carrying capacity) and the actual situation of ES supply and demand.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide important feeding opportunities for shorebirds, depending on their prey availability, hydrodynamic conditions and human pressure. We aimed to evaluate short-term responses (occurrence and minimum approach distance) of shorebirds to urbanization and natural drivers on an extensive beach arc adjacent to the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon of South America. The presence of the migrant Sanderling Calidris alba and resident Collared Plover Charadrius collaris was geo-coordinated and for each record and an equivalent number of random points we measured the distance from urban settlements, swash width and invertebrate abundance (food availability) in a snapshot sampling. The distance at which each shorebird flock escaped from humans was determined (minimum approach distance). The occurrence of shorebirds was predicted by food availability, and higher crustacean density was found in areas of shorebird occurrence (37 +/- 19 individuals/m(2)) compared to random points (10 +/- 10 individuals/m(2)). This result highlights the importance of the beach as a feeding area and the need for conservation of shorebirds' prey. The resident Collared Plover delayed their escape from humans in areas closer to urban areas, suggesting a higher tolerance to humans on disturbed beaches, where they can prioritize the food intake rather than vigilance. The larger flocks let the researcher get closer, corroborating the risk-dilution theory stating that flocking behaviour during foraging provides protection of birds from predators. In conclusion, our results showed that monitoring of sandy beaches based on shorebirds' presence and behaviour can be a reliable tool, especially close to coastal lagoons that constitute foraging sites for these charismatic species.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (also referred to as the Plateau) is the largest area bearing alpine permafrost region in the world and thus is endowed with great formation conditions and prospecting potential of natural gas hydrates (NGH). Up to now, one NGH accumulation, two inferred NGH accumulations, and a series of NGH-related anomalous indicators have been discovered in the Plateau, with NGH resources predicted to be up to 8.88x10(12) m(3). The NGH in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have complex gas components and are dominated by deep thermogenic gas. They occur in the Permian-Jurassic strata and are subject to thin permafrost and sensitive to environment. Furthermore, they are distinctly different from the NGH in the high-latitude permafrost in the arctic regions and are more different from marine NGH. The formation of the NGH in the Plateau obviously couples with the uplift and permafrost evolution of the Plateau in spatial-temporal terms. The permafrost and NGH in the Qilian Mountains and the main body of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau possibly formed during 2.0-1.28 Ma BP and about 0.8 Ma BP, respectively. Under the context of global warming, the permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is continually degrading, which will lead to the changes in the stability of NGH. Therefore, The NGH of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau can not be ignored in the study of the global climate change and ecological environment. (C) 2021 China Geology Editorial Office.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that people feel happier in more natural environments than in predominantly built-up environments; however, it is less clear whether the type of natural environment matters. In a large-scale experience sampling study in the Netherlands, we explored whether happiness differs by the type of natural environment experienced. We also investigated to what extent scenic beauty, peacefulness or fascinatingness are associated with momentary happiness. Smartphone apps were developed for both iOS and Android smartphones, and made freely available in both app stores. The app, named HappyHier, sent requests to fill in a short questionnaire, starting with how happy the participant feels. The requests were programmed to oversample experiences in natural environments. Location data were provided by the GPS of the smartphone, and the type of environment was determined based on a land-use map incorporated in the app. HappyHier was launched with a media campaign starting on 1st May 2016. In the following few months, over 4000 people participated, generating over 100,000 experience samples. Multi-level analyses were conducted, controlling for, among other things, being inside or outside, type of activity, type of company and weather conditions. The participants generally felt happier in natural environments, especially at the coast and in areas with low-lying natural vegetation, such as heathlands. Whether the environment is thought to be peaceful and fascinating appears to be more important for happiness than its scenic beauty. The representativeness of the data gathered by this relatively new method was explored from several angles: people, time and location.

AB  - The industrial space favors the creation of artificial water bodies which should be seen as a new resource of potential use. The aim of the study was to assess the possibility of using the newly created clarification pond from opencast mine dewatering system to extensive aquaculture and determine the effect of hydrochemical and hydrobiological parameters, i.e. water quality and trophic indices, on the growth ratio of the one-year-old ide, Leuciscus idus. In 2014-2017, the experiment was carried out twice. The trophic state index (TSI) based on total phosphorus and Secchi disk transparency indicated eutrophy or hypereutrophy, while TSI based on chlorophyll a, total nitrogen and rotifers pointed at from oligotrophy to meso-eutrophy. The redundancy analysis showed the negative relationships between phytoplankton and total suspended solids, phosphates, iron and electric conductivity. Only nitrates correlated positively with phytoplankton and negatively with zooplankton. The hydrochemical background, including the concentration of trace elements, has not been a limitation or a threat to biological potential of the aquatic environment. After 11 months, the total length of ide increased in the range of 70%-77%. In turn, the weight increased in the range of 403%-476%. With a generally poor density of planktonic organisms but chemically enriched waters, high growth potential has been maintained. The results suggest that the clarification ponds, next to their basic technological function, have a biological potential. Thus, they can be successfully used for other purposes. Our observations are an initiation to further analyses directed to the functioning of water ecosystem under turbid water conditions of clarification pond with the use for aquaculture.

AB  - Petroleum industry can create enormous wealth and employment opportunities, which is one of the pillars of the national economy. The transportation conditions of petroleum products are complex and changeable. The natural disaster-induced dangerous chemical leakage may damage the ecological environment, which leads to substantial economic losses. It significantly undermines the sustainable development agenda. Therefore, assessing the possibility of leakage and the potential environmental damages becomes a primary task to decision-makers to formulate maintenance plans. This paper evaluated the risk of an oil pipeline leakage under the regional geological disasters. Specifically, risk assessment indicators system was established considering the common threat of multiple natural hazards in the region. The sensitivities of the influence factors were determined using the combined GIS and the contribution rate model. The fuzzy analysis approach was used to process the expert's judgment to obtain a real-time disaster hazard. Meanwhile, in terms of the analysis of pipeline failure causes, the assessment system of disaster resistance ability was developed to determine the possibility of leakage. The leakage-induced environmental losses were quantified by monetary quantification. Finally, the level of environmental risk was determined using a 5 x 5 probability-currency matrix. Case results show that the risk level is medium, thereby appropriate maintenance measures need to be taken to reduce the risk. Overall, this study provides necessary help to prevent the leakage of petroleum products in transportation. Also, the environmental risk presented in the form of currency can promote non-environmental professional risk decision-makers better understand the degree of risk.

AB  - Browning caused by colored dissolved organic matter is predicted to have large effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, there is limited experimental evidence about direct and indirect effects of browning on zooplankton in complex field settings. We used a combination of an ecosystem-scale enclosure experiment and laboratory incubations to test how prolonged browning affects physiological and life-history traits of the water flea Daphnia longispina, a key species in lake food webs, and whether any such effects are reversible. Daphnids and water were collected from enclosures in a deep clear-water lake, where the natural plankton community had been exposed for 10 weeks to browning or to control conditions in clear water. Daphnid abundance was much lower in the brown than in the clear enclosure. Surprisingly, however, daphnids continuously kept in brown enclosure water in the laboratory showed increased metabolic performance and survival, and also produced more offspring than daphnids kept in clear enclosure water. This outcome was related to more and higher-quality seston in brown compared to clear water. Moreover, daphnids transferred from clear to brown water or vice versa adjusted their nucleic acid and protein contents, as indicators of physiological state, to similar levels as individuals previously exposed to the respective recipient environment, indicating immediate and reversible browning effects on metabolic performance. These results demonstrate the importance of conducting experiments in settings that capture both indirect effects (i.e., emerging from species interactions in communities) and direct effects on individuals for assessing impacts of browning and other environmental changes on lakes.

AB  - This study explores the significant role of indigenous traditional ecological knowledge (ITEK) in weather forecast prediction and fishing related activities in the coastal villages of Tamil Nadu. In total, 33 rural coastal villages were studied for different uses of ecological indicators in seasonal predictions based on oceanographic parameters, hydro-geological, astrophysical, meteorological and biological conditions. We focused on oral dialects from traditional fishing practitioners, local community leaders and fishers as efficient respondents to carry out the study. In addition, we also attempted to develop a template of seasonal ecological calendar based on ecological indicators of Tamil Nadu coastline. This conceptualisation can also be absorbed on a synoptic scale as an integration framework of ITEK and scientific innovations. On the other perspective, it is so factual that adaptation of ITEKs in the current decades is in verge of extinction due to several factors such as modernization, technological advancements and waning intergenerational knowledge transmissions. In the face of losing ITEKs, it is crucial to integrate ITEKs in the scientific seasonal forecasting of environmental changes and climatic events to facilitate better decision making policies on adaptation and mitigation strategies. It is highly essential to build the concept of conservation and documentation of ITEK to solve the climate crisis and effective decision making. In the recent years, the approach of integrating biophysical and social sciences on understanding earth science is an emerging concept to enhance climate knowledge. Application and integration of ITEKs with scientific ecological modelling systems possess tremendous potential to develop accurate scientific forecasts and reliable future predictions.

AB  - The relationship between environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity represents a cornerstone of ecological research. While environmental descriptors over large extents usually have medium-to-low spatial resolution, in situ measures provide accurate information for limited areas, and a gap remains in providing remote descriptors that represent local environmental structure. Texture from satellite images can represent fine-scale heterogeneity over wide spatial coverage, but to date, it has mostly been used to predict general aspects of species diversity, such as richness. Here, we assess the utility of image textures from high-resolution satellite images (RapidEye 3A) and in situ variables to predict differences in the composition of anuran communities in a tropical savanna (Cerrado) of Brazil. While in situ measures accounted for compositional differences in the whole community, two measures of image textures were associated only with the variation of species within the Hylidae family (adj. R-2 = 0.16 and 0.14). Comparatively, image textures predicted ~2/3 of the variation explained by in situ measures (adj. R-2 = 0.23). When both approaches were combined, a greater compositional variation was achieved (adj. R-2 = 0.28), with 1/5 of it shared by both in situ and textures, and 1/5 attributed solely to texture. Our findings suggest that image texture can complement the assessment of environmental heterogeneity acting on the assembly of local anuran communities. This approach can be valuable for explicitly including spatial heterogeneity in biological assessments over broad spatial extents, especially for biological groups strongly filtered by environmental conditions. in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB  - Climate-smart interventions in agriculture have varying costs and environmental and economic impacts. Their implementation requires appropriate investment decisions by policy makers that are relevant for current as well as future scenarios of agro-ecology, climate and economic development. Decision support tools are therefore needed to assist different stakeholders to prioritize and hence implement appropriate strategic interventions. These interventions transform agriculture ecosystems to climate-resilient, adaptive and efficient. This paper outlines the mathematical modelling framework of one such, the Climate Smart Agricultural Prioritization (CSAP) toolkit. This toolkit employs a dynamic, spatially-explicit multi-objective optimization model to explore a range of agricultural growth pathways coupled with climate-adaptation strategies to meet agricultural development and environmental goals. The toolkit consists of three major components: (i) land evaluation including assessment of resource availability, land suitability, yield and input-output estimation for all promising crop production practices and technologies for key agro-ecological units; (ii) formulation of scenarios based on policy views and development plans; and (iii) land-use optimization in the form of linear programming models. Climate change and socio-economic drivers condition the land evaluation, technological input-output relations, and specification of optimization objectives that define modelled scenarios. By integrating detailed bottom-up biophysical, climate impact and agricultural-emissions models, CSAP is capable of supporting multi-objective analysis of agricultural production goals in relation to food self-sufficiency, incomes, employment and mitigation targets, thus supporting a wide range of analyses ranging from food security assessment to environmental impact assessment to preparation of climate smart development plans.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to investigate the optimal environment for (chemical and physical properties of water, feeding type), and biological indicators (growth, development and sustainability) of, sturgeon breeding in pond adopted to natural environmental conditions. The research resulted in data on productive (vital capacity) and biological indicators (weight, length, maximum, nominal and daily average growth of biomass) of four species of sturgeon: Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii Brandt), stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus Pallas), and paddlefish (Polyodon spathula Walbaum). The water analysis has shown the following physical and chemical parameters of water in the reservoirs: pH - 3.8-6.6, total hardness - 2.8-4.8 mg-equ/dm(3). This research shows that the highest rates of daily average growth for the five-month period had the paddlefish fry (24.44 g), Russian (22.13 g) and Siberian sturgeon fry (19.28 g). Final weighting shown that paddlefish fry had the best indicators among all studied species (m=1.8 kg). The coefficient of variation (C-v > 7) indicates high phenotypic variation in all studied species of sturgeon. Ichtyopathological study of experiments revealed that none of stellate sturgeon, Russian and Siberian sturgeon and paddlefish were infected. As it was revealed, feed with higher protein (56% relative to 50 %) causes greater increase in weight (+0.2 kg).
   Obtained results show that paddlefish and stellate sturgeon have the best parameters for breeding in ponds. Research results can be applied for sturgeon breeding in ponds with similar chemical and physical properties.

AB  - A fully integrated, physically-based MIKE SHE/MIKE11 model was developed for the Mokolo River basin flow system to simulate key hydraulic and hydrologic indicator inputs to the Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation for Arid Rivers (DRIFT-ARID) decision support system (DSS). The DRIFT-ARID tool is used in this study to define environmental water requirements (EWR) for non-perennial river flow systems in South Africa to facilitate ecosystem-based management of water resources as required by the National Water Act (Act No. 36 of 1998). Fifty years of distributed daily climate data (1950 to 2000) were used to calibrate the model against decades of daily discharge data at various gauges, measurements of Mokolo Dam stage levels, and one-time groundwater level measurements at hundreds of wells throughout the basin. Though the calibrated model captures much of the seasonal and post-event stream discharge response characteristics, lack of sub-daily climate and stream discharge data limits the ability to calibrate the model to event-level system response (i.e. peak flows). In addition, lack of basic subsurface hydrogeologic characterisation and transient groundwater level data limits the ability to calibrate the groundwater flow model, and therefore baseflow response, to a high level. Despite these limitations, the calibrated model was used to simulate changes in hydrologic and hydraulic indicators at five study sites within the basin for five 50-year land-use change scenarios, including a present-day (with dam), natural conditions (no development/irrigation), and conversion of present-day irrigation to game farm, mine/city expansion, and a combination of the last two. Challenges and recommendations for simulating the range of non-perennial systems are presented.

AB  - At both local and landscape levels, farm management is the main driver of land cover change influencing ecosystem functions, processes and traits. In Mediterranean large-scale silvo-pastoral systems these changes can have serious implications in the provision of valuable ecosystem services (ES). Current ES assessment, mapping and valuation are still focused in representing the state and trends of ES provision, often missing the link to actual farm management and farm management systems. We propose an approach that, at the farm level, combines the classification of farm management systems with indicators of ES provision. This is illustrated for soil erosion prevention, a key ES in mitigating current and future impacts in Mediterranean regions and the proposed approach is tested in Southern Portugal. We characterize thirty-eight large-scale farm management units (FMU) regarding their management system and environmental traits. Each FMU was then classified according to their management system and a set of ES indicators was calculated. To classify the FMU, data on livestock composition and grazing density, pastures, and soil mobilization practices were object of a cluster analysis and the result was tested against a set of ES indicators. The results highlight the implications and challenges for the provision of soil erosion prevention under different farm management systems and draw a clear relation between more intensive management practices and the degradation of service provision. Our results can also be used to support land management and policy design through the definition of intensity thresholds that consider the local environmental and ecological conditions.

AB  - Because old trees contain centuries of environmental history investigators are increasingly turning to dendrochronology to create context for current environmental change While a suite of characteristics to identify old trees has been developed most of these characteristics are for conifers or trees growing in low density forests Given that the diverse Eastern Deciduous Forest (EDF) is dominated by a species rich angiosperm dominated woody flora old growth forests are scarce in the EDF and research permits in natural areas often limit the number of trees that can be sampled having a suite of characteristics that identify old trees for a wider range of species increases the likelihood of efficiently creating longer depths of ecological history The common indicators of old (> 250 year old) EDF an giosperms are presented to aid in the recovery and preservation of these living sources of information Six common external characteristics of old angiosperm trees include (1) smooth or balding bark (2) low stem taper (3) high stem sinuosity (4) crowns comprised of few large diameter twisting limbs (5) low crown volume and (6) a low ratio of leaf area to trunk volume The existence of old trees in the landscape can also be related to life history traits or land use histories Both professionals and lay folk can be trained to identify these traits and environmental conditions While these characteristics and settings generally signal the potential for old trees there is no guarantee that they represent old ages However these characteristics should aid in the discovery of old trees throughout the EDF

AB  - Headwater forests serve many ecological functions and may be particularly responsive to changes in climate and land use. Riparian birds can serve as indicators of changes in their associated ecosystems. Little known, however, are combined influences of climate and land use on riparian birds and riparian ecosystems. We examined multiscale associations between these environmental conditions and reproduction of the Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla), a riparian-obligate songbird that breeds in the eastern United States. Specifically, we measured variables at multiple spatial and temporal scales to model crucial components of individual fecundity, using an information-theoretic approach. We monitored 190 nests in 139 territories within 13 drainages from 2002 to 2005. Daily nest survival reached a maximum when mean rainfall was intermediate (3-10 mm day(-1)) during the nesting period. Nestling survival, by contrast, reached its maximum with high amounts of rainfall (>14 mm day(-1)). Nestling survival declined with increasing territory size and was lowest in areas that were far from clearcuts and fields (>= 160 m) but were surrounded by large expanses of fields (>= 40% within 1.75 km). Urban land uses surrounding drainages, proximity to edges, measures of food availability, differences among years, and timing of nesting had weak, if any, effects on Louisiana Waterthrush reproduction. These findings indicate that reproduction by this riparian obligate is negatively associated with (1) rainfall extremes and agricultural land use and (2) size of the territory defended by the male.

AB  - Termite ecology came of age in 1978 with the seminal review of Wood and Sands which by considering the quantitative contributions made by termites to the carbon cycle at the landscape level concluded that they were major players in tropical ecosystems. Subsequent field work in the succeeding two decades was summarised in 2000 by Bignell and Eggleton, the most recent review which attempted to cover the entire topic in detail, which included 188 listed references and has been extensively cited for almost 20 years. Subsequent summaries more narrowly defined or in some cases more superficial are listed in the bibliography. In this overview, the main and subsidiary headings in Bignell and Eggleton are revisited and reclassified in the light of 186 selected articles added to the relevant literature since 2000, and some earlier work. While the literature on termite ecology remains buoyant, it has declined relative to publications on other aspects of termite biology. Overall, the thesis that termites have a major impact on, and are major indicators of soil health and landscape integrity in the tropics and sub-tropics is maintained, but the drivers of local diversity, abundance and biomass remain complex, with many biographical, edaphic and optimum sampling issues not completely resolved. The large increase in diversity and abundance data from Neotropical biomes can also be noted.

AB  - The reactivation of faults induced by natural/human induced fluid pressure increases is a major concern to explain subsurface fluid migration and to estimate the risk of losing the integrity of reservoir/seal systems. This study focusses on paleo-fluid migration in a strike slip fault with >100 m long, affecting a Toarcian shale (Causses Basin, France). A high calcite concentration is observed in a 5 cm thick zone at the boundary between the fault core and damage zone. Cumulated displacements in this zone are of millimeter-to-centimeter-scale offsets and different dilatant deformation textures are observed. The zone is affected by thin slip planes containing gouge. Cathodo-luminescence observations indicate that two phases of vein formation occurred. The first phase coincides with the fluid migration along this centimeter thick dilatant zone. The second one is associated to re-shear along the millimeter thick slip planes that results in more localized mineralization, but also in a better hydrologic connection through the shale formation. These results show that in shales fluids may migrate off a slipping surface in centimeter scale dilatant volumes, at first controlled by the intact shale anisotropy related to bedding and then favored by brecciating, structures re-orientation and strengthening processes induced by calcite sealing effects.

AB  - Several recent reports described an apoptosis-like programmed cell death (PCD) process in yeast in response to different environmental challenges. In this study, hyperosmotic stress caused by high NaCl concentration in culture medium induced cell death in the haploid yeast Torulopsis glabrata. Propidium iodide (PI) and PI/rhodamine-123 (Rh123) dual staining with flow cytometry showed that high salinity decreased intact cells by 16.5 %, increased necrotic cells by nearly twofold, and altered fermentative parameters appreciably. Morphological and biochemical indicators of apoptosis were apparent, specifically a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (a dagger I-m), translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer side of the plasma membrane, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and involvement of caspase all while plasma membrane integrity was maintained. Additionally, it was found that overexpression of YCA1 drastically stimulated cell death, indicating that activation of metacaspase might lead to cell death. However, T. glabrata growth under hyperosmotic stress was enhanced when FIS1, HOG1, and GPD2 were overexpressed, or when exogenous proline or glutathione (GSH) were added into the cultures, both of which could repress caspase-3 activity. Thus, in these concrete cases of overexpression of anti-apoptotic or anti-necrotic factors and pharmacological manipulations, it decreased T. glabrata cell death that might help to achieve higher fermentative efficiency.

AB  - Impact of leptospermone, a beta-triketone bioherbicide, was investigated on the fungal community which supports important soil ecological functions such as decomposition of organic matter and nutrients recycling. This study was done in a microcosm experiment using two French soils, Perpignan (P) and Saint-Jean-de-Fos (SJF), differing in their physicochemical properties and history treatment with synthetic beta-triketones. Soil microcosms were treated with leptospermone at recommended dose and incubated under controlled conditions for 45 days. Untreated microcosms were used as control. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the fungal rRNA revealed significant changes in fungal community structure and diversity in both soils. Xylariales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales and Capnodiales (Ascomycota phyla) fungi and those belonging to Sebacinales, Cantharellales, Agaricales, Polyporales, Filobasidiales and Tremellales orders (Basidiomycota phyla) were well represented in treated soil microcosms compared to control. Nevertheless, while for the treated SJF a complete recovery of the fungal community was observed at the end of the experiment, this was not the case for the P treated soil, although no more bioherbicide remained. Indeed, the relative abundance of most of the saprophytic fungi were lower in treated soil compared to control microcosms whereas fungi from parasitic fungi included in Spizellomycetales and Pezizales orders increased. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study assessing the effect of the bioherbicide leptospermone on the composition and diversity of the fungal community in soil. This study showed that leptospermone has an impact on alpha- and beta-diversity of the fungal community. It underlines the possible interest of microbial endpoints for environmental risk assessment of biopesticide.

AB  - Sediments of Lake Kojle, located in the transition zone between the nemoral and boreal biogeographic zones in NE Poland, were analysed to verify the response of the aquatic ecosystem to major environmental changes. High-resolution plant macrofossil, mollusc and pollen data were derived from two replicate parallel cores and revealed several shifts in the biota composition within the littoral zone between 250 BCE and 1550 CE. The reaction of the aquatic ecosystem to temperature changes was found to be minor, which is ascribed to the mitigating influence of water and the wide ecological tolerance of most of the taxa. Najas marina, considered as an indicator of wanner conditions, was the only species that clearly reacted to the long-term climate shifts. We consider lake level changes that resulted from fluctuations in climate humidity and the filling of the lake with sediments as the most important factors that control the presence of macrophytes species from the genera Nymphaea, Nuphar, Typha, and Chara. Mollusc diversity and abundance increased with the increase in the diversity and biomass of submerged vegetation. However, reduced dissolved oxygen within the water column under the floating leaves of Nymphaea alba and Nuphar sp. resulted in the retreat of Planorbis carinatus, a gastropod species sensitive to oxygen shortages. Major shifts in the developments of fauna and flora were parallel in the two studied cores, but some spatial variability was observed. This might be due to the spatial variability of the macrophyte and mollusc communities within Lake Kojle.

AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is a policy challenge, especially for areas with unfavorable conditions for agriculture and remote and mountainous areas. Agricultural abandonment is an important land use process in many world regions and one of the dominant land use change processes in Europe. Previous studies have shown that abandonment can have both positive and negative effects on several environmental processes, influenced by location and scale. Preferred policies and management of these areas are debated given concerns for the loss of (traditional) agricultural landscapes and potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We present a European-scale impact assessment of the possible effects of agricultural abandonment, based on eight indicators that are on the forefront of the agricultural abandonment debate. Using a multi-scale modelling approach, we expect between 71.277 and 211.814 km(2) of agricultural abandonment in 2040. Impacts on the indicators and trade-offs between the impacts are spatially variable. A typology of typical trade-off bundles at a 1 km(2) resolution resulted in four typical trade-off clusters. All clusters identified are characterized by a loss of agriculture-related values, such as agro-biodiversity and cultural heritage. For two clusters, this was accompanied by positive effects on indicators such as carbon sequestration, nature recreation and mammal habitat suitability. Overall, our results indicate that location and scale are key to assess the trade-offs originating from agricultural abandonment in Europe. Identification of typical trade-offs bundles can help to distinguish potential desirable outcomes of agricultural abandonment and assist in targeting measures to areas that face similar management challenges.

AB  - The temporal dynamics of biogeochemical variables derived from a coupled 3-D model of the Mediterranean Sea are evaluated for the last 50years (1960-2010) against independent data on fisheries catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the same time period. Concordant patterns are found in the time series of all of the biological variables (from the model and from fisheries statistics), with low values at the beginning of the series, a later increase, with maximum levels reached at the end of the 1990s, and a posterior stabilization. Spectral analysis of the annual biological time series reveals coincident low-frequency signals in all of them. The first, more energetic signal peaks around the year 2000, while the second, less energetic signal peaks near 1982. Almost identical low-frequency signals are found in the nutrient loads of the rivers and in the integrated nutrient levels in the surface marine ecosystem. Nitrate concentration shows a maximum level in 1998, with a later stabilization to present-day values, coincident with the first low-frequency signal found in the biological series. Phosphate shows maximum concentrations around 1982 and a posterior sharp decline, in concordance with the second low-frequency signal observed in the biological series. That result seems to indicate that the control of marine productivity (plankton to fish) in the Mediterranean is principally mediated through bottom-up processes that could be traced back to the characteristics of riverine discharges. The high sensitivity of CPUE time series to environmental conditions might be another indicator of the overexploitation of this marine ecosystem.

AB  - Varenicline is believed to work, in part, by reducing craving responses to smoking cues and by reducing general levels of craving; however, these hypotheses have never been evaluated with craving assessed in the natural environments of treatment-seeking smokers.
   Ecological momentary assessment procedures were used to assess the impact of varenicline on cue-specific and general craving in treatment-seeking smokers prior to quitting.
   For 5 weeks prior to quitting, 60 smokers carried personal digital assistants that assessed their response to smoking or neutral cues. During week 1 (baseline), participants did not receive medication; during weeks 2-4 (drug manipulation), participants were randomized to receive varenicline or placebo; during week 5 (standard therapy), all participants received varenicline. Craving was assessed before each cue; cue-specific craving and attention to cue were assessed after each cue.
   During all phases, smoking cues elicited greater craving than neutral cues; the magnitude of this effect declined after the first week. General craving declined across each phase of the study. Relative to the placebo condition, varenicline was associated with a greater decline in general craving over the drug manipulation phase. Varenicline did not significantly attenuate cue-specific craving during any phase of the study.
   Smoking cues delivered in the natural environment elicited strong craving responses in treatment-seeking smokers, but cue-specific craving was not affected by varenicline administered prior to the quit attempt. These findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of varenicline is not mediated by changes in cue-specific craving during the pre-quit period of treatment-seeking smokers.

AB  - Bioenergy from sustainably managed forest ecosystems could provide a renewable, carbon-neutral source of energy in many nations and communities throughout the world. In order for forest bioenergy to be an ecologically sustainable fuel source, woodfuel procurement systems must not adversely impact forest ecosystems or the environment. Sustainable forest management (SFM) certification schemes are one mechanism for applying standards and monitoring regimes to forest management systems to ensure ecological sustainability. This paper provides a global review of the main environmental risks to forest ecosystems that can arise from household- to industrial-scale woodfuel production systems, including forest soil quality and site productivity, water resources, biodiversity and carbon budgets. A set of regionally adaptable principles, criteria, indicators and verifiers of sustainable forest management were developed, based on criteria and indicators from existing internationally recognized certification frameworks and scientific literature and tailored to address issues relevant to producing and harvesting forest bioenergy feedstocks. A variable monitoring approach and a three-tiered certification approach are proposed as two methods for enabling the adoption of certification and associated monitoring requirements across a wide range of forest operations in regions with widely differing levels of development. The importance of the Adaptive Forest Management framework inherent in certification systems to ensuring the efficacy and continual improvement in woodfuel sustainability is stressed. The proposed principles, criteria, indicators and verifiers can be adapted to local conditions and incorporated into existing sustainable forest management and green energy certification schemes, as well as other criteria and indicator frameworks, to ensure the environmental sustainability of woodfuel production systems.

AB  - The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) has developed a minimum flows and levels (MFLs) method that has been applied to rivers, lakes, wetlands, and springs. The method is primarily focused on ecological protection to ensure systems meet or exceed minimum eco-hydrologic requirements. MFLs are not calculated from past hydrology. Information from elevation transects is typically used to determine MFLs. Multiple MFLs define a minimum hydrologic regime to ensure that high, intermediate, and low hydrologic conditions are protected. MFLs are often expressed as statistics of long-term hydrology incorporating magnitude (flow and/or level), duration (days), and return interval (years). Timing and rates of change, the two other critical hydrologic components, should be sufficiently natural. The method is an event-based, non-equilibrium approach. The method is used in a regulatory water management framework to ensure that surface and groundwater withdrawals do not cause significant harm to the water resources and ecology of the above referenced system types. MFLs are implemented with hydrologic water budget models that simulate long-term system hydrology. The method enables a priori hydrologic assessments that include the cumulative effects of water withdrawals. Additionally, the method can be used to evaluate management options for systems that may be over-allocated or for eco-hydrologic restoration projects. The method can be used outside of the SJRWMD. However, the goals, criteria, and indicators of protection used to establish MFLs are system-dependent. Development of regionally important criteria and indicators of protection may be required prior to use elsewhere.

AB  - The classification of fish species tolerance to environmental disturbance is often used as a means to assess ecosystem conditions. Its use, however, may be problematic because the approach to tolerance classification is based on subjective judgment. We analyzed fish and physicochemical data from 773 stream sites collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program to calculate tolerance indicator values for 10 physicochemical variables using weighted averaging. Tolerance indicator values (TIVs) for ammonia, chloride, dissolved oxygen, nitrite plus nitrate, pH, phosphorus, specific conductance, sulfate, suspended sediment, and water temperature were calculated for 105 common fish species of the United States. Tolerance indicator values for specific conductance and Sulfate were correlated (rho = 0.87), and thus, fish species may be co-tolerant to these water-quality variables. We integrated TIVs for each species into an overall tolerance classification for comparisons with judgment-based tolerance classifications. Principal components analysis indicated that the distinction between tolerant and intolerant classifications was determined largely by tolerance to suspended sediment, specific conductance, chloride, and total phosphorus. Factors such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH may not be as important in distinguishing between tolerant and intolerant classifications, but may help to segregate species classified as moderate. Empirically derived tolerance classifications were 58.8% in agreement with judgment-derived tolerance classifications. Canonical discriminant analysis revealed that few TIVs, primarily chloride, could discriminate among judgment-derived tolerance classifications of tolerant, moderate, and intolerant. To our knowledge, this is the first empirically based understanding of fish species tolerance for stream fishes in the United States. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global development in the coming decades. Current global trends and ecological dynamics are consistent with very different outcomes, defined by alternative assumptions about the technological, economic, demographic, geopolitical, and social aspects of development and the ways in which institutions, personal and public values, and natural systems may be expected to respond to historically novel stressors. Recent advances in scenario analysis have addressed the dual methodological challenge of exploring these uncertainties in an organized way and determining what would be needed to make the transition to sustainability. This paper reviews global scenario research, setting current efforts in a historical context. it focuses on seven recent studies that are comprehensive, regionally disaggregated, and narratively rich-and thus of greatest relevance to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). It summarizes their social visions and the level of quantitative detail used in these exercises. Taken together, this suite of global scenario studies provides a useful platform for the MA by offering insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude of regional pressures on ecosystems, sounding the alert on critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development, and understanding the importance of institutions and values. But these studies are only a point of departure. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions into global development scenarios, as both effects and causes, is at the cutting edge of scenario analysis. The paper concludes by identifying directions for this research program and suggesting ways that the MA can contribute to this effort.

AB  - To use seabirds as ecological sentinels of marine ecosystems under the incidence of global changes, it is essential to understand linkages between their spatial ecology and environmental conditions. Such information is still lacking for some key areas, including in Europe. We studied the spatial ecology of European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) in Normandy, France, where > 1% of the species' world population, and ca. 20% of its French population breeds. Working on 29 breeding individuals at two colonies (Chausey and Saint-Marcouf), we performed the first GPS-tracking study for the species in this region. On the basis of GPS positions and dive information across 244 foraging trips, we present a general methodological framework to map existing, and model potential seabird habitats. Shags performed dives between 9 and 17 h, and fed at average distances of 5.3 km (Chausey) and 3.3 km (Saint-Marcouf) from their nests. They used 186 km(2) (Chausey) and 143 km(2) (Saint-Marcouf) areas with a depth < 15 m over rocky and sandy habitats. Shags selected areas with an SST around 18 degrees C (Chausey) and 12-13 degrees C (Saint-Marcouf). There is strong evidence that they are year-round residents in these coastal areas and we identified four major environmental changes to which they may react as spatial ecological indicators: climate change, which may impact them directly, or indirectly via shifting prey distributions; fisheries, which may target small pelagic fish such as sandeels, upon which they depend; sediment extraction which may remove benthic habitats critically important to sandeels; and marine windfarms which may result in feeding habitat loss.

AB  - Chironomids, diatoms and microcrustaceans that inhabit aquatic ecosystems of the Northern Neotropics are abundant and diverse. Some species are highly sensitive to changes in water chemical composition and trophic state. This study was undertaken as a first step in developing transfer functions to infer past environmental conditions in the Northern lowland Neotropics. Bioindicator species abundances were related to multiple environmental variables to exploit their use as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators. We collected and analyzed water and surface sediment samples from 63 waterbodies located along a broad trophic state gradient and steep gradients of altitude (similar to 0-1 560m.a.s.l.) and precipitation (similar to 400-3 200mm/y), from NW Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) to southern Guatemala. We related 14 limnological variables to relative abundances of 282 diatom species, 66 chironomid morphospecies, 51 species of cladocerans, 29 non-marine ostracode species and six freshwater calanoid copepods. Multivariate statistics indicated that bicarbonate is the strongest driver of chironomid and copepod distribution. Trophic state is the second most important factor that determines chironomid distribution. Conductivity, which is related to the precipitation gradient and marine influence on the Yucatan Peninsula, is the main variable that shapes diatom, ostracode and cladoceran communities. Diatoms, chironomids and cladocerans displayed higher diversities (H=2.4-2.6) than ostracodes and copepods (H=0.7-1.8). Species richness and diversity were greater at lower elevations (<450m.a.s.l.) than at higher elevations in Guatemala. Distribution and diversity of bioindicators are influenced by multiple factors including altitude, precipitation, water chemistry, trophic state and human impact.

AB  - Green space has been associated with a wide range of health benefits, including stress reduction, but much pertinent evidence has relied on self-reported health indicators or experiments in artificially controlled environmental conditions. Little research has been reported using ecologically valid objective measures with participants in their everyday, residential settings. This paper describes the results of an exploratory study (n = 25) to establish whether salivary cortisol can act as a biomarker for variation in stress levels which may be associated with varying levels of exposure to green spaces, and whether recruitment and adherence to the required, unsupervised, salivary cortisol sampling protocol within the domestic setting could be achieved in a highly deprived urban population. Self-reported measures of stress and general wellbeing were also captured, allowing exploration of relationships between cortisol, wellbeing and exposure to green space close to home. Results indicate significant relationships between self-reported stress (P < 0.01), diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion (P < 0.05). and quantity of green space in the living environment. Regression analysis indicates percentage of green space in the living environment is a significant (P < 0.05) and independent predictor of the circadian cortisol cycle, in addition to self-reported physical activity (P < 0.02). Results also show that compliance with the study protocol was good. We conclude that salivary cortisol measurement offers considerable potential for exploring relationships between wellbeing and green space and discuss how this ecologically valid methodology can be developed to confirm and extend findings in deprived city areas to illuminate why provision of green space close to home might enhance health.

AB  - Cities rely on ecosystems beyond their limits to provide natural resources that are unavailable within their boundaries, and this reliance increases as cities grow. With its development, Macao is changing from a city based primarily on consumption of natural resources to one supported mainly by the gambling and tourism industry. As a result, Macao has recently experienced an economic boom and rapid social development. This paper adopts the emergy analysis method to evaluate the sustainability of Macao's exchange processes in 2004 with respect to the life-support systems outside the city, tourism, and waste treatment processes. Tourism emergy was estimated using the proportional approach, waste emergy synthesis was expanded to include labor and waste treatment services, and Macao's trading partners were divided into China and "other regions" to produce more accurate results. In 2004, imported emergy equaled 241.95 x 10(20) sej, versus exported production equaling 137.23 x 10(20) sej and service exports equaling 42.70 x 10(20) sej. The gambling and tourism industry earned US$ 8.10 billion in 2004, and with a purchasing power of 211.53 x 10(20) sej, it is the largest source for sustaining Macao's dissipative structure. Since sustainability combines social, economic, and ecological factors, a single emergy index cannot measure sustainability adequately. By expanding Odum and Brown's net emergy surplus concept, we developed two aggregated emergy-based indicators: net emergy (NE) and the net emergy ratio (NER). These indicators more accurately reflect the development condition of the city. In addition, we used published data to compare Macao's emergy-based indices with those of four selected cities.

AB  - 1. The marbled newt, Triturus marmoratus, is a vulnerable urodele species (listed on Annex IV of the European Habitats Directive). However, biological information about their migration and the terrestrial habitats they use is relatively scarce. In order to investigate the influence of the surrounding habitats of a local pond on the directions of pre- and post-breeding migrations, adult newts were monitored over two Successive years (from February 2000 to June 2001) at a permanent pond in south-western France using a drift fence and pitfall traps.
   2. In both sexes the entry and exit directions were non-randomly distributed. Furthermore, males and females generally followed similar directions facing an oak forest and avoiding barren areas. However, the directions followed by postbreeding migrants leaving the pond differed from those they followed when coming to the pond.
   3. The distribution of captures around the pond was related to environmental factors, and more precisely to vegetation within the immediate surroundings of the pond.
   4. The environmental conditions occurring at the end of the spring postbreeding migration differed greatly from those occurring during the winter prebreeding migration. Thus, vegetation does not exert similar attraction during the two migration periods.
   5. This raises the importance of microhabitat diversity in the vicinity of the breeding pond, which provides a wide range of suitable shelters in different migration periods. Conservation planning must take into account the ecological requirements of this endangered species in managing buffer zones around the breeding sites. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Despite great efforts in European nature conservation, semi-natural habitats such as calcareous grasslands are still suffering considerable declines due to abandonment. Shrub cutting and subsequent grazing or mowing are effective restoration measures to counteract the adverse effects of management cessation. Here, for the first time, we used leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) as bioindicators to assess the conservation value of restored calcareous grasslands. We compared environmental conditions and leafhopper assemblages of 21 restored grasslands and 21 regularly managed sites (control) within the largest area of calcareous grasslands in the northern part of Germany. Furthermore, we applied Generalised Linear Mixed-effects Models (GLMM) to assess the effects of environmental parameters on species richness of leafhoppers within the restored grasslands. After a period of three to eight years, the restoration measures had led to species-rich leafhopper assemblages, including both habitat specialists and threatened species. However, we still found clear differences in leafhopper composition compared to the control. Within the restored grasslands, a pronounced field layer and an increased number of host plants positively affected species richness. In conclusion, the restored grasslands form open fringe-like habitat structures that clearly enhance the conservation value of calcareous grasslands by (i) harbouring numerous exclusive (indicator) species leading to a higher leafhopper diversity at the habitat level and (ii) by providing habitats for several habitat specialists which occurred only rarely on control grasslands. In order to maintain or even increase the biodiversity of calcareous grasslands, we recommend a combination of traditional grazing and small-scale shrub cutting.

AB  - In certain countries, it is important to monitor for poorly managed freshwaters in order to avoid ecosystem degradation. This can be achieved through biomonitoring involving the use of living organisms as ecological alert indicators. In this context, biotests of the duckweed Lemna gibba (L. gibba) were undertaken to assess the toxic effects of pollutants from the textile industry on a natural ecosystem. L. gibba was exposed to different concentrations (5-100 mg/L) of two dyes, namely Direct Red 89 (DR-89) and Vat Blue 20 (VB-20), under laboratory conditions. Our findings showed that at dye concentrations > 50 mg/L, visible damage to the duckweed (chlorosis and disconnection of fronds, leading to severe necrosis) appeared from the third day of toxicity testing due to the toxicity of the dyes. However, at dye concentrations <= 50 mg/L, the duckweed showed no visible signs of toxicity within an exposure time of 4 days, although these concentrations did significantly reduce the growth rate of L. gibba and its photosynthetic pigment levels. The dye concentration that reduced the growth rate of the plant by 50% (IC50) was 36.3 mg/L for DR-89 and 26.9 mg/L for VB-20. The dye-concentration-dependent reductions in the growth and photosynthetic pigment levels of the duckweed demonstrated that this plant would be sensitive to the concentrations of these dyes in aquatic systems. The current findings therefore prove that physiological alterations occur in L. gibba following dye exposure, suggesting that this species is highly suited to use in the biomonitoring of textile effluents that contaminate water bodies.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) losses from intensified agriculture are a major cause of global change, due to nitrate (NO3-) export and the eutrophication of aquatic systems as well as emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. Diversified agroecosystems with legume cover crops couple N and carbon (C) inputs to soil and reduce N pollution, but there is a need to identify controls on legume N-2 fixation across ecosystems with variable soil conditions. Here, I tested the hypothesis that N mineralization from turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) regulates legume N-2 fixation across 10 farms that spanned a gradient of SOM levels. I separated soil samples into two SOM fractions, based on size and density, which are indicators of soil nutrient cycling and N availability (free particulate organic matter and intra-aggregate particulate organic matter [POM]). This study indicates downregulation of legume N-2 fixation in diversified agroecosystems with increasing N availability in intra-aggregate POM and increasing N mineralization. Intercropping the legume with a grass weakened the relationship between N in POM and N-2 fixation due to N assimilation by the grass. Further, mean rates of N and C mineralization across sites increased with two seasons of a legume-grass cover crop mixture, which could enhance this stabilizing feedback between soil N availability and N-2 fixation over time. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the diversity-ecosystem-function relationships measured in long-term studies of agroecosystems, in which regular use of legume cover crops increases total soil organic C and N and reduces negative environmental impacts of crop production.

AB  - Science and society are increasingly interested in predicting the effects of global change and socio-economic development on natural systems, to ensure maintenance of both ecosystems and human well-being. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services has identified the combination of ecological modelling and scenario forecasting as key to improving our understanding of those effects, by evaluating the relationships and feedbacks between direct and indirect drivers of change, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Using as case study the forests of the Mediterranean basin (complex socio-ecological systems of high social and conservation value), we reviewed the literature to assess (1) what are the modelling approaches most commonly used to predict the condition and trends of biodiversity and ecosystem services under future scenarios of global change, (2) what are the drivers of change considered in future scenarios and at what scales, and (3) what are the nature and ecosystem service indicators most commonly evaluated. Our review shows that forecasting studies make relatively little use of modelling approaches accounting for actual ecological processes and feedbacks between different socio-ecological sectors; predictions are generally made on the basis of a single (mainly climate) or a few drivers of change. In general, there is a bias in the set of nature and ecosystem service indicators assessed. In particular, cultural services and human well-being are greatly underrepresented in the literature. We argue that these shortfalls hamper our capacity to make the best use of predictive tools to inform decision-making in the context of global change.

AB  - The radio elements U-234 U-235, U-238, Th-230, Th-232 an a Po-210 were characterized in lichens, mosses and ferns species sampled in an adjacent coal mine area at Figueira City, Parana State, Brazil, due to their importance for the assessment of human exposure related to the natural radioactivity. The coal is geologically associated with a uranium deposit and has been used as a fossil fuel in a thermal power plant in the city. Samples were initially prepared at LABIDRO (Isotopes and Hydrochemistry Laboratory), UNESP, Rio Claro (SP), Brazil. Then, alpha-spectrometry after several radiochemical steps was used at the Applied Nuclear Physics Laboratories, University of Seville, Seville, Spain, for measuring the activity concentration of the radionuclides. It was Po-210 the radionuclide that most bio-accumulates in the organisms, reaching the highest levels in mosses. The ferns species were less sensitive as bio-monitor than the mosses and lichens, considering polonium in relation to other radionuclides. Fruticose lichens exhibited lower polonium content than the foliose lichens sampled in the same site. Besides biological features, environmental characteristics also modify the radio-elements absorption by lichens and mosses like the type of vegetation covering these organisms, their substrate, the prevailing wind direction, elevation and climatic conditions. Only Po-210 and U-238 correlated in ferns and in soil and rock materials, being particulate emissions from the coal-fired power plant the most probable U-source in the region. Thus, the biomonitors used were able to detect atmospheric contamination by the radionuclides monitored. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecotones, the narrow transition zones between extensive ecological systems, may serve as sensitive indicators of climate change because they harbor species that are often near the limit of their physical and competitive tolerances. We investigated the ecotone between salt marsh and adjacent upland at Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in California, USA. Over a period of 10 years, we monitored movement of the ecotone-upland boundary, plant community structure, and physical factors likely to drive ecotone response. At three undiked sites, the ecotone boundary migrated about 1 m landward, representing a substantial shift for a transition zone that is only a few meters wide. Analysis of potential correlates of this upward migration suggests that it was driven by increased tidal inundation. Mean sea level did not increase during our study, but inundation at high elevations did. While the ecotone boundary responded dynamically to interannual changes in inundation at these undiked sites, the plant community structure of the ecotone remained stable. At two diked sites, we observed contrasting patterns. At one site, the ecotone boundary migrated seaward, while at the other, it showed no consistent trend. Diking appears to eliminate natural sensitivity of the ecotone boundary to interannual variation in oceanic and atmospheric drivers, with local factors (management of water control structures) outweighing regional ones. Our study shows that the marsh-upland ecotone migrated rapidly in response to environmental change while maintaining stable plant community structure. Such resilience, stability, and rapid response time suggest that the marsh-upland ecotone can serve as a sensitive indicator of climate change.

AB  - Eutrophication remains one of the foremost impacts of industrialization and population expansion on aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Selecting metrics for assessing the manner in which communities and biogeochemical processes respond to nutrient fertilization is an ongoing management challenge critical both for detecting changes and for monitoring recovery of impaired environments. A key limitation to the selection of response variables is the lack of consistent evaluation of metrics under the same conditions in multiple systems across ecoregions. Here we report the results of nutrient-diffusing agar fertilization experiments conducted simultaneously in 30 streams in two distinct ecoregions of California, USA: the mountainous Sierra Nevada and the coastal chaparral of Santa Barbara county. In each experiment we evaluated algal community shifts across five nutrient delivery rates using multiple response variables at the ecosystem process (respiration and primary production), community (biomass and diversity metrics), functional group (nitrogen fixing, growth form, nutrient adaptation), and taxonomic group (indicator species, genera, families) levels of ecological organization. We used mixed-effect general linear models to quantify the magnitude, sensitivity, and consistency of responses among streams within and across ecoregions to provide an objective assessment of the potential for each variable to describe and detect significant changes in algal community characteristics. Our results indicate that ecosystem-and community-level variables showed significant and consistent nutrient responses among diverse streams and across the two ecoregions, while indicator taxa and functional groups were less likely to respond consistently to nutrient enrichment. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the ongoing development of monitoring and bioassessment strategies for aquatic eutrophication.

AB  - It is widely accepted that Indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) is potentially valuable for maintaining biodiversity within linked social-ecological systems, and cultural landscapes in particular. However, IEK is declining globally, along with biodiversity. Adaptive co-management frameworks incorporating both Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems have the capacity for greater success than frameworks embedded within a singular world view. A major challenge exists, however, in identifying pathways for the integration of these knowledge systems. The need to integrate both IEK and science into management is widely recognised; various approaches have been trialled but there are few successful examples. Cooperative research using joint learning is emerging as one potentially useful approach. Here we present an example of applying co-research in a cultural landscape in Australia, the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, where we aimed to develop linked cultural and biophysical indicators of ecosystem condition. Our approach was founded on five stakeholder-defined core principles for research. The study revealed seven determinants of successful implementation within these principles: strong Indigenous governance; problem-framing and conceptualisation; relationship building; data collection and management; considerations of scale; agreed dissemination of results; and evaluation. We identify cooperative problem-framing as one of the most important determinants, and argue that by starting the co-research process with this task, co-research can assist the equitable convergence of IEK and contemporary natural resource management, thereby potentially enhancing social-ecological system resilience and sustainability.

AB  - According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) the development of bioindicators is extremely necessary to achieve the conservation targets by 2010, and insects are considered an effective group for this goal. Drosophilids are regarded as potential indicators, although this idea remains untested. Therefore, we followed up a protocol to test the drosophilid potential indicator for human disturbance in the Brazilian Savanna, one of the richest and most threatened tropical biomes in the world. Sampling was undertaken in one urban environment and two biological reserves, representing four habitat types (undisturbed gallery forest, disturbed gallery forest, undisturbed savanna, and urban environment). We examined differences in the drosophilid assemblages among habitat types and used the Indicator Value (IndVal) method to point out the indicator species. We also tested the two-stage indicator validation, a protocol recently proposed in the literature, to validate the indicator species for undisturbed gallery forest and savannas, in independent samples. The assemblage variables varied mainly in undisturbed gallery forests, and reflected changes from an undisturbed to a disturbed stage. The IndVal associated with the two-stage protocol showed reliable characteristic species, which are very helpful for diagnostic surveys. Likewise, species that can detect changes in the habitats were also found. We found a set of indicators, which together may be very efficient for both assessing and reflecting a variety of conditions, improving the confidence of the bioindication system, expanding the taxonomic options for bioindicators, and therefore, contributing to the conservation of this region.

AB  - Besides natural tree regeneration itself, the development of the forest understory community is highly indicative of the ecological recovery of forest stands post-harvesting, and therefore of the sustainability of forest management. High mountain forests might show particularly slow recovery of the understory plant community because of harsh environmental conditions. We compared understory community richness and composition among three age classes of forest stands in the subalpine Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. Species composition was found to differ significantly between mature stands (> 110 years old and never harvested) and both recent clearcuts (5-8 years old) and the oldest clearcuts present in the study area (second growth: 24-28 years old). A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination revealed no unidirectional return of species composition in harvested stands towards that of mature forest; indeed, plots in recent clearcuts and second growth stands were similar to one another and clearly separated from the mature stands. Indicator Species Analysis revealed that moss species were particularly indicative of mature forest, with four moss species being common in mature stands but absent from both younger stages. Compared to what has been reported for lower elevation coniferous forests, e.g. in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, redevelopment of the understory appears to be slow after harvesting in these high elevation mountain forests. Rotation intervals that consider the natural temporal pattern of species turnover and the occurrence interval of major natural disturbances (here: fire) should provide effective approaches to sustainable forest management of these forests.

AB  - Cold acclimatization is a complex process that involves extensive modification of plant metabolism. Woody plants of temperate latitudes undergo a kind of preparation for winter conditions in autumn; as a result they become more tolerant to negative temperatures. Plants reach the maximum frost hardiness in the middle of winter, while they lose the acclimatization hardiness by deacclimatization with the increase of temperature in spring. One of the indicators of plant adaptation to the new growth conditions is their ability to dynamically move into a state of dormancy and leave it under the certain changes of external conditions. The research purpose was to study winter dormancy depth in some woody species of the Fabaceae Lindl. family (Robinia pseudoacacia L., Amorpha fruticosa L., Caragana arborescens Lam.) in Nizhny Novgorod region. We used detection method of thermally-induced environmental changes to achieve this purpose. The experiment material was represented by annual shoots of the studied species harvested in the central part of Nizhny Novgorod region. The studies were being carried out from November to February for 5 years. After cutting, the shoots were transferred to laboratory conditions (t = 20 degrees C), where they were placed in the containers with water. The phenological state of shoots and temperature mode were daily recorded. The studies have shown that the interruption timeframe of dormancy significantly influence the transition of the studied introduced species to active metabolism. It was found that, when the steady negative air temperatures are established in winter, the studied objects form high frost hardiness. This is confirmed by the fact that with the artificial interruption of dormancy and warming acceleration from November to February the objects require a significant amount of active temperatures for transition to metabolism. Caragana arborescens Lam. leaves winter dormancy under growing degree-thy of 87 ...136 degrees C (depending on the calendar periods of dormancy interruption) that is equivalent to 5 ...7 days of being in warm conditions at an average ambient temperature from 24 to 25 degrees C. Amorpha fruticosa L. turns to active metabolism in growing degree-day of 255 ...378 degrees C; the same happens with Robinia pseudoacacia L. under 198 ...476 degrees C. The data obtained during the research update the fundamental principles of factorial ecology through the demonstration of woody species adaptations of the Fabaceae Lindl. family. They can be used for perspective preliminary assessment of their wide cultivation in Nizhny Novgorod region.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate whether there is a relationship between abiotic factors and the morphological diversity (MD) of Odonata larvae by building an ecomorphological index in oil palm plantation areas with riparian vegetation in the Eastern Amazon. We hypothesised that the MD of Odonata larvae might be affected by oil palm plantation since changes in the landscape might cause the loss of microhabitats that are essential for the larval life cycle. A total of 950 Odonata larvae were collected in 11 streams located in a continuous forest area (inside the legal reserve) and 18 streams located in oil palm streams surrounded by riparian vegetation. There was a significant difference in the MD of the larvae between the oil palm and forest areas. When we compared the results obtained using traditional measures of biodiversity (estimated species richness) with those obtained using the measure of MD, MD was more efficient. The RLQ tests showed a significant relationship between genus abundance and environmental variables, and between genera and morphological traits. We believe that the suppression or change in riparian vegetation might increase the sediment load input and decrease the amount of plant substrate available in the system, leading to the simplification of morphological traits. Therefore, such traits might be used as indicators of environmental impact.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of land cover changes and vegetation loss under conditions of change in climatic parameters (temperature and precipitation) and determining their impacts on different ecological functions in the eastern watershed of Lake Urmia and its four sub-watersheds in northwestern Iran. The method used has been a quantitative assessment of selected ecosystem functions using a self-parameterizing, physically based model called Water World Policy Support System as well as applying satellite images to detect land-use/cover changes. Modeling of important ecological and hydrological parameters including vegetation density, water balance, surface runoff, and soil erosion was performed and for each of them, the quantity of changes was calculated and mapped. Then, by standardizing the maps for each parameter and overlapping them, cumulative impact levels across the watershed were classified. The result showed that with decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature, the average vegetation density decreased by 32% in the watershed and from 79 to 47%. Decreased vegetation, followed by increased runoff by about 2.5% and equivalent to 19,656.95 cubic meters per year. Consequently, the average net soil erosion has been changed from - 0.012 to 0.20 mm per year per square meter. Hence, the average soil erosion in the watershed has increased by more than 3 tons per hectare. Based on the final results, more than 40% of the watershed area is under severe and very severe ecological impact.

AB  - River water and sediment embody environmental characteristics that give valuable information about the eco-environment Due to rapid unplanned urbanization and industrialization, the aquatic environment of any urban river can be seriously polluted by heavy metals. Four heavy metals (As, Cr, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed in surface sediments and water from the Kirtankhola River located in the coastal area of Bangladesh. The decreasing pattern of metals was observed as Cr> Pb > As > Cd in both water and sediment. The heavy metal ranges were 1.67-7.31, 12.64-45.69, 0.01-1.59, and 8.03-35.68 mu g/L in the water and 2.09-6.89, 14.76-47.08, 0.01-1.77 and 6.37-41.43 mg/kg in sediments for As, Cr, Cd, and Pb. The number of metals tested in water samples surpassed the acceptable limits of drinking water quality, indicating that water from this river is not safe for drinking and cooking and could pose a risk to the riverine ecosystem. The pollution load index (PLI) values were close to one, indicating that the sediment of the study river was low contamination. Contamination factor (CF) has reported that As, Cd, and Pb have been moderate to extremely polluted by sediment samples and metals level implied that the condition is much alarming and probably severely affecting the aquatic ecology of this riverine ecosystem.

AB  - The Margalla Hills falls in moist subtropical ecosystem with rich floristic diversity. Frequent field trips were conducted to record the floristic and ecological characteristics of vegetation. A total of 360 quadrats were laid down along 12 transects (8 on dry and 4 on the foothills' wet sites). Quadrat size was kept 10 x 10 m2, 5 x 5 m2 and 1x1 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs, respectively. Phytosociological attributes were determined for each plant species. Cluster, Two-way Cluster and Indicator Species Analyses of PCORD Version 5 were used to classify potential Landscape types and their respective indicators. Canonical Corresponding Analyses (CCA) and Detrented Corresponding Analyses (DCA) analyses were applied using CANOCO software to determine the significant effect of various environmental and edaphic variables on indicator species distribution patterns. Preliminary, a total of 187 plant species were recorded belong to 57 families. The topmost dominant families were Poaceae (27 species), followed by Leguminosae (17 species), Lamiaceae (11 species) and Moraceae (8 species). Therophytes (40%) followed by Phanerophytes (28%) were the region's dominant life forms. Microphylls leaf form was dominant (38%), followed by Mesophylls (30%). Six landscape types were identified after the Cluster Analysis with Sorenson distance measurements in the region. Environmental gradient analyses showed that the low potassium concentration, higher electrical conductivity, moderate organic matter, clay loam soil condition, anthropogenic activities, and grazing pressures significantly affect plant species distribution, composition, abundance, and different landscape type formation and their respective indicators.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphorus insecticide detected in aquatic environments considered harmful to living beings. The aim of this research was to evaluate the ecotoxicity of CPF for neotropical aquatic organisms of distinct trophic levels (Lemna minor, Azolla caroliniana, and Wolffia brasiliensis macrophytes; Pomacea canaliculata snail; Macrobrachium acanthurus shrimp; Xiphophorus maculatus and Hyphessobrycon eques fish), to verify the risk of environmental poisoning for each organism, and to determine the best bioindicator species of aquatic contamination by the insecticide. Ecotoxicological assays were carried out with different concentrations of CPF under controlled laboratory conditions standardized for each species. IC50;7d, LC50;7d, EC50;48h, and LC50;48h values were calculated using the Trimmed Spearman Karber software with 95% confidence limits. The toxicity data were used to classify the CPF according to the ecotoxicity categories for aquatic organisms. The risk of CPF environmental poisoning was determined by the quotient method considering different environmental scenarios. The sensitivity order of neotropical aquatic organisms to chlorpyrifos was Macrobrachium acanthurus (0.002 mg L-1) > Xiphophorus maculatus (0.07 mg L-1) > Hyphessobrycon eques (1.65 mg L-1) > Pomacea canaliculata (30.66 mg L-1) > Azolla caroliniana (849.72 mg L-1) > Wolffia brasiliensis (1271.63 mg L-1) = Lemna minor (1299.60 mg L-1). The risk of poisoning by chlorpyriphos may vary according to the environmental concentration of the insecticide and the exposed trophic level. The best bioindicator and with the greatest risk of environmental poisoning was shrimp. The difference in CPF ecotoxicity for distinct aquatic trophic levels shows the relevance of evaluating the effects of contaminants considering food chains and highlights the importance of studying these levels in environmental monitoring programs.

AB  - Scavengers can provide ecosystem services to people by removal of dead animals that could become sources of disease. From such point of view, it seems appropriate to evaluate these benefits in Azerbaijan in quantitative terms. To this end, in 2013, an extensive monitoring was organized in the Turyanchay Reserve, which covers six regions and neighboring territories (the total population here is 640 thousand people). A high level of animal mortality in the Turyanchay Reserve is supported by the concentration of 24 species of wild mammals and 700 thousand domestic animals in the surrounding environment. The difficult terrain area is another factor leading to the death of animals. Animals grazing on hillsides often break down and die. The bodies of domestic and wild animals killed by wolves also often remain lying on this territory. In addition, vehicles traveling along the Agdash-Gabala highway cause the death of many domestic and wild animals. During the two months of the study (from June to July), 62 dead animals were found. Ten kinds of diseases were identified in 38 undecomposed bodies of these animals. Scavengers eat animal bodies in one-three days (without bones), preventing them from becoming a source of infection. The role of necrophages in minimizing of epizootic cases and improving sanitary conditions is important for ecosystems, because the blood of most animals is a carrier of diseases and most of the parasites present in it are common to both humans and animals. Scavengers can be used by veterinary organizations as indicators to simplify the identification of animal bodies and the subsequent disposal of their remains.

AB  - Coastal dune ecosystems are increasingly threatened by the mass tourism phenomenon. Intense concentration of human activities and mass tourism are leading to coastal dune loss and fragmentation. Besides the loss and fragmentation of coastal dunes, mass tourism has considerably affected remnant natural areas. To prevent degradation of remnant natural areas, it is mandatory to understand whether, and under what conditions, tourism can be allowed. In the present study I addressed the problem by evaluating the impact of tourism on the structure and resilience of pollination networks in coastal dune ecosystems freely accessible to tourists. Pollination networks represent ecological community structure and depict interactions among species, providing the opportunity for a holistic assessment of ecosystem structure and functioning.
   I conducted the study on coastal dune sites of the North Adriatic coast, with different levels of touristic pressure. I recorded pollination interactions together with descriptors of human disturbance along sea-inland transects. A moderate level of human disturbance was positively related to the richness of animal-pollinated plant and pollinator species. Besides species richness, the resilience of pollination networks was also highest at moderate disturbance. By assessing the impact of human disturbance on coastal dune ecosystems from the perspective of pollination interactions, evidence arises that moderate disturbance and long-term conservation of pollination networks of coastal dunes can co-exist. However, to achieve this goal, tourism should be regulated, and visitor access to coastal sites managed, so as to prevent intense human disturbance from compromising both the structure and function of coastal dune ecosystems.

AB  - Compact urbanization is the main strategy for sustainable urban development. However, it is yet unclear whether compact urban forms are ecologically more favourable than dispersed ones. In this paper, we studied the effects of urban sprawl on the riparian vegetation condition in one of the most degraded watersheds in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina. We conducted random sampling of the riparian vegetation at sites along streams in the basin and assessed urban indicators at the reach and sub-watershed scales for each of those sites in a geographic information system: urban area, impervious surface, population density and two landscape metrics of dispersion. The indicators assessed explained a high proportion of the variability of the vegetation response variables, thereby confirming the importance of urban sprawl pressure in shaping riparian communities in fluvial ecosystems. Dispersed urbanization had more positive than negative effects on the vegetation in the study area. Riverbanks associated with dispersed urbanization had more plant species, including exotics, when urban sprawl was assessed at the local scale. At the sub-watershed scale, dispersed urbanized areas were richer in native plants and most of the functional groups, and poorer in exotic species. The model of the compact city, including bio-corridors along watercourses, has been proposed for the Buenos Aires conurbation process for the next decades. Our results showed that the quality of existing river corridors across the compact matrix was not desirable and best practices for redesigning a more sustainable landscape structure are necessary, including the restoration of habitats for wetland species.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether native and invasive plants harbor different bacterial communities in their rhizospheres and whether there are bacterial indicator species associated with the invasive rhizosphere. Additionally, physico-chemical, biochemical, and biological properties have been determined in the native and invasive rhizospheres in order to ascertain the relationships between these soil properties and the rhizosphere bacterial communities. We carried out a study in five independent locationts under Mediterranean semiarid conditions, where the native Hyparrhenia hirta is being displaced by Perinisetum setaceum. Partial 16S rRNA genes of the rhizosphere bacterial communities were amplified and 454-pyrosequenced. Principal coordinate analysis revealed differences in the composition and structure of the rhizosphere bacterial communities between native and invasive plants, the values of the richness index being higher in the invasive microbial community. RhiZosphere microbial community structure was also influenced by invaded location. The indicator species analysis showed a higher number of indicators for the invasive community at all the taxonomic levels studied, the genus Ohtaekwangia being the most abundant indicator. As shown by canonical correspondence analysis, the protease and dehydrogenase activities and soil respiration were related to the rhizosphere bacterial community of invasive plant. However, only protease activity was significantly affected by the plant type, being higher in the invasive plant rhizosphere. Our results show that P. setaceum invasion has produced an intense interaction with the soil bacterial community, shifting its structure, composition, and protease activity related to N cycling, which may be altering the function of the invaded ecosystem.

AB  - Environmental degradation and poverty are linked, and must be tackled together. Doing so requires a win-win strategy that both restores the environment and ensures a sustainable livelihood for those who are affected by the restoration project. To understand the importance of combining ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation objectives with a consideration of the livelihoods of residents, we examined a successful project in ecologically fragile Changting County, Fujian Province, China. We attribute the project's success to the development of a win-in strategy that sustainably improved resident livelihoods, in contrast with traditional strategies that focus exclusively on establishing forests and grassland. To develop this win-win strategy, we performed long-term monitoring (since 1984) under a program designed to permit ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation in the county. For our analysis, we chose a range of natural and socioeconomic indicators that could affect the ecological restoration; we then used a contribution model to identify the relative influence of each social, economic, or environmental factor on the dependent variables (vegetation cover, soil erosion, number of plant species). The results showed that by improving livelihoods and mitigating poverty in the long term, the project also reduced damage to the environment by local residents. Our calculations suggest that accounting for socioeconomic factors played a key role in the successful ecological conservation. This win-win path to escaping the poverty trap during ecological restoration provides an example that can be followed by restoration projects elsewhere in the world with suitable modifications to account for unique local conditions.

AB  - The oligochaetes are considered good indicators of ecological conditions and specific types of habitats. Among the factors that influence the distribution of these invertebrates are the water flow and the nature of the substrate. The aim of this study is to describe the composition and distribution of oligochaete species in a first-order stream in Atlantic Forest and try to identify if some species are associated with characteristics of particular types of habitats. In the dry season and in the rainy season, sand and litter samples in two riffle areas and two pool areas were collected in different parts along the stream using a hand net. The greatest observed richness and abundance occurred in sand in the pool, however the greatest estimated richness was obtained for litter in the pool. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis showed effect of the different types of habitat on the abundance and richness of oligochaetes. The Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and Multiresponse Permutation Procedure analysis (MRPP) indicated that the variation in the fauna composition had relation with different types of substrates. The indicator species analysis showed that Limnodrilus. hoffmeisteri was an indicator species in both the riffle sand and pool sand and Pristina americana was only an indicator in the pool sand. The high organic matter content in both sandy habitats probably favored the greater abundance of oligochaetes. The results showed that the substrate constitutes an important factor for the local distribution of these invertebrates in streams. The variation of the community structure among mesohabitats and the presence of indicator species of specific types of habitats in the stream demonstrate the importance of environmental heterogeneity for the oligochaetes fauna in forested streams.

AB  - Biomarkers in geological samples on Earth are products derived from biochemical precursors (i.e., natural products) by reductive and oxidative alteration processes (e.g., cholestanes from cholesterol). Generally, lipids, pigments, and some biomembranes are preserved best over longer geological times, and labile compounds such as amino acids, sugars, etc. are useful biomarkers for recent times. Thus, the detailed characterization of biomarker composition permits the assessment of the major contributing species of extinct and/or extant life. Nonbiomarkers and abiogenic organic compounds are also discussed. In the case of the early Earth, work has progressed to elucidate biomarker structures and carbon isotopic signals preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks. In addition, the combination of bacterial biochemistry with the organic geochemistry of contemporary and ancient hydrothermal ecosystems permits the modeling of the nature, behavior, and preservation potential of primitive microbial communities. This approach entails combined molecular and isotopic analyses to characterize lipids and biopolymers produced by cultured bacteria (representative of ancient strains) and to test a variety of culture conditions that affect their biosynthesis processes. In regards to Mars, the biomarkers. from lipids and biopolymers would be expected to be preserved best if life flourished there during its early history (3.5-4 x 10(9) years ago). Both oxidized and reduced products would be expected. This is based on the inference that hydrothermal activity occurred during that time, with the concomitant preservation of biochemically-derived carbonaceous matter. Known biomarkers (i.e., as elucidated for early terrestrial samples and for primitive terrestrial microbiota) as we'll as novel, potentially unknown compounds, should be characterized.

AB  - Salinity is an increasing environmental problem in agricultural ecosystems and is not adequately represented in conventional life cycle assessment (LCA) impact categories. It is often not the total quantity of salts emitted or the proportion of salt accumulated in the soil profile that is the primary mechanism for deteriorating soil conditions for irrigated salinity, rather the ratio of major cations in the soil matrix and the potential for colloid, dispersion and reduced permeability. A soil salinisation potential (SP) is proposed as an indicator for irrigated salinity and potential soil degradation from poor irrigation practices. The indicator uses the threshold electrolyte concentration concept that predicts the adjusted sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)/ Electrical conductivity (EC) ratio that soil will no longer flocculate, but potentially disperse. The SAR is converted to a threshold EC and compared to the measured EC in order to develop a site-specific irrigation equivalence factor (EF). This site/region/process specific EF is then used to weight the sodium load to soil and repeated for each stage throughout the entire life cycle to determine the overall Salinisation Potential (SP). The data required for calculating the SP is generally readily available either on site or from the water chemistry of the local watercourses. Preliminary calculations simply require the volume, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), alkalinity and the concentrations of Na, Ca, and Mg of the irrigation water. The site/process/region specific nature of the indicator ensures a quantitative measure to enable comparisons between different systems and is useful for identifying stages in the life cycle of a product (particularly food products), where the potential for soil salinisation and soil degradation is most severe.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the transformation of the methodology for substantiating the development of energy from centralized state planning to a new paradigm for multilateral decision-making and the creation of mechanisms for their implementation in terms of multi-criteria, multiplicity of conflicting interests, uncertainty of initial information and conditions for further development. New conditions for substantiating the decisions are considered in the context of the construction of thermal power plants in remote areas of new development, where local energy resources are considered as fuel. The choice of fuel determines the economic and technical indicators of power plants, their environmental and social impacts. In order to justify the choice of fuel for thermal power plants from the point of view of numerous criteria in the conditions of uncertainty of initial information and future development conditions, it is necessary to create new methodological approaches.
   The main aim of the research is to propose a methodology of multi-criteria fuel selection for a thermal power plant in the areas of new development taking into account the uncertainty factor.
   Objects: organic fuel deposits in remote areas of new development.
   Methods: multiplicative method of the analytic hierarchy process, method of multi-criteria utility theory, methods of interval analysis, methods of fuzzy set theory.
   Results. The author has carried out the review of modern methodological approaches in the problems of substantiation of the choice of fuel for power plants and proposed the modification of the method of the analytic hierarchy process. It allows taking into account the uncertainty of the source information and the ambiguity of preferences of decision makers, as well as significantly reducing the number of requests for information. On the basis of the modified method, the author developed the technique of multi-criteria selection of fuel for thermal power plants in the areas of new development. Its application is considered on the problem of coal selection in three points of perspective siting of thermal power plant in Omsukchansky and Severo-Evensky districts of Magadan region. The criteria used to compare the alternatives are: fuel cost, pollutant emissions from fuel combustion, fuel reserves, development and production conditions, the impact of fuel combustion emissions on the health of the population, employment of the local population.

AB  - Lake Kuetsjarvi (in the lower reaches of the Pasvik River, Murmansk Region, Russia) in the border area between Russia and Norway, is one of the most polluted water reservoirs in the European Arctic. The operation of the Pechenganikel Smelter located on its shores has led to the extremely high concentrations of heavy metals observed in the waters and sediments of the lake. Long-term comprehensive studies of the ecosystem of Lake Kuetsjarvi have made it possible to identify the response of its components to the global and regional change in the environment and climate as a whole, resulting in increased water toxicity and eutrophication, reduction in the number of stenobiont species of aquatic organisms against the background of an increase in the number of eurybiontic and invasive species. Modern communities of Lake Kuetsjarvi are the result of a combination of long-term changes in the abiotic environment and biotic interactions. Heavy-metal pollution of Lake Kuetsjarvi, observed since the 1930s, has led to the formation of a community that is resistant to this type of impact and supports large populations of adapted species. Adaptations of communities to the dynamics of the environmental conditions that their members are exposed to include changes in the species composition, quantitative indicators, ratios between individual taxonomic groups, and the population structure. The development of sympatric forms that differ in the ecological niches they occupy, morphology, and life cycle strategies, including the transition to a short-cycle survival strategy, allows whitefish to remain the dominant species and maintain high population numbers. Unlike the organismal level, responses to medium-term environmental changes on the population and community level are less specific and characterized by stronger inertia.

AB  - Fish species richness (FSR) has been widely used as an indicator of both ecological variation and fish biodiversity. On global and local scales, FSR has been declining due to human impact. Species distribution models, such as conventional regression techniques and machine learning methods, have played a critical role in predicting the distribution of FSR in estuarine systems. The Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is the largest estuarine ecosystem in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a muddy estuary providing many important ecosystem functioning services acting as spawning, feeding, and nursing grounds for a variety of valuable commercial species such as Coilia ectenes and Muraenesox cinereus. Despite this, the spatial distribution of FSR in the YRE has not been estimated. In this study, four modelling approaches (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, regression tree, and boosted regression tree) are applied to predict FSR in the YRE. Model performance was compared by evaluating the fit and predictive performance via deviation explained, root mean squared error, and cross-validation. Finally, the spatial distribution of FSR was estimated by the optimal model. It was shown that a regression tree approach outperformed the other methods. Additionally, regression tree modelling captured the overall distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE. The factors that appear to be contributing to the distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE included environmental conditions, fish migrations, and local physical characteristics (e.g. runoff and tide). The results from this study could provide guidance for the conservation planning and spatial management of the YRE. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article considers international trends and directions of inclusive growth which is considered as an inclusive economic growth and is measured by heterogeneous growth indicators, as an index of inclusive development. Considering the above, was analysed the existing state of the country's growth considering the environmental, economic, social and technological components as prerequisites for inclusive environmental management. Thus, the main focus of this article is on the formation of prerequisites for inclusive nature management in socio-economic and environmental practices and their subsequent methodological support. So segments of population prosperity means not just material consumption, but social vision formation and the institutional support creation for enables everyone to participate in the socio-economic achievements. The main gaps in the institutional support of the inclusive environmental management process are disclosed: in the social sphere: limited access to economically viable means that meet the real needs of the population in terms of health care, social assistance, basic education and awareness; in the ecological and economic sphere there is no effective and efficient management of providing the population with products that comply with the requirements of eco-certification and eco-labelling, which negatively affects the replenishment of the state budget and the promotion of the rational use of natural resources. Therefore, in order to create a favourable climate and institutional support of inclusive environmental management, in this article, will conduct a thorough analysis of the status of its components and assess the compliance of the existing conditions with current international requirements for inclusiveness. Inclusive growth requires environmental inclusion, which can be achieved through the introduction of new metrics and resource value indicators in regional development projects and programs. In doing so, measures should be developed and recommendations made to improve further planning and control.

AB  - Soil biota are responsible for essential ecosystem services such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling and water retention. However, assessment of the condition of soil biota is hampered by an overwhelming level of diversity. With representatives in all trophic levels of the food web, nematode communities can be used as bioindicators. Accurate assessment of nematode assemblages requires insight into the distribution of specimens with distinct food preferences. With the availability of taxon-specific quantitative PCR assays, distribution patterns of multiple nematode groups can be investigated simultaneously. Here, microscale patchiness of 45 nematode taxa was studied on 12 sampling sites (each with four adjacent microplots) located on arable fields or semi-natural grasslands (system'), and on marine, river clay or sandy soils (soil type'). From each microplot, five composite samples were collected. Contrary to our expectations, an increase in the number of cores per composite sample did not result in more accurate measurements, and apparently the levels of microscale patchiness of the taxa are low compared to what has been reported for oligophagous plant-parasites. System and soil type did not affect microscale distribution. To investigate the level of patchiness in more detail, detection probability (DP) and variability of abundances were calculated. Common and widespread bacterivorous and fungivorous taxa had DP90%, confirming low level of microscale patchiness. With DPs of 40%-70%, predators and most omnivores showed degrees of local clustering. An overview of mean variabilities of abundances is presented that offers insight into how feeding preferences impact the microscale distribution both between and within trophic groups.

AB  - Scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) have been used to investigate the effects of environmental disturbances on forest structure and diversity. This group is recognized as sensitive to habitat perturbations and ecosystem changes. Here we examine the effects of anthropogenic impacts on Scarabaeidae composition, testing the following hypotheses: (1) Scarab beetle communities react to land use disturbances with predictable trends, (2) disturbed habitats are able to retain only a part of the Scarab beetle community of native forests or late secondary forests; (3) habitats largely differ in terms of species richness, taxonomic diversity and ecological composition, supporting exclusive and indicator species. We selected areas of native forest, agriculture, pasture for extensive livestock and secondary forests in different stages of regeneration. Our results show that the Scarabaeidae species were not indifferent to the gradient of structural changes represented by the studied areas. In fact, their patterns of habitat preference reveals communities more abundant and diverse in pristine habitats. In contrast, disturbed habitats, dominated by agricultural activities and pasture, indicated clear detrimental effects on the abundance of all forest Scarab beetle specialists. On the other hand, the generalist species, mainly associated with open environments, seemed to be favoured by the prevailing conditions induced by agricultural activities. Overall, the composition of the Scarab beetle communities is variable and sensitive to those structural gradients and, therefore, capable of responding as useful ecological indicators for assessing the extent of land use change or degradation.

AB  - 1. Dietary studies give vital insights into foraging behaviour, with implications for understanding changing environmental conditions and the anthropogenic impacts on natural resources. Traditional diet sampling methods may be invasive or subject to biases, so developing non-invasive and unbiased methods applicable to a diversity of species is essential. We used digital photography to investigate the diet fed to chicks of a prey-carrying seabird and compared our approach (photo-sampling) to a traditional method (regurgitations) for the greater crested tern Thalasseus bergii. Over three breeding seasons, we identified >24000 prey items of at least 48 different species, more than doubling the known diversity of prey taken by this population of terns. We present a method to estimate the length of the main prey species (anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) from photographs, with an accuracy <1mm and precision similar to 05mm. Compared to regurgitations at two colonies, photo-sampling produced similar estimates of prey composition and size, at a faster species accumulation rate. The prey compositions collected by two researchers photo-sampling concurrently were also similar. Photo-sampling offers a non-invasive tool to accurately and efficiently investigate the diet composition and prey size of prey-carrying birds. It reduces biases associated with observer-based studies and is simple to use. This methodology provides a novel tool to aid conservation and management decision-making in the light of the growing need to assess environmental and anthropogenic change in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Bosmina longirostris is a small-bodied, filter-feeding cladoceran. The species is widely distributed throughout the world in temperate and tropical climates, where it persists in all kinds of freshwater bodies regardless of their trophy, acidification, or salinity. Its wide distribution causes B. longirostris to be one of the most taxonomically recognizable Cladocera species all over the world, despite the fact that the species is a well-known example of a taxon with confused taxonomy. Although B. longirostris often displays high abundances in the world's freshwaters and sporadic studies on its feeding suggest that the species can have an important role in energy transfer throughout the food web, B. longirostris is still perceived by scientists as having a minor role in the classical food web structure. This perception of B. longirostris as a food web component could be altered in the near future due to global climatic changes, including increases in temperature which may cause cyanobacterial blooms that may be more harmful to Daphnia than B. longirostris. The response of B. longirostris to environmental, competitive, and predatory conditions has been repeatedly studied to search for application of that species as indicator in ecological, neolimnological, and paleolimnological research. Regardless of its common use as test species in ecological and limnological studies, B. longirostris still lacks appropriate study by researchers because of its problematic systematics. Research directed at this species seems to be hampered by the absence of an accurate taxonomical revision of B. longirostris or group of cryptic species called B. longirostris.

AB  - In spite of their moderate altitude (1000-1600 m a.s.l.), the Western Sudety Mountains belong to areas with the most efficient fog precipitation in Europe. Intense industrial activity in the area of windward western foothills caused an exceptional intensification of atmospheric pollutant deposition via precipitation and fog to take place since the 1950s. In the second half of the 1970s a massive spruce forest dieback began affecting around 42% of coniferous forest in the Polish part of the Sudety Mountains. As the result of emission abatement in the region, gradual improvement of forest health status has been observed in the last decade. In October 2010 there were 70 dendrochronological samples collected from Norway spruce (Picea abies) stems at 7 different locations using an increment borer. It was documented for six sites that lowest annual growth rates took place between the early eighties and the early nineties which coincides with the highest pollutant deposition rates. Only one site representing the lowest parts of leeward slope showed gradual decrease of tree rings as a result of increasing tree age rather than due to an increase in ecological stress conditions. Tree ring widths were then compared with spatial distribution of fog frequency in the Western Sudety Mountains. The achieved results document a strongly negative dependence of tree ring widths on fog deposition rates. Spruce forest ecosystems have an ability to respond quickly to both negative and positive stimuli, related to increasing and decreasing environmental contamination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Most of Inner Mongolia is covered with natural grassland and is highly sensitive to global climate change because of the physical geography, the highly variable climate, and the complicated socioeconomic conditions. The climate is generally wetter in the east becoming drier towards the west of the region. Using a Pressure-State-Response model to select climate-related assessment indicators, a vulnerability assessment to climate change framework of counties in Inner Mongolia was built, which included three layers and 17 indicators. Climate change vulnerability of eight counties in the steppe area of Inner Mongolia was assessed from 1980 to 2009. The results showed that in the past 30 years, climate change vulnerability of eight counties has decreased with the decrease more pronounced after 2000. The lowest value for vulnerability was in 2008. The vulnerability of the western region was higher than that of the eastern region. Counties with a desert ecological system had a higher vulnerability than counties with steppe. Under the background of exposure increasing and sensitivity slightly decreasing, a continuing significant improvement in adaptive capacity is the key reason for a reduction invulnerability of the Inner Mongolia steppe area to climate change. The volatility of the climate on an inter-annual scale can cause changes in vulnerability between years. With the development of the rural economy and increases in national investment in the environment, the vulnerability of the Inner Mongolian steppe has been significantly reduced, but, overall, the vulnerability remains high. Most of the counties are moderately vulnerable, some counties are seriously vulnerable, even extremely vulnerable, and strong measures need to be adopted to strengthen the ability to adapt to climate change.

AB  - Lakes are major repositories of biodiversity, provide multiple ecosystem services and are widely recognised as key indicators of environmental change. However, studies of lake response to drivers of change at a pan-European scale are exceptionally rare. The need for such studies has been given renewed impetus by concerns over environmental change and because of international policies, such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), which impose legal obligations to monitor the condition of European lakes towards sustainable systems with good ecological status. This has highlighted the need for methods that can be widely applied across large spatial and temporal scales and produce comparable results. Remote sensing promises much in terms of information provision, but the spatial transferability and temporal repeatability of methods and relationships observed at individual or regional case studies remains unproven at the continental scale. This study demonstrates that NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal data are capable of producing highly accurate (R-2>0.9) lake surface temperature (LST) estimates in lakes with variable hydromorphological characteristics and contrasting thermal regimes. Validation of the approach using archived AVHRR thermal data for Lake Geneva produced observations that were consistent with field data for equivalent time periods. This approach provides the basis for generalizing temporal and spatial trends in European lake surface temperature over several decades and confirms the potential of the full 30 year NOAA AVHRR archive to can provide AVHRR-derived LST estimates to help inform European policies on lake water quality.

AB  - Marine systems are under pressure from both climate change and exploitation. While many of these ecosystems are inherently variable and hard to monitor, seabirds can be used as ecological indicators that provide early warning signals of deeper environmental change. The Agulhas-Benguela marine ecosystem around southern Africa has exhibited long-term changes in sea surface temperature, and the distribution of pelagic fish in this system has shifted. The Cape gannet Morus capensis is a seabird endemic as a breeding species to the Agulhas-Benguela ecosystem. Cape gannets breed at just 6 locations and are listed by the IUCN as Vulnerable. Knowledge of the survival and movements of a species is important for understanding of factors influencing its conservation. A random effects multistate capture-recapture model was used to estimate the annual survival probabilities and movement between colonies for adult birds at the 3 South African colonies of the species. The effects on survival of environmental and fisheries-related covariates were explored. Survival over the 20 yr period did not exhibit any long-term trend at the 2 southern colonies (Malgas and Bird Islands) but decreased at Lambert's Bay between 1996 and 2007. At all 3 colonies, adult birds showed a high degree of site fidelity. It may be that for Cape gannets, the primary effects of climate and fishing are on recruitment rather than on survival. The continued use of sub-optimal conditions by the west coast colonies has been referred to as an 'ecological trap' and necessitates the introduction of spatial considerations into fisheries management.

AB  - Temporary ponds are seasonal wetland habitats subjected to extreme and unstable ecological conditions. Some are classified as priority habitats for conservation by the European Union Habitats Directive. Our study area was the coastal plain of southwest Portugal, which spans across 100 km north to south and hosts a large number of temporary ponds as a consequence of climatic and edaphic characteristics. Field sampling of floristic and edaphic data was carried out in 24 temporary ponds every spring between 2005 and 2008. We recorded a total of 174 plant species identified within visually homogeneous plots. We included the data in a geographic information system and classified ponds according to their floristic composition, using a biotic regionalization analysis based on species presence/absence, which is a practical and unambiguous criterion. We found three significantly different groups of ponds which corresponded to an eco-physiognomic pond typology: Mediterranean temporary ponds, marshlands, and disturbed ponds. For the first two pond types we defined characteristic or indicator plant species. We searched also for relationships between pond type and a series of large-scale climatic, geographic, and geological variables, as well as local-scale physical and chemical properties of the soil. Pond type was distinguished by a complex combination of some of these variables, including environmental energy, soil texture, nitrogen content of the soil and pH. A practical way of discriminating between different types of ponds is important so that management and conservation measures can be defined accordingly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the relationships between channelization, environmental characteristics, and plant communities in 4 streams (Betz, Clery, Lunain, and Ecole Rivers) southeast of Paris, France, with the goal of assessing stream health. Seventeen 100-m-long reaches, each divided into a pool/riffle sequence, were monitored in 2006. Each reach had 0 to 3 channelization structures (i.e., embanking, resectioning, and other man-made structures). Redundancy analysis and mean-comparison tests done at 2 spatial scales (reach scale and pool/riffle sequence scale) indicated that channelization significantly affected flow velocity, depth, substrate type, and number of pools/riffles (4 of 24 variables considered). Physical characteristics of the streams were significantly more affected by channelization than were chemical characteristics. Moreover, different channelization structures affected the streams differently. Resectioning and embanking reduced flow velocity and the number of riffles and increased the number of pools. However, man-made structures either accelerated (downstream) or reduced flow velocity (upstream). Channelization strongly affected floristic richness on the basis of biological type (vascular plants, bryophytes, macroalgae) and ecomorphological type (hydrophytes, helophytes) at the pool/riffle sequence scale. Channelization led to taxonomic shifts and loss of biodiversity. Vascular plant taxa such as Helosciadium nodiflorum and Berula erecta were replaced by opportunist taxa such as Potamogeton crispus in channelized reaches. Combinations of channelization structures affected the stream plant assemblages less than did individual structures, a result that suggested compensatory effects. Our study supports the idea that channelization must be accompanied by measures that preserve the initial physical conditions of streams and the natural plant community composition.

AB  - Chemical and biological data from more than 5,000 lakes in 20 European countries have been compiled into databases within the EU project REBECCA. The project's purpose was to provide scientific support for implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). The databases contain the biological elements phytoplankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish, together with relevant chemistry data and station information. The common database strategy has enabled project partners to perform analyses of chemical-biological relationships and to describe reference conditions for large geographic regions in Europe. This strategy has obvious benefits compared with single-country analyses: results will be more representative for larger European regions, and the statistical power and precision will be larger. The high number of samples within some regions has also enabled analysis of type-specific relationships for several lake types. These results are essential for the intercalibration of ecological assessment systems for lakes, as required by the WFD. However, the common database approach has also involved costs and limitations. The data process has been resource-demanding, and the requirements for a flexible database structure have made it less user-friendly for project partners. Moreover, there are considerable heterogeneities among datasets from different countries regarding sampling methods and taxonomic precision; this may reduce comparability of the data and increase the uncertainty of the results. This article gives an overview of the contents and functions of the REBECCA Lakes databases, and of our experiences from constructing and using the databases. We conclude with recommendations for compilation of environmental data for future international projects.

AB  - Disturbance by military maneuvers over short and long time scales may have differential effects on grassland communities. We assessed small mammals as indicators of disturbance by military maneuvers in a mixed prairie in southern Oklahoma USA. We examined sites on two soil series, Foard and Lawton, across a gradient of disturbance intensity. A MANOVA showed that abundance of small mammals was associated (p=0.03) with short-term (cover of vehicle tracks) disturbance but was not associated (p=0.12) with long-term (loss of soil organic carbon, SOC) disturbance intensity. At the individual species level, Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rat) and Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) occurred across all levels of disturbance and in both soil types. Only P. maniculatus abundance changed (p < 0.01) with short-term disturbance and increased by about one individual per 5% of additional track-cover. Abundance of P. maniculatus also increased (p=0.04) by about three individuals per 1% increase in soil carbon. Chaetodipus hispidus (hispid pocket mouse) and Reithrodontomys fulvescens (fulvous harvest mouse) only occurred in single soil types limiting their potential as more general indicators. Abundance of P. maniculatus was positively related to shifts in plant species composition and likely reflected changes in vegetation structure (i.e. litter depth) and forage availability resulting from disturbance. Peromyscus maniculatus may be a useful biological indicator of ecosystem change because it responded predictably to both long-term and short-term disturbance and, when coupled with soil, plant, and disturbance history variables, can reveal land condition trends.

AB  - The era of ecosystem management for federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest began in 1994 with the adoption of the Northwest Forest Plan. This plan was designed to maintain and restore species and ecosystems associated with late successional and old-growth forests on over 10 million ha of federal lands in Washington, Oregon and California. The plan called for implementation monitoring, effectiveness monitoring, and validation monitoring for a variety of ecological and socio-economic components. Monitoring has become a central part of management of the federal forests in the region and managers and scientists have gained considerable experience in implementing this large and complex program. The components of the monitoring plan include late-successional/old growth vegetation, northern spotted owls, marbled murrelets, aquatic habitat and social conditions. The monitoring plan is strongly based on vegetation layer created with TM satellite imagery and on a regional grid of forest inventory plots. The lessons learned from the implementation of this monitoring plan include: 1) agencies need to devote considerable resources to insure that effective monitoring will occur at broad scales; 2) aggregation of local monitoring efforts is not a substitute for a designed regional monitoring plan; 3) vegetation structure and composition, measured with satellite imagery and inventory plots, is a cost-effective, broad-scale indicator of biological diversity; 4) some species, such as threatened and endangered species, are not necessarily covered with habitat approaches and may require population monitoring; 5) our scientific understanding of monitoring components will vary widely as will the approaches to data collection and analysis; 6) monitoring requires research support to develop and test metrics and biodiversity models; 7) links of monitoring to decision-making (adaptive management) are still being forged.

AB  - 1. Aquatic macrophyte composition and abundance is required by the European Union's Water Framework Directive for determining ecological status. Five metrics were produced that can be combined to determine the deviation of aquatic macrophytes from reference conditions in Northern Ireland's rivers.
   2. Species optima and niche breadths along silt, nitrate, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen gradients were generated from aquatic macrophyte and water quality surveys conducted at 273 sites throughout Northern Ireland using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Five metric scores based on these environmental gradients were determined at new monitoring sites using the mean optima of the species occurring at the site, weighted by percentage cover and niche breadth of each species.
   3. A preliminary reference network of 32 sites of high physico-chemical and hydromorphological quality, and representative of the range of river types in Northern Ireland, enabled reference metric scores to be produced for each river type. Five unimpacted and twenty impacted sites were used for testing the performance of the metrics. By subtracting reference metric scores from metric scores at a monitoring site measures of ecological impact could be determined along five different impact gradients. Metrics were also combined to give a measure of total ecological change.
   4. The metrics system distinguished unimpacted from impacted sites and correctly identified 77% of the known impacts. The metrics distinguished different types of impact, e.g. silt and nitrate.
   5. Aquatic macrophyte occurrence and abundance has high natural variability at a site, both temporally and spatially. This method was designed to be sensitive to ecological change whilst reducing noise caused by natural variation.

AB  - Amid climate change, biodiversity loss and food insecurity, there is the growing need to draw synergies between micro-scale environmental processes and practices, and macro-level ecosystem dynamics to facilitate conservation decision-making. Adopting this synergistic approach can improve crop yields and profitability more sustainably, enhance livelihoods and mitigate climate change. Using spatially explicit data generated through a public participatory geographic information system methodology (n = 37), complemented by spatial analysis, interviews (n = 68) and focus group discussions (n = 4), we explored the synergies between participatory farmer-to-farmer agroecology knowledge sharing, farm-level decisions and their links with macro-level prioritization of conservation strategies. We mapped farm conditions and ecosystem services (ES) of two village areas with varying knowledge systems about farming. Results of the farm-level analysis revealed variations in spatial perception among farmers, differences in understanding the dynamics of crop growth and varying priorities for extension services based on agroecological knowledge. The ES use pattern analysis revealed hotspots in the mapped ES indicators with similarities in both village areas. Despite the similarities in ES use, priorities for biodiversity conservation align with farmers' understanding of farm processes and practices. Farmers with training in agroecology prioritized strategies that are ecologically friendly while farmers with no agroecology training prioritized the use of strict regulations. Importantly, the results show that agroecology can potentially contribute to biodiversity conservation and food security, with climate change mitigation co-benefits. The findings generally contribute to debates on land sparing and land sharing conservation strategies and advance social learning theory as it pertains to acquiring agroecological knowledge for improved yield and a sustainable environment.

AB  - Human-induced habitat clearing and pollution are leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Ecosystem assessments are required to identify ecosystems at risk of collapse, but they should account for cross-system linkages and dynamics where necessary. This is particularly true for coastal wetlands (e.g. seagrass, mangroves and saltmarsh), which exhibit high ecological connectivity and have individually suffered global declines over the last century. We use the coastal wetlands of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, as a model system to examine how integrating outcomes of multiple, simultaneously conducted, ecosystem assessments can assist in identifying appropriate management and conservation strategies. We simultaneously conducted separate assessments of seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems against the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria. Despite substantial human population growth in the region, seagrass and mangroves were assessed as Least Concern. Mangroves were found to be rapidly encroaching on saltmarsh. This process, together with past clearing, were the major drivers behind saltmarsh being assessed as Endangered. Given the importance of connectivity among these connected ecosystems, collapse in any one ecosystem can have seascape-wide consequences, highlighting the benefit of conducting multi-ecosystem assessments. Consequently, a fully integrated assessment of the coastal wetlands as a single entity would miss key processes, such as mangrove encroachment, potentially underestimating overall risks. Our study highlights the plight of saltmarsh and the value of conducting simultaneous RLE assessments for multiple ecosystems comprising seascapes. We recommend that connectivity be accounted for explicitly in assessments of other connected, high-risk ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization changes the landscape structure and ecological processes of natural habitats. While urban areas expose animal communities to novel challenges, they may also provide more stable environments in which environmental fluctuations are buffered. Species' ecology and physiology may determine their capacity to cope with the city life. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying organismal responses to urbanization, and whether different physiological systems are equally affected by urban environments remain poorly understood. This severely limits our capacity to predict the impact of anthropogenic habitats on wild populations. In this study, we measured indicators of physiological stress at the endocrine, immune and cellular level (feather corticosterone levels, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and heat-shock proteins) in urban and non-urban European blackbirds (Turdusmerula) across 10 European populations. Among the three variables, we found consistent differences in feather corticosterone, which was higher in non-urban habitats. This effect seems to be dependent on sex, being greater in males. In contrast, we found no significant differences between urban and non-urban habitats in the two other physiological indicators. The discrepancy between these different measurements of physiological stress highlights the importance of including multiple physiological variables to understand the impact of urbanization on species' physiology. Overall, our findings suggest that adult European blackbirds living in urban and non-urban habitats do not differ in terms of physiological stress at an organismal level. Furthermore, we found large differences among populations on the strength and direction of the urbanization effect, which illustrates the relevance of spatial replication when investigating urban-induced physiological responses.

AB  - Benthic indices based on the Polychaetes/Amphipods (P/A) ratio have been proposed to assess the environmental quality status of ecosystems in estuarine and coastal waters. Although the methods used to calculate these indices (essentially BOPA and BO2A) have been revised over the past two decades, the underlying approach corresponds to the contrasted responses of two benthic invertebrate groups to pollution, with polychaetes as tolerant/opportunistic species and amphipods as sensitive taxa. The Polychaetes/Amphipods ratio has been tested for monitoring major changes in benthic communities in response to a wide variety of different human pressures in estuarine and coastal environments (oil spills, urban sewage outfalls, enrichment in organic matter, etc.) and is used in 23 countries mainly in Europe, but also in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America. This paper reviews the use of the P/A ratio (79 documents) in relation to a large panel of human activities, in transitional (estuaries and lagoons) and coastal waters. In some studies, BOPA and BO2A indices based on P/A ratios were selected in certain regions of Spain and Gibraltar to assess the quality of water bodies according to the Water Framework Directive. Moreover, most of these studies do not meet the necessary conditions for application of the indices. As a result, comparisons between P/A ratios and other benthic indices are inappropriate when assessing ecological quality status, which therefore reinforces the need to apply P/A ratios with precaution.

AB  - Cumulative effects assessment (CEA), as a required practice for the environmental assessment (EA) of projects in many countries, faces several practical challenges, especially related to biodiversity. Drawing on the perspectives and experiences of Canadian EA practitioners, this paper explores options or drivers of change for improving project-based assessment to better tackle cumulative effects on biodiversity. An on-line survey was conducted with 40 professionals from the private sector, government departments/agencies, universities, and non-governmental organizations, examining the current challenges and opportunities regarding: CEA process for biodiversity; responsibilities for undertaking CEA tasks; resources to support and promote good CEA practice. In terms of process, there is shared understanding on: (i) the need of EA terms of reference to provide specific directions on CEA; (ii) CEA should capture both human and natural drivers of cumulative change; (iii) spatial boundaries for CEA should be based on ecological boundaries. There are dissenting views about: (i) whether CEA should consider all valued components (VCs) potentially affected by a project or only those for which residual effects are predicted; and (ii) delimitation of future temporal limits. In terms of responsibilities, participants agreed that project proponents should retain a central role in conducting CEA, but government agencies should lead the collection/provision of information about other projects in the study area and baseline VC conditions. Information and knowledge management resources could be also applied in the context of governmental agencies and consultancy firms to support CEA for biodiversity.

AB  - Key message Apical dominance ratio (ADR), reported as a suitable indicator for the growth and development of Abies alba, is concurrently determined by morphological and functional plant traits. Structural equation modeling (SEM) proved here to be an effective multivariate technique to represent the contribution of different variables in explaining ADR variability.
   Context During the natural recruitment of understory tree saplings, the light environment and competition among individuals may change drastically as well as their growth patterns. To cope with this, saplings have a remarkable ability to accordingly modify their physiology and morphology. Therefore, understanding the ecological significance of plant structural patterns requires an integrated view of morphological, architectural, and physiological attributes of plants.
   Aims Here, we applied a SEM approach to understand the mechanisms influencing the ADR, recently reported as suitable indicator of the growth conditions favoring silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) natural regeneration in Mediterranean areas.
   Methods A series of plant traits (e.g., root-collar diameter, leaf mass per area, and isotope composition) were combined into two main latent variables, namely Morphology and Physiology, to account for their relative contribution in explaining the ADR variability.
   Results Our results underline the importance of variables accounting for the photosynthetic capacity and leaf economics in determining ADR; among them, leaf mass per area (LMA) emerged as an important driving variable.
   Conclusion SEM proved to be an effective multivariate technique to represent the coordination of different morphological and functional variables in explaining ADR variability in silver fir.

AB  - Recent climate change on the Antarctic Peninsula is well documented [1-5], with warming, alongside increases in precipitation, wind strength, and melt season length [1, 6, 7], driving environmental change [8, 9]. However, meteorological records mostly began in the 1950s, and paleoenvironmental datasets that provide a longer-term context to recent climate change are limited in number and often from single sites [7] and/or discontinuous in time [10, 11]. Here we use moss bank cores from a 600-km transect from Green Island (65.3 degrees S) to Elephant Island (61.1 degrees S) as paleoclimate archives sensitive to regional temperature change, moderated by water availability and surface microclimate [12, 13]. Mosses grow slowly, but cold temperatures minimize decomposition, facilitating multiproxy analysis of preserved peat [14]. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) in cellulose indicates the favorability of conditions for photosynthesis [15]. Testate amoebae are representative heterotrophs in peatlands [16-18], so their populations are an indicator of microbial productivity [14]. Moss growth and mass accumulation rates represent the balance between growth and decomposition [19]. Analyzing these proxies in five cores at three sites over 150 years reveals increased biological activity over the past ca. 50 years, in response to climate change. We identified significant changepoints in all sites and proxies, suggesting fundamental and widespread changes in the terrestrial biosphere. The regional sensitivity of moss growth to past temperature rises suggests that terrestrial ecosystems will alter rapidly under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of this iconic region-an Antarctic greening to parallel well-established observations in the Arctic [20].

AB  - Transport infrastructure is closely linked to several sustainability issues of main policy relevance, and significant impacts on biodiversity as well as resource use and construction costs relate to the corridor design and location in the landscape. The aim of this study was to develop methods for railway corridor planning, in which corridor design and location would be based on important ecological and geological sustainability criteria. The method, an MCA framework including both spatial and non-spatial MCA, was demonstrated on a railway planning proposition in an urbanising area north of Stockholm, Sweden. Alternative spatial alignments for 6 railway corridors were derived based on criteria representing biodiversity, resource efficiency and costs, developed from ecological and geological knowledge, data and models. The method identified a study area specific positive synergy between ecological and geological sustainability criteria. The evaluation part of the methodology could furthermore identify uncertainties in the input data and assumptions and conflicts between ecological criteria. In order to arrive at a well-informed decision support system, the criteria as well as the decision rules employed could be further elaborated. Other relevant sustainability issues would also need to be integrated, such as cultural landscapes, recreation, and other ecosystem services. Still, arriving at a corridor design informed by the ecological and geological conditions in the planned area, as demonstrated by this study, could improve the sustainability performance of transport infrastructure planning.

AB  - The entomopathogenic fungus L. lecanii has been developed as biopesticides and used widely for biological control of several insects in agricultural practice. Due to the lack of isolation/ count methods for L. lecanii in soil, the persistence of this fungus in soil appears to have attracted no attention. A selective medium and count method for L. lecanii in soil based on cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was developed, and then the persistence and viability of this fungus in soil were investigated under field conditions between 2012 and 2014. The results showed that the rate of recovery for L. lecanii in soil on the selective CTAB medium was satisfactory. The minimum CFUs for L. lecanii on the selective medium (0.5 g/L CTAB) was about 10(2) conidia/g soil. The L. lecanii density in soil declined quickly in the first month after inoculation with fungal conidia, kept stable for 6 to 10 months, and then decreased gradually until undetectable. L. lecanii could persist for at least 14 months in the agricultural soil of northern China. The colony growth, conidia yield and germination rate on plates, as well as the median lethal concentration or times (LC50 or LT50) to aphids, mycelium growth in aphids and sporulation on aphids of L. lecanii did not change significantly during the persistence in soil. In general, the count method developed here was a very useful tool for monitoring the dynamics of natural or introduced L. lecanii populations in soil, and the data on the persistence of L. lecanii in soil reported here were helpful for biological control and environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Subfossil remains of the Pediastrum-algae group (Fam. Hydrodictyaceae) are frequently found in lake sediments, but very few studies have used them as palaeoclimate and palaeolimnological indicators. This study explored the species composition of Pediastrum assemblages in shallow floodplain lakes in northern Germany during two transitional periods from cold to temperate climate conditions (GS-2/GI-1 and GI-1/Holocene). We identified Pediastrum taxa to subspecies level and used multivariate statistics (constrained clustering, principal component analysis and redundancy analysis) to show that shifts in taxonomic composition reflected the strong Late Glacial climate oscillations. The Pediastrum assemblages indicate that climate amelioration already begun shortly before the main GS-2/GI-1 summer-temperature transition. In contrast to previous studies that identified trophic state as the main driver of change in Pediastrum species composition, we identified climate shifts and related factors as the major drivers of community change. Water depth and trophic state probably acted as secondary factors that were responsible for differences in Pediastrum response between the first and second investigated climate transitions. During cold periods, Pediastrum algae composition was controlled mainly by environmental variables, whereas during warm periods, Pediastrum assemblages may have been influenced to a greater extent by intra- and intergeneric competition. This study contributes to knowledge about ecological niches of Pediastrum species. Size-measurements on Pediastrum coenobia reveal that one response of Pediastrum algae to climate shifts probably was size change. Coenobia of Pseudopediastrum boryanum var. boryanum were significantly smaller during cold climate periods than during temperate periods. The shifts in Pediastrum species composition and coenobium size suggest this algae group has great potential for enabling palaeoecological and palaeoclimate inferences.

AB  - The loss of biological and economic productivity in the dryland regions hinders the prospects of reducing poverty. The method of vulnerability assessment has been broadly employed to evaluate the potential impact of environmental change and pinpoint the future adaptations on regional or global levels, which could help in the identification and development of coping strategies for dryland regions. The present study provides a vulnerability assessment for the semiarid grasslands of the Xilingol, Mongolia Plateau - a typical dryland area that has been suffering from land degradation for a long period. An exposure-sensitivity index was calculated using Spatial Principal Component Analysis for 19 climate and anthropogenic indicators that had a strong correlation with observed grassland degradation. This indicator was compared with an adaptive capacity index, constructed using principal component analysis for 27 relevant variables from the aspects of location advantage, economic level, resources, and social efficiency. The results show that the northeastern part of Xilingol is least vulnerable due to more favorable and available natural resources, including high precipitation, productive grassland, etc., and greater economic development. By contrast, the areas in the southwest, with harsh environmental conditions and a poor socio-economic infrastructure, have the greatest vulnerability. These regions are in dire need for targeted adaptation measures to further decline in human well-being. Through analyzing the results of SPCA and PCA analysis, the entry points for vulnerability reduction were distinguished and the pertinent suggestions were clearly brought forward from the aspects of reducing exposure-sensitivity and improving adaptive capacity.

AB  - Question Can a Kohonen's self-organizing map, which is robust to non-linear relationships between variables and their non-normal distributions, be effective in patterning the data on plant communities investigated with the classical Braun-Blanquet phytosociological method based on the ordinal scale? Does the application of the self-organizing map make it possible to obtain new information from the analysed plant communities when compared to the BraunBlanquet method alone? Location The Babsk nature reserve, Central Poland. Methods The analysed data were derived from two separate series of phytosociological studies on plant communities dating from periods 31 yr apart (1960 and 1991). The data consisted of 24 quantitative sampling lists of plant species (=phytosociological releves). The releves were analysed by the application of a Kohonen's self-organizing map and the indicator value (IndVal). Results The transformations from Querco roborisPinetum to Tilio cordataeCarpinetum betuli in the vegetation in the Babsk nature reserve over 31 yr were determined precisely. Valuable new data were also obtained on: (1) significant associations of individual plant species with the previous and recent phytocoenoses, i.e. diagnostic groups of plant species for each phytocoenosis; (2) abiotic conditions (determined retrospectively in the two study periods on the basis of ecological indicators for vascular plants); and (3) the concordance of phytocoenoses with the biotope. Conclusions The Kohonen's self-organizing map method and the IndVal made it possible to efficiently identify abiotic and biotic patterns for plant communities on the basis of the data expressed in the conventional Braun-Blanquet scale.

AB  - Recent attempts to mitigate global change have brought forestry-based carbon (C) sequestration into sharp focus due to its potential to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the consequences of actual forest management practices on C storage capacity are still controversial to a certain extent. Under such a perspective, a distinctive relevant issue concerns the management of forest ecosystems within areas specifically designated for nature conservation. From the analysis of biomass data from forests in the National Parks of Italy, we found that the average forest C stock and sink per unit area is relatively higher within National Parks (81.21 and 2.18 tons ha(-1), respectively) than on the overall national territory (76.11 and 1.12 tons ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The analysis confirms the influence of ecological conditions and management approach on C sequestration capacity. Although the results of the proposed assessment approach have to be considered as rough estimates, the trial proves interesting, given the relative lack of specific information, at least on a large scale, about C stocks and sinks within forest areas designated for nature conservation, and the direct comparison with those forest areas not designated to such an end. The C storage capacity can be enhanced by increasing the productivity of forests, minimizing the disturbance to stand structure and composition. Extending conservation strategies adopted in National Parks to other forest areas of the national territory would allow the restoration of C sequestration potential, where unsustainable management practices have degraded relatively large stocks of biomass.

AB  - Since 1962, the tobacco variety Bel-W3 (Nicotiana tabacum L.), has been used in many countries as an indicator of the presence of phytotoxic concentrations of O3. It is super-sensitive to o3 and may produce easily recognizable symptoms for several weeks on the new, fully expanded leaves. Bel-B and Bel-C, tolerant and sensitive to O3, respectively, are sometimes used along with Bel-W3. Information is provided on the origin and nature of these varieties. This includes their use as indicators of elevated O3 concentrations, strength and limitations, and the inheritance and nature of resistance to O3 in Bel-B. The varieties were the product of research initiated in 1957 to determine the cause and to reduce losses from tobacco weather fleck. Bel-C and Bel-B display the classical upper leaf surface injury; whereas, Bel-W3 develops primarily bifacial lesions. Data are provided to show differences in the amounts of acute and chronic injury on each variety when exposed to different O3 exposure doses in controlled environments and under field conditions. There is discussion of the influence of environmental factors on response to O3 by the varieties and the possibility of synergistic action of O3 and SO2 when tobacco is exposed to mixtures of these gases. The methods and results obtained with Bel-W3 in the Dutch National Monitoring Network for Air Pollution are presented in detail. Use of Bel-W3 world-wide as an indicator of elevated O3 concentrations has been a significant factor in increasing the awareness of O3 as a pollutant.

AB  - Improved water resources governance supports important social, economic, and environmental objectives. The 2030 Agenda recognizes improved water governance to be critical for achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and commits to monitor the progress of implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM). This paper critically reviews the approach to monitoring SDG indicator 6.5.1 on implementation of IWRM. Firstly, the paper places the indicator monitoring within the context of other initiatives to measure water governance. Secondly, it analyzes experiences of application of the SDG indicator 6.5.1 methodology to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the indicator and presents the key findings of the 2017/2018 global baseline assessment of IWRM implementation. Baseline reporting shows that degree of IWRM implementation globally is 49%, though country scores range from 10 to 100%. Disaggregating the data by country and by aspect of water resources governance provides a diagnostic tool to identify areas of high and low progress, and, therefore, where increased resources and attention are required. The article concludes by suggesting how the next iteration of SDG indicator 6.5.1 monitoring cycle can be made into a tool for advancing the IWRM implementation and improved governance practices on the ground. It also proposes how the methodology can be strengthened to address current limitations, including aspects relating to integrity, accountability and transparency.

AB  - The majority of the southern Baltic Sea seabed encompasses homogenous soft-bottom sediments of limited productivity and low biological diversity, but shallow productive areas in the coastal zone such as wetlands, vegetated lagoons and sheltered bays show a high variety of benthic habitat types offering favourable biotopic conditions for benthic fauna. Within Polish marine areas, semi-enclosed Puck Bay (the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk) features an exceptionally diverse environment covering a range of benthic habitats which underscores its unique biological value and aesthetic quality and providing an impetus for conservation and ecosystem-based development. Full-coverages maps on benthic habitats in this area are therefore a necessary foundation for maritime spatial planning and implementation of strategies for sustainable management and protection of the coastal environment. This study presents the first comprehensive description and distribution of benthic habitats in Puck Bay which were categorised using the revised EUNIS 2019 classification system. Typological analyses were carried out based on inventory datasets from 1995 to 2019 including scientific publications, satellite images, open databases, topographic and geological maps, reports, theses, information available on websites and unpublished data shared willingly by individual researchers and administrative institutions. Collating various spatial data sources, that were first georeferenced and then visualized using techniques available in ArcMap 10.4.1 software (Esri), resulted in the mapping of benthic habitats and sites of important and protected plant species, which can contribute to the high confidence in environmental assessments and monitoring activities.

AB  - The mechanisms that regulate the composition and structure of biological communities remain poorly understood. Diatom communities have traditionally been assumed to be a collection of r-selected, ecologically redundant generalist taxa with distributions constrained largely by dispersal limitation. Here, we challenge this notion by presenting a novel model that uses distributional data to estimate ecological specialization for groups of diatom taxa. We further develop this model to evaluate relationships among ecological specialization, taxonomic richness, and species' abundance using field data collected from ancient Lake Matano and the broader Malili Lakes system (Sulawesi, Indonesia), as well as Mazinaw Lake (Ontario, Canada). We demonstrated that diatom niche breadth is highly variable both at the assemblage scale and among genera within assemblages. Ecologically-specialized genera exhibited higher taxonomic richness than their generalist counterparts, suggesting that ecological specialization serves to support the sympatric coexistence of multiple species by limiting competitive interactions among congeneric taxa. This assertion is further supported by species' abundance patterns, which suggested that resources are evenly partitioned among taxa within specialist genera, while less-specialized genera are composed of taxa with either exceptionally high or exceptionally low abundances reflective of their relative success in competitive interactions with one another. Our findings indicate that the often-overlooked complement of rare taxa within diatom assemblages are in fact the entities that respond most sensitively to environmental conditions and are worthy of far greater consideration in environmental assessment and paleolimnological studies.

AB  - Land degradation is a global environmental problem that has received a great deal of attention. Moreover, the current methods used to evaluate land degradation concentrate mostly on point and management levels, while information at the regional scale is lacking. This study aimed to assess potential land degradation at a regional scale by adapting the Mediterranean desertification and land use approach for a subtropical region with a geographic information system (GIS), developing a degradation assessment model that recognizes environmentally sensitive areas and analyzing potential land degradation for natural and anthropogenic factors. The selected indicators included vegetation, soil, climate, and human pressure, and these four indicators contained 15 indices that were input by layers from GIS data. The results showed that 89.32% of the study area was affected by land degradation, with more than half of this region in the moderate risk class for land degradation. At the city scale, Nanning had the largest percentage of land in the critical class, followed by the cities of Chongzuo and Qinzhou. Climate and human pressure were the predominant indicators, with the highest mean scores of 1.46 and 1.45, respectively. This study offers significant information for decision makers evaluating potential land degradation. The goal of land management is to solve conflicts between humans and land, and management measures consider local conditions. The assessment model provides a basis for effective management measures and decision making for land degradation prevention. Developing this approach is significant in terms of extending degradation assessment to a larger scale.

AB  - Organization of efficient economic activity in the Arctic zone requires development of human potential, transport infrastructure, exploitation of natural resources under the conditions of greatest possible environmental safety. In order to choose preferable trends of economic development and to provide efficiency of operations in the Arctic zone it is crucial to perform research in the areas of industrial efficiency upgrading and rational use of fuel, energy, mineral, chemical and biological resources of the Ocean and littoral areas of Russian Arctic.
   The paper analyzes major trends in the research on increasing economic efficiency of operations aimed at territory development in the Arctic zone. The authors justify the need to examine economic problems of rational resource use in the Arctic zone of Russia based on the proposed system of resource-estimation indicators and their application in establishing a mechanism of rational resource use with a due regard to protection of the marine environment. The paper also focuses on methodological problems of the target programme approach to complex development of the Arctic zone, creation of target programmes, industrial development and rational use of natural resources. The authors give rationale for the key task in this area - development of methodological principles of forming federal and regional target programmes, aimed at exploration, exploitation and rational use of natural resources in the Arctic zone of Russian Federation. An analysis is provided that focuses on the problems of creating a scientifically justified hierarchical system of programmes and regional regulations, creation of a scientific information data bank and other methodological issues.

AB  - The magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events are predicted to increase in the future due to ongoing climate change. In particular, floods and droughts resulting from climate change are thought to alter the ecosystem functions and stability. However, knowledge of the effects of these weather events on soil fauna is scarce, although they are key towards functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Plant species richness has been shown to affect the stability of ecosystem functions and food webs. Here, we used the occurrence of a natural flood in a biodiversity grassland experiment that was followed by a simulated summer drought experiment, to investigate the interactive effects of plant species richness, a natural flood, and a subsequent summer drought on nematode communities. Three and five months after the natural flooding, effects of flooding severity were still detectable in the belowground system. We found that flooding severity decreased soil nematode food-web structure (loss of K-strategists) and the abundance of plant feeding nematodes. However, high plant species richness maintained higher diversity and abundance of higher trophic levels compared to monocultures throughout the flood. The subsequent summer drought seemed to be of lower importance but reversed negative flooding effects in some cases. This probably occurred because the studied grassland system is well adapted to drought, or because drought conditions alleviated the negative impact of long-term soil waterlogging. Using soil nematodes as indicator taxa, this study suggests that high plant species richness can maintain soil food web complexity after consecutive environmental perturbations.

AB  - A model incubation experiment using natural zooxanthellate corals was conducted to evaluate the influence of phosphate uptake by coral holobionts on oxygen isotope ratio of dissolved PO4 (3-) (delta O-18(p)). Live coral samples of Acropora digitifera, Porites cylindrica, and Heliopora coerulea were collected from coral reefs around Ishigaki Island (Okinawa, Japan) and Bolinao (northern Luzon, Philippines) and incubated for 3-5 d after acclimatization under natural light conditions with elevated concentrations of PO4 (3-). Phosphate uptake by corals behaved linearly with incubation time, with uptake rate depending on temperature. delta O-18(p) usually increased with time toward the equilibrium value with respect to oxygen isotope exchange with ambient seawater, but sometimes became higher than equilibrium value at the end of incubation. The magnitude of the isotope effect associated with uptake depended on coral species; the greatest effect was in A. digitifera and the smallest in H. coerulea. However, it varied even within samples of a single coral species, which suggests multiple uptake processes with different isotope effects operating simultaneously with varying relative contributions in the coral holobionts used. In natural environments where concentrations of PO4 (3-) are much lower than those used during incubation, PO4 (3-) is presumably turned over much faster and the delta O-18(p) easily altered by corals and other major primary producers. This should be taken into consideration when using delta O-18(p) as an indicator of external PO4 (3-) sources in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - This study examines the influence of the increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition observed in central Russia between 1960 and 2010 (with a peak in 1990) on biodiversity and the availability of N in soil in pine forests. Shifts in N availability in soils of 3 pine plots were analyzed using presence/absence chronosequence records of the dynamics of ground vegetation plants and a set of specialist plant species with a narrow range of tolerance as bioindicators of soil richness. We assumed that changes in plant communities might be caused by increased atmospheric N input. To examine this assumption, (i) the species composition of forest ground vegetation was analyzed using the Ellenberg N scale and the Tsyganov N scale, which was developed for forest vegetation in European Russia, and (ii) the dynamics of the main N pools were examined using simulation models of forest growth and elements cycling in the forest-soil system. Our results confirm that changes in the ground vegetation communities experiencing eutrophication occurred in all plots. The number of indicators of N-rich conditions for these plots reached a maximum in 1990, the year N deposition reached its maximum in this area. The decline in the number of oligotrophic species indicated that N-poor soils decreased over the monitoring period. Model simulations showed an increase in labile N compounds in the soil and in the total N pool in forest ecosystems. Our results demonstrate an acceleration of natural succession due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition in this region.

AB  - National ecosystem assessments provide evidence on the status and trends of biodiversity, ecosystem conditions, and the delivery of ecosystem services to society. I this study, we analyze the complex relationships established between ecosystems and human systems in Spain through the combination of Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and structural equation models. Firstly, to operationalize the framework, we selected 53 national scale indicators that provide accurate, long-term information on each of the components. Secondly, structural equation models were performed to understand the relationships among the components of the framework. Trend indicators have shown an overall progressive biodiversity loss, trade-offs between provisioning and cultural services associated with urban areas vs. regulating and cultural services associated with rural areas, a decoupling effect between material and non-material dimensions of human wellbeing, a rapid growing trend of conservation responses in recent years and a constant growing linear trend of direct or indirect drivers of change. Results also show that all the components analyzed in the model are strongly related. On one hand, the model shows that biodiversity erosion negatively affect the supply of regulating services, while it is positively related with the increase of provisioning service delivery. On the other hand, the most important relationship found in the model is the effect of pressures on biodiversity loss, indicating that response options for conserving nature cannot counteract the effect of the drivers of change. These results suggest that there is an insufficient institutional response to address the underlying causes (indirect drivers of change) of biodiversity loos in Spain. We conclude that more structural changes are required in the Spanish institutional framework to reach 2020 biodiversity conservation international targets.

AB  - Growing concern over environmental pollution by chemicals that may directly or indirectly impact human and ecosystem health make it increasingly necessary to establish a biological early warning system to minimize these impacts. To achieve this, simple and reliable approaches and criteria for environmental risk assessment must be developed. We propose a new approach for detecting behavioral responses to toxicants in flowing water. We conducted a series of tests to determine toxic responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to lethal concentrations of potassium cyanide (KCN; 10 mg L(-1)) and phenol (25 mg L(-1)) Fish movements were tracked by three-dimensional (3D) biomonitoring under flow-through conditions The 3D data were used to evaluate behavioral responses in terms of swimming speed, vertical position in the water, and entropies of these parameters Fish exposed to KCN surfaced more frequently than unexposed fish, whereas fish exposed to phenol stayed near the bottom. Maximum swimming speed significantly increased after exposure to both test chemicals, whereas median swimming speed significantly decreased after exposure. Despite large variations in swimming behavior between individual fish, toxic behavioral responses could be identified by the significant decrease in the entropy of vertical position after 10-30 min of exposure to the test chemicals. We conclude that the use of entropy can contribute to the development of a biological early warning system for detecting toxicants at early stages of pollution. To use the present approach to detect lower concentrations of toxicants, further studies should be conducted using long-term monitoring of fish exposed to sublethal concentrations ((C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals.

AB  - Parasites are a common and constant threat to organisms at all levels of phyla. The virulence of a parasite, defined as the impact on survival and reproduction of its host, depends on the specific host-parasite combination and can also be influenced by environmental conditions. Environmental pollution might be an additional factor influencing host-parasite interactions. We here aimed to test whether the combined stress of pollutant exposure and parasite challenge results in stronger impacts on host organisms than expected from the single stressors applied alone. We used the water flea Daphnia magna and two of its endoparasites, the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and the microsporidium Flabelliforma magnivora, as invertebrate host-parasite models. For each parasite, we tested in a full-factorial design for interactions between parasitism and pollution using the neurotoxic pesticide carbaryl as a model substance. Sublethal concentrations of the pesticide synergistically enhanced the virulence of both parasites by increasing host mortality. Furthermore, host castration induced by P. ramosa was accelerated by carbaryl exposure. These effects likely reflect decreased host resistance due to direct or indirect immunosuppressive activity of carbaryl. The present study provides experimental evidence that the in vivo development of infectious diseases can be influenced by a pesticide at environmentally realistic concentrations. This implies that host-parasite interactions and subsequently co-evolution might be influenced by environmental pollution at toxicant concentrations being sublethal to parasite-free hosts. Standard toxicity testing as employed in the current way of conducting ecological risk assessments for anthropogenic substances does not consider natural antagonists such as infectious diseases, and thereby likely underestimates the impact these substances may pose to natural populations in the environment.

AB  - The impact of herbivory, fungi and competition on Mimosa pigra was studied in the field in Australia using insecticide and fungicide exclusion experiments and monitoring. The insect Neurostrota gunniella, a stem-boring moth imported for the biological control of M. pigra, had no apparent effect on seedling survival, which was however strongly reduced by inter- and intra-specific competition. In mature plants, the insect reduced radial growth of the canopy by about 14% in a season, but the insecticide had a negative effect on seed production, perhaps because it disrupted native pollinating insects. Fungicide had no effect, implying that native fungi were not affecting plant performance. A 5-year monitoring study showed a strong negative correlation between the density of the insect and seed output, such that seed output was 60% lower than normal at the highest densities of the insect. Furthermore, even at the lowest insect densities found in the field, the mean seed output and leaf litterfall were less than 50% of the value found in a study carried out prior to the insect's release in the mid 1980s. The authors conclude tentatively that theta has been an impact of the insect on seed output, though this would not be sufficient to control the weed Although measuring the impact of biological control agents in the field is fraught with difficulties, the asymmetrical designs recently proposed for environmental impact assessment may represent a solution.

AB  - Marine classification schemes based on abiotic surrogates often inform regional marine conservation planning in lieu of detailed biological data. However, these schemes may poorly represent ecologically relevant biological patterns required for effective design and management strategies. We used a community-level modeling approach to characterize and delineate representative mesoscale (tens to thousands of kilometers) assemblages of demersal fish and benthic invertebrates in the Northwest Atlantic. Hierarchical clustering of species occurrence data from four regional annual multispecies trawl surveys revealed three to six groupings (predominant assemblage types) in each survey region, broadly associated with geomorphic and oceanographic features. Indicator analyses identified 3-34 emblematic taxa of each assemblage type. Random forest classifications accurately predicted assemblage distributions from environmental covariates (AUC > 0.95) and identified thermal limits (annual minimum and maximum bottom temperatures) as important predictors of distribution in each region. Using forecasted oceanographic conditions for the year 2075 and a regional classification model, we projected assemblage distributions in the southernmost bioregion (Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy) under a high emissions climate scenario (RCP 8.5). Range expansions to the northeast are projected for assemblages associated with warmer and shallower waters of the Western Scotian Shelf over the 21st century as thermal habitat on the relatively cooler Eastern Scotian Shelf becomes more favorable. Community-level modeling provides a biotic-informed approach for identifying broadscale ecological structure required for the design and management of ecologically coherent, representative, well-connected networks of Marine Protected Areas. When combined with oceanographic forecasts, this modeling approach provides a spatial tool for assessing sensitivity and resilience to climate change, which can improve conservation planning, monitoring, and adaptive management.

AB  - As an indicator of physiological state of lizards, thermoregulatory behavior has been proposed as an assessment tool of environmental contamination, particularly in desert ecosystems where lizards represent a major biological component. Although pesticide contamination has been shown to induce behavioral fever in lizards, the possible pyrogenic effect of heavy metals has received less attention. The objective of this study was to provide data on this issue by using Bosk's fringe-toed lizards (Acanthodactylus boskianus) living in a metal-contaminated industrial area in south-eastern Tunisia as a study model. Combining field observations of behavior with measures of thermoregulatory performance under laboratory conditions, we found that proximity to the industrial zone was associated to a different thermoregulatory behavior of lizards. There was a tendency of lizards living close to the contamination source to display behavioral fever, as they spent more time in the sun, preferred higher body temperatures, and warmed up faster, compared to lizards living far away. This heat-seeking behavior is likely a reaction to improve the functioning of physiological systems involved in the defense against toxic effects of heavy metals, possibly through the increase of metabolic rate, stimulation of enzymes involved in the detoxification process, and enhancement of immune defense systems. Our findings stress the need for further detailed studies into the physiological mechanisms linking metal contamination to behavioral fever. They also underline the usefulness of thermoregulatory behavior as a reliable, non-destructive, and inexpensive, individual-level biomarker in lizard ecotoxicology and biomonitoring of contaminated desert environments.

AB  - Because of their importance in the maintenance of ecological processes and sensitivity to multiple stressors, bat activity is increasingly being used to study habitat associations, including the effects of urbanization and other landuse changes. However, to be effectively used as a bioindicator, baseline information on bat activity patterns must first be established. In this study, we aimed to determine patterns of insectivorous bat activity, richness, and assemblage within an urban green space in the Philippines' capital region in relation to habitat type, insect abundance, and environmental conditions, with particular focus on activity at dusk emergence. Bat activity was measured as the number of bat passes per minute using a portable bat recorder at five time intervals from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM, and compared between 10 open and 10 forested sites. Bat calls were classified into sonotypes based on five call variables. There was no difference in bat activity between forested and open sites, but more sonotypes were recorded in open sites. Both bat activity and sonotype richness peaked between 6:00 PM and 6:30 PM, representing a short foraging bout upon dusk emergence. However, we did not observe significant relationships between bat activity and insect abundance, air temperature, and relative humidity. Our study found considerable bat activity and diversity in an urban ecosystem, a poorly explored field of research in the Philippines. Additional studies are necessary to understand the impact of landuse changes on Philippine bats, and to inform their conservation and management in anthropogenically altered habitats.

AB  - Despite their ecological and economical relevance, a lack of data is still occurring about the distribution, abundance, bioaccumulation and risks for consumption of some edible bivalves. The present study has been carried out in the Venice Lagoon taking into account three bivalve species to investigate i) the possible relationship among the biological features-distribution, abundance and bioaccumulation patterns- of razor clams (Solen marginatus Pulteney, 1799), Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum Adams and Reeve, 1850) and lagoon cockles (Cerastoderma glaucum Poiret, 1789) and the hydrological features, namely sediment physico-chemical characteristics and contamination; ii) their specific role as bioindicators of inorganic contamination; iii) the possible risks for human health associated with the consumption of these edible bivalves. Results showed that species distribution and abundance, especially for razor clams, was mainly influenced by environmental conditions and sediment granulometric composition, abovemetal(loid) contamination. The contamination patterns were different among species, as Manila clam generally showed higher bioaccumulation values for most of themetal(loid)s, whilst lagoon cockles preferentially accumulated Ni. Eventually, a serious concern exists for the human consumption, for all species and investigated sites regarding As. This study will raise attention on the effects of bioaccumulation of inorganic pollutants by edible bivalves and risks for consumers' safety, especially concerning razor clams and cockles, for which a critical lack of data on metal(loid) bioaccumulation occurs from the Northern Adriatic Sea.

AB  - Soil management is fundamental to all agroecosystems and affects ecosystem processes that are involved in the provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES). Agricultural soils are the habitat for key functional organisms which collectively as soil biota contribute to soil ES provision: supporting biomass production and nutrient cycling, regulating of climate, water and biological control of pests and diseases. As result of an increased awareness on the importance of soil ES, soil science is playing an active role in informing the ecological intensification of agriculture. In this study, the lessons learned from Italian case studies on the usefulness of using a soil health assessment framework based on multiple soil ES are presented. Soil health as an integrative property of agroecosystem management can be evaluated with a set of physical, chemical, and biological indicators representative of essential soil ES. This is the basis of the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) (Andrews et al., 2004) and it is based on a three-step process that includes indicator selection, indicator interpretation, and integration into a final index. In northern Italy, several field trials have been set up to assess multiple ES provision from bioenergy crops cultivated on marginal conditions and from contrasting vegetable cropping systems. These studies revealed how the use of a comprehensive soil health assessment framework can help: (1) to identify the best soil management practices that deliver multiple ES and (2) to support resource-efficient production. Beyond academic research, the integration of multiple indicators of soil health within the assessment of agroecosystems sustainability is essential if we want to promote ecological intensification of food and bioenergy production.

AB  - Spatial management planning for vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) across broad areas of un-sampled seafloor requires detailed predictions of species distribution. We utilised two habitat suitability modelling techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), to create potential distribution maps for 11 VME indicator taxa in the New Zealand area and adjacent seas. New bathymetry data were combined with existing environmental, chemical and physical data to produce a set of 45 predictor variables describing conditions at the seafloor. Nine of these variables were selected for use in the models based on low covariance and high explanatory power. Historical biological survey data were used to provide models with absence data (BRT) or target-group background data (MaxEnt). Model agreement was high, with each model predicting similar areas of suitable habitat both in the vicinity of known VME indicator taxa presence locations as well as across broad regions of un-sampled seafloor. Model performance measures, including cross-validation testing against sets of spatially independent data, did not clearly indicate a preferred modelling method across all taxa. Previous habitat suitability modelling efforts have rarely accounted for model precision, and in this study we used a bootstrap re sampling technique to produce model uncertainty maps to accompany each habitat suitability map. Because of the similar performance of BRT and MaxEnt methods in this study, we conclude that the best approach to incorporating the results into decision-support tools for spatial conservation planning is to average predictions and uncertainty from both.

AB  - Ecological monitoring and its associated research programs have often provided answers to various environmental management issues. In the face of changing environmental conditions, ecological monitoring provides decision-makers with reliable information as they grapple with maintaining a sustainable economy and healthy environment. The Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN) is a national ecological monitoring network consisting of (1) about 100 case study sites across the country characterized by long-term multi-disciplinary environmental work conducted by a multitude of agencies (142 partners and counting); (2) a variety of less comprehensive yet more extensive monitoring sites; (3) a network where core monitoring variables of ecosystem change are measured; and (4) geo-referenced environmental observations. Environment Canada is the coordinating partner for the network through the EMAN Co-ordinating Office. EMAN's mission is to focus a scientifically-sound policy-relevant ecosystem monitoring and research network based on (a) stabilizing a network of case-study sites operated by a variety of partners, and (b) developing a number of cooperative dispersed monitoring initiatives in order to deliver unique and needed goods and services. These goods and services include: (1) an efficient and cost-effective early warning system which detects, describes and reports on changes in Canadian ecosystems at a national or ecozone scale; and (2) cross-disciplinary and cross-jurisdictional assessments of ecosystem status, trends and processes. The early warning system and assessments of ecosystem status. trends and processes provide Environment Canada and partner organizations with timely information that facilitates increasingly adaptive policies and priority setting. Canadians are also informed of changes and trends occurring in Canadian ecosystems and, as a result, are better able to make decisions related to conservation and sustainability.

T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
LA  - English

KW  - CYANOBACTERIA
AB  - There is increasing evidence of climate change in Antarctica, especially elevated temperature and ultraviolet B (UVB) flux within the ozone ''hole.'' Its origins are debatable, but the effects on ice recession, water availability, and summer growth conditions are demonstrable. Light-dependent, temperature-sensitive, fast-growing organisms respond to these physical and biogeographical changes. Microalgae (cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae), which are pioneer colonists of Antarctic mineral fellfield soils, are therefore highly suitable biological indicators of such changes. In frost-heaved soil polygons containing naturally sorted fine mineral particles, microalgal growth is restricted to a shallow zone of light penetration. By virtue of this light requirement, microalgae are exposed to extreme seasonal fluctuations in temperature (air and black-body radiation), photosynthetically active radiation, UV radiation, and desiccation. Dominance of conspicuous autofluorescent indicator species with distinctive morphology allowed quantification of responses using epifluorescence microscopy, and image analysis of undisturbed, unstained communities. However, the physical changes in climate, although significant in the long term, are gradual. The changes were therefore amplified experimentally by enclosing the communities at a fellfield site on Signy Island, maritime Antarctica, in cloches (small greenhouses). These were made of polystyrene of either UV-transparent or UV-opaque acrylic plastic, with or without walls. During a 6-year period, statistically significant changes were observed in microalgal colonization of the soil surface and in the morphology of filamentous populations. Evidence of community succession correlated with measured changes in local environment was found. Results from Signy Island and at continental sites on Alexander Island suggested that rates of microalgal colonization and community development might change significantly during current climate changes in Antarctica.

AB  - Enteric bacteria in natural and drinking waters present an important health risk. Adequate modelling of the survival of enteric bacteria in such systems can provide a valuable tool in assessing water quality. Herein, the survival curves of two enteric bacteria, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, in fresh and marine waters were studied. Both, colony-forming units (CFU) and total number of enteric bacteria were analyzed. Log-linear (LL) and other nonlinear (ONL) (Gompertz and Logistic) models were compared; with the premise that the best-fitting model of predicted survival should deviate least from the experimental data. In 68% of cases ONL models gave statistically lower deviations than LL models; LL models never fitted the experimental data significantly better than ONL models. Data obtained under different experimental conditions, such as different enteric bacterial species, different ecosystems, decay of CFU number, or decay of total number of enteric bacteria, were analyzed separately and together. Separately analyzed data were in general agreement with the overall data set. Significant correlations were observed between the parameters estimated from the studied models. The commonly used parameter, T-90, correlated with both the lag phase and the decay rate of the survival curves. ONL models, as well as fitting significantly better (P<0.05) to experimental data, provided information about the lag phase (time needed for a significant decrease in enteric bacterial number), the decay rate and the asymptote (final enteric bacterial concentration) of the survival curves. Furthermore, ONL models allow comparisons between different experiments, bacterial strains or species, and aquatic systems.

AB  - Background Predicting how natural and anthropogenic drivers shape different ecological indicators, such as plant populations along environmental gradients, can be a relevant tool for establishing management and conservation criteria of tropical wetlands. We aimed to assess the effects of seasonal flood disturbance, type of grasslands and topographical conditions on Croton trinitatis population distribution in a tropical wetland. Methods The study was carried out in a seasonally flooded grassland (Central-West Brazil). We conducted samplings of soil on the dry and flood hydrophases of the Pantanal. We took the samples in eight seasonal ponds, with 1 km interval between them. Transects were marked during the flood period, observing the water level, one in the lowest zone, in the middle of the pond = low (ca. 60 cm deep), one at the pond edge = mid (ca. 30 cm deep) and one in the higher zone, on the external part = high (ca. 1 cm deep). Results The results showed that the topography, seasonality, and types of grassland determine differences in the abundance patterns of adult plants and seedlings, and seed bank and seed predation. The abiotic factors can shape plant population-related ecological processes and patterns, with outputs (germination and predation) and inputs (local dispersion and from neighbouring areas) of proportional seeds for the population maintenance in this environment. Conclusion We emphasize the importance of these findings, to show that abiotic factors are not the only ones to be considered in ecological studies of distribution and structuring of populations in habitats with extreme seasonal events.

AB  - The paper highlights results obtained from collation between river water quality in mountain regions of Russia and Armenia employing two different methodological approaches: a method of a complex assessment by hydrochemical parameters by a Specific Combinatorial Water Pollution Index (SCWPI) and the Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI). Assessment was done of water quality of typical, identical in terms of conditions of formation small- and medium-size mountain rivers in Russia (river Terek basin: the Malka, the Baksan, the Cherek) and Armenia (rivers Kura-Araks basin: the Vorotan, the Voghchi, the Pambak). Collation was done between results of a complex assessment of water quality in mountain rivers obtained employing two indices: SCWPI and CCME WQI and two sets of norms: maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) set for fishery waters and ecological norms, and critical water pollution indices (CPI) and the highest excursive indices, defined. As shown, the river water quality classes by both indices coincide when using ecological norms, whereas difference in assessment results obtained through different methods employing common MAC set for fishery waters is primarily determined by more stringent values of MAC set for heavy metals. As an ultimate result, water quality in the studied rivers is characterized as marginal (the 4th class) for the Malka, the Baksan, the Cherek and the Voghchi and fair (the 3rd class) for the Vorotan and the Pambak. Methodological approaches to river water quality and pollution levels to be developed need to focus primarily on application of ecological (regional) norms or background hydrochemical parameters accounting for natural and climatic peculiarities of river watersheds.

AB  - Urban trails and greenspaces have become ubiquitous features in cities, in part due to their ability to provide ecological benefits to the built-up environment. A major factor in their popularity is their potential to enhance habitat connectivity by bridging the gaps between remnant patches across urbanized areas, however, information on the structure and function of greenways themselves is limited. In this study we examined how greenways serve as distinct habitats in their own right by characterizing the vegetative structure of the Capital Area Greenway (CAG) in Raleigh, NC. We conducted a systematic vegetation survey of woody vegetation along 39 km of trails (354 random plots) in 2016 and identified environmental variables related to site conditions (percent canopy cover, stream proximity, flood zones), management efforts (designated conservation areas), and local anthropogenic activities (percent impervious surface, street proximity). We preformed three types of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA)) to distinguish potential influences on species distribution and community structure. We observed highly diverse riparian, upland mesic, and xeric forest communities within the CAG. Results from NMS and MRPP suggested that vegetation patterns can be differentiated based on local environmental variables. Sites located in conservation areas and floodplains, for instance, were typically found at further distances from streets and were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and higher non-native species richness. Individual study sites were highly diverse and varied even within similar local environments. Our findings indicate that the CAG serves as established natural habitat for native vegetation, supporting the idea that greenways can be used to enhance environmental quality in cities as ecological corridors.

AB  - Magnetic microparticles (MPs) have been recently proposed as innovative and promising dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) adsorbents. However, before using them in a whole-lake restoration project, it is essential to assess their toxicological effects (direct and indirect) on aquatic biota. In the present study we hypothesized that zooplankton community is affected by MPs used for lake restoration. To test our hypothesis we designed a microcosms experiment (n = 15) containing lake water and surface sediment from a hypertrophic lake. Temporal changes (70 days) on physico-chemical conditions and on zooplankton structure (rotifers, copepods and branchiopods) were monitored under different scenarios. In particular, three different treatments were considered: no addition of MPs (control) and MPs addition (1.4 g MPs L-1) on the surface water layer (T-W) and on the sediment (T-S). After 24 h of contact time, MPs were removed with a magnetic rake. A total of 15 zooplankton species (12 rotifers, 1 branchiopod and 2 copepods) were recorded and a high abundance of zooplankton was registered during the experiment for all treatments. No significant differences (RM-ANOVA test; p > 0.05) in total abundance, species richness and species diversity among treatments were found. The absence of any effect of MPs on zooplankton can be explained because MPs did not significantly alter any of its physico-chemical (e.g. temperature, pH, O-2) or biological (e.g. food quantity and quality) drivers. These results confirm the suitability of MPs as a promising tool for removing DIP in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While safe and of high quality, drinking water can host an astounding biodiversity of microorganisms, dismantling the belief of its "biological simplicity." During the very few years, we are witnessing an exponential growth in scientific publications, exploring the ecology hidden in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and drinking water distribution system (DWDS). We focused on what happens to the microbial communities from source water (groundwater) throughout the main steps of the potabilization process of a DWTP, located in an urbanized area in Northern Italy. Samples were processed by a stringent water filtration to retain even the smallest environmental bacteria and then analyzed with High-Throughput DNA Sequencing (HTS) techniques. We showed that carbon filters harbored a microbial community seeding and shaping water microbiota downstream, introducing a significant variation on incoming (groundwater) microbial community. Chlorination did not instantly affect the altered microbiota. We were also able to correctly predict (through machine learning analysis) samples belonging to groundwater (overall accuracy was 0.71), but the assignation was not reliable with carbon filter samples, which were incorrectly predicted as chlorination samples. The presence and abundance of specific microorganisms allowed us to hypothesize their role as indicators. In particular, Candidatus Adlerbacteria (Parcubacteria), together with microorganisms belonging to Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, characterized treated water, but not raw water. An exception, confirming our hypothesis, is given by the samples downstream the filters renewal, which had a composition resembling groundwater. Volatility analysis illustrated how carbon filters represented an ecosystem that is stable over time, probably bearing the environmental conditions that promote the survival and growth of this peculiar microbial community.

AB  - The chironomid community in non-wadeable lotic systems was tested as a source of information in the construction of biological metrics which could be used into the bioassessment protocols of large rivers. In order to achieve this, we simultaneously patterned the chironomid community structure and environmental factors along the catchment of the Danube and Sava River. The Self organizing map (SOM) recognized and visualized three different structural types of chironomid community for different environmental properties, described by means of 7 significant abiotic factors (a multi-stressor gradient). Indicator species analysis revealed that the chironomid taxa most responsible for structural changes significantly varied in their abundance and frequency along the established environmental gradients. Out of 40 biological metrics based on the chironomid community, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), an supervised type of artificial neural network, derived 5 models in which the abundance of Paratrichocladius rufiventis, Orthocladiinae, Cricotopus spp., Cricotopus triannulatus agg. and Cricotopus/Orthocladius ratio achieved a significant relationship (the r Pearson's linear correlation coefficient >0.7) with the multi stressor environment. The sensitivity analysis "partial derivatives" (PaD) method showed that all 5 biological metrics within the multi-stressor gradient were mostly influenced by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Despite short and monotonous environmental gradients and the absence of reference conditions, the chironomid community structure and biological metrics predictably changed along the multistress range, showing a great potential for the bioassessment of large rivers.

AB  - Oxidative stress biomarkers can provide highly relevant insights into the physiological state of an organism. We compared endogenous oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation and glutathione redox status) in the liver and testes as well as the hepatic antioxidant vitamins A and E in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) collected from a reclaimed mine site on the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (northern Alberta, Canada), with those from a non-industrial reference site within the same natural macroregion. Both glutathione redox and vitamin A status in the liver as well as glutathione redox status in the testes were disrupted in mice from the reclaimed site, indicating oxidative stress in these organs. Increased oxidative stress in the liver was associated with greater exposure to Co, Se, and Ti and contributed to poorer body condition and lowered testis size in animals from the reclaimed site (data from companion study). These results confirm health effects and biological costs in this native, sentinel small mammal from exposure to pollutants at the reclaimed mine site. This work provides compelling information and insight into the value of oxidative stress biomarkers as physiological tools that can indicate the health status and fitness of local wild animals. In particular, this approach can be used by risk assessors and other stakeholders from the oil sands region in future environmental risk assessments to improve wildlife management and conservation practices.

AB  - This study assessed the water quality of Mengkuang Reservoir, Penang, Malaysia, by its trophic status according to a Carlson Modified Trophic Index (CMTSI) and by its biological parameters using Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and saprobic index. The study conducted from August 2005 to July 2006 showed that mean values of CMTSI (nutrients), CMTSI (chlorophyll a) and CMTSI (Secchi depth) were 27.18 +/- A 8.73, 40.63 +/- A 7.12 and 41.74 +/- A 6.38, respectively. The mean values of CMTSI indicated that the reservoir was oligotrophic. Mean value of H' was 2.15 bits/individual, showing that the water quality based on H' value was in class III (slightly polluted). Saprobic index value (2.24) also revealed that the reservoir was moderately polluted (class II). The occurrence of Anabaena, Microcystis, Oscillatoria, Nostoc, Dinobryon, Chroococcus, Staurastrum paradoxum and Mallomonas which are indicators of toxic and polluted waters was also recorded. This study therefore showed the importance of phytoplankton composition and community structure as a reliable and important tool to assess the degree of pollution in Mengkuang Reservoir. Long-term assessments of biological and chemical parameters in the reservoir are necessary, and phytoplankton community structure as bioindicator provides unique information about the ecosystem. This information is potentially useful as an early warning sign of deteriorating condition and thus gives insight into the overall ecology of lakes and will assist in the future conservation and management of this lentic ecosystem.

AB  - Water availability is one of the most important factors limiting photosynthetic assimilation of carbon dioxide and growth of individual plants in terrestrial ecosystems. It is especially important for desert shrubs because the diurnal water availability is particularly sensitive to climate change in arid ecosystems. Water use efficiency (WUE) is an indicator of water availability and is frequently used to assess plant performance in various ecosystems, particularly in arid ecosystems. The WUE of plants has been widely assessed using ecological methods and field measurements; however, these approaches are impractical to obtain numerous near-simultaneous estimates of plant water status at the landscape-scale. Consequently, landscape-scale assessments of plant water status are practically pursued through modeling. In this study, measurement and modeling of the diurnal variations of WUE were conducted for a native dominant desert shrub, Tamarix ramosissima, in its original habitat on the periphery of the Gurbantunggut Desert, China. The diurnal net photosynthesis (A(n)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration (T-r) were measured for each individual using a portable photosynthesis system. A coupled model of stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and transpiration was applied to simulate the diurnal dynamics of A(n), g(s), T-r, and WUE. The model explained 83, 47, 83, and 55% of the variance in the measured A(n), g(s), T-r, and WUE values, respectively, for this desert ecosystem in which T. ramosissima is sparsely distributed. The results demonstrated that the coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance-transpiration model strategy is a promising approach to estimate water availability in desert ecosystems in Central Asia.

KW  - VEGETATION
KW  - DISTURBANCE
AB  - Natural vegetation in urban environments is greatly impacted by human activities and it is in constant threat of degradation and destruction as a result of urbanisation. This vegetation, although fragmented, serves an important ecological function and needs to be properly managed and conserved. Studies on urban vegetation are lacking in South Africa, with only a handful having been carried out since the end of the last century. This study was initiated to identify, classify and describe the grassland communities of the urban open spaces in Bloemfontein. Releves were compiled in 61 sample plots, where species present and habitat information were recorded. Care was taken to restrict sample plots to vegetation in pristine condition, wherever possible, and severely degraded stands were avoided. A two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed two distinct major communities, seven communities and four sub-communities. Both detrended and canonical correspondence analyses indicated the vegetation units to be associated with soil texture and pH, although biotic factors such as overgrazing, burning and mowing also influence the composition of the vegetation. The proper management and conservation of urban open spaces requires in-depth knowledge of the spatial distribution, floristic, structural and functional compositions within the major vegetation types in this environment. The present study further contributed towards formulating ways for the proper management, utilisation and functioning of the open spaces within the Bloemfontein area.
   Conservation implications: The Grassland Biome of South Africa is poorly conserved, mainly because of its status as an agricultural hub of the country. The preservation of natural and semi-natural forms of urban vegetation is important because such vegetation, although often disturbed and degraded, could form dispersal corridors between peri-urban and rural vegetation.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves ( 604,832 km(2)) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity ( 75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions ( 15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, ( 5/ 10.3%); environmental units ( 46/ 27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units ( 21/ 22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classiWcations do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine Weld studies with remote sensing.

AB  - This paper describes an integrated methodology for the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS), which may be applied comparatively to rank the eutrophication status of estuaries and coastal areas, and to address management options. It includes quantitative and semi-quantitative components, and uses field data, models and expert knowledge to provide Pressure-State-Response (PSR) indicators.
   A substantial part of the concepts underlying the approach were developed as the United States National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment (NEEA), which was applied to 138 estuaries in the continental United States. The core methodology relies on three diagnostic tools: a heuristic index of pressure (Overall Human Influence), a symptoms-based evaluation of state (Overall Eutrophic Conditions), and an indicator of management response (Definition of Future Outlook).
   Recently, the methodology has been extended and refined in its application to European estuaries, and a more quantitative approach to some of the metrics has been implemented. In particular, the assessment of pressure is carried out by means of simple modeling techniques, comparing anthropogenic nutrient loading with natural background concentrations, and the quantitative criteria for classification of system state based on different symptoms have been refined to improve comparability.
   The present approach has been intercalibrated with the original NEEA work, for five widely different U.S. estuaries (Long Island Sound, Neuse River, Savannah River, Florida Bay and West Mississippi Sound) with good results. ASSETS additionally aims to contribute to the EU Water Framework Directive classification system, as regards a subset of water quality and ecological parameters in transitional and coastal waters.

AB  - Salinity is a major problem in many regions of Australia, and is predicted to get considerably worse over the next 30 - 50 years. Most effort has focused on the terrestrial environment, and specifically on the loss of productive agricultural land. Increased salinity can also result in unwanted changes to aquatic ecosystems in rivers, streams and particularly wetlands.
   This paper first reviews the importance of assessing risks from salinity increases in a catchment context, and then introduces a disturbance - response conceptual model to assist with the understanding of such situations. Two factors are shown to be particularly important in assessing which freshwater systems will be most susceptible to increases in salinity - the location of the systems in the landscape, and the current ecological condition of the system. The resilience of an ecosystem to salinity disturbances is shown to be a useful concept which with further knowledge may be incorporated into risk- assessment approaches.
   The development of a new ecological risk assessment approach for assessing risks to aquatic systems in the Goulburn - Broken catchment from increases in salinity over the medium ( 20 years) and long ( 100 years) term is reported. The risks to the biota in Hughes Creek, a tributary of the Goulburn River, are assessed by using a probabilistic approach. Current salinity levels in the creek present a low risk to the biota.
   Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of making the ecological risk assessment method more quantitative by discussing the following two key aspects: how to better quantify the linkages between the key stressors and the biotic components, and how to better handle uncertainties.

AB  - Introduction: Differing conditions in captive breeding and in the wild have impact on the mineral profile of the pheasant carcass and its heavy metal contents. This may be an indicator of environmental contamination. The study evaluated the nutritional composition and selected macro- and trace element contents (heavy metals in particular) in usable sections of pheasant breast and thigh muscles originating from captive breeding and wild birds. Material and Methods: The tests were performed on the breast and thigh muscles of 20 wild and 20 farm bred birds from around Lublin, Poland, with equal sex representation. The nutrient and lead, cadmium, chromium, and nickel contents were determined using inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Results: The farmed pheasants had a higher proportion of breast muscle. The thigh muscles of all birds had a higher fat content than the breast muscles (5.1 g vs. 3.4 g per kg of natural weight). The macroelement level depended on the muscle type and bird origin. The trace element content also did and gender dependence was also evident. The wild birds contained more cadmium in the breast muscles and lead in both muscles than the farm-raised ones. Conclusion: The high quality and usefulness of wild and farmed pheasant meat is confirmed. It has advantageous macro- and trace element contents and permissible heavy metal contents except for lead in wild birds. The heavy metal level can be a bioindicator of their environmental occurrence. In wild birds, the lead level may also reflect birdshot remnants.

AB  - Human land use activities around estuaries can result in high levels of eutrophication. At Elkhorn Slough estuary, a highly eutrophic California estuary, we investigated the effects of impaired water quality on two stress-tolerant estuarine species, a common fish, the staghorn sculpin, Leptocottus armatus and a foundational invertebrate, the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida. We caged the two indicator species at six wetlands with different levels of water quality impairment, four of which had restricted tidal flow. We also recorded water quality parameters simultaneously at all sites using YSI sondes, and sampled nutrients and chlorophyll-a monthly, building on the National Estuarine Research Reserve System-wide Monitoring Program. We found that the monitored environmental variables predicted ecological responses by the indicator species. In particular, we found that the duration and severity of hypoxia were negatively correlated with fish survival and oyster growth. Further, our results corroborate previous studies that artificial tidal restriction leads to increased hypoxia stress. We conclude that large diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and extended nighttime hypoxia can have lethal and sub-lethal effects even on stress-tolerant organisms in the estuary. While laboratory experiments have often shown such effects, it is relatively rare to demonstrate negative effects of oxygen variation with in situ experiments, which provide stakeholders with concrete evidence for impaired water quality at local wetlands. Tidally restricted sites, which experience the largest fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and longest periods of hypoxia, harbor conditions harmful to vertebrates and invertebrates in the estuary. Reversing the anthropogenically induced low oxygen levels, by restoring more natural tidal exchange and by decreasing agricultural runoff, could improve the survival and growth of important estuarine organisms.

AB  - The article considers mathematical approach to environmental quality management to improve the ecological comfort of living for the population. The problem of environmental management is described using a multi-factor model of quality of the environment with the weight coefficients of the importance of its components: atmospheric air, acoustic impact, soil, water resources, and green spaces, accessibility of natural and recreational areas. The values of weight coefficients of importance of influencing factors for environmentally comfortable living are determined by the method of expert assessment. A multi-factor model is used for detailed assessment of the ecological quality of the urban environment. The proposed quantitative approach also allows to compare the environmental comfort of the different residential districts or to study the dynamics of environmental comfort of specific urban area.
   Much attention is paid to scientific and methodological principles of management and the formation of the concept of "environmental quality". The strategy of environmental management with ecological foundation of various practical solution is shown. The plan of measures on organization of optimal management of quality of the environment to improve comfort of living for the population of the residential microdistrict of Tiraspol is presented. Graphical scheme of the results of integral analysis of various environmental indicators and assessments for improving the comfort of the environment is given.
   Realization of environmental quality management of the urban areas on the basis of a multi-factor model contributes to the gradual change of dangerous ecological conditions of environmental factors, to increase a comfort of the territory taking into account the real preferences and needs of the population.

AB  - In large-scale conservation decisions, scenario planning identifies key uncertainties of ecosystem function linked to ecological drivers affected by management, incorporates ecological feedbacks, and scales up to answer questions robust to alternative futures. Wetland restoration planning requires an understanding of how proposed changes in surface hydrology, water storage, and landscape connectivity affect aquatic animal composition, productivity, and food-web function. In the Florida Everglades, reintroduction of historical hydrologic patterns is expected to increase productivity of all trophic levels. Highly mobile indicator species such as wading birds integrate secondary productivity from aquatic prey (small fishes and crayfish) over the landscape. To evaluate how fish, crayfish, and wading birds may respond to alternative hydrologic restoration plans, we compared predicted small fish density, crayfish density and biomass, and wading bird occurrence for existing conditions to four restoration scenarios that varied water storage and removal of levees and canals (i.e. decompartmentalization). Densities of small fish and occurrence of wading birds are predicted to increase throughout most of the Everglades under all restoration options because of increased flows and connectivity. Full decompartmentalization goes furthest toward recreating hypothesized historical patterns of fish density by draining excess water ponded by levees and hydrating areas that are currently drier than in the past. In contrast, crayfish density declined and species composition shifted under all restoration options because of lengthened hydroperiods (i.e. time of inundation). Under full decompartmentalization, the distribution of increased prey available for wading birds shifted south, closer to historical locations of nesting activity in Everglades National Park.

AB  - Intertidal areas are considered to be productive habitats, but due to the challenging and dynamic environment, in situ assessments of their performance remain scarce. Here, we aimed to quantify the production and turnover of organic material in an intertidal sediment across several consecutive diel/tidal cycles and to evaluate the importance of key drivers affecting the community performance. Time-series measurements of the oxygen (O-2) microdistribution across 2 sites at a silty sandflat documented extreme variability, which was mainly driven by light availability and flow conditions. Diffusion dominated the interstitial solute transport, but advective porewater transport was observed during 15% of the 9 d study period. Photosynthetic activity never exhibited light inhibition and average daytime net photosynthesis ranged between 1.01 and 11.15 mmol m(-2) d(-1) depending on the daily light availability, while the assessed gross primary production was similar to 80% higher. When irradiance exceeded 17.2 mol photons m(-2) d(-1), daytime net autotrophy more than balanced the heterotrophic activity during the night (average night-time respiration, ERn: -4.01 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). However, despite intense primary production, the integrated activity during the target autumn period was net heterotrophic with an average net ecosystem metabolism of -2.21 (span: -7.93 to 1.48) mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1). This study highlights the extreme temporal and spatial variation of intertidal sediments and the importance of accounting for natural in situ dynamics to correctly assess their performance and contribution to system production.

AB  - River flow dynamics play an important role for aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Climate change is projected to significantly alter river flow regimes in Europe and worldwide. In this study, we evaluate future river flow alterations in the entire Danube River basin by means of ecologically relevant river flow indicators under different climate warming scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5). The process-based watershed model SWIM was applied for 1124 sub-catchments to simulate daily time series of river discharge for the Danube River and its tributaries under future scenario conditions. The derived hydrological data series were then statistically analyzed using eight eco-hydrological indicators to distinguish intra-year variations in the streamflow regime. The results are used to: (a) analyze the possible impacts of climate change on the ecologically relevant flow regime components; and (b) identify regions at the highest risk of climate change-driven flow alterations. Our results indicate that climate change will distinctively alter the recent ecological flow regime of the Danube River and, in particular, the tributaries of the Middle and Lower Danube basin. While for the RCP 2.6 scenario the projected flow alterations might still be considered moderate for many rivers, the impacts might strongly accelerate if global mean temperatures rise more than 2 degrees C compared to pre-industrial times. Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 warming scenarios, the recent ecological flow regime might be highly altered, posing a serious threat to river and floodplain ecosystems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate benthic macroinvertebrate communities as bioindicators of water quality in five streams located in the "Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural" (RPPN) Mata Samuel de Paula and its surroundings, in the municipality of Nova Lima near the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. This region has been strongly modified by human activities including mining and urbanization. Samples were collected in the field every three months between August 2004 and November 2005, totaling six samplings in the rainy and dry seasons. This assessment identified one area ecologically altered while the other sampling sites were found to be minimally disturbed systems, with well-preserved ecological conditions. However, according to the Biological Monitoring Work Party (BMWP) and the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) indices, all sampling sites had excellent water quality. A total of 14,952 organisms was collected, belonging to 155 taxa (148 Insecta, two Annelida, one Bivalvia, one Decapoda, one Planariidae, one Hydracarina, and one Entognatha). The most abundant benthic groups were Chironomidae (47.9%), Simuliidae (12.3%), Bivalvia (7.5%), Decapoda (6.1%), Oligochaeta (5.2%), Polycentropodidae (3.7%), Hydropsychidae (2.5%), Calamoceratidae (1.8%), Ceratopogonidae (1.7%), and Libellulidae (1.2%). The assessment of the benthic functional feeding groups showed that 34% of the macroinvertebrates were collector-gatherers, 29% predators, 24% collector-filterers, 8% shredders, and 5% scrapers. The RPPN Mata Samuel de Paula comprises diversified freshwater habitats that are of great importance for the conservation of many benthic taxa that are intolerant to organic pollution.

AB  - Multiple interacting stressors in the environment present increasingly complex risks to human health. Too often, however, the data required for traditional risk assessment are either lacking or unavailable at the necessary spatial or temporal scales. In addition, assessment practices and management policies need to move away from single factors approaches in order to accommodate the reality of complex chemical mixtures and environmental stressors. Recent literature suggests that a paradigm shift is under way and points to the need for the development of new techniques both for rapid data collection and flexible risk assessment strategies that can adapt to make use of readily available data. This paper presents a novel method for population-level risk assessment that uses self-organising feature maps (SOM) to generate multivariate clusters cause-of-death and birth outcome metrics, in combination with the use of supervised learning risk-propagation modelling to identify key factors. We apply this method to identify exposure-outcome linkages at the county level for Wisconsin, USA and civil divisions in Dobrogea, Romania, demonstrating its effectiveness in visualising public health risk relationships with behavioural risk factors (e.g. smoking, heavy drinking) and environmental factors (e.g. land cover, nitrates and faecal coliform in drinking water). These risk relationships do not demonstrate cause-effect, but provide guidance for targeted investigations and for risk-management prioritisation.

AB  - One of the major drawbacks of DNA-based microbial diagnostics is its inability to discriminate between live and dead bacteria. Due to the persistence of DNA in the environment after cells have lost their viability, DNA-based assays cannot assess pathogenic risk since signals can originate from both live and dead cells. Presented here is a potential application of the novel chemical propidium monoazide (PMA), which results in the selective suppression of DNA detection from dead cells. PMA can only penetrate dead cells with permeabilized cell membranes. Upon intercalation into the DNA, covalent crosslinkage of PMA to DNA is achieved through light exposure. This modification prevents the DNA from being amplified by PCR. The method, in combination with quantitative PCR as a diagnostic tool, successfully monitored the disinfection efficacy of hypochlorite, benzalkonium and heat on several model pathogens. Threshold cycle numbers increased with increasing disinfection strength after PMA treatment of samples compared to non-PMA treated samples. With some disinfectant-specific differences, monitoring viability loss with membrane integrity as an indicator seemed to be more conservative than monitoring viability loss with plate counts. Loss of viability after short U-V-exposure could not be monitored with PMA as UV light affects viability by inducing DNA damage without directly affecting membrane permeability.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Detecting human impacts on riverine systems is challenging because of the diverse biological, chemical, hydrological and geophysical components that must be assessed. We briefly review the chemical, biotic, hydrologic and physical habitat assessment approaches commonly used in riverine systems. We then discuss how landscape indicators can be used to assess the status of rivers by quantifying land cover changes in the surrounding catchment, and contrast landscape-level indicators with the more traditionally used approaches. Landscape metrics that describe the amount and arrangement of human-altered land in a catchment provide a direct way to measure human impacts and can be correlated with many traditionally used riverine indicators, such as water chemistry and biotic variables. The spatial pattern of riparian habitats may also be an especially powerful landscape indicator because the variation in length, width, and gaps of riparian buffers influences their effectiveness as nutrient sinks. The width of riparian buffers is also related to the diversity of riparian bird species. Landscape indicators incorporating historical land use may also hold promise for predicting and assessing the status of riverine systems. Importantly, the relationship between an aquatic system attribute and a landscape indicator may be non-linear and thus exhibit threshold responses. This has become especially apparent from landscape indicators quantifying the percent impervious surface (or urban areas) in a watershed, a landscape indicator of hydrologic and geomorphic change.

AB  - Discharge of pollution loads into natural water systems remains a global challenge that threatens water and food supply, as well as endangering ecosystem services. Natural rehabilitation of contaminated streams is mainly influenced by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, or the rate of longitudinal dispersion (D-x), a key parameter with large spatiotemporal fluctuations that characterizes pollution transport. The large uncertainty in estimation of D-x in streams limits the water quality assessment in natural streams and design of water quality enhancement strategies. This study develops an artificial intelligence-based predictive model, coupling granular computing and neural network models (GrC-ANN) to provide robust estimation of D-x and its uncertainty for a range of flow-geometric conditions with high spatiotemporal variability. Uncertainty analysis of D-x estimated from the proposed GrC-ANN model was performed by alteration of the training data used to tune the model. Modified bootstrap method was employed to generate different training patterns through resampling from a global database of tracer experiments in streams with 503 datapoints. Comparison between the D-x values estimated by GrC-ANN to those determined from tracer measurements shows the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed method in determining the rate of longitudinal dispersion. The GrC-ANN model with the narrowest bandwidth of estimated uncertainty (bandwidth-factor = 0.56) that brackets the highest percentage of true D-x data (i.e., 100%) is the best model to compute D-x in streams. Considering the significant inherent uncertainty reported in the previous D-x models, the GrC-ANN model developed in this study is shown to have a robust performance for evaluating pollutant mixing (D-x) in turbulent environmental flow systems.

AB  - It is a difficult task to describe what constitutes a 'healthy' shellfish (e.g., crustacean, bivalve). Visible defects such as discolouration, missing limbs or spines, fouling, lesions, and exoskeletal fractures can be indicative of underlying issues, senescence, or a 'stressed' animal. The absence of such symptoms is not evidence of a diseasefree or a stress-free state. Now, more than ever, aquatic invertebrates must cope with acute and chronic environmental perturbations, such as, heatwaves and cold shocks, xenobiotic contaminants, intoxication events, and promiscuous pathogens expanding their host and geographic ranges. With that in mind, how does one determine the extent to which shellfish become stressed in situ (natural) or in cultured (artificial) settings to enhance disease susceptibility? Many biomarkers - predominantly biochemical and cellular measures of shellfish blood (haemolymph) - are considered to gauge immunosuppression and immunocompetence. Such measures range from immune cell (haemocyte) counts to enzymic activities and metabolite quantitation. Stressed invertebrates often reflect degraded conditions of their ecosystems, referred to as environmental indicators. We audit briefly the broad immune functions of shellfish, how they are modulated by known and emerging stressors, and discuss these concepts with respect to neuroendocrinology and immunotoxicology. We assert that chronic stress, alone or in combination with microbial, chemical and abiotic factors, increases the risk of infectious disease in shellfish, exacerbates idiopathic morbidity, and reduces the likelihood of recovery. Acute stress events can lead to immunomodulation, but these effects are largely transient. Enhancing our understanding of shellfish health and immunity is imperative for tackling losses at each stage of the aquatic food cycle and disease outbreaks in the wild.

AB  - Mediterranean peatlands remain largely under-documented, except for detailed biological data such as fauna and flora taxa lists, and yet are increasingly threatened by water withdrawal and agriculture practices. This lack of information, particularly on their hydrogeological functioning, makes it impossible to evaluate their response to changing climate conditions. A pilot study on a representative Mediterranean peatland on the island of Corsica (France) was conducted to evaluate recharge modalities in the peatland using a coupled water-level monitoring, geochemical and isotope multi-tracing approach (electric conductivity, major ions, delta O-18, delta H-2, H-3, Sr-87/Sr-86). The goal was to understand how water budgets in peatland ecosystems were maintained throughout the year, especially during the summer. Despite the remarkable stability of the peatland water level, the recharge contributions of varied water bodies through an alluvial aquifer vary significantly from one season to another. An endmember mixing analysis (EMMA) indicates that the peatland is mainly recharged by an alluvial aquifer. During fall-winter, the alluvial aquifer on which the peatland depends is recharged by the rainfall, a river, and shallow groundwater (colluvium). During spring-summer, water supply is provided mostly by a river, shallow, and deep groundwater (fractured granite). However, this specific hydrogeological functioning is not taken into account by environmental management policies making peatlands vulnerable to anthropogenic and climatic pressures. Thus, their actual status regarding water and aquatic environment management policies is discussed to provide recommendations for better consideration and preservation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water temperature is a controlling indicator of river habitat since many physical, chemical and biological processes in rivers are temperature dependent. Highly precise and reliable predictions of water temperature are important for river ecological management. In this study, a hybrid model named BP_PSO3, based on the BPNN (back propagation neural network) optimized by the PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm, is proposed for water temperature prediction using air temperature (Ta), discharge (Q) and day of year (DOY) as input variables. The performance of the BP_PSO3 model was compared with that of the BP_PSO1 (with Ta as the input) and BP_PSO2 (with Ta and Q as the inputs) models to evaluate the importance of the inputs. In addition, a comparison among the BPNN, RBFNN (radial basis function neural network), WNN (wavelet neural network), GRNN (general regression neural network), ELMNN (Elman neural network), and BP_PSO-based models was carried out based on the MAE, RMSE, NSE and R-2. The eight artificial intelligence models were examined to predict the water temperature at the Cuntan and Datong stations in the Yangtze River. The results indicated that the hybrid BPNN-PSO3 model had a stronger ability to forecast water temperature under both normal and extreme drought conditions. Optimization by the PSO algorithm and the inclusion of Q and DOY could help capture river thermal dynamics more accurately. The findings of this study could provide scientific references for river water temperature fore-casting and river ecosystem protection. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water is an important receptor of environmental problems generated by anthropogenic activities, the water quality being affected by their magnitude and impact as well as by climate change. Given the international and cross-border nature of the Danube River and being aware that the pollution risk assessment is one of the key elements of the ecology and health of the people in its region, this paper assessed the state of water quality in the Lower Danube River in accordance with Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). The intensive monitoring program applied by the National Institute for Research and Development in Environmental Protection (INCDPM) took place during the period 2011-2017, in which approximately 1500 samples were taken and processed from 10 monitoring sites and the quality indicators stipulated in M.O. 161/2006 were analysed according to the standards in force. In this monitoring area (km 375-km 175), hydrotechnical works have been done in order to improve navigation conditions. Therefore, on the basis of the data obtained from the monitoring campaigns, multivariate statistical methods of water quality assessment were applied on the complex set of data, and at the same time, the multiparametric quality index (ICPM) was applied, an index of global comparative assessment of water quality over historical trends, developed by INCDPM. Following the evaluation of the results, the water quality in the Lower Danube River was characterized as moderately polluted and corresponds to Class III of surface water quality. The ecosystem approach indicates that the values of the monitored indicators did not correspond to the target values according to the Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Aerially transported contaminants from the industrial development of the bituminous sands in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of western Canada may threaten the water quality and community structure of the region's lakes. This environmental threat is further compounded by the region's changing climate (i.e. increased temperatures and reduced moisture). Because environmental monitoring began 30 years after the initiation of the region's bitumen-based industry ( 1967), a paleolimnological approach is required to document pre-disturbance conditions and to determine how lakes have changed, if at all, in response to environmental stressors. Our bottom-top (before and after) study of dated sediment records compared pre-disturbance ( 1850) and modern subfossil diatom assemblages from 18 shallow, isolated lakes (which are typical of the region), located along a spatial gradient (up to 110 km) relative to the main area of local industry. Despite the region's substantial environmental stressors, the changes in mostly benthic-dominated diatom communities were minor at 15 of the 18 lakes. We conclude that the muted biological responses may be a consequence of naturally high nutrient concentrations and/or the typically subtle nature of changes in assemblages dominated by benthic generalist taxa. At all sites, including three lakes with marked changes, we found no evidence of a diatom assemblage response to airborne inputs of contaminants (i.e. dibenzothiophenes) and nutrients (i.e. bioavailable nitrogen) from the AOSR industry. Instead, it is likely that regional warming played a role in the modest diatom assemblage changes observed in these shallow lakes, with responses mediated by lake-specific characteristics.

AB  - Ecosystems provide a variety of ecosystem services (ES), which act as key linkages between social and ecological systems. ES respond spatially and temporally to abiotic and biotic variation, and to management. Thus, resistant and resilient ES provision is expected to remain within a stable range when facing disturbances. In this study, generic indicators to evaluate resistance, potential resilience and capacity for transformation of ES provision are developed and their relevance demonstrated for a mountain grassland system. Indicators are based on plant trait composition (i.e. functional composition) and abiotic paramters determining ES provision at community, meta-community and landscape scales. First the resistance of an ES is indicated by its normal operating range characterized by observed values under current conditions. Second its resilience is assessed by its potential operating range - under hypotheses of reassembly from the community's species pool. Third its transformation potential is assessed for reassembly at meta community and landscape scales. Using a state-and-transition model, possible management-related transitions between mountain grassland states were identified, and indicators calculated for two provisioning and two regulating ES. Overall, resilience properties varied across individual ES, supporting a focus on resilience of specific ES. The resilience potential of the two provisioning services was greater than for the two regulating services, both being linked to functional complementarity within communities. We also found high transformation potential reflecting functional redundancy among communities within each meta-community, and across meta-communities in the landscape. Presented indicators are promising for the projection of future ES provision and the identification of management options under environmental change. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Pampas biome is a subtropical-temperate grassland region that presents striking climatic characteristics, such as temperatures below zero in the winters and up to 40 degrees C in the summers. Hence, long sampling periods are necessary to better understand the structure of Drosophilidae assemblages through current climatic conditions in the heterogeneous landscape of the Pampas. Samples of drosophilids were taken in natural and urban areas during 12 climatic periods. The environmental influence on the structure of assemblages was temporally and spatially analyzed through nonmetric multidimensional scaling, indicator value, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) the structure of drosophilids assemblages vary through different habitats from the same area, and 2) the presence and abundance of Drosophilidae species in a particular environment is regulated by the interaction between the phytophysionomy and climatic traits of each locality. The Pampas assemblages were dominated by a few species, although it is a highly diverse biome with regards to Drosophilidae. The environmental heterogeneity was confirmed as a determinant factor of the structure of assemblages, and it explained 8.86% of the assemblage composition. Nonetheless, the interaction between temperature and humidity was revealed as the most influential environmental component of the Drosophilidae assemblages, and it explained 37.28% of all the recorded variation. Together, environment type and the climatic elements were able to explain 56.45% of the assemblages' variation. Open and close environments, such as grassland and forest patches, respectively, presented a peculiar composition of Drosophilidae assemblages and should be equally considered in the Pampas preservation strategies.

AB  - The assessment of environmental vulnerability is a sound basis for environmental management measures because it provides an objective standard for the priorities for implementation. Although several methods have been used by international agencies to assess and compare national environmental vulnerabilities, relatively few methodologies have been proposed to assess vulnerability on the local scale. In this study, we developed a methodology to assess the environmental vulnerability of a coastal city, with the goal of overcoming the limitations of a previous method that compared countries' vulnerabilities on a global scale. We applied this methodology to Jakarta, Indonesia, to identify its utility in providing a basis for the development of environmental policy measures. We assessed the relative environmental vulnerabilities of Jakarta's five districts, using a conceptual diagram composed of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For environmental exposure, we considered inundation due to heavy rainstorm, flood from sea level rise, and environmental pollution. For sensitivity, sectors of human and natural systems were considered using a land cover map from GIS data. To examine adaptive capacity, we addressed environmental awareness, policy foundation, economic status, and infrastructure. The assessment results showed that the East and North districts are more vulnerable than other districts. We suggested environmental policy measures for each district using radial graphs that show the dominant indicators within the composite index. Our proposed methodology has a significant relevance in the sense that it extracts key indicators of environmental vulnerability by considering local conditions, and provides a useful tool to compare results within a vulnerability assessment and to inform appropriate environmental policy measures.

AB  - Lake sediment records from three lakes in the South Island of New Zealand were examined to determine the effects of human (Maori and European) impacts on the lake catchments during the Late Holocene. Major changes in lake biota occurred in the Early to Middle Holocene (11,000-6000 cal. yr BP), but there were no major changes between c. 6000 cal. yr BP and the time of human impact. Intensive Maori forest clearance occurred here between c. ad 1200 and 1600, which is consistent with other New Zealand records. Catchment erosion and increased sedimentation probably occurred in all of the studied lakes, but the most obvious changes occurred in Lake Clearwater and the Maori Lakes. There was evidence for gravity-induced slumping of the littoral sediments in Lake Clearwater due to increased sediment loading, and the outflow from the Maori Lakes was blocked by a migrating alluvial fan. The erosion of sediment (and nutrients) from the lake catchments led to eutrophication, but increases in lake depth were just as important in two of the lakes. Increased water depth was caused by damming of the Maori lakes outflow by a migrating alluvial fan. Reduced evapotranspiration following deforestation would also have led to increased water yield in lake catchments. European impacts were minor compared with the impacts of Maori deforestation, and all lakes display different levels of recovery towards pre-human impact conditions. Complete recovery is prevented by permanent changes in catchment hydrology and probable internal feedback mechanism such as wind-induced sediment re-suspension in the larger lakes.

AB  - Nematode biomass and allometric attributes (size spectra, body length and width, morphotypes) were measured and related to the environmental quality of sediments of the Genoa-Voltri commercial harbour (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean) to investigate their possible use as ecological indicators. The sediment quality was defined by measuring the level of organic enrichment (quantity and biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter) and oxygen stress (redox potential).
   Nematode biomass spectra (NBS) proved to be extremely valuable in determining differences in the environmental quality of sediments on a hundred-metre spatial scale. High peaks of the NBS were observed in the more organic-rich and oxygen-stressed stations probably in relation to a lower diversity of the nematode communities in these stations, with the predominance of tolerant genera such as Paracomesoma and Sabatieria. Among allometric variables, the length was found to be negatively correlated with oxygen concentrations and positively with TOM percentages, whilst the morphotype length/width ratio (L/W) resulted negatively related to oxygen concentrations and organic matter quality (protein:carbohydrate ratio), suggesting that these allometric attributes represent indicators of the functional adaptation of nematodes to the changing environmental conditions.
   We suggest that in contrast to time-consuming and expertise-requiring nematode taxonomic analysis, biomass and allometric attributes analysis can provide a simpler but comparable tool to assess sediment quality and environmental heterogeneity of harbour ecosystems.

AB  - Although research on population carrying capacity has made significant progress, research on urban carrying capacity still has a weak theoretical basis and uses, imperfect regulation mechanisms and estimation methods. This study proposes a new method for evaluating urban population carrying capacity based on spatial analysis with GIS, which utilizes spatial classification and spatial grading of land use. The results demonstrate that urban construction and industrial development subspaces have most of the population, accounting for about 86.4% of the total population carrying capacity, across 40.7% of the total land area. Therefore, urban construction and industrial development subspaces are the centers of the population concentration, industrial agglomeration and wealth concentration in the Shanghai metropolis. The agricultural production and ecological protection subspaces, as noncommercial and ecological conservation areas of the metropolis, should not carry too much industrial development or added-value activities. In addition, under the current conditions of socio-economic and technological development in China, the gross population carrying capacity of Shanghai is estimated to be about 27.1732-30.3308 million persons, based on 2009 data. The actual population of Shanghai was 22.1028 million persons in 2009; thus, the population can continue to grow before reaching the population carrying capacity. The estimation in this paper takes into account both the internal disparities in carrying capacity of heterogeneous land spaces and composite factors such as natural resources, the environment, economic resources and social resources. Consequently, this method not only addresses defects in the existing research and estimation methods but also improves the credibility of the estimate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a gradient analysis of 620 vegetation samples covering most of the floristic and environmental variation in semi-natural grassland vegetation on well-drained soils in Denmark. Vegetation was sampled using frequency in subplots. Explanatory variables were surface inclination, aspect, pH, geographical co-ordinates together with indications of soil type. Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed four floristic gradients that could be interpreted in ecological terms by measured variables supplemented with site calibrations based on weighted averaging of Ellenberg's indicator values. All four axes were interpreted using rank correlation statistics, and linear and non-linear multiple regression of sample scores on explanatory variables. The first gradient was from dry calcareous to humid acidic grasslands; the second reflected an underlying gradient in fertility; the third reflected regional differentiation and the fourth was associated with variation in intensity of competition as indicated by association with calibrated Grime-CSR values for the plots. We applied subset ordination to the data as a supplement to traditional permutation and correlation statistics to assess the consistency of ordination results. DCA axes 1 and 2 were consistent in space and time.
   This gradient analysis is discussed in a context of plant strategy theory and species diversity models. Ecocline patterns lend support to the view that grazing not only favours the ruderal strategy but also the stress-tolerant strategy. The low rank of competition as an explanatory variable for the floristical gradients supports the notion that competitive effects play a subordinate role for species composition compared to microclimate and soil conditions in infertile semi-natural grasslands.

T2  - EVOLUTION
LA  - English
AB  - The norm of reaction, the set of average phenotypes produced by a genotype in different environments, can be affected by spatial variation in natural selection especially when there exists genotype-environment interaction. In subdivided populations, the greater the genotype-environment interaction variance and the lower the migration rate, the more independent are the possible evolutionary trajectories for local adaptation. I examined genotype-environment interaction in the rate of population increase for lineages randomly derived from a wild population of Tribolium castaneum across a series of ecologically important environments. The lineages were derived from an outbred, wild-caught population by 14 generations of random genetic drift, during which the effective size of each lineage was approximately 22 breeding adults. The environments studied were the classic temperature-wet and cold-dry climates of Park (1954) in factorial combination with two genetic strains of a congeneric competitor, T. confusum. Much among-lineage genetic variation for rate of population increase was found for each of these ecologically important environments of climate and competition. Genotype-environment interaction accounted for 40.5% of the total among-lineage variance in rate of population increase signifying that the performance of a lineage in one environment is not necessarily a good predictor of its performance in another. Changing the genetic identity of the competitor changed the rate of increase of some lineages as much or more than changing the climatic conditions of temperature and humidity. This is the first empirical study to characterize the genotype-environment interaction variance associated with genetic variation in a competing congeneric-species. This competitor-specific genetic variation in competitive ability may play an important role in coevolution in subdivided populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Non-invasive determination of cortisol metabolite concentrations in feces is widely used to evaluate the influence of housing and handling conditions on the stress physiology of wildlife in captivity. The present study aimed to assess the physiological response of a lion pride to a change in management and social conditions after the death of the dominant male of the pride. Before the dominant male died, weekly management routines between the indoor and outdoor enclosures were conducted to avoid cohabitation problems between the two males of the pride. After the death of the dominant male, these weekly management dynamics ceased, leading to a decrease in the daily management routine of the lion pride. An individualized sampling of the animals through the utilization of indigestive markers was conducted, and fecal samples were collected before and after the death of the dominant male. Significant lower cortisol metabolite concentrations in feces were detected after the death of the dominant male, suggesting a positive impact of a decrease in daily management routines, together with a more stable social environment. In addition, assessment of individualized hormone concentrations throughout the study revealed variable physiological responses among lions, providing evidence of the importance of monitoring hormonal profiles individually. Monitoring the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through determination of fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) levels is a non-invasive method useful for understanding how handling and social conditions may affect the physiological status of zoo animals. The present study used FCM analysis to evaluate whether the HPA axis activity of a lion pride was modified by a change in social and handling conditions after the death of the dominant male. Five African lions (Panthera leo bleyenberghi), two males and three females, were included in the study. Fecal samples were collected before and after the death of the dominant male. To avoid cohabitation conflicts between males before the dominant male died, subgroups were established and subjected to weekly changes between indoor and outdoor facilities. After the death of the dominant male, these management dynamics ceased, and the remaining four lions were kept together outdoors. Significant lower group FCM concentrations (p < 0.001) were detected after the decease of the dominant male, probably associated with a decrease in daily handling, together with a more stable social environment. Overall, the present study indicates the effect of different management scenarios on the HPA axis activity and differentiated physiological responses to the same situation between individuals.

AB  - Beijing, as the capital of China, still has soil pollution problems that cannot be ignored. However, there are few studies on the overall ecological risks of heavy metals in farmland soils in Beijing. This study selected 432 soils and crops heavy metal content data of eight districts in Beijing from academic papers and academic journal papers. In this study, the improved Hakanson method, improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and integrated quality impact index (IICQ) comprehensively were used to evaluate the impact of Pb, As, and Cd pollution on the farmland soil environment, and the applicable conditions of these methods were discussed. The results by improved Hakanson method showed that both Pb and As were at the normal ecological risk level, while Cd was the largest contributor to potential ecological risk which accounted for 72.54% of the total risk and is mainly at a moderate ecological risk level. The analysis by improved AHP showed that the average comprehensive index of soil heavy metal pollution in the study area was 0.2317, which was at a light pollution level. The IICQ of soil and agricultural products were between 0 and 1 demonstrating that the soil was clean. In summary, the pollution of heavy metals Pb, As, and Cd in the study area is at a relatively low level, and there is no significant risk to the surrounding environment and human health. IICQ method is suitable for the evaluation of soil heavy metal composition and individual impact and can be more accurately used for the overall ecological evaluation of soil-crop-human health system.

AB  - Tropical coastal wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services that are closely associated withmicrobially-driven biogeochemical processes. Knowledge of the main players and their drivers in those processes can have huge implications on the carbon and nutrient fluxes in wetland soils, and thus on the ecosystems services we derive from them. Here, we collected surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (20-25 cm) soil samples along a transect from forested freshwater wetlands, to saltmarsh, andmangroves. For each sample, wemeasured a range of abiotic properties and characterised the diversity of bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The alpha diversity of bacterial communities in mangroves exceeded that of freshwater wetlands, which were dominated by members of the Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, and associated with high soil pore-water concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorous, and nitrogen as nitrate and nitrite (N-NOX-). Bacterial communities in the saltmarsh were strongly stratified by depth and included members of the Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Deltaproteobacteria. Finally, the mangroves were dominated by representatives of Deltaproteobacteria, mainly Desulfobacteraceae and Synthrophobacteraceae, and were associated with high salinity and soil pore-water concentrations of ammonium (N-NH4+). These communities suggest methane consumption in freshwater wetlands, and sulfate reduction in deep soils of marshes and in mangroves. Ourwork contributes to the important goal of describing reference conditions for specific wetlands in terms of both bacterial communities and their drivers. This information may be used to monitor change and assess wetland health and function. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A plant life-form in a particular ecosystem is the sum of its all life processes and evolved directly in response to the prevailing environment. It is considered as a potential indicator of phytoclimatic conditions of the ecosystem in which it populates. The spatial distribution patterns of life-forms vary from one ecosystem to another due to variation in the environmental gradients. The present study was aimed to assess the distribution patterns of different life-forms along the altitudinal gradients in the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) situated in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh (Western Himalaya, India). We prepared a checklist of flowering plants of the park (945 taxa, 470 genera, 188 families) using both primary (field surveys) and secondary data (earlier published literature) sources. The entire altitudinal range was classified into seven altitude classes. The presence/absence (1/0) species data matrix was prepared using local altitudinal distribution range of each species to investigate the similarity in species composition and patterns of life-forms across the seven altitudinal classes. The Cluster analysis classified the seven altitudinal classes into four distinct plant communities at different altitudes. Maximum similarity (43.77%) in species composition was recorded between 3000-3500 m and 3500-4000 m altitude classes. In terms of number of species, Asteraceae (101 taxa) and Potentilla (11 taxa) revealed as dominant family and genus respectively. The species richness peaks at middle altitude (1500-3000 m) in the GHNP. The phytoclimate of GHNP can be termed as 'phanero-therophytic' (<1500 m), 'thero-phanerophytic' (1500-3000 m) 'thero-hemicryptophytic' (3000-4000 m) and 'crypto-hemicryptophytic' (>4000 m) at different altitudes.

AB  - Mountain catchments provide for the livelihood of more than half of humankind, and have become a key destination for tourist and recreation activities globally. Mountain ecosystems are generally considered to be less complex and less species diverse due to the harsh environmental conditions. As such, they are also more sensitive to the various impacts of the Anthropocene. For this reason, mountain regions may serve as sentinels of change and provide ideal ecosystems for studying climate and global change impacts on biodiversity. We here review different facets of anthropogenic impacts on mountain freshwater ecosystems. We put particular focus on micropollutants and their distribution and redistribution due to hydrological extremes, their direct influence on water quality and their indirect influence on ecosystem health via changes of freshwater species and their interactions. We show that those changes may drive pathogen establishment in new environments with harmful consequences for freshwater species, but also for the human population. Based on the reviewed literature, we recommend reconstructing the recent past of anthropogenic impact through sediment analyses, to focus efforts on small, but highly productive waterbodies, and to collect data on the occurrence and variability of microorganisms, biofilms, plankton species and key species, such as amphibians due to their bioindicator value for ecosystem health and water quality.

AB  - Marl prairie, a diverse graminoid-dominated freshwater vegetation community in the Florida Everglades, provides a specialized niche for the federally endangered Cape Sable seaside sparrow (CSSS). This paper describes a regional habitat suitability modeling approach to evaluating how changes in management from Everglades restoration may affect the CSSS. The Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow Marl Prairie Indicator (CSSSMarlPrairie) is a spatially explicit model that integrates frequency (return periods) of target hydrologic conditions to simulate the anticipated response of marl prairie CSSS habitats to fluxing hydropatterns resulting from restoration projects, water management operations, and climatic change. The model integrates CSSS field survey data with the hydrologic targets at the resolution of the hydrologic simulation model (in this case, the Regional Simulation Model). The application of return periods for hydrologic events provides a novel approach for simulation of anticipated marl prairie responses in the southern Everglades and is readily applicable to evaluating targets-of modeled wetland restoration scenarios elsewhere. CSSSMarlPrairie is intended to be used for decision support, in association with a suite of ecological models for additional species of management concern, to facilitate planning of ecosystem restoration projects such as those in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and recovery of the marl prairie habitats of the CSSS. A tentatively selected restoration plan for the central Everglades is projected to have mostly minor overall impacts to marl prairie CSSS habitats. Local substantial habitat shifts in and adjacent to designated habitat boundaries have been identified, however, that warrant management consideration. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ecological indicators can be used to assess the condition of the environment, to provide an early warning signal of changes in the surrounding environment or to diagnose the causes of an environmental problem. The study aims to evaluate the applicability of a common foliose lichen Pyxine cocoes (Sw.) Nyl., as an indicator to evaluate the arsenic and heavy metal rich sites. The naturally growing lichen and its substratum (bark) were utilized to biomonitor the accumulation of arsenic (As) and other heavy metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) in Chinsurah, a highly As contaminated area of West Bengal. Significantly higher levels of Al, Cr, Fe, Pb and Zn (p < 0.01), Cd and Cu (p < 0.05) were found in the lichens especially in samples collected from road sites. Higher As concentration (48.1 +/- 2.1 mu g g(-1)) in samples were found near the paddy field, indicating pesticide-herbicides as its source used in agriculture. The substrate exhibits lower concentration of most of the metals while Cr, Cd and Pb were below detection limit. As evident from the bioaccumulation factor most of the metals accumulated in lichen thallus are air borne. Chl a and Chl b concentrations decreased significantly with increasing distance from roadside whereas the carotenoid and protein showed an enhanced level. The chlorophyll stability index, chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid contents were found to be the most sensitive parameters to assess the vitality of lichen thallus against changing environment.

AB  - Carpathian pine growth at its natural range limit, where small hydroclimatic fluctuations are indicated by tree-ring width anomalies, may provide insight into past ecological responses to climatic changes. Tree-ring chronologies from extreme cliff sites may also contain annually resolved and accurately dated information to facilitate the development of palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Complex and spatiotemporally inconsistent relationships between biotic and abiotic factors, however, often complicate our understanding of forest growth dynamics. In this study, we utilized a novel ensemble approach of 3240 growth-climate interactions to evaluate the likelihood of temporal fluctuations in the hydroclimatic sensitivity of three newly developed tree-ring width chronologies from 515 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The data represent undisturbed cliff habitats across the northwestern Carpathian arc between 700 and 1050 m asl. These sites are located in the northern (N) and southern (S) Tatra Mountains and in-between (M). Two sites (N, S) share common interannual to multi-decadal ring width variability (r = 0.73), and they significantly capture variations in 20th-century summer drought conditions (r = 0.52-0.65). Temporal instability in the growth-climate response, however, occurred in all three tree-ring chronologies, thus challenging any possible palaeoclimatic value. Orographic-induced climatology was found to dominate the observed growth-climate inconsistency, whereas age-related physiological mechanisms and differences in the absolute growth levels of the trees, as well as methodological standardization constraints and seasonal climate differences appeared to be less important. Our results suggest that environmental and ecological site criteria should be routinely supplemented by statistical data assessments prior to employing tree-ring chronologies for climate reconstructions.

AB  - Gene flow between related plant species, and between transgenic and non-transgenic crop varieties, may be considered a form of biological invasion. Brassica napus (oilseed rape or canola) and its relatives are well known for intra- and inter-specific gene flow, hybridisation and weediness. Gene flow associated with B. napus poses a potential ecological risk in the Fynbos Biome of South Africa, because of the existence of both naturalised (alien, weedy) and native relatives in this region. This risk is particularly pertinent given the proposed use of B. napus for biofuel and the potential future introduction of herbicide-tolerant transgenic B. napus. Here we quantity the presence and co-occurrence of B. napus and its wild and weedy relatives in the Fynbos Biome, as a first step in the ecological risk assessment for this crop. Several alien and at least one native relative of B. napus were found to be prevalent in the region, and to be spatially congruent with B. napus fields. The first requirement for potential gene flow to occur has thus been met. In addition, a number of these species have elsewhere been found to be reproductively compatible with B. napus. Further assessment of the potential ecological risks associated with B. napus in South Africa is constrained by uncertainties in the phylogeny of the Brassicaceae, difficulties with morphology-based identification, and poor knowledge of the biology of several of the species involved, particularly under South African conditions.

AB  - With 2% of the world's forests and 17% of Canada's forested land, Ontario plays a major role in maintaining Canada's forests and managing them sustainably. Ontario is developing a set of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) to aid in conservation and sustainable management of its temperate and boreal (BO) forests. The criteria and indicators are intended to provide a framework for describing and assessing processes of SFM at a regional scale; and to improve the information available to the public and decision-makers. This paper describes three ecological indicators, evaluated using a carbon (C) budget model, a forest inventory database, and disturbance records to assess long-term sustainability of Ontario's forest ecosystems based on the environmental conditions of the past 70 years. Results suggest that total net primary productivity (NPP) of Ontario's forest ecosystems increased from 1925 to 1975 and then decreased between 1975 and 1990; Ontario's forest ecosystems acted as a C sink between 1920 and 1980, and a C source from 1981 to 1990, mainly due to decreased average forest age and NPP caused by increased ecosystem disturbance (e.g. fire, insect and disease infestations, harvesting) since 1975. Current estimates from this analysis suggest that there is significant potential for Ontario's forests to function as C sinks by reducing ecosystem disturbances and increasing growth and storage of C in the young forests throughout the province.

AB  - Ciguatera (fish poisoning) is the most frequent cause of human illness caused by ingestion of marine toxins. The toxins are ingested by herbivorous fish which feed on marine algae and are then passed up the food chain to humans eating reef fish. We have used a unique database of reported fish poisoning cases in the South Pacific islands to investigate the relationship between fish poisoning and El Nino Southern Oscillation, a periodic disruption of global climate that is associated with marked changes in rainfall, temperatures, and ocean currents. This provides an opportunity to study the effects of a strong climate signal on a sensitive ecosystem in a region that has been less subject to local human disturbance than most others. Using a mixed ecological study design, we calculated correlations between reports of fish poisoning in individual Pacific Islands, estimates of local sea surface temperature, and the Southern Oscillation Index. Strong positive correlations between the annual incidence of fish poisoning and local warming of the sea surface were found in a group of islands which experience warming during EI Nino conditions. In another group of islands, which experience cooling of the sea surface during El Nino events, there were weaker negative correlations between fish poisoning and local sea surface temperature. The results are consistent with other evidence suggesting a close interdependence of marine ecosystems and climate. Increases in ciguatera may result if the climate continues to warm as a result of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Coral reefs have been under increasing pressure from human populations in recent years; ciguatera may be a sensitive indicator of environmental disturbance in tropical marine ecosystems.

AB  - The patchy nature of landscapes drives variation in the extent of ecological processes across space. This spatial ecology is critical to our understanding of organism-environmental interactions and conservation, restoration, and resource management efforts. In fisheries, incorporation of the spatial ecology of fishes remains limited, despite its importance to fishery assessment and management. This study quantified the effects of variation in headwater river stage, as an indicator of freshwater inflow, on the distribution and movement of a valuable recreational fishery species in Florida, common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). The hypothesis tested was that variation in river stage caused important habitat shifts and changes in the movement behavior of Snook. A combination of electrofishing and acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the distribution and movement patterns of snook in the upper Shark River Estuary, Everglades National Park. Negative relationships with river stage were found for all three variables measured: electrofishing catch per unit effort, the proportion of detections by upstream acoustic receivers, and movement rates. Snook were up to 5.8 times more abundant, were detected 2.3 times more frequently, and moved up to 4 times faster at lower river stages associated with seasonal drawdowns in water level. These findings show how seasonal drawdowns result in local aggregations of consumers, largely driven by improved foraging opportunities, and emphasize the importance of maintaining the natural variance in managed hydrological regimes. Results also highlight the importance of understanding the nature of flow-ecology relationships, especially given projected changes in freshwater availability with climate change.

Resorting to topography, climate and land-use data, a semi-distributed hydrological model (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN) was run in order to simulate the hydrological cycle of the river and its tributaries. The model was calibrated over a 25-year period and validated within a 31-year period. Its performance was verified by comparing the recorded and simulated daily flows. The values of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency of 0.95 and 0.76, and coefficient of determination of 0.95 and 0.82, were achieved for calibration and validation, respectively, thus showing a quite satisfactory model performance. Subsequently, the climate change impacts on temperature and precipitation, as well as their extremes, and on the flowrates were also assessed for a future period (2041-2070) under two anthropogenic forcing scenarios (representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5). A procedure for selecting the most relevant metrics for assessing the ecological condition of the Paiva River was developed based upon a set of 52 invertebrate families sampled. Correspondence analyses were carried out for biological datasets (traits/metrics) with physicochemical and land use/land cover matrices separately. Out of all variables, water quality and flow and agriculture land use explained most of the variance observed. The integrated analysis undertaken in the present study is an important advance when compared to previous studies and it provides key information to stakeholders and decision-makers, particularly when planning suitable adaptation measures to cope with changing climates in the forthcoming decades.

AB  - The tropical Southeast Asia area is rich in plant diversity, and the current environment conditions, especially the vegetation, were formed through a series of complicated processes, both geological and biological, in the past. One of the most powerful tools to reveal these processes is pollen analysis. However, so far, it is still poorly understood in the modern pollen rain, hindering further palynological exploration of ecological and environmental evolutions in the region. Here we analyzed 84 surface pollen samples from the western Malay Peninsula and illustrated a high level of pollen and spore diversity by photographic images of 328 types. The results also revealed that all the regional vegetation types are distinguished by a few major characteristic pollen and spore types in the assemblages. For montane rainforests, Podocarpaceae, Ericaceae, cf. Distichostemon, Borreria, Myrica, Rapanea, Ophioglossaceae and Ilex type1 are characteristic. For lowland dipterocarp rainforests, Bursaraceae, Sapotaceae, Mallotus/Macaranga, Eugeissona, Anacardiaceae, Asystasia, Ilex type2/3, Hamamelidaceae, Dicranopteris, etc. are good indicators. The coastal rainforests are distinguished by relatively abundant Casuarina, cf. Pittosporum, Styracaceae, Ulmus, Alstonia and Schoutenia, and the mangrove forest by abundant Rhizophora, Sonneratiaceae, Xylocarpus and Lygodiaceae. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) of pollen percentages shows strong correlations of plant communities with the distribution elevation and the substrate gradients. Our results demonstrate the potential for detailed paleoecological reconstructions of both montane and lowland communities in the study region, and also suggest a pollen sorting of marine samples after a long-distance transport to the deposition sites.

AB  - The spatial distribution and species richness of ichthyoplankton have been investigated using samples from two commercially important fishing areas of the North Aegean Sea (Thermaikos and Chalkidiki Gulfs, East Mediterranean Sea) in June 2004, 2005 and 2006. A total of 62 taxa were identified in this study something which is in agreement with other relevant studies of a wider spatial scale in the East and West Mediterranean Sea. The horizontal distribution of fish larvae was spatially segregated. Epipelagic, mesopelagic and demersal taxa occupied different geographical areas. Species richness and larvae abundance were significantly positively correlated with depth. Three ecological indicators, total taxa abundance, species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity, were used to measure the diversity of the two areas. The relationship between environment and ichthyoplankton was tested with permutational multivariate analysis of variance using seven environmental factors as predictors. Topography and the physicochemical factors salinity and depth-integrated chlorophyll-a constitute the main factors affecting species richness of our study area. Analysis of similarities showed significant differences between the biocommunities in the span of the three years. The Chalkidiki area showed higher species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity than the Thermaikos area, something, which is probably due to the different characteristics of water masses and also due to the variety of benthic habitats that Chalkidiki offers. Notably, in the Thermaikos Gulf, European anchovy and Round sardinella exhibited a strong domination pattern while mesopelagic larvae abundance and occurrence was higher at the deeper Chalkidiki area. Physicochemical parameters affected biodiversity by creating favorable conditions for adult spawning.

AB  - Biomonitoring has become a useful tool in environmental risk assessment of anthropogenic activities releasing disturbing pollutants. Permethrin, used worldwide to control a wide range of pest insects, can threaten aquatic biota, potentially useful as precocious bioindicators in ecotoxicology. This study seeks to assess the acute toxicity permethrin to the freshwater beetle, its availability in water, as well as, its uptake. The acute toxicity of permethrin to non-target species was studied under laboratory conditions to assess its effect, after the exposure 48 h, on the freshwater beetle Laccophilus minitus considering changes in some enzymatic activities; a specific biomarker of neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase) and a non-specific biomarker of oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and catalase). The rates of permethrin in water and insects were determined using gas chromatography. The low measured concentration of the pesticide 0.0013 mu g/L didnt modify the SOD and CAT activities in comparison with controls, only the high concentrations (0.023 and 0.18 mu g/L) induced a significant increase in the enzyme activity. A similar profile was recorded for the H2O2 level. The permethrin treatment induced a drastic depletion of AChE activity. As outcomes, uptake at a low level (<6.8 +/- 0.43 ng/g dry weight) showed to be the factor underlying the alterations in the beetles exposed to permethrin. Such findings provide information on the behaviour of permethrin within the environment and its biological target through its neurotoxicity and induction of oxidative stress in a freshwater beetle.

AB  - The importance of semi-natural vegetation elements in the agricultural landscape is increasingly recognized because they have the potential to enhance multiple ecosystem service delivery and biodiversity. However, there is great variability in the observed effects within and between studies. Also, little is known about the simultaneous delivery of multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity because most studies focus on monitoring one service at a time and in conditions specifically suited to observe this one service. In this study, the results are presented of 1 year of monitoring of a set of parcel-level and simplistic ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators on parcels with grass strips or hedgerows. In the grass strips, an increase in soil organic carbon stock, a decrease in soil mineral nitrogen content, a different carabid species composition and a higher spider activity density were found, compared to the adjacent arable parcel. These results indicate a contribution of grass strips to climate regulation, the regulation of water quality, an increase of beta diversity and potential for pest control. Next to hedgerows, crop yield was reduced and winter wheat thousand kernel weight, soil organic carbon stock and spider activity density were increased. These indicators show an effect of the hedgerow on food production, climate regulation and potential for pest control. The study concludes that both grass strips and hedgerows have the potential to increase multiple ecosystem service delivery, but that an increase of every service is not assured and that multifunctionality is affected by management choices. Also, an improved experimental setup in order to enhance ecosystem service monitoring is suggested.

AB  - Three sediment cores were collected from different regions of the mangrove adjacent to Carmen Island, in Terminos Lagoon, to examine the influence that natural processes, the oil industry and urban development exert upon the mangrove environment. Textural and chemical characteristics were evaluated in each core. The variations among them reflect the different dynamic and depositional conditions for each site. Core C1, located near Puerto Real inlet, presents higher averages of grave l (16%), silt (32.6%), clay (1.48%), organic carbon (4.42%), carbonates (49.9%), CaO (28.96%), MgO (1.7%), P2O5 (0.99%) and Cu (4.46 mg/kg), some of these elements linked to the abundance of organisms in the area. Located in a channel with high sand content formed by an ancient delta, core C2 presents the highest average concentration of Al2O3 (4.39%), Fe2O3 (1.1%), MnO (0.02%), TiO2 (0.17%), Zn (14.8 mg/kg), Ni (16.9 mg/kg), Cr (293 mg/kg), V (12.3 mg/kg) and Cd (0.14 mg/kg), indicating high concentration of terrigenous sediments associated with heavy minerals. Situated in the lagoon border close to Carmen City, core C3 presents the highest sand (88.3%), SiO2 (64.5%), K2O (1.1%) and Pb (2.2 mg/kg) concentration. The location of this core makes it more susceptible to the dynamic processes that take place in the lagoon. The chemical differences observed in C2 are linked to the construction of Federal Highway 180. The drought that affected the basin during El Nino (1997-1998) produced a decrease in the rivers flow and a diminution of terrigenous sediments supply to Terminos Lagoon that is mainly observed in C3.

AB  - Water is the important limitations of management in Zayanderood basin. Adoption and implementation of basin water management bill as provincial in the parliament in 2006. Zayanderood basin management became a dual management and increased the environmental degradation for agricultural production in the west of the basin. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the non-expert decision of managers on the environment and water in the west of the Zayanderud basin. So, land cover changes were investigated using Landsat images in the basin from 1993 to 2015. Then, the cost of the destruction of rangeland was estimated in this area for agricultural development. In this study, some of the indicators for measuring the economic values of ecosystems have improved compared to previous studies. Results showed that the change cover land is increasing quickly, while water scarcity of Zayanderood basin has remained in critical condition. Also, an economic value of at least US$1179.77 per hectare was delivered to people in 2015 by the rangeland and the cost of destruction rangelands was $10,247.3 per hectare over the last decade. The total cost of the destruction of rangelands was calculated around US$21,341,342.5 from 2008 to 2015 in this area. The result showed the impact of natural resource services destruction on person's welfare. So, proposed to the decision makers to consider the economic value of rangeland for assessment of agricultural development projects, because the projects with high social costs is not adopted in this area.

AB  - When considering the development of conservation strategies for threatened plant communities it is crucial to understand their resilience to environmental change, taking into account current decline and the occurrence of further habitat fragmentation and climatic changes. Many recent works describe resilience character and elements, but there is little focus on the metrics and indices that describe elements of stability and specific resistance or resilience over the community composition matrix. Communities with strong niche selection might be restricted to specific resistance strategies to cope with environmental changes. This would result in a community at greater risk from increasing fragmentation and climatic changes.
   In a 35 years survey of relic calcareous grasslands, we looked at measures to identify the resilience mechanisms for stability in the presence and abundance of species. We used techniques of partitioning of temporal beta diversity in nestedness and turnover components, analysis of functional strategy changes and dissimilarity analysis to detect changes in between -plot diversity and exchanges.
   Contrary to expectations, we observe strong resilience with different stabilizing mechanisms both at plot level and exchanges between plots. At the scale of our grassland complex, response diversity and environmental stochasticity allow for the maintenance of high biodiversity under natural perturbations and gradual human -induced environmental changes. This highlights the importance of dispersal, recruitment dynamics and microsite diversity.
   Community resilience is more than just the sum of species resilience strategies; adaptive management strategies need more emphasis on the variability of conditions, as this can enable or disrupt important community resilience mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since 1972, satellite remote sensing of the environment has been dominated by polar-orbiting sensors providing useful data for monitoring the earth's natural resources. However their observation and monitoring capacity are inhibited by daily to monthly looks for any given ground surface which often is obscured by frequent and persistent cloud cover creating large gaps in time series measurements. The launch of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite into geostationary orbit has opened new opportunities for land surface monitoring. The Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument on-board MSG with an imaging capability every 15 min which is substantially greater than any temporal resolution that can be obtained from existing Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) systems currently in use for environmental monitoring. Different areas of the African continent were affected by droughts and floods in 2008 caused by periods of abnormally low and high rainfall, respectively. Based on the effectiveness of monitoring these events from Earth Observation (EO) data the current analyses show that the new generation of geostationary remote sensing data can provide higher temporal resolution cloud-free (<5 days) measurements of the environment as compared to existing POES systems. SEVIRI MSG 5-day continental scale composites will enable rapid assessment of environmental conditions and improved early warning of disasters for the African continent such as flooding or droughts. The high temporal resolution geostationary data will complement existing higher spatial resolution polar-orbiting satellite data for various dynamic environmental and natural resource applications of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - The design of road surfaces involves application of a sophisticated algorithm system based on mathematical calculations and engineering solutions, with the calculation of evaluation criteria. It is precisely the observance of the standardized requirements in terms of design criteria that makes it possible to consider the design of the pavement as reliable, and the road as safe and convenient for traffic during the specified service life. When calculating the strength, based on the predicted traffic intensity and the composition of the traffic flow, calculations are carried out according to the main criteria: admissible elastic deflection, shear in layers of non-reinforced materials and in asphalt concrete, as well as the ultimate tensile stresses in cast-in-situ materials with the specified reliability level. However, in the accepted concepts for calculating the strength and reliability of road pavements, only the force effect is directly taken into account. To take into account environmental factors, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive indicator of the resulting impact of all factors. The paper presents a complex of factors influencing on traffic safety, road deformations and irregularities the height of unevenness, in particular, an increase in the dynamic impact on the road and the amplitude of vibration of a car wheel on a road with an uneven surface (when detached from the road surface), the coincidence of the vibration frequency of the car with the natural frequencies of vibration of the road surface, and as a consequence, on the behavioral features of driving. The arguments have been substantiated that the predictive models do not take into account a number of factors that have a significant impact on the formation of irreversible deformation in the layers of materials of road structures.

AB  - Diatoms have been proven to be good indicators of natural stream conditions, but little is known about the seasonal variability of diatom communities in megacity streams. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation of diatom communities along an urban-to-rural gradient in megacity streams, Beijing, China. We found that the composition and diversity of diatom community was significantly different along the urban-to-rural gradient in streams of Beijing city. The diatom community was subtle temporal variation in the reference stream and urban upstream, but the temporal variation of diatoms was relatively greater in the urban downstream. Overall, the composition of the diatom community was relatively stable in the streams among different seasons, and the dominant species did not change much over seasons. For example, during the sampling periods, the speciesAchnanthidium minutissimumin reference streams had the average relative abundance of 20.3 +/- 3.5%; the speciesPseudostaurosira brevistriataandStaurosira construensvar.venterin urban upstream had average relative abundances of 17.0% +/- 0.9% and 17.3% +/- 1.2%, respectively; and the speciesNitzschia paleain urban downstream had average relative abundances of 18.8 +/- 4.7%. There were significant correlations between the relative abundances of the dominant species and environmental variables, suggesting that the environmental variables had significant effects on the diatom distribution. Our results demonstrate that the diatom communities are relatively stable among seasons in different sampling areas, suggesting that diatoms can be used as reliable indicators for the biological monitoring of water quality in megacity streams across seasons.

AB  - The present paper examines the nature of salt movement by the influence of landscape position and development of secondary salinity in Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojana command area of hot arid India. Soil samples were collected along 20km transect across landscapes of upland, medium land, lowland and wetland. Soil properties, electrical conductivity of saturated extract (ECe), soluble ions in saturated extracts, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and sodium adsorption ratio were determined. Results showed that cation exchange capacity, organic carbon and CaCO3 were significantly increased in lowland and wetland while soil pH, salinity indicators (ECe and ESP) and exchangeable cations and anions such as chloride and sulphate were increased significantly (P<0.05) in the wetland. The mean exchangeable Na was increased while exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K decreased from upland to wetland landscape. It was found that Cl- imposed an existing and potential threat to sensitive crops in medium to wetland, where Cl- concentrations were greater than 106 me L-1. Principal component analysis helped in the identification of the parameters responsible for soil salinity variation, and the first factor indicated that soil ECe and ESP had a major role in the development of salinity and sodicity, respectively. Cluster analysis grouped four sampling sites into three clusters and members of the third cluster (lowland and wetland) were in close proximity. Under the prevalent arid conditions, improving the management of irrigation water should be the indispensable one to conserve and sustain the already fragile agricultural soils in the hot arid regions of India.

AB  - Drought is one of the key natural hazards impacting net primary production and tree growth in forest ecosystems. Nonetheless, tree species show different responses to drought events, which make it difficult to adopt fixed tools for monitoring drought impacts under contrasting environmental and climatic conditions. In this study, we assess the response of forest growth and a satellite proxy of the net primary production (NPP) to drought in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands, a region characterized by complex climatological, topographical, and environmental characteristics. Herein, we employed three different indicators based on in situ measurements and satellite image-derived vegetation information (i.e., tree-ring width, maximum annual greenness, and an indicator of NPP). We used seven different climate drought indices to assess drought impacts on the tree variables analyzed. The selected drought indices include four versions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI, Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), Z-index, and Palmer Modified Drought Index (PMDI)) and three multi-scalar indices (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and Standardized Precipitation Drought Index (SPDI)). Our results suggest thatirrespective of drought index and tree speciestree-ring width shows a stronger response to interannual variability of drought, compared to the greenness and the NPP. In comparison to other drought indices (e.g., PDSI), and our results demonstrate that multi-scalar drought indices (e.g., SPI, SPEI) are more advantageous in monitoring drought impacts on tree-ring growth, maximum greenness, and NPP. This finding suggests that multi-scalar indices are more appropriate for monitoring and modelling forest drought in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands.

AB  - Quantifying the impacts of agroforestry systems (AFS) on habitat conservation remains a challenge due to difficulties in accounting for differences in scales, AFS configurations, and inadequate measures of species dynamics within practical time frames. The field of soundscape ecology offers new perspectives and tools to efficiently collect information on species richness and has a potential to be used as a holistic measure for indicating changes in habitat conditions. The objective of this investigation was to conduct a rapid soundscape assessment using low-cost technology and evaluate the efficacy of using sounds as an indicator for monitoring and assessing species richness within AFS. A series of low-cost recorders were placed within two AFS (pecan alley crop and silvopasture) and two control habitats (natural forest and soybean monoculture). The acoustic complexity index (ACI) was used as the metric to quantify the sonic environment. Results indicated a weak, but significant relationship (R-2 = 0.30) between the ACI and overall structural complexity, measured using median heights, across different land-use systems. There was a stronger relationship (R-2 = 0.53) between the ACI metric and soundscape composition, which was defined by overall species richness. This study demonstrated the usefulness of conducting a rapid, low-cost soundscape analysis that quantified the effects of different land-use systems on species richness. This research also helped provide evidence of the significance of AFS as an integrative land-use system with beneficial characteristics that have potential to promote both production and ecological conservation.

AB  - Despite the history of freshwater biomonitoring, there is still a dearth of proven indices that allow accurate status assessment while simultaneously diagnosing the cause of impairment, particularly when stressors are multiple. Here, we present an approach to developing diagnostic indices where the sensitivity of biota is quantified using multivariate ordination. We applied the approach to the development of an index to detect acidity in British streams.
   Using a 197-site calibration dataset, we quantified variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages and determined which environmental variables best described the pattern. We then ranked taxa along an acid-base gradient, having first considered the merits of factoring out confounding variation from natural environmental factors. The response of the new species-level Acid Water Indicator Community (AWICsp) index to variation in base-flow and storm-flow pH and acid neutralising capacity (ANC) was quantified using independent data. Performance was also compared with existing family-level and species-level indices.
   AWICsp was consistently the species-level diagnostic index most clearly related to base-flow pH, storm-flow pH and ANC, accounting for 38-56% of the variation in acid conditions among the 76 test sites.
   Given the need to develop bio-diagnostic indicators, these data illustrate how organisms can indicate causes of stream impairment using robust and objective procedures, and when applied to strong environmental gradients such as acid-base status. We suggest that given the necessary calibration data, this approach could be applied successfully to other widespread stressors with equally strong biological effects such as organic pollution and fine sediment deposition, particularly if used in combination with RIVPACS-type predictive bioassessment models.

AB  - Statistically-designed inventories and biodiversity monitoring programs are gaining relevance for biological conservation and natural resources management. Mandated periodic surveys provide unique opportunities to identify and satisfy natural resources management information needs. However, this is not an end in itself but rather is the beginning of a process that should lead to sound decision-making in biodiversity conservation. Forest inventories are currently evolving towards multipurpose resource surveys and are broadening their scope in several directions: (i) expansion of the target population to include non-traditional attributes such as trees outside the forest and urban forests; (H) forest carbon pools and carbon sequestration estimation; (iii) assessment of forest health; and (iv) inclusion of additional variables such as biodiversity attributes that are not directly related to timber assessment and wood harvesting.
   There is an on-going debate regarding the role of forest inventories in biodiversity assessment and monitoring. This paper presents a review on the topic that aims at providing updated knowledge on the current contribution of forest inventories to the assessment and monitoring of forest biodiversity conditions on a large scale. Specific objectives are fourfold: (i) to highlight the types of forest biodiversity indicators that can be estimated from data collected in the framework of standard forest inventories and the implications of different sampling methods on the estimation of the indicators; (ii) to outline current possibilities for harmonized estimation of biodiversity indicators in Europe from National Forest Inventory data; (Hi) to show the added value for forest biodiversity monitoring of framing biodiversity indicators into ecologically meaningful forest type units; and (iv) to examine the potential of forest inventory sample data for estimating landscape biodiversity metrics.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effects of Magnacide (R) H (Baker Petrolite, TX, USA) usage on the aquatic ecosystem at the Cooperativa de Riego y Fomento (CORFO)-Rio Colorado irrigation channels, analyzing the effects on benthic invertebrates. At recommended treatment concentrations, Magnacide H kills most of the aquatic organisms; however, its presence in the channels is transient. Magnacide H caused a significant reduction in the number of taxa (58%), abundance (57%), and community diversity (67%) in the benthic assemblage with respect to untreated channels during the application period in the first year of the study. The herbicide reduced the abundance of the most abundant taxa: oligochaetes, chironomids, ostracods, and the snails Biomphalaria peregrina and Heleobia parchappii. In contrast, the herbicide only reduced invertebrate diversity during the application period at the second year Of Study. Two months after the applications had ceased, the benthic community in treated channels recovered their biotic attributes, reaching values similar to controls. Recovery could have occurred from upstream unimpaired reaches supplying migrating invertebrates that recolonized affected areas. Since recovery occurred within a reasonable period of time, we conclude that the impact of Magnacide H at CORFO-Rio Colorado channels is acceptable from a regulatory point of view in the present practice protocol. Nevertheless, a strict control on the application conditions must be ensured to minimize the risk on the ecological receptors. We emphasize the recommendation that water release outside the channels is prevented until the product has dissipated.

AB  - Uneven-aged stands in Croatia are mainly characterised by European fir (Abies alba Mill.), since uneven-aged structure and management are linked to ecological requirements and biological properties of this tree species. European fir, alongside with autochthonous oak species (Quercus) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), belongs to a group of basic tree species in Croatia. This paper presents the condition and value of some structural elements which have an impact on natural regeneration and viability of non-economic forests. Three-dimensional digital dynamic model of selection forest and vertical stand profile with specific measured trees on the field have been made by the application of digitalisation. Basic structural indicators have been calculated: basal area and volume of wood per ha; sum of horizontal crown projections per ha in absolute and relative terms; absence of canopy density; arithmetic mean of projections and medium crown diameter. The model facilitates computing-digital monitoring of changes in stand structure and their simulation and it opens new possibilities in studying the stand structure by the application of new technologies in forest management. Too many overmature trees, complete absence of young tress in the thinnest diameter classes, as well as shortage of medium thick fir trees are indicators of disturbed natural structure. In addition to the previously stated, there is excessive crown canopy density of 88.46% and low quality and old young growth of beech in the shrubbery layer, which ultimately results in absence of natural regeneration and questionable capacity for sustainability of these stands.

AB  - Although ostracods are common inhabitants of most types of continental water bodies, their ecologies are generally poorly known. Despite this, there is a genuine need for data on species-habitat relationships, particularly because of the recent expansion of their use in Quaternary palaeoecology. We studied the responses of ostracod assemblages to environmental gradients in a variety of Mediterranean brooks. These differed in their geographical and geological settings, water chemistries and degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. The use of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that the main sources of assemblage variation were related to the physical and chemical properties of the host environment. CCA separated species that inhabited chloride-rich, shallow streams on evaporitic rocks at medium altitudes, from deeper, lowland streams with higher carbonate than chloride contents. The second axis of CCA reflected ostracod species segregations derived from nutrient (nitrate) pollution of aquifers. It also showed a gradient from high altitude sites with high BMWP' values, to disturbed lowland sites that were nitrate-enriched and had high oxygen concentrations. Multivariate logistic regression showed that Sarscypridopsis lanzarotensis and Heterocypris salina both relate to waters with low alkalinities with respect to calcium and, in the former case, also to high relative chloride contents. Both species are good indicators of aquatic ionic composition, which is related to local geology. Our results also suggest that Herpetocypris brevicaudata, a common ostracod in the area, may be valid as indicator of clean waters. Despite these findings, further data are required before Ostracoda can be used effectively to monitor water quality. However, the present survey provides evidence that supports their potential in the assessment of the present and past conditions of flowing waters.

AB  - Patterns in the assemblage structure of littoral fishes occupying the gradient between riverine and estuarine ecosystems were revealed through multivariate analysis of 5 annual summer seine surveys in 4 tributary systems of the lower Chesapeake Bay. Catch per unit effort of fishes was quantified and environmental variables measured to characterize assemblage structure and population responses along large-scale (km) environmental gradients. Results of two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) suggested the presence of 4 intergrading assemblages of littoral beach fishes: permanent tidal freshwater, lower tidal freshwater, oligohaline estuary and mesohaline estuary. Littoral fish assemblages were ordered along a large-scale spatial gradient between tidal freshwater and mesohaline river reaches during summer, when relatively stable hydrological conditions create a well-defined salinity gradient. Large-scale distribution of these fishes along the liver axis corresponded with salinity (and its correlates) up to the interface, and with structural attributes of the habitat (nearshore sediment grain size, presence of submerged aquatic vegetation, woody debris) in the permanent tidal freshwater river reaches. The permanent tidal freshwater reaches were more riverine in character, and were typified by speciose and relatively stable assemblages dominated by resident secondary division freshwater fishes and the juveniles of several diadromous species. Although the resident fauna is certainly derivative of more upland, non-tidal streams. patterns of association suggest distinct ecological relationships may exist for species co-occurring in tidal freshwater habitats.

AB  - In recent years, an invasive macrophyte, Egeria densa, has overwhelmingly colonized some midstream reaches of Japanese rivers. This study was designed to determine how E. densa has been able to colonize these areas and to assess the environmental conditions that limit or even prevent colonization. Invasive species (E. densa and Elodea nuttallii), and Japanese native species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Potamogeton crispuss) were kept in experimental tanks and a flume with different environmental conditions. Tissue hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations were measured responding to either individual or multiple environmental factors of light intensity, water temperature, and water flow velocity. In addition, plants were sampled in rivers across Japan, and environmental conditions were measured. The H2O2 concentration increased in parallel to the increment of unpreferable levels of each abiotic factor, and the trend was independent of other factors. The total H2O2 concentration is provided by the sum of contribution of each factor. Under increased total H2O2 concentration, plants first started to decrease in chlorophyll concentration, then reduce their growth rate, and subsequently reduce their biomass. The H2O2 concentration threshold, beyond which degradation is initiated, was between 15 and 20 mu mol/gFW regardless of the environmental factors. These results highlight the potential efficacy of total H2O2 concentration as a proxy for the overall environmental condition. In Japanese rivers, major environmental factors limiting macrophyte colonization were identified as water temperature, high solar radiation, and flow velocity. The relationship between the unpreferable levels of these factors and H2O2 concentration was empirically obtained for these species. Then a mathematical model was developed to predict the colonization area of these species with environmental conditions. The tissue H2O2 concentration decreases with increasing temperature for E. densa and increases for other species, including native species. Therefore, native species grow intensively in spring; however, they often deteriorate in summer. For E. densa, on the other hand, H2O2 concentration decreases with high water temperature in summer, allowing intensive growth. High solar radiation increases the H2O2 concentration, deteriorating the plant. Although the H2O2 concentration of E. densa increases with low water temperature in winter, it can survive in deep water with low H2O2 concentration due to diffused solar radiation. Currently, river rehabilitation has created a deep zone in the channel, which supports the growth and spreading of E. densa.

AB  - The upper 8.45 m of a sediment core from Lake Naleng were analysed for its pollen and charcoal content to detect vegetation, climate, and human activity changes on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) since the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (11.7 cal kyr BP). The application of pollen indicator taxa, pollen sums, biomisation, and multivariate analysis helped to reconstruct environmental conditions during the Holocene. Furthermore, 64 surface samples from the southeastern TP and its foreland were analysed to investigate the relationship between modern pollen assemblages and vegetation. The modern vegetation was recorded in the surface pollen assemblages by pollen indicator types, although sediments also contain pollen spectra extra-regional pollen transported from lower vegetation belts, which is seen as a consequence of steep elevation gradients at the southeastern margin of the TP. The relation between different vegetation belts and temperature from the modern sample sites was used to infer quantitative temperature trends for the Holocene record.
   Spreading of forests at the beginning of the Holocene marks the transition to warmer conditions. From 10.7 to similar to 4.4 cal kyr BP open Abies-Betula forests were found at Lake Naleng probably reflecting a stronger-than-present summer monsoon. Temperature range reconstructions suggest a temperature that was about 2-3 degrees C warmer and a treeline position that was 400-600 m higher than today. A severe climate deterioration with temperatures about 1-2 degrees C colder than before is documented by a retreating forest between 8.1 and 7.2 cal kyr BP. Forests retreated while subalpine Rhododendron shrubs spread around Lake Naleng indicating colder conditions with temperatures 1-2 degrees C below early and mid Holocene level after 4.4 cal kyr BP. The forest decline at 4.4 cal kyr BP is considered to reflect climatic conditions as low concentrations of charcoal particles found in this period exclude human-induced fires as reason for the forest retreat. However, grazing indicators imply human influence on the environment since 3.4 cal kyr BP around Lake Naleng. We therefore consider the rapid treeline shift seen at 3.4 cal kyr BP as partly generated by human activity and partly by climatic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethanol from various plant resources, especially maize, is increasingly being used as a Substitute for fossil fuels. The production potential of ethanol from maize varies with weather and climatic conditions and crop management practices. The merits and prospects of ethanol production have been evaluated based on its impact on greenhouse gas emissions, economic viability and national energy security. The net energy value (NEV), i.e. the output energy after all non-renewable energy inputs have been accounted for, is a measure of energy gain, At the same time, the NEV can be an indicator for the long-term sustainability of bio-ethanol production, regardless of other conditions e.g. climate change scenarios, global trade restrictions, or local variability in natural resources such as water availability. Crop management practices directly affect the NEV of ethanol. Moreover, both crop management practices and climate variability affect the NEV through the grain yield. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of crop management practices and climate variability on grain yield of maize for ethanol production and ethanol NEV for conditions that represent the southeastern USA. Maize grain yield Was simulated with the dynamic crop growth model CSM-CERES-Maize and ethanol NEV was calculated using the simulated yield levels and crop management practices. The Simulations were conducted for conditions representing Mitchell County, Georgia, USA, using weather data from 1939 to 2006 and local soil profile information. The impact of irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer, planting date and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases were determined for the maize cultivars DeKalb DKC 61-72 (RR2), Pioneer 31D58 and Pioneer 31G98. Crop management practices and ENSO phase had a significant impact on ethanol feedstock production and NEV. The NEV of ethanol produced from irrigated maize was more than two times higher and varied less than the NEV of ethanol from rainfed maize. NEV of ethanol produced from maize grown during La Nina years was significantly higher than maize grown during El Nino years, both under rainfed and irrigated conditions. This study showed the importance of crop management practices and climate variability on ethanol feedstock productivity and long-term energy sustainability as assessed by the NEV. We discuss methods of implementing the findings of this study in practical farming e.g. through market mechanisms and governmental initiatives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The key objectives of this research were to establish fish monitoring methodologies and sampling efficiency strategies through the analysis of relations between fish species (compositions) and different kinds of sampling gear for lentic ecosystem health assessments. During the study, 81 species of fish and 53,792 individuals were sampled from the thirty reservoirs. When we tested the efficiency of combinations of multiple sampling gears, the combination of the cast net (CN) and kick net (KN) was most cost-effective, based on the sampling time elapsed and total cost of the sampling. This combination (1st choice method) sampled 74 fish species and 21,321 individuals and showed even better results than the combination of four types of gear (2nd choice method), which included the CN, fyke net (FN), trammel net (TN), KN, although 80 species and 52,242 individuals were sampled from the 2nd method. Overall, our preliminary data suggest that the lentic ecosystem health assessment (LEHA) model developed for national-level surveys may be used as an efficient tool for LEHA and the combined use of the CN and KN was more cost-effective than the 2nd choice method of four types of sampling gear (CN, FN, TN, and KN).

AB  - Sediment quality has been evaluated in a variety of ways since the early 1990s in studies from Europe. In South Korea, most studies have used an indicator value for benthic macroinvertebrates based on water quality, not sediment quality. To date, few studies have examined the biological integrity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in South Korea. In the current study, the tolerance valency and value in samples and the indicator weight values were measured for 43 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa from 73 sampling units in South Korea from 2014 to 2016. Total organic carbon, the amount of heavy metals, and total ammonia nitrogen were analyzed. The average grade for each pollutant was used as the sediment quality index. A benthic macroinvertebrates sediment index was developed for bioassessment of freshwater sediment. The benthic macroinvertebrates sediment index, which is based on the relative frequency of occurrence of macroinvertebrates, was highly correlated with pollution levels in the sediment. This index can be used in the field to assess the contamination of freshwater sediment. As the sample size was small in the current study and there were taxonomic limitations of Chironomidae larvae, further research is needed to improve the reliability of the benthic macroinvertebrates sediment index.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates are a biodiverse component of wetlands. Knowing the degree to which the different groups show congruence in their diversity and composition is therefore necessary if we are to optimize cost effectiveness of macroinvertebrate-based monitoring tools. Here we used published family lists of macroinvertebrate assemblages from 381 wetlands spread across the Western Palearctic and the Nearctic geographic regions, comprising both temporary and permanent waters. In order to determine the magnitude and nature of the spatial variability in the composition of molluscans, crustaceans and insects, we first examined beta diversity patterns for these groups. We then assessed which pairs of these taxonomic groups, or sub-groups (i.e. molluscan and crustacean classes, and insect orders), had a higher congruence in taxonomic richness and composition. We finally tested if any particular combination of groups could serve as a useful surrogate to estimate overall taxonomic richness. We found Mollusca composition could be better predicted than Crustacea and Insecta compositions. Mollusca (M), Hemiptera (H) and Coleoptera (C) family richnesses showed highest congruence with the rest of the groups. We subsequently combined the family richness of these groups (MHC) and observed that this metric was highly correlated with non-MHC family richness. We thus suggest that MHC should be considered when implementing new, or adapting existing, wetland biodiversity monitoring programs.

AB  - Serpentine soils are contaminants of naturally occurring metal-rich agricultural and fallow lands due to erosion of the serpentine site with consequences and deterioration of soil, water quality, and water sources in the ecosystem. The harsh climatic conditions due to the high concentration of potential toxic elements, organic pollutants, and acidity make it difficult to cultivate and establish vegetation on serpentine or adjacent land. Recently, biochar amendments have emerged in the area of soil remediation technology with the suitability and potential to promote seed emergence, plant growth, biomass productivity, and vegetation cover on contaminated soils such as serpentine soil. By enhancing the buffering capacity of the soil through pH, soil nutrients and water holding capacity stimulate the diversity and function of microbes. In this review, we have conferred the physicochemical aspects of serpentine soil, heavy metal contaminants, and their consequences, especially in crop production and phytotoxicity. Another, the assessment of biochar preparation using various types of feedstock, their characteristics, and the application for the amendment of serpentine soils has been deliberated. The restoration of sites with a high fraction of heavy metal contaminents and organic pollutants associated with serpentine soils using biochar has been highlighted for its importance. In line with the possibility of expanding the cultivated area, future research directions have been suggested in field trials, advances in biochar production, and environmental risk assessment. In addition, the applicable mechanisms have prerequisites to accelerate the efficiency of biochar amendments.

AB  - Earthworms are a major component of soil fauna communities in most ecosystems and comprise a large proportion of macro fauna biomass. They play multiple roles in soil heath. Earthworms represent one of the most important biological indicators in the terrestrial environment. However, they are exposed to agrochemicals used to increase crop yield. The present study was conducted to assess the potential hazards of a complete fertilizer (NPK), commonly used in agriculture, on juveniles of Aporrectodea caliginosa Savigny, 1826 an abundant species in the region of Tebessa (Northeast Algeria). The fertilizer was tested at different doses ranging between 400 and 1200 mg on juvenile earthworm under laboratory conditions. Growth, biochemical composition (lipid, protein, and carbohydrate content) and four selected biomarkers of oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione S-Transferase and glutathione) were examined weekly during an exposure of four weeks. The earthworm mortality was monitored after 4 weeks of exposure. The LD25, LD50 and LC90 values were 518.9, 644.9 and 996.4 mg, respectively. The tested fertilizer (LD25 and LD50) showed inhibitory effects on the growth of A. caliginosa. Moreover, it resulted in a significant reduction in the energy reserves as evidenced by a reduction in carbohydrate, lipid and protein amounts. Lastly, enzymatic assays revealed a stimulation of the detoxification system traduced by an increase in glutathione peroxidase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione S-Transferase activities and a decrease in glutathione rate compared to control series. Overall results indicate that application of the fertilizer tested could have harmful effects on earthworms.

AB  - Although the long-term geomorphic evolution of an estuarine tidal flat consequent to flow alteration and erosion has been widely documented, the short-term ecological responses of such ecosystems to multiple stressors remain poorly understood. We combined a mechanism-based ecomorphodynamic model with a hydrodynamic and sediment numerical model to examine the ecological response of an estuarine tidal flat ecosystem to different magnitudes of flow discharge and erosion conditions in the Yellow River Estuary (YRE) of China. The ecological benefits of flow discharge and erosion are reported in terms of the state of the tidal flat system: (1) a patterned state with high primary production and strong sediment stabilization; and (2) a homogeneous state with low primary production and severe erosion. We focused on the nonlinear flow-ecology relationship and identified the minimum threshold of flow discharge at which a patterned state occurs. Both flow discharge and erosion rates were shown to be important determinants of the state of the estuarine tidal flat ecosystem. We showed that a change in flow discharge altered the sediment deposition rate S-in and induced a state transition of the tidal flat ecosystem. Erosion increased the minimum threshold value of flow discharge at which a patterned state occurred. Our model framework provides an insightful method with a strong mechanistic basis to determine thresholds of flow discharge at which ecological benefits change dramatically, thereby providing a tool to make decisions regarding flow allocation in estuarine tidal flat ecosystems that are suffering from degradation caused by restricted flow and sediment load.

AB  - Nowadays, fuzzy logic has been successfully employed to handle the environmental issues. Due to inflexible classifications and interpretative difficulties of crisp data involved in the classic water quality index (WQI), employment of fuzzy logic in water resources problems has been repeatedly recommended for decision support in ecological assessment. As a mixed-ability method, it can both provide balance in suitable and unsuitable observations, which results in incompatible outcomes and can interpret social, economic, and biological effects as membership functions of linguistic terms. Accordingly, this study aims at evaluating the Karun River water quality, based on Mamdani fuzzy approach using developing a fuzzy water quality index (FWQI), a hierarchical approach was conducted to avoid curse of dimensionality in fuzzy rules and to take the relationships between parameters in to account as well 21 parameters in the form of physicochemical, chemical, biological and heavy metal fuzzy groups were processed based on trapezoidal membership functions and the rulesets for considering the relationships between parameters. A global FWQI of 36.78 +/- 2.17 has been estimated based on 2010 to 2015 data, while the assessment with NSFWQI and CCMEWQI indices scored 41.8 +/- 1.33 and 33.65 +/- 2.87, respectively. Based on ANOVA test, changes in global FWQI were not significant in sampling stations. Moreover, results show degradation of the water quality from upstream to downstream of the Karun watershed. These results put forward an argument in necessity of regeneration of the Karun water quality to improve ecological conditions in the region.

AB  - Oceans are changing faster than even observed before. Unprecedented climate variability is interacting with long-term trends, all against a backdrop of rising anthropogenic use of marine space. The growth of maritime activities is taking place without the full understanding of complex interactions between natural and human-induced changes, leading to a progressive decline of biodiversity and degradation of marine ecosystems. Against this complex interplay, marine managers and policy makers are increasingly calling for new approaches and tools allowing a multi-scenario assessment of environmental impacts arising from the complex interaction between natural and anthropogenic drivers, also in consideration of multiple marine plans objectives. Responding to this need, for the Adriatic Sea we developed a GIS-based Bayesian Network to evaluate the probability (and related uncertainty) of cumulative impacts under four 'what-if' scenarios representing different marine management options and climate conditions. We addressed issues concerning consequences of potential planning measures, as well as management programmes required to achieve environmental status targets, as required by relevant EU acquis. Results from the scenario analysis highlighted that an integrated approach to maritime spatial planning is required, combining more sustainable management options of marine spaces and resources with climate adaptation strategies. This approach to planning would allow to reduce human pressures on the marine environment and rise resilience of natural ecosystems to climate and human-induced disturbances, which would result in an overall decrease of cumulative impacts.

AB  - Natural rivers in urban areas bear significant potential to provide ecosystem services for the surrounding inhabitants. However, surface sealing by houses and street networks, urban drainage, disposal of waste and wastewater resulting from advancing urbanization usually lead to the deterioration of urban rivers and their riparian areas. This ultimately damages their ability to provide ecosystem services. This paper presents an innovative methodology for a rapid and low-cost assessment of the ecological status of urban rivers and riparian areas in developing countries under data scarce conditions. The methodology uses a combination of field data and freely available high-resolution satellite images to assess three ecological status categories: river hydromorphology, water quality, and riparian land cover. The focus here is on the assessment of proxies for biophysical structures and processes representing ecological functioning that enable urban rivers and riparian areas to provide ecosystem services. These proxies represent a combination of remote sensing land cover- and field-based indicators. Finally, the three ecological status categories are combined to quantify the potential of different river sections to provide regulating ecosystem services. The development and application of the methodology is demonstrated and visualized for each 100 m section of the Pochote River in the City of Leon, Nicaragua. This spatially distributed information of the ecosystem service potential of individual sections of the urban river and riparian areas can serve as important information for decision making regarding the protection, future use, and city development of these areas, as well as the targeted and tailor-made development of nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure.

AB  - Evaluation of the physiological states of copepods can improve current understanding of the dynamics of zooplankton population and contribute to assessments of the health of trophic linkages in marine ecosystems. However, assessing the starvation status of copepods in situ using conventional methods is difficult because of spatial and temporal changes in food availability. Here, we analyzed gene expression to identify the molecular markers associated with starvation in the copepod Calanus sinicus from the western North Pacific Ocean. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared between starved and satiated copepods using high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Sixteen DEGs were identified. Nine of these DEGs were assigned to known functional genes associated with energy metabolism, egg production, and somatic growth, and therefore were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) as candidate markers for starvation. To evaluate the reliability of these candidate markers as indicators for starvation, copepods were given different food concentrations and fasted for various periods. Gene expression was highly sensitive to temporal and quantitative changes in food conditions. During starvation, the expression of NADH-dehydrogenase (related to energy metabolism) was upregulated and that of vitellogenin 2 (related to egg production) was downregulated compared to their expression in satiated copepods. As might be expected from such changes in expression, complete fasting significantly decreased egg production. Changes in NADH-dehydrogenase and vitellogenin 2 expression were therefore correlated with the degree of copepod starvation or food limitation. This information may help to assess potential reproductivity and predict egg production rates in copepods in their natural environment.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a recognised threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services. With increasing tourism and projected 21st century climate changes across the mid- to high-latitudes of the southern hemisphere, subantarctic islands are potentially highly vulnerable to IAS, but suffer from a dearth of baseline monitoring. Here we report tree-ring measurements from a lone exotic Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr) on subantarctic Campbell Island to determine past growth rates and likely future response to climate changes. Though the samples were unable to resolve exactly when the tree was planted, the fast growth rate indicates it is likely to have been later than the reported date of 1901. Since at least 1941, the tree appears to have responded favourably to the relatively warm summers experienced on Campbell Island, resulting in growth more rapid than that observed in natural stands (North American Pacific Coast). Although trees of similar age arc normally mature and produce cones, none have so far been observed on Campbell Island - possibly the result of the fast growth causing an extended 'juvenile' or pre-reproductive phase - preventing seeding across the island. Importantly, relatively dry periods are needed for cones to open and disperse seeds, conditions not recorded in the instrumental record. Examination of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) outputs show increasing rainfall across the region during the 21st century under a range of emission scenarios, suggesting that even when mature, the Sitka spruce poses a limited threat to the long-term ecology of Campbell Island.

AB  - Although ecological succession is one of the principal focuses of recent restoration ecology research, it is still unclear which factors drive this process and positively influence species richness and functional diversity. In this study we sought to elucidate how species traits and functional diversity change during forest succession, and to identify important factors that determine the species in the observed assemblages. We analyzed species richness and functional diversity of ground beetle assemblages in relation to succession on post-industrial localities after habitat deterioration caused by spoil deposition. We selected ground beetles as they are known to be sensitive to landscape changes (with a large range of responses), and their taxonomy and ecology are generally well-known. Ground beetles were sampled on the spoil heaps during the last 30 years when spontaneous succession occurred. To calculate functional diversity, we used traits related to habitat and trophic niche, i.e. food specialization, wing morphology, trophic level, and bio-indication value. Ground beetle species were found to be distributed non-randomly in the assemblages in the late phase of succession. Ordination analyses revealed that the ground beetle assemblage was significantly associated with the proportion of forested area. Environmental heterogeneity generated assemblages that contained over-dispersed species traits. Our findings indicated that environmental conditions at late successional stages supported less mobile carnivorous species. Overall, we conclude that the decline in species richness and functional diversity in the middle of the studied succession gradient indicated that the assemblages of open habitats had been replaced by species typical of forest ecosystems.

AB  - Bryophyte particularly mosses, have been found to serve as reliable indicators of air pollution and can serve as bryometers-biological instruments for measuring air pollution. They are remarkable colonizers, as they have the ability to survive in adverse environments and are also particular in their requirement of environmental conditions, which makes them appropriate ecological indicators. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity of antioxidative enzymes in two mosses viz., Hyophila rosea R.S. Williams and Semibarbula orientalis (Web.) Wijk. & Marg. and assess their suitability as biomonitors. Three different locations viz., Lucknow University, Residency (contaminated sites) and Dilkusha Garden (reference site) within Lucknow city with different levels of air pollutants were used for comparison. Our results indicate that air pollution caused marked enhancement in activity of antioxidative enzymes viz., catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. All the three are capable of scavenging reactive oxygen species. In the genus S. orientalis, catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity was minimum at the reference site Dilkusha Garden and was significantly higher at the two contaminated sites for catalase and peroxidase, whereas the difference was non significant for superoxide dismutase. In H. rosea the activity of catalase and peroxidase at the three locations was almost similar, however superoxide dismutase activity showed a significant increase in the two contaminated sites when compared to the reference site, the value being highest for Lucknow University site. It was thus observed that the two genera, from the same location, showed difference in the activity of the antioxidative enzymes. Based on our results, we recommend bryophytes as good monitors of air pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental indicators can be used to evaluate natural recovery processes. Although several studies have used ant assemblage metrics as environmental indicators, few try to explain the response of these insect assemblages to forest recovery. Thus, we carried out a vertical ant sampling design to verify the sensitivity of ant assemblages from different microhabitats (epigeic, arboreal and hypogeic) to natural forest recovery. We also verified whether changes to the diversity measures (species richness, composition and evenness) of these assemblages could be predictable and explained by changes in the resource quantity and conditions, and structural and resource heterogeneity that also occur along the natural forest recovery gradient. Additionally, we verified the potential of ant species as indicators of forest recovery. We sampled ants in a pasture and seven forest remnants with different recovery times that represent a forest recovery gradient along a chronosequence. Although, the non response of species richness and evenness, species composition changed along the recovery gradient and the dissimilarity between the ant species composition of pasture and forest habitats increased with the age of the forest remnant. This was supported by ant species indicators of pasture and forest areas pointed out by the IndVal test. The variation of ant species composition of the two groups of habitat types (pasture and forest) could be explained by the different responses of open habitat and forest specialist ants to the increase in vegetation cover along the recovery gradient. Therefore, species composition and indicator species by habitat type seems to be the most predictable data for the use of ants in environmental monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of systemic environmental monitoring and indicators for sustainability requires one to tackle the complexity of human-environmental systems. To this end the ecosystem approach is proposed here as a framework and the ecological network analysis as a tool for investigation while an urban system, represented as a water flow network, is discussed as a case study. Flow distribution is used to calculate total system throughput, development capacity, average mutual information, ascendency and overhead. These indices condense the complexity of the flow structure (representing system's metabolism) into a few measures that provide information on how systems grow and develop: because of this they are consistent with the sustainability context.
   Two alternative scenarios are presented to discuss the effects of management actions (policies) on sustainability as they change the flow structure and system level indices. While it is shown that increasing system activity (intensity of processes) augments potential for development but not realized development, actions that improve the organization of flows, thus increasing average mutual information, may reduce total system throughput and drive the system toward more sustainable conditions.
   System level indices are holistic measures that unveil the relation between internal processes and whole system performance. Understanding this relation is crucial because the former are the target of environmental policies but sustainability, the objective of such policies, is an overall system trait. Because of these features system level indices can be examples of a new quality of indicators for sustainability assessment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our landscape can be regarded as a development process that is affected and subsequently shaped by a series of different environmental and human-induced factors. However, to date, concrete data about the impact of each of these factors are still missing. One key reason for this is that methods of acquisition and evaluation of these factors inherently have differences, thereby preventing meaningful comparative analyses. This study presents an integrative methodical approach that bridges many of these gaps. Our approach also has the advantages of being generally applicable while delivering easily interpretable results that also allow comparisons between diverse geographical regions. The indicators used enable all major features of landscape change, e.g. changes in land use, landscape structuring, habitat settings, and urban sprawl, to be accurately monitored and provide high-quality realistic results that were validated in our study site, South Tyrol (North Italy). Indicators were selected for both their further subdivision, e.g. monocrops and different features of mixed crops, and their easy to ascertain hierarchically structured feature classification, e.g. land cover. Furthermore, our use of ecoregions enables better comparison of aspects of landscape development for geographical regions having diverse socio-economic and ecological conditions. Our methodical approach can be used as a basis not only for creating landscape change scenarios, but also for determining the environmental and human-induced factors involved and being able to list them in order of importance. Further the detected striking difference between the mapped land-use data and the official census data suggests a validation of the methodical approach in context of the national agriculture census.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants known for their photoinduced toxicity. This toxicity may occur through two mechanisms: Photosensitization, and photomodification. Photosensitization generally leads to the production of singlet oxygen, a reactive oxygen species that is highly damaging to biological molecules. Photomodification of PAHs, usually via oxidation, results in the formation of new compounds and can occur under environmentally relevant levels of actinic radiation. The toxicities of 16 intact PAHs to Daphnia magna were assessed under two ultraviolet radiation conditions. The toxicity of intact PAHs generally increased in the presence of full-spectrum simulated solar radiation relative to that in the presence of visible light plus ultraviolet A only. Despite the knowledge of a bipartite mechanism of phototoxicity that includes photosensitization and photomodification, few studies have examined the effects of PAH photoproducts on animals. To expand the existing data, 14 PAH photoproducts (oxy-PAHs) also were assayed, most of which were highly toxic without further photomodification. Two photoproducts of benzo[a]pyrene, 1,6- and 3,6-benzo[a]pyrenequinone, were the most toxic compounds tested, followed closely by benz[a]anthraquinone. Each of these three compounds had a median effective concentration in the low nanomolar range. The data presented highlight the effects of ultraviolet radiation on mediating PAH toxicity and the need to analyze absorption spectra of contaminants in the prediction of photoinduced toxicity. The importance of the role of photomodification also is stressed, because several oxy-PAHs, an unregulated group of contaminants, were highly toxic to D. magna, a key bioindicator species in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The copepod Calanus finmarchicus was investigated in four Subpolar Basins, Labrador, Irminger, Iceland, and Norwegian Seas, during spring, covering the time of ascent, grazing, and initiation of reproduction in the area. Lipid content, spawning activity, and stage composition and vital rates, such as egg and faecal pellet production were measured and linked to environmental parameters. Specific egg- and faecal pellet production rates varied with diatom biomass and were negatively correlated with temperature. Comparison of the various biological indicators revealed different life history traits C. finmarchicus has adopted in the different basins. In Labrador Sea, the females have invested in large eggs compared to the remaining basins. Labrador and Irminger Sea C. finmarchicus invest in size that we propose to be adaptation to cope with warmer overwintering habitats resulting in larger potential lipid storage capacity, while the Iceland and Norwegian Sea females can invest their remaining lipid storage in spring to fuel lipid-driven egg production. Grazing pressure on the phytoplankton community was estimated and compared between copepod and two dominating groups of protozooplankton; ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Despite approximately the same biomass in the upper 100 m, the grazing impact of the protozoan grazers was an order of magnitude higher than the C. finmarchicus dominated mesozooplankton. This illustrates the importance to also include the smallest grazers when studying the spring bloom in high latitude marine ecosystems if the fate of the primary production should be fully understood.

AB  - Exchange between groundwater (GW), hyporheic zone waters (HZ) and surface waters (SW) is critical for water quality, quantity, and the ecological health and functioning of all three ecosystems. Hydrological exchange is particularly important in intermittent creeks, such as in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia, where stream reaches shift from losing to gaining depending on the volume of surface flows. In this study we used hydrochemistry to identify SW-GW exchange and combined this with eDNA data to analyse the response of eukaryote and prokaryote communities to differing flow conditions within intermittent and perennial stream reaches. Our study suggested that SW and GW microbial communities were only around 30% similar. Differences in microbiota between SW, HZ and GW habitats were driven by changes in relative abundances of surface water dominant organisms (such as those capable of photosynthesis) as well as anaerobic taxa typical of GW environments (e.g., methanogens), with GW and HZ microbial communities becoming increasingly different to those in SW as flow ceased in intermittent creeks. Fine-scale hydrologic changes were identified through microbial communities in the perennial Maules Creek, indicating the importance of GW-SW exchange to biotic communities. This study highlights the importance of flow in shaping microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling within intermittent creeks and their connected alluvial aquifers. Our results suggest that microbiota may prove a useful indicator of SW-GW exchange, and in some circumstances, may be more sensitive in demonstrating fine-scale changes in SW-GW interactions than water chemistry. This knowledge furthers our understanding of GW-SW exchange and its impacts on ecological health.

AB  - Deterministic assessments of whether, when, and where environmental safety thresholds are exceeded by pollutants are often unreliable due to uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the properties of environmental systems and limited sampling. We present a global sensitivity analysis to rank the contribution of uncertain parameters to the probability, P, of a target quantity to exceed user-defined environmental safety thresholds. To this end, we propose a new index (AMAP) which quantifies the impact of a parameter on P and can be readily employed in probabilistic risk assessment. We apply AMAP, along with existing moment-based sensitivity indices, to quantify the sensitivity of soil and aquifer contamination following herbicide glyphosate (GLP) dispersal to soil hydraulic parameters. Target quantities are GLP and its toxic metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) concentrations in the top soil as well as their leaching below the root zone. The global sensitivity analysis encompasses six scenarios of managed water amendments and rainfall events. The biodegradation of GLP and AMPA varies slightly across scenarios, while leaching below the root zone is greatly affected by the assumed hydrologic boundary conditions. AMAP shows that, among the tested uncertain parameters, absolute permeability, air-entry suction, and porosity have the greatest impact on GLP and AMPA probability to pollute the aquifer by exceeding the aqueous concentration thresholds. Our results show that AMAP is effective to thoroughly explore time histories arising from model-based predictions of environmental pollution hazards. The proposed methodology may support informed decision making in risk assessments and help assessing ecological indicators through threshold-based analyses.

AB  - Psychosocial stress is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to a wide range of health conditions and has a significant negative impact on public health. Quantifying exposure to stress in the naturalistic environment can help to better understand its health effects and identify strategies for timely intervention. The objective of the current project was to develop and test the infrastructure and methods necessary for using wearable technology to quantify individual response to stressful situations and to determine if popular and accessible fitness trackers such as Fitbit (R) equipped with an optical heart rate (HR) monitor could be used to detect physiological response to psychosocial stress in everyday life. The participants in this study were University of Minnesota students (n = 18) that owned a Fitbit (R) tracker and had at least one upcoming examination. Continuous HR and activity measurements were obtained during a 7-day observation period containing examinations self-reported by the participants. Participants responded to six ecological momentary assessment surveys per day (similar to 2 hour intervals) to indicate occurrence of stressful events. We compared HR during stressful events (e.g., exams) to baseline HR during periods indicated as non-stressful using mixed effects modeling. Our results show that HR was elevated by 8.9 beats per minute during exams and by 3.2 beats per minute during non-exam stressors. These results are consistent with prior laboratory findings and indicate that consumer wearable fitness trackers could serve as a valuable source of information on exposure to psychosocial stressors encountered in the naturalistic environment.

AB  - This study examines shrimp farmer behaviour in relation to production intensity along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Thailand, and its embeddedness in the wider socio-economic context of shrimp farming households. The integrative agent-centred (IAC) framework was used as a basis for designing a structured survey to collect semi-quantitative data for a range of explanatory variables that potentially drive shrimp farmer behaviour. The results show that shrimp farming intensity is associated with a combination of technical (e.g. farm area, pond size, stocking density and production), economic (shrimp selling price, production costs and farm revenue), social (e. g. farm operating years, the use of family labour, engagement in shrimp farming and with other shrimp farmers), and ecological factors (e.g. farmer reliance on natural pond productivity, and constraints brought about by environmental change and fluctuations in productive areas). In addition, the results indicate that a number of external and internal socio-economic factors are related to the decision to adopt a certain level of production intensity, including training received on farming practices, access to technical equipment, proportion of total income from shrimp farming, season-specific changes in production, risk perception, and subjective culture (social norms and roles). This study therefore illustrates that levels of shrimp fanning intensity are in fact an indicator of a diversity of socio-economic conditions and behavioural choices, which need to be targeted by sustainability policies differentially and beyond the technical sphere. In showing this, we conclude that national standards aimed at achieving aquaculture sustainability should be designed to reflect the diversity needed to support such a diverse sector, and should be adjustable to better represent different socio-economic contexts.

AB  - Ecological risk of chemicals to aquatic-phase amphibians has historically been evaluated by comparing estimated environmental concentrations in surface water to surrogate toxicity data from fish species. Despite their obvious similarities, there are biological disparities among fish and amphibians that could affect their exposure and response to chemicals. Given the alarming decline in amphibians, in which anthropogenic pollutants play at least some role, investigating the risk of chemicals to amphibians is becoming increasingly important. Here, we evaluate relative sensitivity of fish and larval aquatic-phase amphibians to 45 different pesticides using existing data from three standardized toxicity test designs: (1) amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) with the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis); (2) fish short-term reproduction assay (FSTRA) with the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas); (3) fish early life stage test (ELS) with fathead minnows or rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The advantage of this dataset over previous work is that the underlying studies are consistent in exposure method, study duration, test species, endpoints measured, and number of concentrations tested. We found very strong positive relationships between fish and frog lowest adverse effect concentrations (LOAEC) for survival [Spearman's rank correlation (r(s)) = 0.88], body weight (r(s) = 0.86), and length (r(s) = 0.89) with only one out of 45 chemicals (propiconazole) exhibiting 100-folder greater sensitivity in frogs relative to fish. While our results suggest comparable toxicity for pesticides between fish and aquatic-phase amphibians under these test conditions, further research with a greater diversity of amphibians and exposure scenarios will help determine the relevance of these results across species and life stages.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are highly dynamic and can be strongly influenced by climate change, anthropogenic activities (e.g., pollution), and a combination of the two pressures. As a result of climate change, the northern hemisphere is predicted to undergo an increased precipitation regime, leading in turn to higher terrestrial runoff and increased river inflow. This increased runoff will transfer terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) and anthropogenic contaminants to coastal waters. Such changes can directly influence the resident biology, particularly at the base of the food web, and can influence the partitioning of contaminants and thus their potential impact on the food web. Bacteria have been shown to respond to high tDOM concentration and organic pollutants loads, and could represent the entry of some pollutants into coastal food webs. We carried out a mesocosm experiment to determine the effects of: (1) increased tDOM concentration, (2) organic pollutant exposure, and (3) the combined effect of these two factors, on pelagic bacterial communities. This study showed significant responses in bacterial community composition under the three environmental perturbations tested. The addition of tDOM increased bacterial activity and diversity, while the addition of organic pollutants led to an overall reduction of these parameters, particularly under concurrent elevated tDOM concentration. Furthermore, we identified 33 bacterial taxa contributing to the significant differences observed in community composition, as well as 35 bacterial taxa which responded differently to extended exposure to organic pollutants. These findings point to the potential impact of organic pollutants under future climate change conditions on the basal coastal ecosystem, as well as to the potential utility of natural bacterial communities as efficient indicators of environmental disturbance.

AB  - The high prevalence of co-occurring alcohol and tobacco use underscores the importance of understanding the influence of alcohol consumption on risk factors for smoking and relapse. Alcohol has been shown to impact reactivity to smoking and stress-related cues, both of which are common antecedents to smoking and smoking relapse.
   The objective of the current study is to examine associations between alcohol use, cigarette craving, and stress reactivity following exposure to smoking and stress cues delivered in participants' daily lives.
   Using cue-reactivity ecological momentary assessment (CREMA), adult smokers (n = 138) reported cigarette craving, stress, and past hour alcohol use on a mobile device four times per day for 2 weeks, resulting in a range of 4493-5983 data points per analysis. Questions were followed by exposure to pictorial neutral, stressful, or smoking cues delivered via the mobile device. Craving and affect were re-assessed following cue exposure.
   Results showed that recent (past hour) alcohol use was significantly associated with increases in the following: (a) tonic (non-cue-elicited) cigarette craving, (b) stress cue-elicited cigarette craving, and (c) stress cue-elicited stress reactivity, in the context of high-baseline stress. There was no significant association between alcohol use and smoking cue-elicited craving.
   Alcohol use may increase risk for smoking and relapse to smoking by increasing cigarette craving and, in certain contexts, stress following stress cue exposure. Though alcohol is known for its anxiolytic properties, under some conditions, it may increase reactivity to stress cues.

AB  - Because of their location at the interface between sea and emerged lands, so-called transitional environments are characterized by strong spatial and temporal variability in terms of sedimentological, physicochemical, and geochemical parameters. An increasing number of studies put forward the use of bioindicators as a tool for environmental monitoring. However, the sensitivity to these environmental parameters is commonly tested separately, even though it is known that interactions are numerous within this complex ecosystem. An integrated methodological study was conducted in Lake Varano (Italy). On the basis of 45 spatially distributed samples throughout the area and selected environmental parameters (trace elements, organic matter, clay mineral assemblages, grain size of sediment, and water characteristics), four factors are identified. The Lake Varano ecosystem is pre-dominantly influenced by terrigenous inputs (first-order factor). The clastic fractions of the sediments supply a ylarge range of trace elements, occasionally in relatively high concentrations. Under such circumstances, despite occasionally exceeding of threshold limits, the trace element pollution can generally be ruled out. The organic content combined with depth is the second key factor. In Lake Varano, the organic content is high and may lead to seasonal eutrophication. As a third- order factor, although only analyzed once, oxygen, ORP, salinity, and pH gradients show that foraminiferal diversity is positively influenced by more saline conditions. The fourth- order factor is the sediment size. To conclude, this paper illustrates the interest in and need to conduct a detailed, integrated, sedimentological study of a site prior to any examination of its ecological status (possible occurrences of sources of pollution).

AB  - The potential value of parasites as ecosystem markers was tested by analyzing the metazoan assemblages of Urophycis brasiliensis caught in four locations distributed in three ecoregions of the Warm Temperate Southwestern Atlantic. A total of 5,001 metazoan parasites belonging to 33 species were found. The identified parasites varied across locations in terms of presence, prevalence, and abundance, and their multivariate analyses resulted in clear similarity patterns. No differences were observed between two locations of the same ecoregion, whereas an evident separation of samples was observed across ecoregions in support of the existing hypotheses regarding the ecoregional division of the southwestern Atlantic. We proposed that parasite assemblages, which are composed of several metazoan phyla, are potentially useful as ecosystem indicators. This suggestion is derived from the combined evidence of the evolutionary history and biogeography of multiple lineages, which is expected to be more efficient in capturing recurrent patterns in overall biodiversity than individual lineages. Furthermore, as many parasites have complex life cycles, their distribution patterns are dependent not only on environmental conditions but also on the distribution and population density of all hosts involved in their life cycles, adding further sources of distributional variability that act synergistically to define robust geographical patterns. The selection of long-lived parasites and their comparative analysis provided evidence supporting the existence of three different stocks in the four sampled areas. The best parasite tags were those with low specificity in fish hosts, constituting promising biological tags for the stock discrimination of other fish species in the region.

AB  - The historic port town of Mikindani is situated along the southern portion of the Swahili coast. Archaeological investigations in this region of coastal East Africa yield evidence of occupation since the last centuries BCE and intensive settlement since the middle of the first millennium CE. This long settlement history suggests that people in the region have had an expansive, wide-ranging impact on local ecological conditions in the region. This paper takes a historical ecology approach in evaluating the nature and degree of anthropogenic influences on the environment in and around Mikindani. The evaluation is based on evidence from contemporary botanical communities, faunal remains, macrobotanicals, phytolith residues, isotope analysis of archaeological sediments, and soil chemistry. This research also looks to define an environmental component that contributes to a previously defined mercantile culture that characterizes Swahili communities in the region. We argue that this interdisciplinary analysis yields evidence of several long-term anthropogenic influences in Mikindani, including: a long-term reduction in forests and woody vegetation, reliance on shifting agriculture as a subsistence strategy, and the continued reliance on marine resources to meet subsistence needs. These patterns of human-environment interaction help suggest reasons for certain developments in Mikindani's history, perhaps most notably its early second millennium CE absence from Indian Ocean trade networks. Our results contribute to a growing literature in East Africa which acknowledges that modern environments of East Africa derive from a recursive relationship with human populations that has continued for thousands of years.

AB  - P> Assessing and monitoring the impact of offshore wind farms on marine fauna is vital if we want to achieve ecologically sustainable development of this renewable energy resource. Given the complexity of the marine environment, a method capable of accommodating spatio-temporal behaviour of specific species and their interrelation with other marine phenomena is an essential prerequisite for investigating whether or not there has been any measurable impact to date.
   This paper presents a method based on geostatistical simulation to assess whether pre- and post-construction collected bird count data suggest displacement of birds due to the wind farm. The method takes into account spatial autocorrelation in species abundance at various scales, pre- and post-construction differences in environmental conditions and in survey effort and design.
   We demonstrate that taking these factors into account influences the conclusions about a wind farm's impact on bird life. In particular, incorporating spatial autocorrelation in seabird numbers is an important factor in reducing the risk of wrongly identifying an effect of a wind farm on bird abundance.
   Synthesis and applications. The development of offshore wind farms is often in conflict with nature conservation interests. Environmental impact assessment and monitoring is essential to protect and manage the marine environment. The method described here will allow scarce data to be utilized effectively as a basis for well-informed environmental decisions. In addition, the method will assist in the design of optimal monitoring procedures at a given site, balancing costs and effectiveness in detecting potentially harmful impacts.

AB  - The individual physical, chemical, and biological interactions that determine the exposure of plants and animals to chemicals associated with soils are of great importance in the assessment of contaminants bioavailability. Understanding of bioavailability processes is at last needed to improve the scientific basis of risk assessment and is the purpose of the present research. Since bioavailability processes are embedded within existing human health and ecological risk frameworks, sorption efficiency of contaminants is assumed as the bioavailability factor and used as an adjustment to applied dose. Various soils and contaminants (dyes, refractory organics, heavy metals) were contacted and the maximum sorbed concentrations were determined in various experimental conditions using a batch system. Inorganic and organic contaminants associated with soils can be transported to biological receptors by a variety of pathways in environmental systems. The released concentrations of contaminants were assessed by desorption experiments using distilled water. These data were applied for bioavailability assessment.
   The intake equation for incidental ingestion, as an important exposure route for contaminated soils in human health risk assessments was used in its basic form, which includes chemical concentration in the soil at the point of contact, soil ingestion rate, body weight. The soil concentration, surface area, adherence factor, and body weight terms allow calculation of an amount of chemical present on the skin per unit body weight, applying an adequate equation to calculate the absorbed dose from dermal exposure to soil. Depending on which exposure pathways dominate, different bioavailability processes were considered during ecological risk assessment, according to specific methods.
   This way bioavailability can be considered as having a potential influence on risk-based decision-making processes for remedial goals.

AB  - Identification of typical vegetation succession types and their important influencing factors is an important prerequisite to implement differential vegetation and soil management after land abandonment on the Loess Plateau, China. However, there is no reported study specifically on the identification of vegetation types and their important factors as well as the thresholds of the important factors for classification of the vegetation types, based on the medium- to long-term succession of natural vegetation after cropland abandonment. We collected vegetation and soil data on the natural vegetation with the longest 60-year-old forest communities that developed after cropland abandonment and analyzed the data using two-way indicator species analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, direct canonical correspondence analysis and classification tree model. The vegetation communities were classified into five distinct vegetation types, including Artemisia scoparia, Lespedeza davurica and Stipa bungeana, Artemisia giraldii pamp, Sophora viciifolia, Quercus liaotungensis and Biota orientalis. The years after cropland abandonment and soil C/N were further identified as important factors determining the types of vegetation. Likewise, it was observed that most of the investigated soil nutrient variables and soil texture-related variables improved with the vegetation succession while soil water in the surface layers showed a decreasing trend. These findings may provide an ecological basis for site-specific management of vegetation types after cropland abandonment in the medium-long term on the Loess Plateau. Our results encourage further exploration of vegetation succession and their important factors based on longer periods of vegetation succession after cropland abandonment under more soil and climatic conditions on the mountainous areas as the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Coastal areas worldwide are undergoing major changes and degradation due to a set of combined natural and anthropogenic stressors. In arid aeolian sedimentary systems these changes can be even more acute given their sensitivity to perturbances in landscape dynamics. While in many such areas recent (20 year) observations have been made regarding measurable differences in dune coverage and stability, few studies have assessed and quantified the long-term relationships of transitioning exploitation and land-use changes in order to fully evaluate their importance. Land management, therefore, does not always benefit from the more holistic picture that a combined deeper time historical ecology and geographical approach provides and can contribute to decision making. The Jandia isthmus, in Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain) presented an ideal field laboratory in which to assess these phenomena in actual conditions and test a combined methodology using historical and current sources (historical documents, aerial photographs, orthophotos, LiDAR data, field work and oral sources). By doing so, different phases of land exploitation associated with changing land ownership were identified and the consequences of each on the dune system assessed. It is concluded that the transition from traditional land uses (livestock and fuel extraction) to more recent ones (aggregate extraction, construction of new roads and urbantouristic resorts, and some recreational uses) has altered aeolian sedimentary transport, inducing stabilization of the landforms, as well as producing significant changes in the vegetation. The wider application of this type of study can benefit the many other areas worldwide that are facing similar pressures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sorption studies of organic pollutants by microplastics (MPs) in single-solute systems are well established in the literature. However, actual aquatic environments always contain a mixture of contaminants. Prediction of the fate and biological effects of MPs-mediated chemical exposure requires a better understanding of sorption-desorption processes of multiple organic contaminants by MPs. In this study, the altered sorption and desorption behaviors of individual organic UV filters (BP-3 and 4-MBC) in the presence of cosolutes (BP-3, 4-MBC, EHMC and OC) on two types of MPs (LDPE and PS) were examined. In most cases, co-occurrence of other organic UV filters appeared to have an antagonistic effect on the sorption of primary solute, which was consistent with trends found in previous studies. Nevertheless, the sorption uptake of 4-MBC as primary solute on PS was enhanced in the presence of cosolute(s), arising presumably from solute multilayer formation caused by laterally attractive pi-pi interactions between adsorbed cosolute(s) and 4-MBC molecules. Such formation of multilayer sorption in multi-solute systems depends on the solute hydrophobicity and concentration as well as inherent sorptivity of MPs. Our further desorption experiments revealed that the bioaccessibility of primary solute was significantly elevated with cosolutes, even though competitive sorption was observed under the same experimental conditions. These findings supplement the current knowledge on sorption mechanisms and interactions of multiple organic contaminants on MPs, which are critical for a comprehensive environmental risk assessment of both MPs and hazardous anthropogenic contaminants in natural environments.

AB  - A large area of plantations has been established worldwide and especially in China. Evaluating the restoration status of these plantations is essential for their long-term management. Based on our previous work, we used an ecological memory (EM) approach to evaluate four 26-year-old plantations that represent four common kinds of plantations in subtropical China, i.e., mixed broad-leaved plantation (MBP), mixed coniferous plantation (MCP), eucalyptus plantation (EP), and mixed legume plantation (MLP). Comparing them with the regional climax community, i.e., monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (BF), all four plantations accumulated nearly the same pattern of EM during succession. EM was > 50 % for soil minerals, light conditions, soil age, soil animals, and soil microbes. EM was about 25 % for soil pollen and 10 % for birds, soil seed bank, and plant species. The total EM value of the four plantations ranged from 50.96 to 52.54, which indicated that all four plantations were in the regional, natural trajectory of succession and between the early and medium successional stages. The results indicated that natural succession processes are unlikely to be accelerated by planting late-stage tree species without sufficient EM. The results also demonstrated that all four plantations were in positive successional trajectories, and the positive succession dynamics were greater in the MLP and MCP. We suggest that the entire natural succession trajectory be used to evaluate the restoration of a site and that the ultimate restoration target be divided into several milestones along the reference trajectory to monitor progress. Forest restoration may be accelerated by starting with a minimum dynamic unit supporting sufficient EM.

AB  - Soil erosion is a common form of land degradation in Europe concentrating on sloping rural areas. Consequences of soil erosion include the alteration of the long-term balance between ecosystem functioning and sodo-ecological systems. Although it was hypothesized that rural areas with specific environmental (soil, climate, vegetation) and territorial attributes (economic marginality and poor accessibility) are more exposed to soil erosion risk, less information are available on the spatial link with various socio-spatial, productive, cultural and political attributes of local communities, spanning from unemployment to subsidence agriculture, from quality of life to water management, from poverty to economic backwardness. Taken together, these factors may trigger a downward spiral leading to land degradation. The present study explores, on a municipal scale in Italy, the spatial relationship between an index of soil erosion risk and 133 indicators describing six research domains. Exploratory data analysis based on non-parametric inference, principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering was carried out with the aim to profile municipalities exposed to high risk of soil erosion and to identify a restricted number of factors possibly determining a downward spiral towards soil erosion and land degradation. Results indicate that the socioeconomic profile of risky areas in Italy is characterized by specific rural development attributes and defined productive structure and socio-spatial characteristics representing a possible target for mitigation policies. Multi-factor studies investigating the influence of the local socioeconomic context on soil erosion may contribute to improve the effectiveness of national soil conservation strategies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the abundance of soil and surface litter fauna in the western region of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, in the following land use systems (LUS): no-tillage crops (NT), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), pasture (PA), Eucalyptus plantation (EP) and native forest fragments (NF). Sampling was done in three counties in the western region of Santa Catarina: Xanxere, Chapeco and Sao Miguel do Oeste, in two seasons (winter and summer). The evaluation of soil/litter fauna in each LUS was performed by installing nine "pitfall traps" per sampling grid (3 x 3). The counties are true replicas. The soil for the chemical attributes was collected at the same sampling points for soil fauna. Altogether, 17 taxa were identified in the five LUS. The presence of groups of fauna was influenced by the type of soil management used. The LUS NF and EP provide better soil conditions for the development of a higher diversity of soil fauna groups compared to other LUS, which showed varying degrees of human intervention, regardless of the sampling season (winter or summer). However, annual crop systems NT and ICL groups showed greater richness and total abundance when compared to the perennial systems (EP and PA). Principal component analysis is an important tool in the study of biological indicators of sustainability because it allows use of soil attributes (chemical and physical) as explanatory environmental variables, which helps in the interpretation of ecological data.

AB  - Environmental assessments to evaluate potentials risks to humans and wildlife often involve modelling to predict contaminant exposure through key pathways. Such models require input of parameter values, including concentration ratios, to estimate contaminant concentrations in biota based on measurements or estimates of concentrations in environmental media, such as water. Due to the diversity of species and the range in physicochemical conditions in natural ecosystems, concentration ratios can vary by orders of magnitude, even within similar species. Therefore, to improve model input parameter values for application in aquatic systems, freshwater concentration ratios were collated or calculated from national grey literature, Russian language publications, and refereed papers. Collated data were then input into an international database that is being established by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The freshwater database enables entry of information for all radionuclides listed in ICRP (1983), in addition to the corresponding stable elements, and comprises a total of more than 16,500 concentration ratio (CRwo-wat) values.
   Although data were available for all broad wildlife groups (with the exception of birds), data were sparse for many organism types. For example, zooplankton, crustaceans, insects and insect larvae, amphibians, and mammals, for which there were CRwo-water values for less than eight elements. Coverage was most comprehensive for fish, vascular plants, and molluscs. To our knowledge, the freshwater database that has now been established represents the most comprehensive set of CRwo-water values for freshwater species currently available for use in radiological environmental assessments.

AB  - Changes to sources, stressors, habitats, and geographic ranges; toxicological effects; end points; and uncertainty estimation require significant changes in the implementation of ecological risk assessment (ERA). Because of the lack of analog systems and circumstances in historically studied sites, there is a likelihood of type III error. As a first step, the authors propose a decision key to aid managers and risk assessors in determining when and to what extent climate change should be incorporated. Next, when global climate change is an important factor, the authors recommend seven critical changes to ERA. First, develop conceptual causeeffect diagrams that consider relevant management decisions as well as appropriate spatial and temporal scales to include both direct and indirect effects of climate change and the stressor of management interest. Second, develop assessment end points that are expressed as ecosystem services. Third, evaluate multiple stressors and nonlinear responsesinclude the chemicals and the stressors related to climate change. Fourth, estimate how climate change will affect or modify management options as the impacts become manifest. Fifth, consider the direction and rate of change relative to management objectives, recognizing that both positive and negative outcomes can occur. Sixth, determine the major drivers of uncertainty, estimating and bounding stochastic uncertainty spatially, temporally, and progressively. Seventh, plan for adaptive management to account for changing environmental conditions and consequent changes to ecosystem services. Good communication is essential for making risk-related information understandable and useful for managers and stakeholders to implement a successful risk-assessment and decision-making process.

AB  - Toxicological tests are widely applied for assessment of impact of chemical compounds on living organisms. Most often microorganisms such as bacteria, algae and cyanoabcteria are used as test organisms. They are used because of in most of the ecosystems they pay vary important ecological role and they are relatively sensitive to toxicants [34].
   Microalgae are sensitive indicators of environmental change and, as the basis of most freshwater and marine ecosystems, are widely used in the assessment of risk and development of environmental regulations for metals.
   Copper is a trace element essential for all living organisms. In plants, it participates in photosynthetic electron transport and also plays a role as a cofactor of several oxidizing enzymes. Several heavy metals are essential for living beings at very low concentrations, but at higher doses most of them are toxic for organisms belonging to different levels of the trophic chain.
   We examined the influence of copper on the growth of green algae Chlorella kessleri H1901 CAUP. The effect of copperII was defined in concentration range from 5.10(-7) to 5.10(-5) mol.dm(3) in ionic form. A comparative study on metal interaction in the free and alginate immobilized of algae cells was conducted. Cultures with free and immobilized cells were incubated for 7 days under conditions optimal for the growth of the test alga. Algal growth (cellular density) was used as toxicity response parameter.
   The copper concentration inhibiting from 40 to 70% of algal growth of free and immobilized algal cells was 5.10(-6) mol.dm(-3). Both free and immobilized cultures showed similar response to Cu treatments.
   Immobilization of microalgal cells in alginate beads could be a technique in order to monitor potential pollution (eg. heavy metals) of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystem information on the Colombian Amazonia is poor in comparison with that on the Brazilian Amazon. We examined patterns of ecosystem diversity, deforestation and fragmentation and provided an estimate on their possible causes through a temporal and spatial analysis of biotic and abiotic data using remote sensing and geographical information systems in six pilot areas covering a total of 4,200,000 ha. Ecological, demographic and socio-economic data were analysed to establish the local conditions. We used a landscape ecology approach to calculate indicators of ecosystem diversity, cover and forest fragmentation such as number of patches, mean patch size, mean shape index and mean nearest neighbour distance. Patterns of deforestation did not run parallel to access roads; instead the typical pattern of unplanned colonization follows the only transportation network existing in many areas in the Colombian Amazonia: rivers. In addition, we have used indicators of human influence such as demographic pressure, quality of life and economic activity indicators. Results show that the extent and rate of change varies between areas depending on population density. Annual deforestation rates were 3.73 and 0.97% in the high population density growth areas of Alto Putumayo and Macarena respectively, and 0.31, 0.23, and 0.01% in the relatively unpopulated areas of indigenous population. These changes are related to land use history as well as to environmental and historical socio-economic factors such as oil extraction, deforestation, cattle ranching or illegal cropping. The current situation in the region suggests that tropical deforestation rates in the Colombian Amazon are substantially higher than those found in previous studies in the rest of the Amazon.

AB  - We investigated the toxicity of an emerging polynitramine energetic material hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) to the soil invertebrate species Enchytraeus crypticus by adapting then using the Enchytraeid Reproduction Test (ISO/16387:2003). Studies were designed to develop ecotoxicological benchmark values for ecological risk assessment of the potential impacts of accidental release of this compound into the environment. Tests were conducted in Sassafras Sandy Loam soil, which supports relatively high bioavailability of CL-20. Weathering and aging procedures for CL-20 amended into test soil were incorporated into the study design to produce toxicity data that better reflect soil exposure conditions in the field compared with the toxicity in freshly amended soils. Concentration-response relationships for measurement endpoints were determined using nonlinear regressions. Definitive tests showed that toxicities for E. crypticus adult survival and juvenile production were significantly increased in weathered and aged soil treatments compared with toxicity in freshly amended soil, based on 95% confidence intervals. The median effect concentration (EC50) and EC20 values for juvenile production were 0.3 and 0. 1 mg kg(-1), respectively, for CL-20 freshly amended into soil, and 0. 1 and 0.035 mg kg(-1), respectively, for weathered and aged CL-20 soil treatments. These findings of increased toxicity to E crypticus in weathered and aged CL-20 soil treatments compared with exposures in freshly amended soils show that future investigations should include a weathering and aging component to generate toxicity data that provide more complete information on ecotoxicological effects of emerging energetic contaminants in soil.

AB  - Riverine assessments of channel morphology and fluvial processes typically involve a time-consuming survey of channel cross sections and longitudinal profiles, expensive aerial imagery, and/or require specialised knowledge. As a result, geomorphic input is not widely included in multiparameter river condition assessments. We were interested in determining if surface flow type observations can be used as a rapid measure of channel morphology and then subsequently be used in river condition assessments to monitor channel change over time.
   We examined the relationship between flow types (e.g., rippled flow, no perceptible flow) and channel morphology. Two aspects of channel morphology were assessed: (i) within-reach depth variability and (ii) cross section geometry (e.g., width, area. Froude number). In a two-part study, each of these was correlated with flow type diversity for a range of study sites from upland and lowland environments in Victoria, Australia. We found that an increased diversity of flow types correlated with greater depth diversity, based on the coefficient of variation of depth along a reach. Flow types also correlated well with the cross-sectional Froude number, but less so with other geometric parameters. The proportion of flow types present was also notably sensitive to discharge within the low flow range examined (70-99% flow exceedance).
   Three 'geo-topes' cross section units of a dominant flow type were found to be the most physically distinct units at this cross section scale; no perceptible flow (deadwater), smooth boundary turbulent (glide), and rippled flow (run/riffle). Rippled flow is a revision to previous run/riffle classifications and is identified by the presence of unbroken waves of any size with crests moving in a general downstream direction.
   Our findings indicate that flow types can provide indicative information on channel morphology along a reach. When assessed at low flow levels, the diversity of flow types reflects the variability of cross-sectional geometry and also the diversity of the channel bed (depth). On this basis, the inclusion of flow type observations in river condition assessments can provide meaningful information on channel morphology, in a rapid and repeatable way. With repeat surveys, flow types could be used as a geomorphic metric to track changes in morphologic diversity over time, including changes associated with processes of sediment transport, scour, and deposition at a reach.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization have aggravated heavy metal contamination in river sediments of the riverine ecosystem in developing countries like Bangladesh owing to their toxicity and persistence. Sediments are dynamic components and useful indicators to understand the level of contamination and their associated ecological risks in the aquatic environment. The study was conducted to investigate the heavy metal contamination in sediments for assessing the ecological risks of an urban river of Bangladesh using principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson's correlation matrix, geo-accumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), contamination degree (CD), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factors (EF), and potential ecological risk factor (RI). The ranges of Zn, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Cd in sediments were 42.22-99.55, 11.12-57.83, 7.98-53.31, 6.76-22.41, and 0.38-0.87 mg/kg, respectively. In the present study, heavy metal concentration in sediments followed the descending order of Zn > Cr > Cu > Pb > Cd, while the concentrations of Cu, Cr, and Cd were higher and the concentrations of Pb and Zn were lower than the toxicity reference value (TRV). Geoaccumulation index (I-geo) demonstrated that most of the sediment samples were unpolluted to moderately polluted. The PLI ranged from 0.334 to 1.209 that stated that sediments were moderately polluted by studied metals. The multivariate statistical analysis revealed that heavy metal contamination was influenced by multiple pollution sources. The extent of heavy metal pollution in the Shitalakhya River implies that the condition is much frightening to both the aquatic biota and inhabitants in the vicinity of the river.

AB  - Knowledge of people's understanding of environmental problems is vital for the effective implementation of the ecosystem approach to marine management. This is especially relevant when conservation goals are aimed at ecosystems in the deep-sea that are remote to the consciousness of most people. This study explores public perceptions of the deep-sea environment among the Scottish and Norwegian public. It further analyses the relationships between respondents' pro-environmental concerns toward the marine environment and personal characteristics using a multiple indicators multiple causes model. The results show that public knowledge of the deep-sea environment is low for Scottish and moderate for Norwegians. Awareness of cold-water corals was high for the Lofoten case study area amongst the Norwegian public and low for the Mingulay reef complex in the Scottish case. These differences might arise because Norway is known to host the world's largest cold-water corals in the Lofoten area; a fact that has been well-publicized. We find that most people think changes in the deep-sea have at least some effect on them. On average, the public perceive the deep-sea condition to be at most "fairly good" but are dissatisfied with the management of it with approximately only one third or less thinking it is well-managed. Generally, the public perception from both countries show ecocentric attitudes toward the marine environment implying that they recognize the value of ecosystem services, the current ecological crisis and the need for sustainable management.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and nutrient availability are key indicators of soil quality, and both can be influenced by land-use change. However, it is still unclear whether the impact of land-use change on SOC and nutrient stocks differs between ecoregions. Grasslands near the northeast border of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) occur across several ecoregions that have recently been subjected to substantial land-use change. Based on long-term land-use history, we conducted a field investigation comparing soil C and nutrient stocks between natural grassland (NGL) and three types of converted grassland (agricultural grassland, AGL; farmland, FL; and abandoned farmland, AFL) in three ecoregions along a climate gradient: alpine meadow, temperate steppe and temperate desert. Compared with NGL, soil C stocks in converted grasslands were 22%-30% lower in the alpine meadow, but 60-82% higher in the temperate steppe and 6%-76% higher in the temperate desert. Converted grasslands also contained higher stocks of available nitrogen and phosphorus than NGL in the temperate steppe and desert. Soils (0-40 cm) in NGL contained 14.8 +/- 0.1 kg C m(-2) in alpine meadow, 6.7 +/- 0.6 kg C m(-2) in temperate steppe and 1.7 +/- 0.3 kg C m(-2) in temperate desert. Together, our results indicate that the responses of soil C and nutrients to grassland conversion differed between ecoregions. Thus, to optimize soil C sequestration rates and overall soil quality, we suggest that land-use policies in this area should take into account local environmental conditions.

AB  - Drylands are a widely degraded biome characterized by low productivity and high abiotic stress. Biological soil crust (biocrust) inoculants hold promise as a rehabilitation material in drylands, useful for boosting ecosystem functions including stabilization of eroding soil surfaces. However, biocrust materials cultivated ex situ by humans inconsistently establish under field conditions. We tested two approaches aimed at improving field establishment of biocrust inoculum: exposing the organisms within the inoculum to abiotic stress in an attempt to harden them, and applying habitat ameliorations intended to reduce the stressfulness of the environment. We hypothesized that both approaches in concert would lead to the most consistent field establishment of biocrusts. Overall, addition of biocrust inoculum did enhance biocrust establishment over the 1.5-year duration of the study but did not result in full recovery. Generally, hardened biocrust inoculum performed no better than inoculum that was not hardened, although one indicator (chlorophyll a) was enhanced by addition of hardened inoculum in some circumstances. Temporary irrigation was initially an effective habitat amelioration but had no effect on biocrust establishment by 1.5 years. In contrast, application of jute net to the soil surface promoted biocrust establishment both in synergy with and in the absence of inoculum addition. We hypothesize that jute net stabilizes the soil surface, reduces abiotic stress, and enhances resource availability, overcoming barriers to establishment of biocrusts. Currently, there is broad support for the efficacy of habitat amelioration approaches in biocrust rehabilitation, but effective hardening techniques remain elusive.

AB  - Human socioeconomic activities affect natural environments worldwide. Coastal environments like estuaries are especially threatened by the disproportional population growth and development taking place within the coastal zone. Within semiarid South Africa, and especially within the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, estuaries face human development pressures from a growing coastal population ranging in socioeconomics and types of natural resource use, and many systems are degraded. Although estuary management is well legislated, it is slow to be implemented. Unlike biophysical data, land cover data (historical-present) for KZN's coastal zone is readily available. Of interest was whether land cover is related to estuary ecological condition. If so, there is potential to use land cover characteristics around estuaries in future development of a tool for short-term interim management that addresses common management challenges including a paucity of historical ecological information, money, and expertise. In a novel approach for this region, land cover and biophysical (water physicochemical, sediment, and estuary macrobenthic invertebrates) data sets for seven of the province's estuaries for three points within a 30-year period (1980-2010) were examined. Land cover around these estuaries ranged from seminatural, agriculturally dominated to highly urbanized systems. Macrobenthos communities within the systems showed a similar distinction in terms of taxonomic dominance, although species richness and abundances were variable. Land cover within the 20-m contour line was found to be a very strong predictor of estuary macrobenthos characteristics, with a subset of 8 land cover types and five invertebrate species identified in this study for use as potential future indicators.

AB  - The natural heritage of parks is an important resource within the framework of sustainable development. Plans, projects and activities concerning park management form the basis for evaluations that rely on indicator systems to keep the evolution of pressure factors and the conditions of habitats and protected species under control. The ant of this study is to contribute to the provision of tools to analyse and evaluate the social impact of a Nature Park in terms of the accessibility and usability for all of the network of pedestrian paths within it.
   The study proposes an analysis methodology and an indicator of the "environmental accessibility of the pedestrian network" which enables us to measure some aspects of accessibility such as: the ease of getting around, comfort and security for all types of users, with the maximum degree of autonomy improving the quality of the visitor's experience of the park.
   A spaces configuration and performance based analysis methodology was used, and the 'accessibility for all' indicator was developed in relation to the conduct of users, based on expert knowledge and the involvement of stakeholders. The results are highlighted using maps.
   There is still a long way to go before methodologies and operational procedures for this type of accessibility analysis can be set out, and the case studies research can provide an important contribution. The article reports on the application of the proposed methodology to the case study of the natural park of Migliarino, San Rossore and Massaciuccoli in Tuscany (Italy).

AB  - The effect of wind environment is becoming increasingly important in analyzing and selecting sites for better natural ventilation of residential buildings, external comfort, and pollution dispersion. The main purpose of this study was to develop a set of methods for wind environment assessment in coastal concave terrains. This set of methods can be used to provide quantifiable indicators of preferable wind conditions and help site analysis. Firstly, a total of 20 types of coastal bays with concave terrains in East Asia were characterized to find ideal locations. The selected areas were divided into five categories according to the main terrain features. Then a sample database for the concave terrains was compiled for modelling comparisons. Secondly, a number of key wind variables were identified. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the typical coastal concave terrains identified as a result of the study were created, and the local wind environments were simulated with input from geographic information system (GIS) and statistic package for social science (SPSS) analysis. A measure of wind suitability was proposed that takes wind velocity and wind direction into account using GIS. Finally, SPSS was used to find the relationship between wind suitability and key terrain factors. The results showed that wind suitability was significantly associated with terrain factors, especially altitude. The results suggest that residential building sites should be selected such that their bay openings face the direction of the prevailing wind and that the opposite direction should be avoided.

AB  - Desertification is one of the most serious environmental and socioeconomic problems in the world. Desertification has got ever-increasing attention from scientists to policy makers worldwide. Monitoring and assessing desertification (MAD) has been a key and extreme important work, for combating desertification in threatened areas. Tremendous progress has been made in MAD during the last several decades, including multi-level indicator system, various kinds of extracting and assessing method of desertification information, etc. In particularly, Remote Sensing has become an important data source and technology in MAD due to its strength of macroscopic, synthesis, abundant information, quickly updated data, but it focused primarily on biophysical symptoms and involved some uncertainties challenging MAD. In this paper, several key challenges in MAD were reviewed and discussed. Some findings were given, mainly including: (1) the reference frame or baseline of desertification usually lacking of enough scientific support from environmental background reconstruction and ecosystem dynamics, (2) effective and readily accessible monitoring indicators of desertification usually lacking of reliability and scientific basis derived from bio-physics mechanism of desertification process, (3) underemphasized temporal and spatial scales of desertification and the scale effect, as well as (4) those extracting and assessing methods of real desertification information in need of improvement. Finally, some suggestions were put forward for advancing desertification research and providing authentic desertification information, including more distinct desertification connotation, addressing desertification research at multiple temporal and spatial scales, integrated application of multisource remote sensing data, closely combining MAD with field research work about desertification processes, establishing and protecting natural ecosystems' reserves with different climate types and vegetation types for desertification baselines, etc.

AB  - The vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) provide indicators of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity that can be used to model photosynthesis from remote sensing with the light-use-efficiency model. To help develop and validate this approach, reliable proximal NDVI and PRI sensors have been needed. We tested new NDVI and PRI sensors, "spectral reflectance sensors" (SRS sensors; recently developed by Decagon Devices, during spring activation of photosynthetic activity in evergreen and deciduous stands. We also evaluated two methods of sensor cross-calibration - one that considered sky conditions (cloud cover) at midday only, and another that also considered diurnal sun angle effects. Cross-calibration clearly affected sensor agreement with independent measurements, with the best method dependent upon the study aim and time frame (seasonal vs. diurnal). The seasonal patterns of NDVI and PRI differed for evergreen and deciduous species, demonstrating the complementary nature of these two indices. Over the spring season, PRI was most strongly influenced by changing chlorophyll : carotenoid pool sizes, while over the diurnal timescale, PRI was most affected by the xanthophyll cycle epoxidation state. This finding demonstrates that the SRS PRI sensors can resolve different processes affecting PRI over different timescales. The advent of small, inexpensive, automated PRI and NDVI sensors offers new ways to explore environmental and physiological constraints on photosynthesis, and may be particularly well suited for use at flux tower sites. Wider application of automated sensors could lead to improved integration of flux and remote sensing approaches for studying photosynthetic carbon uptake, and could help define the concept of contrasting vegetation optical types.

AB  - A total of 25 species of ascidians were collected in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto, a semi-enclosed Mediterranean basin. Three are non-indigenous for the Mediterranean Sea: Microcosmus squamiger, Polyandrocarpa zorritensis and Distaplia bermudensis. The substrate features, season and depth affect the distribution of ascidians in the study area. Some species, such as Pyura dura and Pyura microcosmus, were found only on artificial Substrates, while Ascidiella aspersa was almost exclusively recovered on natural bottoms. Seasonal variation in the ascidian distribution and abundance seems to be due mainly to their biological cycles, larval recruitment and adaptation. During the autumn and winter the most abundant species were Clavelina phlegraea and Ciona intestinalis, while A. aspersa was particularly abundant during spring. Depth and more directly light intensity play an important role in ascidian distribution. In the upper few metres the shallow-water species Polyandrocarpa zorritensis was abundant due to its photopositive larvae. Even though the distribution and abundance changed significantly between substrates, seasons and depths, the most abundant species in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto were Clavelina phlegraea, Ciona intestinalis and Styela plicata all of which are able to tolerate the variations in environmental conditions, low rate of water renewal and continuous silting of this semi-enclosed sea. Assuming the role that the above mentioned species have as marine pollution indicators and the abundance recorded for some of them, a high degree of environmental stress call be confirmed for the Mar Piccolo of Taranto. A comparative list of the ascidians recorded in this and previous studies is also reported.

AB  - An effective strategy to reintegrate biodiversity within otherwise intensively cultivated agroecosystems is to create set-aside and wildflower areas. It remains largely unknown, however, whether the ecological performance of an agroecosystem revitalized in this manner is comparable-from a species' population biology perspective-to traditionally exploited farmland. To address this question we compared, during two successive years, the trophic ecology and breeding performance of an insectivorous, indicator passerine (the Stonechat Saxicola torquata) in a revitalized intensively cultivated farmland (RIC) and a traditional, extensively cultivated farmland (TEC) in southern Switzerland. The chicks' diet and prey abundance did not differ between the RIC and TEC, with orthopterans, caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and coleopterans predominating (approx. 80% of diet biomass). Although Stonechat pairs initiated more broods in TEC than in the RIC, reproductive success (number of fledglings/territory x year) did not differ significantly between the TEC and RIC. The chicks' condition (body mass) was slightly better in TEC than in RIC, while no such effect could be shown for chick constitution (tarsus length) in either year. The inter-site (RIC vs. TEC) variation fell well within the inter-annual variation of breeding parameters, indicating that environmental stochasticity could be a greater determinant of reproductive output and young quality than agroecosystem type. Although in need of replication, these results suggest that incentives for setting aside farmland and creating wildflower areas within agroecosystems may not only enhance plant and invertebrate diversity, as has been demonstrated earlier, but can also support functioning populations of vertebrates situated at higher trophic levels along the food chain.

AB  - From 1980 to 2000, the Mondego estuary (Portugal) suffered dramatic changes due to eutrophication, leading to a decline in seagrass beds and changes in community structure, namely a decline in species richness and replacement of herbivores by detritivores. Because the conservation status of the estuary was being compromised, a restoration project was implemented in 1998 in order to restore the original natural seagrass habitat. This project included several restoration/management measures, including the protection of the remaining seagrass patches and improvement of the hydraulic conditions through modifying sluice opening regimes, thereby reducing the nutrient loading in the Southern arm of the estuary. In addition, several stakeholder forums were convened to inform local people of the ecological and economic importance of the area. In this paper we evaluate the success of this management plan as judged by changes in the polychaete assemblages.
   In the year following implementation of the restoration measures, the total biomass of polychaetes increased markedly, a pattern also seen in the overall macrobenthic community. Biomass recovery was faster and more pronounced compared to density recovery, probably because many larger species were able to attain adult body size (e.g. Hediste diversicolor). The polychaetes Alkmaria romijini and Capitella capitata, considered as indicators of nutrient enrichment and pollution of estuarine systems, gradually declined over time. A general increase in species diversity was observed after the application of the restoration/management measures.
   These changes indicate that the restoration project has been successful and that polychaetes can be considered representative indicators of the wider macrobenthic community, with considerable savings in time and effort for monitoring programmes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Question: Recognizing water table dynamics in wetlands is crucial for understanding species-environment relationships, ecosystem function and changes during restoration. The PVC tape discolouration method enables spatially and temporally extensive studies of reductive conditions associated with longterm water table dynamics in peat soils. The reliability of the method has been verified only for ombrotrophic bogs, even though wide usage can be expected in minerotrophic fens. Location: Trebon basin, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Using data from 49 plots in six poor and moderately rich fens, we correlated the directly measured lowest, highest and mean water table depths and the same variables indicated by discolouration of PVC tape attached to green bamboo stakes installed vertically in the soil profile.
   Results: The depth to the first sign of PVC discolouration was highly correlated with the directly measured position of the highest water table, the correlation between the depth of complete discolouration and the directly measured position of the lowest water table was poorer. The accuracy of the minimum water table measurement depended on the depth of the peat layer. Surprisingly, the depth at which the green bamboo stakes turned brown correlated highly with the minimum water table.
   Conclusions: The PVC tape discolouration method reliably indicates water table maxima in fens, but minima are not accurately indicated. The depth of the green bamboo discolouration is suggested as a new alternative indicator of the minimum water table, even in fens and mineral soils. Combining both methods enables efficient monitoring of water table dynamics at a large number of mire sites.

AB  - Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) provide incentives to landowners to manage resources in ways that deliver ecosystem services, such as through restoration activities. Under a proliferation of initiatives to restore degraded lands, innovative institutional arrangements that promote ecological restoration are emerging. However, exclusion of the human factor is considered a limitation of restoration theory and practice, and recognition of men's and women's roles in restoring landscapes is largely neglected. As the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration commences, this study uses PES as an entry point to explore gender equity in restoration projects. Focused on the Mara North Conservancy in Kenya, the study presents a framework for which qualitative approaches including Process Net-map and intra-household interviews are applied to uncover drivers and constraints associated with processes of gender exclusion and inclusion. The results reveal that 1) power imbalances condition socio-economic outcomes of PES schemes by reinforcing historical inequities in land tenure, and that 2) governance structures exclude women from decision-making processes and from receiving direct PES benefits despite their labor contributions to restoration activities; while men incur financial costs that are not adequately accounted for under direct payments. The study demonstrates the potential to apply new methodologies and define indicators that enable the identification of complex social dimensions in ecological restoration. Critical reflection on whether the neglect of social aspects restrict the potential for ecological restoration to address the very same inequities that contribute to degradation of threatened landscapes is encouraged.

AB  - The analysis of vulnerability of socio-ecological systems to threats of different types such as extreme climate events or change in land use draws attention to the factors and processes that determine whether the ecological, social and integrated socio-ecological systems are likely to experience harm due to exposure to the threat. During the last years there has been an increasing attention to the analysis of the vulnerability of socio-ecological systems when facing the lost or degradation of ecosystem services. However, despite the existence of conceptual frameworks and empirical applications to evaluate vulnerability of socio-ecological systems some open questions and challenges still remain. How to conceptually differentiate key concepts such as sensitivity, exposition, vulnerability and threat? How to consider the differences in socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries and in their capacity to adapt to new conditions of the ecological system? How to link ecological vulnerability with the social system analysis to obtain an integrated risk assessment of the socio-ecological system? This paper presents a conceptual framework for vulnerability assessment of socio-ecological systems that addresses the mentioned open questions based on a review of both theoretical and empirical literature related to vulnerability and socio-ecological systems. The paper identifies the attributes and indicators of the dimensions of vulnerability for understanding both the social vulnerability and ecological vulnerability separately and then jointly, in interaction with each other. The framework offers a way to communicate with practitioners and policy makers on identifying and improving the factors that reduce vulnerability. It can thus serve as a tool for targeting the implementation of policies and practices aimed at reducing vulnerability.

AB  - Spatial explicit information related to ecosystem services is key in decisionmaking for attainment of sustainable development. Ecosystems in the Karst mountainous region of the southwest China subtropical zone contribute a substantial number of products and services. Based on the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, multiple ecosystem services including water supply, sediment retention, carbon storage and habitat quality in the Guizhou Province of southwest China were assessed and mapped at the watershed scale in this study. The correlation among multiple ecosystem services was investigated and effects of the ecological condition and human pressure on ecosystem services explored. Results indicated obvious spatial heterogeneity in multiple ecosystem services and ecosystem services bundling; 51.09% of the area was designated at a moderate-level for "hotspot" (high ecosystem services provision) area. Tradeoffs existed between water supply and sediment retention and also between carbon storage and sediment retention. The spatial pattern of water supply in Guizhou was heavily affected by precipitation, evaporation and root depth associated with each land use type, while the rainfall erosivity, topography, cover-management factor and support practice associated with land use types played important roles in spatial distribution of sediment retention. The area and proportion of forestland were considered to be dominant factors affecting carbon storage. Habitat suitability of natural land use and the weight and effect distance of human land use were key driving factors affecting the habitat quality score and its spatial pattern. A weak negative correlation was demonstrated between human pressure indicators including the urbanization rate, GDP per person and population density and ecosystem services.

AB  - Roskilde University (Denmark) hosted a November 2015 workshop, Environmental RiskAssessing and Managing Multiple Risks in a Changing World. This Focus article presents the consensus recommendations of 30 attendees from 9 countries regarding implementation of a common currency (ecosystem services) for holistic environmental risk assessment and management; improvements to risk assessment and management in a complex, human-modified, and changing world; appropriate development of protection goals in a 2-stage process; dealing with societal issues; risk-management information needs; conducting risk assessment of risk management; and development of adaptive and flexible regulatory systems. The authors encourage both cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to address their 10 recommendations: 1) adopt ecosystem services as a common currency for risk assessment and management; 2) consider cumulative stressors (chemical and nonchemical) and determine which dominate to best manage and restore ecosystem services; 3) fully integrate risk managers and communities of interest into the risk-assessment process; 4) fully integrate risk assessors and communities of interest into the risk-management process; 5) consider socioeconomics and increased transparency in both risk assessment and risk management; 6) recognize the ethical rights of humans and ecosystems to an adequate level of protection; 7) determine relevant reference conditions and the proper ecological context for assessments in human-modified systems; 8) assess risks and benefits to humans and the ecosystem and consider unintended consequences of management actions; 9) avoid excessive conservatism or possible underprotection resulting from sole reliance on binary, numerical benchmarks; and 10) develop adaptive risk-management and regulatory goals based on ranges of uncertainty.

AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems are global hotspots of biodiversity threaten by human disturbances. Growing evidence indicates that regeneration of Mediterranean forests can be halted under certain circumstances and that successional stages can become notoriously persistent. The Mediterranean sclerophyllous forest in central Chile is been largely transformed into savannas dominated by the invasive legume tree Acacia caven as result of interacting management and ecological factors. We used multi-temporal satellite imagery to study the transition dynamics of these major vegetation types over the last four decades (19752008). Vegetation changes were related to indicators of resource availability (topography, water availability, solar radiance), potential propagule availability (distance to forest remnant patches) and disturbance regimes (grazing, fire occurrence and distance to roads and cities). During this study period, forests were mostly converted into Acacia savannas (46.1%). Acacia savanna was the most persistent natural vegetation type. The probability of sclerophyllous forest degradation into Acacia savanna increased on drier northern-exposed slopes, close to roads and further away from forest remnants. In contrast, forest regeneration from Acacia savanna was higher on moister southern-exposed slopes and closer to forest remnants. Acacia savannas are increasingly being converted into cultivated land on the moister locations or switching into a bare soil state in locations close to cities and further away from forest remnants. These results highlight the vulnerability of diverse sclerophyllous forests and its increasing conversion into persistent Acacia savannas in the Mediterranean region of central Chile and identify the ecological conditions for successful conservation and restoration of the native sclerophyllous forest vegetation that can be used for sensible land use planning.

AB  - In many communities in northern Ghana, the environment has been altered by complex natural and human driven forces with significant impact on the lives of their inhabitants. The need to formulate an improved, holistic and consistent methodological approach to assess the problem is critical for sustainable natural resource management. This paper examines the potential of the DPSIR environmental assessment framework utilizing GIS-based participatory methodology in the assessment of environmental degradation in northern Ghana. Community truthing tools such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions, participant observation and participatory Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were employed as a means of soliciting societal responses integrated to conventional GIS spatial analysis to measure the indicators of the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) assessment framework. Post classification GIS imagery results show a marked natural vegetation decrease of 634 km2 (42%) of the study area with a corresponding increase of 600 km(2) (39%) of grasses and built-up and barren environment in the period of 14 years from 1990 to 2004. This is attributed to extreme climatic conditions and human driven causes such as poverty, population growth, migration and land tenure system. Poverty reduction strategies, amendment of the Mining and Mineral Law (PNDC law 153), improvement of the existing land tenure system and the control of migrants and Fulani herdsmen from neighbouring Burkina Faso were some of the solutions selected by the research participants, to be emphasized in the National Environmental Action Plan (EPA Act 490). This paper concludes that the DPSIR environmental assessment framework is an effective means of organizing complex environmental information to facilitate policy decision making.

AB  - We develop a "case model" approach to investigate how conservation measures may affect the ecology of a community module, defined as a small number of tightly interacting species. The community module consists of a parasitic butterfly and its two hosts, a plant and an ant. The butterfly Maculinea alcon and its host plant Gentiana pneumnonanthe have long been used as indicators of high-quality Palearctic heath and moist grassland ecosystems, and both species have been targeted for ecological research and specific conservation management. We constructed a mechanistic model of this community module, including dynamics for the three species, and conducted simulation studies of different conservation strategies (burning, sod cutting, mowing, and grazing). We identified several key parameters for the conservation of Maculinea alcon and its host plant as well as the most efficient conservation strategies for their dual long-term persistence. Our results show that the conditions that optimize the size of the butterfly and the plant populations differ, suggesting that choices must be made in adopting conservation measures. Despite the potential for apparent competition between the ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, and the plant via the butterfly, realized apparent competition is asymmetric (ants are more affected than plants) and occurs only at intermediate successional stages. Our study provides an example whereby an endangered species (the plant) and its endangered specialist natural enemy (the butterfly) are adversely affected by successional dynamics via direct (for the plant) and indirect (for the butterfly) effects. We argue that different field situations will necessitate particular conservation solutions.

AB  - The biodiversity of soil-inhabiting nematodes in Canada is incompletely known, as large areas of Canada's landmass have not been surveyed for nematode fauna. Nematodes considered as indigenous are generally well adapted to a variety of ecological niches and climatic zones. Much of the available information is based on agricultural ecosystems and agricultural species, and thus is biased toward conditions in disturbed ecosystems and away from "primeval" ecology. Introduced nematode species are frequently quite pathogenic, even to exotic host plants from the same geographic point of origin. Estimates of crop loss due to single species infestations of pathogenic nematodes and the costs of nematode control using chemicals are reasonably well known, averaging about 10% of crop value, but ranging to 100% depending on the situation; the cost of damage by multiple-species infestations is less defined. Nematode-suppressive mechanisms are understood in only a few plant species; sulfur appears to be important as a constituent of active compounds in suppressive plants of agricultural origin. Similarly, some native plants are equally adapted with allelopathic chemicals that suppress nematodes. Management of nematode populations in agricultural soils by integrated crop management methods is at an early stage, requiring research to quantify effects of nematode-suppressive plants and soil amendments containing nitrogen. An integrated program could include nematode-suppressive plants, appropriate soil amendments, and the promotion of microbial antagonists. Different mathematical methods may be required to analyze and explain multi-factor nematode control systems. Less-toxic management systems could benefit the soil-inhabiting nematodes that predate arthropod soil pests. Further research on soil-borne nematodes may demonstrate the value of nematodes as indicators of agroecosystern health and environmental pollutants.

AB  - Road construction of the Redwood National Park highway bypass resulted in a large accidental infusion of fine sediments into pristine streams in Prairie Creek State Park, California, during an October 1989 storm event. This incident provided a natural experiment where we could measure, compare, and evaluate native stream amphibian densities as indicators of stream ecosystem stress. We employed a habitat-based, stratified sampling design to assess the impacts of these sediments on the densities of aquatic amphibians in five impacted streams by comparing them with densities in five adjacent, unimpacted (control) streams. Three species were sampled in numbers sufficient to be informative: tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei, larvae), Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus, paedomorphs and larvae), and southern torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton variegatus, adults and larvae). Densities of amphibians were significantly lower in the streams impacted by sediment. While sediment effects were species specific, reflecting differential use of stream microhabitats, the shared vulnerability of these species to infusions of fine sediments is probably the result of their common reliance on interstitial spaces in the streambed matrix for critical life requisites, such as cover and foraging. Many streamdwelling amphibians are highly philopatric and long-lived, and they exist in relatively stable populations. These attributes: make them more tractable and reliable indicators of potential biotic diversity in stream ecosystems than anadromous fish or macroinvertebrates, and their relative abundance can be a useful indicator of stream condition.

AB  - Aulacoseira granulata (Ehrenberg) Simonsen 1979 are considered as the eco-variable species which varies in density and diversity along with their morphological traits with the interference of environmental changes, so it is considered as one of the major ecological indicators of the water quality of lotic as well as lentic aquatic ecosystems. To assess major environmental factors which contribute to A. granulata bloom in the riverine system, a study was carried out from 2018 to 2019 comprising four different seasons at 11 sampling sites of river Ganga in the middle and lower stretch of river Ganga comprising freshwater and estuarine zones. For the analysis, different univariate, as well as multivariate, analytical tools such as principal component analysis (PCA) and water pollution index (WPI) were used. In the finding, it was observed that the average abundance of A. granulata was found maximum during the winter season. Among all the studied sites, the maximum average abundance was at Balagarh (71,576 cell l(-1)) and minimum at Diamond Harbour (68 cell l(-1)). The environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen, depth, and altitude showed a significant influence on the growth of A. granulata, while the water temperature negatively influenced the growth rate of A. granulata. The WPI showed a significantly negative correlation with cell length. Finally, the study concludes that the blooming of A. granulata is highly influenced by varied environmental conditions along the river Ganga, suggesting possible eutrophication. Therefore, a certain minimum flow and depth especially during the lean season have to be maintained for the sustenance of planktonic biota in the river Ganga.

AB  - Sustainable reservoir-river management requires balancing complex trade-offs and decision-making to support both human water demands and ecological function. Current numerical simulation and optimization algorithms can guide reservoir-river operations for optimal hydropower production, irrigation, nutrient management, and municipal consumption, yet much less is known about optimization of associated ecosystems. This ten-year study demonstrates an ecosystem assessment approach that links the environmental processes to an ecosystem response in order to evaluate the impact of climatic forcing and reservoir operations on the aquatic ecosystems of a coupled headwater reservoir-river system. The approach uses a series of numerical, statistical, and empirical models to explore reservoir operational flexibility aimed at improving the environmental processes that support aquatic ecosystem function. The results illustrate that understanding the seasonal biogeochemical changes in reservoirs is critical for determining environmental flow releases and the ecological trajectory of both the reservoir and river systems. The coupled models show that reservoir management can improve the ecological function of complex aquatic ecosystems under certain climatic conditions. During dry hydrologic years, the high post-irrigation release can increase the downstream primary and macroinvertebrate production by 99% and 45% respectively. However, this flow release would reduce total fish biomass in the reservoir by 16%, providing management tradeoffs to the different ecosystems. Additionally, low post-irrigation flows during the winter season supports water temperature that can maintain ice cover in the downstream river for improved ecosystem function. The ecosystem assessment approach provides operational flexibility for large infrastructure, supports transparent decision-making by management agencies, and facilitates framing of environmental legislation.

AB  - Testate amoebae are unicellular organisms characterized by a shell-like test. Due to their potential use as bioindicators and paleoindicators), these organisms have been increasingly studied in the last decade. particularly in temperate latitudes. This study's objective was two-fold: to identify the testate amoeba communities sampled from 29 water bodies in Mexico and to determine if their presence and distribution also made them suitable bioindicators for tropical latitudes. A total of 40 taxa were recorded within 12 genera, and six significant variables -oxygen. pH, depth, temperature, conductivity, and total alkalinity - that explained testate amoeba distribution within and among the Water bodies were identified through, a canonical correspondence analysis. The Q-mode clusters rendered five assemblages, each named after their respective dominant species: 1) Centropyxis aculeata strain "aculeata" assemblage, 2) Difflugia oblanga strain "bryophila" assemblage. 3) diverse assemblage, 4) Cucurbitella tricuspis assemblage, and 5) Difflugia protaeiformis strain "acuminata" assemblage. We found that Cucurbitella tricuspis and the Difflugia protaeiformis strain "acuminata" have similar ecological preferences to those reported previously for temperate lake& with the former identified as an indicator of eutrophic environments and the latter as an indicator of low oxygen levels. On the other hand, Centropyxis aculeata strain "aculeata" and Arcella vulgaris seem to indicate adverse condition& but the source of this environmental stress apparently differs from that reported in temperate latitudes. Although this stress source could not be identified in all cases, our study nonetheless demonstrates that testate amoebae in the water bodies of central Mexico could reveal the presence of environmental stress.

AB  - Two methods for obtaining information on the fractional composition of organic matter in natural waters (membrane filtration and oxythermography) are combined in this study. The method has a number of indisputable advantages, which distinguish it among the currently available methods of analytical chemistry. In earth science, the fractional composition of organic materials in natural waters is estimated by the concentration of organic carbon (Corg) in fractions. In our opinion, an indicator of chemical consumption of oxygen (CCO) for ecological estimation of water reservoir state is more informative, because this indicator carries specific ecological information on the necessary oxygen consumption for oxidation of pollutants coming into the natural water environment. Therefore, estimation of the CCO parameter in fractions provides real information on the availability of organic matter and the probable danger from its content in water. This is the principal novelty of the information obtained and our study. The method was tested in the study of variation of the fractional composition of water matter during passage of Volga water through the waterworks (upon removal of water from the storage reservoir through the dam of the Ivan'kovskaya hydro power plant in the Dubna area). Analogous results are almost absent in earth science literature. There is a lack of data on the influence of water release through the dam even with respect to the major-component chemical composition. Variation of the fractional composition of matter (both organic and inorganic) upon water release through a waterworks is not discussed in literature. Thus, this study is of fundamental character.

AB  - Neotropical freshwaters host some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world and are among the most threatened by habitat alterations. The high number of species and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of environmental change. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the fish communities of a neotropical river by applying simple descriptions of community organizations: species abundance distribution and abundance biomass comparison curves. Fish data were collected using gillnets during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. A total of 69 343 individuals representing 260 species were recorded. Dam closure was associated with changes in the organization of fish communities at all sites. Species richness tended to increase immediately after dam closure while evenness decreased. Changes in taxonomic structure (richness and evenness) were accompanied by a change in the distribution of biomass with the proportionate contribution by smaller individuals significantly increased relative to larger individuals. Five years on, richness had fallen to below pre-closure levels at all sites, while the comparative stability of assemblages in the transformed habitats was reflected by biomass-abundance distribution patterns that approximated pre-disturbance ratios. This simplistic analysis provided a sensitive and informative assessment of ecological conditions, which highlights the impact to ecosystem process and ecological networks and has particular value in regions where a lack of detailed ecological knowledge precludes the application of traditional bioassessment methods.

AB  - Surrogates are commonly used for monitoring biodiversity under a wide range of scenarios. However, surrogates are not often evaluated under diverse ecological conditions, and this hinders the identification of spatial and temporal boundaries of a surrogate's relationship with its biodiversity metric, including whether a surrogate can predict biodiversity responses to environmental change. We adapted a causal framework from the medical literature and applied this framework to investigate the consistency of a well-established habitat surrogate of arboreal marsupials: hollow-bearing trees. We tested the consistency of the relationship between hollow-bearing trees and arboreal marsupials across four long-term studies (>10 years) covering different habitat types and environmental disturbance. We also tested the ability of the change in hollow-bearing trees over time to predict the change in arboreal marsupials over time. We found a somewhat consistent relationship between hollow-bearing trees and relative abundance of arboreal marsupials, but the mechanistic details of this relationship varied both by location and by species of arboreal marsupial. Similarly, the surrogate approach was not able to predict trends over time, a result likely due to differences in natural temporal variation between the surrogate and target species of interest. Our investigation demonstrates that habitat surrogates can be very useful for certain aspects of monitoring programs, but that serious limitations prevail when trying to monitor changes over time, or if information on species-specific responses is required. Our new framework can be readily applied to any biodiversity surrogate with an established mechanistic link between the surrogate and biodiversity metric of interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to distinguish the impacts of two different anthropogenic conditions using the honeybee Apis mellifera as a bioindicator associated with a battery of biomarkers previously validated in the laboratory. Both the urban (RAV, Ravine des Cabris) and semi-natural (CIL, Cilaos) sites in La Reunion Island were compared in order to assess the impacts of two types of local pollution using the discriminating potential of biomarkers. Hives were placed at the CIL and RAV sites and honeybees were collected from each hive every three months over one year. Honeybee responses were evaluated with respect to several biochemical biomarkers: glutathione-S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and metallothioneins (MT). The results showed a significant difference between the localities in terms of GST, AChE and ALP activities, as regarding midgut MT tissue levels. Compared to the CIL site, ALP and MT tissue levels were higher at the RAV site, although AChE activity was lower. GST displayed more contrasted effects. These results strongly suggest that the honeybees based in the more anthropized area were subjected to sublethal stress involving both oxidative stress and detoxification processes with the occurrence of neurotoxic pollutants, amongst which metals were good candidates. A classification tree enabled defining a decision procedure to distinguish the sampling locations and enabled excellent classification accuracy (89%) for the data set. This field study constitutes a strong support in favour of the in situ assessment of environmental quality using honeybee biomarkers and validates the possibility of performing further ecotoxicological studies using honeybee biomarkers.

AB  - Fecal coliforms and enterococci are indicator organisms used worldwide to monitor water quality. These bacteria are used in microbial source tracking (MST) studies, which attempt to assess the contribution of various host species to fecal pollution in water. Ideally, all strains of a given indicator organism (IO) would experience equal persistence (maintenance of culturable populations) in water; however, some strains may have comparatively extended persistence outside the host, while others may persist very poorly in environmental waters. Assessment of the relative contribution of host species to fecal pollution would be confounded by differential persistence of strains. Here, freshwater and saltwater mesocosms, including sediments, were inoculated with dog feces, sewage, or contaminated soil and were incubated under conditions that included natural stressors such as microbial predators, radiation, and temperature fluctuations. Persistence of IOs was measured by decay rates (change in culturable counts over time). Decay rates were influenced by IO, inoculum, water type, sediment versus water column location, and Escherichia coli strain. Fecal coliform decay rates were significantly lower than those of enterococci in freshwater but were not significantly different in saltwater. IO persistence according to mesocosm treatment followed the trend: contaminated soil > wastewater > dog feces. E. coli ribotyping demonstrated that certain strains were more persistent than others in freshwater mesocosms, and the distribution of ribotypes sampled from mesocosm waters was dissimilar from the distribution in fecal material. These results have implications for the accuracy of MST methods, modeling of microbial populations in water, and efficacy of regulatory standards for protection of water quality.

AB  - The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena Linnaeus, 1758) is one of the large carnivores of forest and grassland ecosystems across Africa and Asia and is currently threatened throughout its range. Hyena habitats are shrinking, due to the increase of human-dominated landscapes. The aim of this study was to identify hyena habitat use as indicated by visitation frequency in the human-dominated landscape of lowland Nepal. We followed a camera trap protocol for the estimation of hyena presence and visitation frequency. We used a generalized additive modelling approach with zero-inflated Poisson distribution to evaluate the effects of environmental variables on capture frequency. Our results showed that the two most important and significant predictors of hyena frequency data were canopy volume and maxD (the maximum among the shortest distances to water sources, agriculture land and villages). The highest hyena frequencies were in sites with low canopy volume, i.e. riverbeds and grasslands, whereas lower frequencies were observed in dense forests, i.e. acacia and riverine forests. Additionally, hyena frequency increased with increasing maxD up to 5-6 km and then dropped sharply at larger maxD values. Overall, our study suggests that hyenas prefer open landscapes along rivers and human settlements, where the following combination of conditions is met: adequate cover, access to food and water. The preservation of natural open landscapes close to human settlements and rugged hilly areas seems crucial for the longterm conservation of hyenas.

AB  - Biological assessment metrics and water chemistry measurements are used to quantify the link between stressors and their effects on lake ecosystems, for the Water Framework Directive. However, correlations between metrics and water chemistry are often poor. This is seen as major weaknesses of Water Framework Directive-related monitoring and assessment. We analyzed macrophytes, benthic algae, benthic macroinvertebrates, water chemistry and sediment total phosphorus content in the littoral of six lakes in the Western Balkans and used CORINE land use data to estimate nutrient enrichment via runoff from the adjacent land. Lakes with a higher estimated phosphorus runoff from the adjacent land did not have higher littoral water nutrient concentrations, but littoral diatom assemblages indicated more eutrophic conditions. These lakes also had higher abundances of littoral benthic primary producers, which in turn were associated with low concentrations of dissolved nutrients, but only in autumn, not in spring. This is consistent with primary producers taking up nutrients during the summer growth season. In lakes with high abundances of benthic primary producers, it is likely that the littoral vegetation plays a large role in the transfer of nutrients from the water to the benthos. This process impairs correlations between biological metrics and water nutrient concentrations. Our results suggest that CORINE land cover may be more useful to characterize littoral nutrient enrichment than lake water chemistry. Increased benthic primary producer biomasses and "eutrophic" diatom indices may indicate littoral nutrient enrichment even if water nutrient concentrations are low. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The Bohemian Forest lakes, situated along the Czech-German-Austrian border, were strongly affected by atmospheric acidification between the 1950s and the late 1980s. The subsequent chemical recovery of the lake water should precede and enable a biological recovery, including changes in caddisfly (Insecta: Trichoptera) assemblages. Nevertheless, local pre-acidification data and detailed knowledge of the lake district history are missing, making evaluation of lake recovery difficult. We performed high-resolution analysis of caddisfly remains in a 2.2 m long sediment profile from Prasilske Lake covering the complete history of the lake-catchment evolution. Caddisfly larvae are good indicators of environmental conditions and their subfossil remains are well preserved in unconsolidated waterlaid sediments. A total of 10 caddisfly morpho-taxa were found providing a record from 11,400 cal. yr. BP to the present. With the exception of Athripsodes aterrimus, all identified species are currently present in the Bohemian Forest glacial lakes or their inflow streams but not all of them are documented in Prasilske Lake. The caddisfly fauna consisted of acid-resistant, acid-tolerant and eurytopic species since the Early Holocene. Based on our results, the acid, dystrophic state of Prasilske Lake has been occurring since the lake formation. We conclude that the first signs of natural acidification appeared not later than during the Holocene onset in the Bohemian Forest region. Furthermore, we did not detect any abrupt changes in the species composition connected to the period of anthropogenic acidification during the twentieth century. This study provides for the first time a record of postglacial succession of caddisfly assemblages in a central European mountain lake.

AB  - Contemporary practice in the conservation of socio-ecological landscapes draws on both a model of responsive management, and also on ideas about historic management. This study considered what evidence might exist for the exercise of these approaches to management in the conservation of floodplain meadows in England, in order to inform understanding and knowledge of conservation management and assessment practice.
   Evidence for a model of responsive management was limited, with managing stakeholders often alternating between this model and an alternative approach, called here the 'traditional management approach', based on ideas, narratives and prescriptions of long-established land management practices. Limited monitoring and assessment appeared to undermine the former model, whilst uncertainty over past long-standing management practices undermined the latter. As a result of the relative power of conservation actors over farmers delivering site management, and their framings of meadows as 'natural' spaces, management tended to oscillate between aspects of these two approaches in a sometimes inconsistent manner.
   Conservation managers should consider the past motivating drivers and management practices that created the landscapes they wish to conserve, and bear in mind that these are necessarily implicated in aspects of the contemporary landscape value that they wish to maintain. They should ensure that assessment activity captures a broad range of indicators of site value and condition, not only biological composition, and also record data on site management operations in order to ensure management effectiveness.

AB  - Ecologists often group organisms based on similar biological traits or on taxonomic criteria. However, the use of taxonomy in ecology has many drawbacks because taxa may include species with very different ecological adaptations. Further, similar characters may evolve independently in different lineages. In this review, we examine the main criteria that have been used in the identification of nine modes of classifying phytoplankton non-taxonomically. These approaches are based purely on morphological and/or structural traits, or on more complex combinations including physiological and ecological features. Different functional approaches have proved able to explain some fraction of the variance observed in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of algal assemblages, although their effectiveness varies greatly, depending on the number and characteristics of functional traits used. The attribution of functional traits to single species or broad groups of species has allowed a few classifications (e.g. Functional Groups, FG) to be used in the assessment of ecological status. We stress that the misuse of functional classifications (by applying them under conditions other than those intended) can have serious consequences for interpreting ecological processes. Assigning functional traits or groups cannot be considered a surrogate for the knowledge of species or ecotypes, and the use of specific traits must always be justified and circumscribed within the limits of ecological questions and hypotheses. An important future challenge will be to integrate advances in molecular genetics, metabolomics and physiology with more conventional traits; this will form the basis of the next generation of functional classifications.

AB  - Habitat loss is a significant cause of biodiversity loss, but while its importance is widely recognized, there is no generally accepted method on how to include impacts on biodiversity from land use and land use changes in cycle assessment (LCA), and existing methods are suffering from data gaps. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the impact of land use on biodiversity using ecological structures as opposed to information on number of species.
   Two forms of the model (global and local scales) were used to assess environmental quality, combining ecosystem scarcity, vulnerability, and conditions for maintaining biodiversity. A case study for New Zealand kiwifruit production is presented. As part of the sensitivity analysis, model parameters (area and vulnerability) were altered and New Zealand datasets were also used.
   When the biodiversity assessment was implemented using a global dataset, the importance of productivity values was shown to depend on the area the results were normalized against. While the area parameter played an important role in the results, the proposed alternative vulnerability scale had little influence on the final outcome.
   Overall, the paper successfully implements a model to assess biodiversity impacts in LCA using easily accessible, free-of-charge data and software. Comparing the model using global vs. national datasets showed that there is a potential loss of regional significance when using the generalized model with the global dataset. However, as a guide to assessing biodiversity impact, the model allows for consistent comparison of product systems on an international basis.

AB  - According to the Water Framework Directive phytobenthos (diatoms) and macrophytes are part of the same biological element, the aquatic flora, which should be used in monitoring programs for rivers ecological assessment. However, they have been treated separately over time, and different indices are used to reach an Ecological Quality Status. Here we build a predictive model (the AQUAFLORA) based on communities composed of diatoms and macrophytes, with the aim of determining if these two elements of the aquatic flora could be combined in a single model to evaluate the streams ecological quality. For that we used biological and environmental information from 200 reference and 171 disturbed sites distributed through the entire Portuguese mainland territory. After clustering analysis, 5 biological reference groups significantly different (ANOSIM Global R=0.685; p<0.001, 999 permutations) were established, corresponding to sub-sets of reference condition. The most contributive taxa to within groups Bray-Curtis similarity (determined by SIMPER analysis) are a mixture of macrophytes and diatoms. The groups were well discriminated (72%) by the environmental descriptors. Generally, groups 1, 2 and 3 are permanent siliceous rivers located in the north where precipitation is higher and temperatures are lower; while reference groups 4 and 5 correspond to southern streams with higher temperatures, low precipitation with a higher degree of temporality and high hardness and alkalinity. A 5-classes quality system based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between the observed flora and the reference groups communities, translated well the human pressures affecting the streams and highlighted the sensitivity of the aquatic flora to other pressures that are not usually considered (hydromorphological, land use).

AB  - Secondary metabolite production is assumed to be costly and therefore the resource allocation to their production should be optimized with respect to primary biological functions such as growth or reproduction. Sponges are known to produce a great diversity of secondary metabolites with powerful biological activities that may explain their domination in some hard substrate communities both in terms of diversity and biomass. Oscarella balibaloi (Homoscleromorpha) is a recently described, highly dynamic species, which often overgrows other sessile marine invertebrates. Bioactivity measurements (standardized Microtox assay) and metabolic fingerprints were used as indicators of the baseline variations of the O. balibaloi secondary metabolism, and related to the sponge reproductive effort over two years. The bioactivity showed a significant seasonal variation with the lowest values at the end of spring and in early summer followed by the highest bioactivity in the late summer and autumn. An effect of the seawater temperature was detected, with a significantly higher bioactivity in warm conditions. There was also a tendency of a higher bioactivity when O. balibaloi was found overgrowing other sponge species. Metabolic fingerprints revealed the existence of three principal metabolic phenotypes: phenotype 1 exhibited by a majority of low bioactive, female individuals, whereas phenotypes 2 and 3 correspond to a majority of highly bioactive, non-reproductive individuals. The bioactivity was negatively correlated to the reproductive effort, minimal bioactivities coinciding with the period of embryogenesis and larval development. Our results fit the Optimal Defense Theory with an investment in the reproduction mainly shaping the secondary metabolism variability, and a less pronounced influence of other biotic (species interaction) and abiotic (temperature) factors.

AB  - Insects often used as accumulation indicators of hazardous elements. Pitfall traps with ethylene glycol as trapping fluid are frequently used to collect insects. We studied the effect of glycol and preservation with ethanol on the elemental composition of hand collected firebugs. Control samples were stored in a freezer and the following treatments were used: insect kept in trapping fluid for 2 weeks, and for 1 month, trapping fluid for 2 weeks plus 2 weeks in ethanol, and trapping fluid for 1 month plus ethanol for 1 month. Insects kept in trapping fluid gained mass with respect to control: 26% for the short trapping and 37% for the long trapping. Preservation in ethanol reversed this effect in each case. Trapping fluid did not alter the dry mass. A significant loss in dry mass only occurred in the long trapping plus long preservation treatment. We analysed the concentration of eight elements: Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Sr and Zn. We found significant difference in the concentrations of elements among the four treatments in the case of all elements, except magnesium and zinc. Our results indicate the potential of both certain trapping fluids as well as preservation in ethanol influencing the concentration of certain elements in insects. Live trapping for collection and storage in under freezing conditions for preservation could be a more reliable method if quantitative analytical studies are to be performed, when invertebrates are used as indicators of the presence and concentrations of hazardous substances in the environment.

AB  - Crude oil is a well-known toxicant that reduces cardiorespiratory performance in acutely exposed fishes. While toxic effects can manifest in death in severe cases, the ecological consequences of sub-lethal exposure remain uncertain. This study investigated the impact of crude oil exposure on long-term social competition, growth, and metabolic performance in a coastal species, the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatits). Fish were acutely exposed to either control or one of two environmentally relevant oil concentrations and reared together in groups of 15 (5 from each exposure concentration) for eight weeks under resource-rich or resource-limited scenarios. Relative to controls, a 41.3% and 45.9% reduction in the specific growth rate was-observed following exposure to 25.3 and 53.4 mu g l(-1) Sigma(PAH) respectively under resource-limited conditions. These fish were subsequently sampled for metabolic performance and common indicators of social subordination including reduced glucocorticoicl receptors in the gill and caudal fin damage. The reduction in specific growth rate coincided with a 15.1% and 17.3% reduction in standard metabolic rate; however, maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope were unaffected. Additionally, measures of social subordination showed no differences between oil-exposed and control fish. These results reinforce the hypothesis that acute oil exposure can have prolonged sub-lethal effects that compromise the ability of exposed individuals to perform effectively in their environment, including gathering and/or metabolizing food. Furthermore, this work highlights the premise that oil spills can be more detrimental in already at risk ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The recovery of areas impacted by mining activities is a major challenge and requires knowledge of how the biological and biochemical processes of the soil as well as the establishment of plant species are affected by mining residue. In this work, the influence of deposition of iron mining mud and tailings on soil biochemical attributes and the initial development of tree seedlings was studied in a simulated event in the greenhouse. Pots (n = 27) with natural soil (2.0 kg) received deposition (280 mL) of iron mining mud or tailings and by three-month was cultivated with Urochloa decumbens. At the end of this period, part of the pots was sampled and the soil biochemical activities were evaluated. Then tree seedlings (Schinus terebinthifolius and Eremanthus incanus) were planted and cultivated for a year, when then shoot (SDW) and roots (RDW) dry weight were evaluated.
   Results: Deposition of iron mining mud and tailings did not affect microbial biomass carbon or basal soil respiration, however both conditions reduced (p < 0.05) beta-glucosidase activities by up to 30%, and the easy extractable glomalin by about 19%. In addition, the mud deposition reduced (p < 0.05) the SDW and RDW of S. terebinthifolius by about 21% and 24%, respectively. Nevertheless, Uruchloa decumbens and Eremanthus incanus had no variation in dry weight production between treatments, so they have good ability to grow settle in soil affected by mining residue.
   Conclusion: This study shows that the sequential planting of U. decumbens and E. incanus can be an alternative for use in environments with deposition of iron mining tailings.

AB  - Background Species distributions and abundances are undergoing rapid changes worldwide. This highlights the significance of reliable, integrated information for guiding and assessing actions and policies aimed at managing and sustaining the many functions and benefits of species. Mapping and monitoring of forest extent is a common requirement of regional forest inventories and public land natural resource management which requires generation of an accurate database on spatial forest structure distribution and environmental variables. Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology is an effective tool in modern management programs for forest ecosystems. The environmental factors which probably affect in the natural regeneration ofCedrus libaniA. Richard in its natural distribution forest in Slenfeh, Syria, were modeled using the binary logistic regression (BLR) model. The effect of environmental factors (spatial and forest structure factors, topographic factors, and spectral indicators) was studied, each one as single set and then their combined effect with each other on the probability of the presence ofC. libaniseedlings in Slenfeh. Results The accuracy of the model was clearly improved by studying the effect of environmental factors combined together (84%), while the accuracy of the other studied models did not exceed 70%. Conclusion The results showed that the forest cover (Cedrus libani, broad leaved except oaks, mixed) is considered a good condition for natural regeneration ofC. libani, while the lack of soil moisture in summer was a negative factor in the possibility of the presence ofC. libaniseedlings in Slenfeh.

AB  - Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) such as diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol, iopamidol, and iopromide are commonly used in medical imaging for radiological visualization of a variety of anatomic structures. Because of their highly persistent nature and poor removal by conventional wastewater treatment, ICM can often remain unchanged after entering the environment or they are transformed into many different by-products in complex physical, chemical, and biological processes. Large amounts of ICM and their by-products are found in natural waters, groundwater, drinking water (up to 100 mu g/L), and even in soil, where they can be a potential threat to the inhabitants of these environments. Because knowledge about the fate of ICM in various environments is dispersed and it concerns specific areas, the main purpose of this review is to summarize the available information about their occurrence, chemical and biological transformation/degradation, and toxicity to living organisms. The topics discussed particularly focus on mechanisms of ICM degradation/transformation in water using advanced oxidation processes and the biotransformation/biodegradation of ICM by microorganisms under different conditions, as well as the toxicity of ICM and their transformation by-products to humans and other organisms. Although environmental risk is not expected from the parent compounds of ICM, their continuous input to the water and the formation of toxic by-products may constitute a long-term potential risk for living organisms. Therefore, monitoring the transport and fate of ICM in various environments seems necessary.

AB  - The spatio-temporal distribution of seven abundant morphospecies (i.e. taxa identified based on morphological traits) and the diversity of the benthic megafaunal community at the Barkley Canyon hydrates site (870 m, Vancouver Island, BC, Canada) were assessed in 18 linear imaging transects (each transect similar to 30 m long), conducted with an Internet Operated Deep-sea Crawler in November 2016. Faunal counts (as proxy for local abundances) were treated as Poisson-behaving variables and were modeled and correlated to habitat quality (i.e. level of physical seafloor disturbance, as previously induced by the crawler), fluctuating oceanographic conditions (i.e. tides and currents, seasonal transitions and episodic particle fluxes) and temporally and spatially varying food availability (i.e. elevated chlorophyll levels, proximity to the hydrate mounds as additional energy sources). The model outcome was used to establish a potential trigger-notification procedure for substrate disturbance monitoring when ratios of faunal abundances exceed the expected range for any morphospecies. Finally, a quality assessment of the crawler's performance as a multidisciplinary monitoring platform was performed using individual and morphospecies accumulation curves, which aids in optimizing and standardizing data collection protocols. We showed that the abundances and diversity of hydrates megafaunal community differed in relation to physical seafloor disturbance, proximity to the hydrate mounds and episodic food input, at varying degrees. Our work sets a solid base for the future real-time, long-term monitoring of ecosystem functioning and health status in deep-sea areas exposed to industrial substrate alterations (i.e. mining, fisheries, etc.).

AB  - The question of the attention paid to content, a message or other information has long been raised in an environment that is not yet at the limits of saturation. This was a question even in bygone eras when the works of Michael Goldhaber, Yves Citton, Dominique Boullier and others advanced the study of attention in the context of hyperconnectivity. Today, the media economy is still dominated by the notion of contact with media, media devices, specific content, expressed by the number of readers, listeners, viewers and Web surfers, and the supreme indicator: the Gross Rating Point. Yet the GRP has existed for several decades, having emerged at a time when print media dominated, television channels and radio stations were far fewer in number, and the Internet had not even been invented. Thus, the media economy has been built on contacts with content, including that of an advertising nature. Digital convergence and the advent of Internet content by and for the general public have led to a situation of constant solicitation from many sources. This does not eliminate the notion of contact (or touchpoint), which must be considered a necessary condition, to be supplemented by the interest or attention garnered by such contact. This article addresses the media ecosystem in France, first describing its existing economy based on contact counts and then discussing emergent changes related to content digitization and the many solicitations received by individuals, making it necessary to consider the attention paid to any given content, as illustrated by some initial measurement experiments. Conclusions are drawn as to a possible transition from the still nascent attention economy to an emotion economy.

AB  - Twenty-nine forest sites in six sampling areas in the Banat region of Romania, adjacent to Serbia, were sampled to obtain inventories of their snail faunas and to make comparisons between these and previously studied faunas in the mountains from the Sudetes in the north-west to the Southern Transylvanian Carpathians in the south. 65 species were recorded overall, with between 13 and 33 at individual sites. Among the six sampling areas that on Schist rock at high altitude differed markedly from the others, and contained mainly species also found in Carpathian forests further north. The remainder, mainly on limestone, also differed among themselves, but contained more species endemic to the region or regions to the south, together with those found mainly in open rocky habitats further north. Some species and subspecies were restricted to particular areas within the region, and although ecological factors accounted for some of these differences, they did not explain all of them. The faunas were differentiated from those in the Carpathians further north, and showed a greater affinity to those from countries to the south. These patterns indicate a transition between northern regions with locally rich but regionally poor forest faunas and those of the Balkans and Mediterranean with many restricted endemics that survived the climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene in situ. Such faunas are no richer at site level than those from further north, but differ more among themselves even when environmental conditions are similar.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, .., ..-...

AB  - Stream restoration is widely applied for conservation of freshwater ecosystems, but systematic comparisons on the effects of different techniques are rare. In this study, we systematically evaluated two types of gravel introduction, substratum raking and the placement of boulders in six streams. We compared indicator-based and multi-scale approaches that simultaneously assess effects on target species, different taxonomic groups and on ecosystem scale. Gravel introduction had by far the strongest effects on macroinvertebrates (increase of species density and numbers of individuals), periphyton (increase of cell numbers) and macrophytes (decrease of coverage, species numbers and biomass), followed by substratum raking. The placement of boulders had no significant long-term effects on aquatic communities. Over all investigated restoration treatments, fish community composition only changed significantly in 50% of the study rivers depending on the occurrence of species sensitive to the structures introduced by the restoration treatments. These were lithophilic, rheophilic and invertivorous fishes, comprising several species listed in the Red List of endangered species, which used the added 16-32 mm gravel as juvenile habitat. Areas with introduced gravel were also most frequently used by spawning Salmo trutta, Thymallus thymallus and Phoxinus phoxinus. In contrast, active bioindication using Salmo trutta eggs indicated that none of the restoration treatments was sufficient to enhance habitat conditions in deeper substratum layers throughout the egg incubation period. Our results suggest that instream restoration measures can contribute to freshwater biodiversity conservation, but reproductive success of species depending on long-term improvement of interstitial water quality cannot be achieved without considering catchment effects and natural substratum dynamics.

AB  - We provide a broad overview of the underlying philosophy of ecological monitoring. We argue that the major characteristics of effective monitoring programs typically include: (1) Good questions. (2) A conceptual model of an ecosystem or population. (3) Strong partnerships between scientists, policy-makers and managers. (4) Frequent use of data collected.
   We classify monitoring programs into three categories - (1) Passive monitoring, which is devoid of specified questions or underlying study design and has limited rationale other than curiosity. (2) Mandated monitoring where environmental data are gathered as a stipulated requirement of government legislation or a political directive. The focus is usually to identify trends. (3) Question-driven monitoring, which is guided by a conceptual model and by a rigorous design that will typically result in a priori predictions that can be tested.
   There are advantages and disadvantages of mandated monitoring programs, which are typically large-scaled, and generally smaller-scaled, question-driven monitoring programs. For example, while question-driven monitoring programs can provide insights into the ecological processes giving rise to emergent environmental patterns, spatial generalization from them is difficult because results may not extrapolate well to other regions, states or to a national level. Conversely, while mandated monitoring can be useful for producing coarse level summaries of temporal changes in a target population or resource condition they may not identify the mechanism influencing a change in an ecosystem or an entity. A key remaining challenge is to develop much improved mandated monitoring programs through more widespread adoption of the features of successful question-driven monitoring programs in efforts to enhance biodiversity conservation and environmental management.

AB  - Monitoring and predicting the biogeochemical state of the ocean and marine ecosystems is an important application of operational oceanography that needs to be expanded. The accurate depiction of the ocean's physical environment enabled by Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) systems, in both real-time and reanalysis modes, is already valuable for various for various applications, such as the fishing industry and fisheries management. However, most of these applications require accurate estimates of both physical and biogeochemical ocean conditions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we discuss recent developments that enable coupling new biogeochemical models and assimilation components with the existing GODAE systems, and we examine the potential of such systems in several areas of interest: phytoplankton biomass monitoring in the open ocean, ocean carbon cycle monitoring and assessment, marine ecosystem management at seasonal and longer time scales, and downscaling in coastal areas. A number of key requirements and research priorities are then identified for the future, GODAE systems will need to improve their representation of physical variables that are not yet considered essential, such as upper-ocean vertical fluxes that are critically important to biological activity. Further, the observing systems will need to be expanded in terms of in situ platforms (with intensified deployments of sensors for O-2 and chlorophyll, and inclusion of new sensors for nutrients, zooplankton, micronekton biomass, and others), satellite missions (e.g., hyperspectral instruments for ocean color, lidar systems for mixed-layer depths, and wide-swath altimeters for coastal sea level), and improved methods to assimilate these new measurements.

AB  - The US food system, from field to table, is at a crossroads for change. Improving the sustainability of this complex system requires a thorough understanding of the relationships between food consumption behaviors, processing and distribution activities, and agricultural production practices. A product life cycle approach provides a useful framework for studying the links between societal needs, the natural and economic processes involved in meeting these needs, and the associated environmental consequences. The ultimate goal is to guide the development of system-based solutions. This paper presents a broad set of indicators covering the life cycle stages of the food system. Indicators address economic, social, and environmental aspects of each life cycle stage: origin of (genetic) resource; agricultural growing and production; food processing, packaging and distribution; preparation and consumption; and end of life. The paper then offers an initial critical review of the condition of the US food system by considering trends in the various indicators. Current trends in a number of indicators threaten the long-term economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the US food system. Key trends include: rates of agricultural land conversion, income and profitability from farming, degree of food industry consolidation, fraction of edible food wasted, diet related health costs, legal status of farmworkers, age distribution-of farmers, genetic diversity, rate of soil loss and groundwater withdrawal, and fossil fuel use intensity. We suggest that effective opportunities to enhance the sustainability of the food system exist in changing consumption behavior, which will have compounding benefits across agricultural production, distribution and food disposition stages.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity (the pattern of response of organisms to changes in environmental conditions) and phenotypic integration (the pattern of character correlations) are important components of our understanding of the evolution of complex phenotypes. Most studies published so far in this area have been conducted within populations with the express aim of predicting future response to evolutionary forces. However, among-population differentiation for plasticity and trait correlations are important indicators of recent past events that have shaped the currently observable phenotypes. We investigated variation in the reaction norms of several traits in a large number of accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to different levels of light quantity as well as the environmental lability of the corresponding across-population character variance-covariance matrix. Our results show that there is an astounding degree of inter-population variation for character means and very little variation for plasticity, in agreement with the idea that A. thaliana is a light-specialist often occurring in open, disturbed habitats. However, this plant also shows patterns of plasticity that are predicted to be adaptive based on functional ecological considerations, such as an increase in either specific leaf area or leaf number (but not both) under low light. We also demonstrate that the set of character correlations in A. thaliana is extremely stable to changes in light availability, contrary to previous findings in the same species when different environmental factors were considered. Several processes that might have been responsible for the observed patterns are discussed as a prelude to follow-up research on these problems.

AB  - In this study, six approaches were used to characterize hydrological changes in the Cepkeliai wetland complex (southeast Lithuania), namely (i) local water-table measurements (WTM), (ii) testate amoebae analysis, (iii) tree-ring width (TRW) series, (iv) peat stratigraphic data, (v) (hydro-) meteorological data (precipitation and river runoff), and (vi) a diachronic analysis of aerial photographs as well as historical maps. This multi-proxy framework provides complementary information on the hydrological evolution of the peatland and offers a unique opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of each approach. Local water-table measurements, for example, generated monthly resolved and precise ( +/- 0.01 m) hydrological information, but were limited to a 16-year period. On the other hand, the TRW data generated annually-resolved information linked to hydrological shifts over the period 1848-2018, but did not allow reconstruction of the amplitude of hydrological variations. Amongst the proxy records, the testate amoebae distribution is the only approach that gives a direct measurement of changes in water-table depths. At the same time, the approach is limited by chronological inaccuracies and weaker resolutions, similar to peat stratigraphic records. The meteorological data are theoretically representing the most highly resolved records. However, due to hydrological lags and feedbacks in peatlands, it was difficult to link regional changes observed in meteorological records to local changes in the peatland. The aerial photographs and historical maps offered an opportunity to document large-scale vegetation changes, which is useful for upscaling local results, but they may not capture rapid changes. Despite all these limitations, at Cepkeliai, most of the proxy records are in agreement with each other and suggest relatively moist conditions with water levels close to the peat surface during the late 1800s and early 1900s, followed by more detailed information towards the present showing shifts towards drier peat surface conditions during the 1930s and 1940s. The 1960s were dry, followed by a short, moist episode during the 1970s, and returning to drier conditions during the 1980s. A gradual change towards moister conditions was recorded over the 1990s and 2000s. The last decade in our records started with relatively wet conditions to end with lower water levels over the most recent years.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pose adverse risks to ecosystems and public health because of their carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. As such, the extensive occurrence of PAHs represents a worldwide concern that requires urgent solutions. Wastewater treatment plants are not, however, designed for PAH removal and often become sources of the PAHs entering surface waters. Among the technologies applied in PAH remediation, constructed wetlands (CWs) exhibit several cost-effective and eco-friendly advantages, yet a systematic examination of the application and success of CWs for PAH remediation is missing. This review discusses PAH occurrence, distribution, and seasonal patterns in surface waters during the last decade to provide baseline information for risk control and further treatment. Furthermore, based on the application of CWs in PAH remediation, progress in understanding and optimising PAH-removal mechanisms is discussed focussing on sediments, plants, and microorganisms. Wetland plant traits are key factors affecting the mechanisms of PAH removal in CWs, including adsorption, uptake, phytovolatilization, and biodegradation. The physico-chemical characteristics of PAHs, environmental conditions, wetland configuration, and operation parameters are also reviewed as important factors affecting PAH removal efficiency. Whilst significant progress has been made, several key problems need to be addressed to ensure the success of large-scale CW projects. These include improving performance in cold climates and addressing the toxic threshold effects of PAHs on wetland plants. Overall, this review provides future direction for research on PAH removal using CWs and their large-scale operation for the treatment of PAH-contaminated surface waters.

AB  - The right timing of animal physiology and behaviour ensures the stability of populations and ecosystems. To predict anthropogenic impacts on these timings, more insight is needed into the interplay between environment and molecular timing mechanisms. This is particularly true in marine environments. Using high-resolution, long-term daylight measurements from a habitat of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, we found that temporal changes in ultraviolet A (UVA)/deep violet intensities, more than longer wavelengths, can provide annual time information, which differs from annual changes in the photoperiod. We developed experimental set-ups that resemble natural daylight illumination conditions, and automated, quantifiable behavioural tracking. Experimental reduction of UVA/deep violet light (approximately 370-430 nm) under a long photoperiod (16 h light and 8 h dark) significantly decreased locomotor activities, comparable to the decrease caused by a short photoperiod (8 h light and 16 h dark). In contrast, altering UVA/deep violet light intensities did not cause differences in locomotor levels under a short photoperiod. This modulation of locomotion by UVA/deep violet light under a long photoperiod requires c-opsin1, a UVA/deep violet sensor employing G(i) signalling. C-opsin1 also regulates the levels of rate-limiting enzymes for monogenic amine synthesis and of several neurohormones, including pigment-dispersing factor, vasotocin (vasopressin/oxytocin) and neuropeptide Y. Our analyses indicate a complex inteplay between UVA/deep violet light intensities and photoperiod as indicators of annual time.
   The intensity of UVA light, in addition to the photoperiod, is shown to determine seasonal change in the marine mass spawning annelid Platynereis dumerilii.

AB  - We characterized the transport pathways of pharmaceuticals released from wastewater outfalls in one of Europe's largest estuarine systems (Tagus estuary, Portugal), to identify areas of ecological relevance prone to environmental degradation due to increased exposure to these emerging contaminants. Particle source, Lagrangian trajectories and arrivals over time (1, 6, and 10 days) were used as a proxy to determine the exposure potential and vulnerability of different habitats to an array of pharmaceuticals with different environmental degradation rates and half-lives. Then, exposure potential was combined with information on sensitive habitats to identify vulnerable areas in the estuary. Three different freshwater inflow scenarios were considered simulating Medium flow, No flow and flood conditions (High flow). Model results for areas with higher particle density were concordant with concentration hotspots of pharmaceuticals. Higher potential exposure in a larger area of the estuary was observed for the High freshwater flow; yet reduced particles export to adjacent coastal areas highlights the potential of estuaries and bays as particle sinks. In all modeled scenarios, vulnerable areas were predominantly located in the southern bays up to day 6, and later in eastern areas, which include a nature reserve. These areas are largely composed of intertidal soft substratum and salt marshes habitats, and thus warrant prioritization for monitoring and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals exposure in the Tagus estuary due to the higher risk of exposure of a wealth of vertebrate and invertebrate species that use them. This framework allowed the identification of vulnerable areas to pharmaceutical contamination and can be a valuable instrument to plan the location for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in estuaries and coastal areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic influence on riverine ecosystems has caused a drastic decline of natural floodplain ecosystems. Estuarine floodplains with their tidal influence are highly dynamic and harbour many rare and threatened plant species in Central Europe. This study focuses on the Dove Elbe River, which is an anabranch of the Elbe Estuary in Northwest Germany. In 1951, a sluice was built to disconnect the Dove Elbe River from the tidal influence of the Elbe River. This study aims to analyse changes in vegetation and environmental variables from 1951 to 2016. Therefore, 98 plots with vegetation records from 1951 along the Dove Elbe River were reassessed in 2016. 45 of the original plots were inventoried again, as 53 of the original plots were under water or majorly transformed, e.g. used as arable fields. Changes in vegetation type, diversity measures, species composition, and Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIV) for moisture and nutrition were analysed. The most remarkable outcome was the almost complete loss of wet pioneer vegetation types. While willows and other woody species were established on several plots with the former reed, Angelica archangelica community or Phalaris arundinacea community vegetation type, the intensification of agricultural land use caused a strong decline in species richness on grasslands. Overall, species richness per plot also decreased, and some threatened species were lost. The weighted average EIV for moisture clearly declined on all plots, which indicates drier conditions today compared to the mid-20th century. Our results reinforce the argument to restore the tidal influence along the Dove Elbe River.

AB  - Natural secondary succession of degraded soil has improved the ecological environment of the Loess Plateau, profoundly influencing the succession and dynamics of soil fungal communities restored grasslands in particular. This chronosequence and the varied topography of the Loess Plateau thus provide a unique opportunity to synchronously investigate the variation of soil quality and fungal communities as they develop over time and space. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the ITS rRNA gene region to analyze the fungal community at a local scale. Edaphic variables and fungal community characteristics were compared among three restoration durations (5, 20, and 30 years), two soil layers (topsoil and subsoil), and different topographic factors (slope positions and aspects). Edaphic variables displayed varying patterns with significant differences among restoration durations and soil layers, but no such topographic patterns were found. As succession proceeded, alpha and beta diversities of fungal communities changed as space changed; whereas, over time, the discrepancy in community composition between the two soil layers declined. Constructed co-occurrence networks of edaphic variables combined with fungal community composition and distribution patterns based on indicator and keystone species also varied among three durations. Fungal trophic guilds showed a contrasting distribution between the two soil layers, but they closely followed the soil nutrient conditions and metabolic characteristics of keystone species. Our results demonstrated that predictable spatial variation occurs in soil fungal communities in tandem with temporal succession and dynamics of indicator and keystone species in restored grassland on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - The estimation of biodiversity is complex in remote areas like Andean-Amazon piedmont where the lack of knowledge is noticeable and most species have not yet been identified. An alternative to the taxonomical approach to assess biodiversity and community structure is to study the body size structure of the community. The present study aimed to identify systematic changes of the size structure of fish communities along the altitudinal gradient of pristine Andean streams. At the same time, we assessed if size structure of fish communities could be an alternative or complementary approach to traditional taxonomic metrics of ecological assessment. This study was conducted along two rivers of eastern Andean piedmont: Hacha River and Alto Madre de Dios basin. Our analysis showed lower values of total size range, maximum length and number of size classes in the highest places and increasing in lower reaches of the rivers. Concerning abundance size spectra, we found flatter slopes (indicating higher relative abundance of large fish) and lower coefficient of determination (i.e. less linear size spectra) and intercept at y-axis on upstream reaches. On the other hand, fish abundance, species richness and species diversity increasing from upstream to downstream. These systematic changes on size-related variables were similar using both basins together or independently and may be used in future studies as management reference conditions when assessing the effect of perturbations in freshwater ecosystems, while bypassing the error associated with the lack of taxonomic information.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is considered as a primary indicator for water quality and foods for oyster growth in Apalachicola estuarine ecosystem. Assessment of chl-a concentration variation in response to river inflow is important for estuarine environmental research and management. In this study, remote sensing analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effects of river inflow on chlorophyll concentrations in Apalachicola Bay of Florida in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. A remote sensing model for chl-a was improved and applied to map spatial distributions of chl-a by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m resolution imageries in high-flow and low-flow seasons in 2001 and 2008. Chl-a values approximately ranged from the minimum 6 mu g/l to the maximum 29 mu g/l in the study period. Maximum chl-a concentration in high-flow season was almost twice above that in low-flow season. The averaged mean and minimum chl-a level in the high-flow season were approximately 42 and 28 % higher than those in low-flow season, respectively. The remote sensing mapping of chl-a was able to show spatial variations of chl-a in the entire bay under different flow conditions, which indicated its advantage over the traditional field data sampling for monitoring water quality over a large area of estuary. The MODIS 250-m remote sensing regression model presented from this study can be used to support monitoring and assessment of the spatial chl-a distribution in the bay for environmental research and management in Apalachicola Bay.

AB  - This paper reports the development and application of two Bayesian Network models to assist decision making on the environmental flows required to maintain the ecological health of the Daly River (Northern Territory, Australia). Currently, the Daly River is unregulated, with only a small volume of water extracted annually for agriculture. However, there is considerable pressure for further agricultural development in the catchment, particularly with demand for extra water extraction during the dry season (May-November).
   The abundances of two fish species-barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and sooty grunter (Hephaestus fuliginosus)-were chosen as the ecological endpoints for the models, which linked dry season flows to key aspects of the biology of each species. Where available, data were used to define flow-fish habitat relationships, but most of the relationships were defined by expert opinion because of a lack of quantified ecological knowledge.
   Recent field data on fish abundances were used to validate the models and gave prediction errors of 20-30%. The barramundi model indicated that the adult sub-population was key to overall fish abundance, with this sub-population particularly impacted by the timing of abstraction (early vs. late dry season). The sooty grunter model indicated that the juvenile sub-population dominated the overall abundance and that this was primarily due to the amount of hydraulically suitable riffle habitat. If current extraction entitlements were fully utilized, the models showed there would be significant impacts on the populations of these two fish species, with the probability of unacceptable abundances increasing to 43% from 25% for sooty grunter and from 36% for barramundi under natural conditions.

AB  - The siliciclastic lacustrine rocks of the similar to 1000 Ma Diabaig Formation, northwest Scotland, contain a remarkable diversity of macroscopic structures on bedding planes that can be compared with various kinds of microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS). Field sedimentological investigations, combined with laboratory analysis of bedding planes and petrographic study of thin sections have allowed us to characterise a range of depositional environments and document the spectrum of biological structures. MISS are reported from frequently subaerial environments, through commonly submerged facies, and down to permanently sub-wavebase settings. Palaeoenvironmental conditions (water depth, exposure, hydrodynamic energy) control the distribution of MISS within these facies. This demonstrates that mat-forming microbial communities were arguably well adapted to low light levels or periodic exposure. Some MISS from the Diataig Formation are typical of Precambrian microbial mats, including reticulate fabrics and 'old elephant skin' textures. In addition to these, a number of new and unusual fabrics of putative microbial origin are described, including linear arrays of ridges and grooves (cf. 'Arumberia') and discoidal structures that are comparable with younger Ediacaran fossils such as Beltanelliformis. These observations indicate that benthic microbial ecosystems were thriving in freshwater lake systems similar to 1000 Ma, and indicate how microbially induced sedimentary structures may be applied as facies indicators for Proterozoic lacustrine environments. The discovery of structures closely resembling Ediacaran fossils (cf. Beltanelliformis) also serves to highlight the difficulty of interpreting simple discoidal bedding plane structures as metazoan fossils. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Savanna rangelands are undergoing rapid environmental change and the need to monitor and manage landscape health is becoming increasingly an imperative of government agencies and research organizations. Remotely sensed ecological indicators of disturbance offer a potential approach, particularly in the context of issues of scale required to assess and monitor extensive rangeland areas. The objective of this research is to analyse the potential of spatially explicit ecological indicators of disturbance to explain the spatial variability in species diversity and abundance (including introduced flora species) in rangelands. For two mapped rangeland ecosystem types in northern Australia, regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between species diversity and abundance, and remotely sensed ground cover time series statistics, foliage projective cover, and a precipitation deficit index. It was assumed that the ecosystem types used had been mapped to represent uniform vegetation units and consequently predictors of environmental heterogeneity were not used in the regression analysis. It was found that the predictor variables performed well in explaining the variation in species diversity and abundance for the more open, homogenous and less topographically complex basalt ecosystem type and less effectively for the more structurally complex, more wooded and less disturbed metamorphic ecosystem type. The results indicate that, for mapped ecosystem types with low heterogeneity and topographic complexity, ground cover temporal mean and variance are potentially useful indicators of disturbance to species diversity and abundance, provided the local spatial variability in the climate signal is accounted for.

AB  - Habitat affinities of the red-listed and EU Habitat Directive moss species Hamatocaulis vernicosus and the more widely distributed allied species Scorpidium cossonii and Warnstorfia exannulata were analysed. Ecological preferences of these fen mosses, with respect to water pH, water conductivity, Ellenberg's moisture and nutrient indicator values, were compared in three different European locations (Bohemian Massif, the West Carpathians and Bulgaria) using logistic regressions fitted by means of Huisman-Olff-Fresco models. Inter-specific co-occurrences of the species were also investigated. Warnstorfia exannulata preferred slightly acid conditions, about pH 5.6 at all the locations studied. Ecological behaviour of S. cossonii was very similar at all the locations, where it occupied base-rich habitats (pH > 7). The pH optimum of H. vernicosus, occupying habitats in the middle part of the base richness gradient, varied between locations from 6.0 in Bulgaria to 6.7-7.0 in the West Carpathians and Bohemian Massif. Niche diversification followed the gradient in Ellenberg nutrient indicator values and was similar at all the locations. In the Bohemian Massif and Bulgaria, the occurrence of W exannulata was further associated with a relatively high moisture indicated by the Ellenberg indicator value. The results obtained from the Huisman-Olff-Fresco models accord with the results of inter-specific co-occurrences. Moreover, the latter method revealed a link between H. vernicosus and the occurrence of disjunctly occurring boreal sedges, suggesting the relic nature of H. vernicosus habitats at these locations.

AB  - Spatial organization of the macrobenthos in the Bou Regreg estuary, Moroccan Atlantic coast. On the Moroccan Atlantic coast, the Bou Regreg estuary has been disrupted by many human activities since more than 30 years, in relation with the extension of Rabat and Sale cities on its strands and especially the installation upstream of a dam in 1974. The aims of this work, realized from March 1998 to January 1999, were to establish a first ecological assessment of the subtidal ecosystem of the estuary after the achievement of the dam, before the establishment of a large development of the area. The results of hydrological analyses showed an upstream shifting of salinity in comparison with the previous situation. Multivariate analyses showed three communities successively distributed from the sea to the upper part of the estuary. The hydrological factors expressed by the distance from the mouth of the estuary seem to be the main factors that controlled the three macrozoobenthic communities, from downstream to upstream respectively: (1) the Haustorius arenarius community, composed of two assemblages dominated respectively by Gastrosaccus spinifer and Solen marginatus; (2) the Cerastoderma edule community, characterized by a high species richness, dominated by tolerant species with opportunistic ones, indicating a strong organic matter impact; (3) the Scrobicularia plana community that characterizes estuarine environmental conditions. Biotic indices values, using ecological groups of macrofauna species, indicated that this estuary is globally unbalanced, excepted at the mouth part. A comparison with the situation before the construction of the dam in 1974 showed that the three main communities are still present, but that their structure and relative extension have been strongly modified.

AB  - Wildlife conservation in urban habitats is increasingly important due to current urbanization trends. We review the different approaches to studying birds in urban landscapes, and point out the importance of the habitat island ecological theory as a research framework for the management and conservation of urban birds. Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds. We present a conceptual model for urban bird conservation, which includes three aspects (management, environmental education and research) and new alternatives to promote the involvement of different sectors of the society.

AB  - A methodology was developed for deriving quantitative exposure criteria useful for comparing a site or a watershed to a reference condition and for defining the occurrence of extreme exposures. The prototype method used indicators of exposures to oil contamination and combustion by-products, naphthalene (NAPH)-type and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-type biliary metabolites from white suckers (Catostomus commersoni). The fish were collected from first- to third-order streams in the Regional Environmental Monitoring Assessment Program (REMAP) study of the Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion at randomly selected sires and from third- or higher-order streams in conjunction with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) Biomonitoring Program. which sampled sites of concern and reference sites selected by ecologists. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites were measured using fixed-wavelength fluorescence with excitation/emission pairs at 290/335 nm for NAPH-type and 380/430 nm for BaP-type metabolites. Exposure criteria values were selected for each type of metabolite for both the REMAP study and the OEPA reference sites following the recommendations of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. Exposure criteria derived for each metabolite were not significantly different for REMAP and OEPA reference sites. More than one half of the OEPA nonreference sites were found to be contaminated, exceeding criteria values for both types of metabolites. This method for finding meaningful exposure criteria can be used to develop criteria of exposure to other contaminants for other wildlife and other ecosystems.

AB  - Reuse of treated wastewater for crop irrigation has been widely adopted to mitigate the effects of water scarcity on agricultural yields and to help preserving the integrity of aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents the outcomes of one-year monitoring of a full-scale agro-industrial wastewater treatment plant designed for water reuse, with a multistage tertiary treatment based on sand filtration, membrane ultrafiltration, storage and on-demand UV disinfection. We aimed to test flow cytometry as a monitoring tool to provide on-site indications on tertiary treatment performances and on the quality of treated wastewater along the treatment scheme. Membrane ultrafiltration retained prokaryotic cells and E. con (>3 log). During storage of treated effluents, a significant decay of E. coil was observed together with the growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and the UV dis-infection was effective only against fecal indicators. The microbial quality of the treated effluent was comparable to the control groundwater locally used for irrigation. On-site rapid assessments by flow cytometry allowed unveiling crucial aspects affecting the microbiological quality of ultrafiltration permeate and treated effluent immediately after sampling, including plant operating performances and microbial removal patterns across the treatment train.

AB  - Gliricidia sepium in establishment was studied as live fence. Twenty cuttings were randomly selected from six different livestock exploitation conditions: 1) bank of leucaena for forage, 2) biomass bank of CT-115 in establishment, 3) equine resting area, 4) biomass bank of CT-115 under exploitation, 5) improved pasture of Cynodon nlemfuensis and 6) protein bank of leucaena-star grass under exploitation. The main indicators studied were cutting and insertion height of the first and last regrowth (descriptive indicators) and the number and distribution of plant regrowths, the number and percentage of regrowths consumed and the length of the last regrowth (growth indicators). Linear models were used to characterize each system and compare the performance of the different indicators between samplings. The cluster analysis was used as multivariate method to study the similarity between the exploitation conditions. In treatments 1, 2 and 5 there were no differences for the descriptive indicators (cutting height and height of the first and last regrowth). For these treatments, the largest lengths of the last regrowth (51.25, 89.50 and 110.65 cm) were found in the last sampling, not differing from the second (49.60 and 96.50 cm) in treatments 1 and 5. An opposite result was observed in treatment 3 where there was a difference for cutting height and insertion height of the first regrowth and the last regrowth with the lowest values (0.88, 0.11 and 0.85 m) in the last sampling, respectively. In treatments 4 and 6 there were no differences for the various heights. There was difference (P < 0.001) for the number of regrowths and the percentage of regrowths eaten in treatment 6. These indicators were null in treatment 4. The results of the cluster analysis for the descriptive and growth indicators allowed the establishment of three groups of similar conditions in both cases. All the distribution conditions of the regrowths had the same performance pattern. The greatest percentage of regrowths was found in strata 1 and 2. This study proved that some indicators relating plant growth and development should be considered for establishing trees and shrubs. Special emphasis should be made on the biological characteristics of these species. Thus, this will permit to create the basis for supporting studies on the establishment of trees as live fences in silvopastoral systems.

AB  - The energy potential of high-organic loaded agro-industrial effluents receiving biological treatment is often neglected, particularly in emergent regions, because of different technical and regulatory drawbacks. In addition, small alternative bioenergy sources are forced to compete disadvantageously with conventional energy supply, hindering their more extended exploitation. Thus, smart strategies to prove the environmental/economic potential of biogas and sludge produced in biological wastewater treatment systems (Bio-WWTs) are required to promote them as truly sustainable energy sources. In this view, the present study depicts a refined methodological framework for a more appropriate appraisal of Bio-WWTs promoting bioenergy recovery. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and emergy analysis (EmA) methods were merged around the statement of some identified and stated Principle-Criteria of Sustainability (PCS) for this kind of "water-energy nexus." As a result, a novel set of four single sustainability development indicators (SDIs) and one aggregated SDI were obtained to address sustainable conditions for valorization of bio-energy from agro-industrial Bio-WWTs. These indicators were made up of an environmental term coming from an LCA based on a system expansion approach as well as a second or "eco-economic" term obtained by means of EmA. This work introduces and shapes the "additionality" notion as an expression of overall sustainability and uses novel sustainability charts to interpret the obtained SDIs and their shifting or changes for different Bio-WWTs' life cycle scenarios. The "proof of concept" of this methodology is discussed along the obtained results for two case studies in Colombia.

AB  - The Planetary Boundaries concept is a recent scientific framework, which identifies a set of nine bio-physical limits of the Earth system that should be respected in order to maintain conditions favourable to further human development. Crossing the suggested limits would lead to drastic changes in human society by disrupting some of the ecological bases that underlie the current socio-economic system. As a contribution to the international discussion, and using the case of Switzerland, this study proposes a methodology to apply the Planetary Boundaries concept on the national level. Taking such an approach allows to assess the environmental sustainability of the socio-economic activities (e.g. consumption) by the inhabitants of a country in a long-term global perspective, assuming that past, current and future populations on Earth have similar "rights" to natural resources. The performance of countries is evaluated by comparing the country limits with their environmental footprints according to a consumption-based perspective. An approach was developed to: i) better characterise the Planetary Boundaries and understand which limits can effectively be currently quantified; ii) identify related socio-economic indicators for which both country limits and footprints can be computed; iii) compute values for limits, footprints and performances (at global and country level); and iv) suggest priorities for action based on the assessment of global and national performances. It was found that Switzerland should, as a priority, act on its footprints related to Climate Change, Ocean Acidification, Biodiversity Loss and Nitrogen Loss. The methodology developed herein can be applied to the analysis of other countries or territories, as well as extended to analyse specific economic sectors.

AB  - Disturbed ecosystems often exhibit increased community heterogeneity when compared to nondisturbed systems. One way to measure community heterogeneity is statistical dispersion, a measure of how variable individual samples are from the multivariate average of the community condition (species presence/absence and density). In more specific manner, dispersion measures the distance between an individual data point and the centroid, the multivariate average of all data points. Statistical dispersion may be an important parameter to include in environmental assessments, or in studies that attempt to understand the role of disturbances in structuring biological systems. However, disturbances have been observed to increase, decrease, or not impact community dispersion (or community heterogeneity). Therefore, the usefulness of dispersion in studying or identifying disturbances is unclear. We tested if a mechanical disturbance increased community dispersion using the infaunal community of the intertidal mudflats along the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. We observed no statistically significant increase in community dispersion with varying frequency and intensity of a mechanical disturbance. This is likely a result of disturbed and nondisturbed treatments being dominated by the same six taxa, thus minimizing dispersion. Therefore, in ecosystems where differences in community successional stages are subtle (a result of changes in relative abundance rather than species replacement), community dispersion may not be an informative parameter when investigating disturbance. Despite this, we suggest that dispersion can be a useful variable to include in studies attempting to understand or identify disturbances; however, dispersion should only be one parameter amongst many used to understand or identify disturbances.

AB  - To explore the effect of environment conditions on immune activity of fish, eight immune-associated genes responsible for innate immunity were selected from the GenBank, i.e. Pgrn-a, Ifit2, P-hepcidin, Lect2, beta 2m, Irf1, Il25 and Hsp96, and the mRNA expressions of them in the kidney of cultured large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea in different sea areas in the East China Sea were examined with qPCR techniques. In the contrasts of immune-associated gene expression between areas and populations, significant differences were found, expression levels of these immune-associated genes were lower in the clear water area than in the poor water quantity area, and lower in May than in October. MY was more sensitive to environmental factors than DQ, which was coincident with the water quality in the culturing areas. Differential analyses of the expression levels of these immune-associated genes showed that significant up-regulation could be triggered by poor environmental factors. The expression patterns indicated that the expression levels of these genes were sensitive to ecological changes, thereby the immune-associated genes, especially Pgrn-a, Ifit2, beta 2m, Il25 and Hsp96, might serve as immediate and sensitive indicators of population immunologic vigor and ecosystem health. But the expression of immunity-associated genes at the level of gene transcription is highly influenced by multiple factors, and the exact causes or influencing factors of the up-regulation or down-regulation of these genes still need further thorough investigation.

AB  - Channelization of streams and rivers to facilitate timber floating has cut off riparian zones from the channel, covered them with coarse sediment and resulted in less flooding. Restoration measures aiming to counteract these impacts are expected to create a higher, more natural hydrological variability and enhance site quality for riparian plants. In a long-term field experiment, we evaluated the effect of flooding regime on riparian plant performance by measuring survival and biomass increment of two transplanted phytometer species, a grass (Molinia caerulea) and a forb (Filipendula ulmaria). We also analysed the number and duration of flooding events in channelized and restored stream and river reaches with an indirect method using diurnal temperature oscillation. We found that flow duration was higher, with significantly more flood events at restored compared with channelized sites in medium-sized and large watercourses, particularly during the summer months. Phytometer performance was better at restored sites, and it was positively correlated with duration and frequency of summer flooding, indicating that more but less intense floods after restoration improved site conditions for phytometer growth. This may not only result from an increased heterogeneity in channel morphology caused by the return of boulders but can probably also be attributed to a reduced current velocity at restored sites. Flood variables were more often correlated with other abiotic variables at restored than at channelized sites, which points to an increased land-water connectivity as a result of restoration.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) emissions from naturally ventilated dairy barns affect the environment and the wellbeing of humans and animals. Our study improves the understanding of the dependency of emission rates on climatic conditions with a particular focus on temperature. Previous investigations of the relation between gas emission and temperature mainly rely on linear regression or correlation analysis.
   We take up a preceding study presenting a multilinear regression model based on NH3 and CH4 concentration and temperature measurements between 2010 and 2012 in a dairy barn for 360 cows in Northern Germany. We study scatter plots and non-linear regression models for a subset of these data and show that the linear approximation comes to its limits when large temperature ranges are considered. The functional dependency of the emission rates on temperature differs among the gases. For NH3, the exponential dependency assumed in previous studies was proven. For methane, a parabolic relation was found. The emissions show large daily and annual variations and environmental impact factors like wind and humidity superimpose the temperature dependency but the functional shape in general persists.
   Complementary to the former insight that high temperature increases emissions, we found that in the case of CH4, also temperatures below 10 degrees C lead to an increase in emissions from ruminal fermentation which is likely to be due to a change in animal activity. The improved prediction of emissions by the novel non-linear model may support more accurate economic and ecological assessments of smart barn concepts. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Alteration of the spatial variability of natural flow regimes has been less studied than that of the temporal variability, despite its ecological importance for river ecosystems. Here, we aimed to quantify the spatial patterns of flow regime alterations along a river network in the Sagami River, Japan, by estimating river discharge under natural and altered flow conditions. We used a distributed hydrological model, which simulates hydrological processes spatiotemporally, to estimate 20-year daily river discharge along the river network. Then, 33 hydrologic indices (i.e., Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) were calculated from the simulated discharge to estimate the spatial patterns of their alterations. Some hydrologic indices were relatively well estimated such as the magnitude and timing of maximum flows, monthly median flows, and the frequency of low and high flow pulses. The accuracy was evaluated with correlation analysis (r > 0.4) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (alpha = 0.05) by comparing these indices calculated from both observed and simulated discharge. The spatial patterns of the flow regime alterations varied depending on the hydrologic indices. For example, both the median flow in August and the frequency of high flow pulses were reduced by the maximum of approximately 70%, but these strongest alterations were detected at different locations (i.e., on the mainstream and the tributary, respectively). These results are likely caused by different operational purposes of multiple water control facilities. The results imply that the evaluation only at discharge gauges is insufficient to capture the alteration of the flow regime. Our findings clearly emphasize the importance of evaluating the spatial pattern of flow regime alteration on a river network where its discharge is affected by multiple water control facilities.

AB  - The climate change risk to biodiversity operates alongside a range of anthropogenic pressures. These include habitat loss and fragmentation, which may prevent species from migrating between isolated habitat patches in order to track their suitable climate space. Predictive modelling has advanced in scope and complexity to integrate: (i) projected shifts in climate suitability, with (ii) spatial patterns of landscape habitat quality and rates of dispersal. This improved ecological realism is suited to data-rich model species, though its broader generalisation comes with accumulated uncertainties, e.g. incomplete knowledge of species response to variable habitat quality, parameterisation of dispersal kernels etc. This study adopts ancient woodland indicator species (lichen epiphytes) as a guild that couples relative simplicity with biological rigour. Subjectively-assigned indicator species were statistically tested against a binary habitat map of woodlands of known continuity (>250 yr), and bioclimatic models were used to demonstrate trends in their increased/decreased environmental suitability under conditions of 'no dispersal'. Given the expectation of rapid climate change on ecological time-scales, no dispersal for ancient woodland indicators becomes a plausible assumption. The risk to ancient woodland indicators is spatially structured (greater in a relative continental compared to an oceanic climatic zone), though regional differences are weakened by significant variation (within regions) in woodland extent. As a corollary, ancient woodland indicators that are sensitive to projected climate change scenarios may be excellent targets for monitoring climate change impacts for biodiversity at a site-scale, including the outcome of strategic habitat management (climate change adaptation) designed to offset risk for dispersal-limited species.

AB  - The availability and composition of dissolved nitrogen in ocean waters are factors that influence species composition in natural phytoplankton communities. The same factors affect the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon incorporation in calcifying species, such as the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Lohman) W. W. Hay et H. Mohler. E. huxleyi has been shown to thrive on various nitrogen sources, including dissolved organic nitrogen. Nevertheless, assimilation of dissolved nitrogen under nitrogen-replete and -limited conditions is not well understood in this ecologically important species. In this study, the complete amino acid sequences for three functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in E. huxleyi were identified: a putative formamidase, a glutamine synthetase (GSII family), and assimilatory nitrate reductase. Expression patterns of the three enzymes in cells grown on inorganic as well as organic nitrogen sources indicated reduced expression levels of nitrate reductase when cells were grown on NH4+ and a reduced expression level of the putative formamidase when growth was on NO3-. The data reported here suggest the presence of a nitrogen preference hierarchy in E. huxleyi. In addition, the gene encoding for a phosphate repressible phosphate permease was more highly expressed in cells growing on formamide than in cells growing on inorganic nitrogen sources. This finding suggests a coupling between phosphate and nitrogen metabolism, which might give this species a competitive advantage in nutrient-depleted environments. The potential of using expression of genes investigated here as indicators of specific nitrogen-metabolism strategies of E. huxleyi in natural populations of phytoplankton is discussed.

AB  - Based on the Treaty on Biological Diversity of Rio de Janeiro in 1992 for maintaining and increasing biodiversity, several countries have started programmes monitoring soil quality and the above- and below ground biodiversity. Within the European Union, policy makers are working on legislation for soil protection and management. Therefore, indicators are needed to monitor the status of the soils and these indicators reflecting the soil quality, can be integrated in working standards or soil quality metrics. Soil micro-organisms, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMP), are indicative of soil changes. These soil fungi live in symbiosis with the great majority of plants and are sensitive to changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the soil. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AMF are reliable and sensitive indicators for disturbances in the soils and can be used for the development of soil quality metrics. Also, it was studied whether soil quality metrics based on AMF meet requirements to applicability by users and policy makers. Ecological criterions were set for the development of soil quality metrics for different soils. Multiple root samples containing AMF from various locations in The Netherlands were analyzed. The results of the analyses were related to the defined criterions. This resulted in two soil quality metrics, one for sandy soils and a second one for clay soils, with six different categories ranging from very bad to very good. These soil quality metrics meet the majority of requirements for applicability and are potentially useful for the development of legislations for the protection of soil quality.

AB  - Lake Okeechobee, Florida, located in the middle of the larger Kissimmee River-Lake Okeechobee-Everglades ecosystem in South Florida, serves a variety of ecosystem and water management functions including fish and wildlife habitat, flood control, water supply, and source water for environmental restoration. As a result, the ecological status of Lake Okeechobee plays a significant role in defining the overall success of the greater Everglades ecosystem restoration initiative. One of the major ecological indicators of Lake Okeechobee condition focuses on the near-shore and littoral zone regions as characterized by the distribution and abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and giant bulrush (Scirpus californicus (C.A. Mey.) Steud.). The objective of this study is to present a stoplight restoration report card communication system, common to all 11 indicators noted in this special journal issue, as a means to convey the status of SAV and bulrush in Lake Okeechobee. The report card could be used by managers, policy makers, scientists and the public to effectively evaluate and distill information about the ecological status in South Florida. Our assessment of the areal distribution of SAV in Lake Okeechobee is based on a combination of empirical SAV monitoring and output from a SAV habitat suitability model. Bulrush status in the lake is related to a suitability index linked to adult survival and seedling establishment metrics. Overall, presentation of these performance metrics in a stoplight format enables an evaluation of how the status of two major components of Lake Okeechobee relates to the South Florida restoration program, and how the status of the lake influences restoration efforts in South Florida.

AB  - A wide range of hydrologic modeling tools based on geographic information systems are available to aid urban planning, design, and environmental assessment by providing an understanding of how urban development impacts water quality and water quantity. These tools range from complex, data-intensive, process-based simulation models to simpler, empirical, coefficient-based approaches. We use a case study watershed in San Diego, California, to illustrate the potential contribution of physically based models as a means to evolve conceptual understanding of geographic pattern and process, rather than the prediction of aggregate watershed behavior. We use the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System to examine interactions between internal watershed processes that lead to runoff production. Through this case study, we address the issue of limited streamflow data for model calibration, a requirement that is often difficult to meet in smaller, ungauged watersheds. We illustrate how flow data from a similar watershed, combined with sensitivity analysis, can serve to compensate for this data limitation in the context of understanding urban impacts on hydrologic behavior. We then use this modeling approach to demonstrate that the conclusions made about the effects of urbanization on streamflow are a complex function of interactions between the watershed drainage network configuration and antecedent soil moisture conditions. Further we show that these qualitative, but potentially useful conclusions do not depend on precise knowledge of uncertain parameters such as soil hydraulic conductivity. We discuss the overall "ease of use" of our modeling approach and the implications for environmental assessment and design.

AB  - Biological soil crusts are key mediators of carbon and nitrogen inputs for arid land soils and often represent a dominant portion of the soil surface cover in and lands. Free-living soil nematode communities reflect their environment and have been used as biological indicators of soil condition. In this study, we test the hypothesis that nematode communities are successionally more mature beneath well-developed, late-successional stage crusts than immature, early-successional stage crusts. We identified and enumerated nematodes by genus from beneath early- and late-stage crusts from both the Colorado Plateau, Utah (cool, winter rain desert) and Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico (hot, summer rain desert) at 0-10 and 10-30 cm depths. As hypothesized, nematode abundance, richness, diversity, and successional maturity were greater beneath well-developed crusts than immature crusts. The mechanism of this aboveground-belowground link between biological soil crusts and nematode community composition is likely the increased food, habitat, nutrient inputs, moisture retention, and/or environmental stability provided by late-successional crusts. Canonical correspondence analysis of nematode genera demonstrated that nematode community composition differed greatly between geographic locations that contrast in temperature, precipitation, and soil texture. We found unique assemblages of genera among combinations of location and crust type that reveal a gap in scientific knowledge regarding empirically derived characterization of dominant nematode genera in deserts soils and their functional role in a crust-associated food web.

AB  - Wildfire poses risks to fish and wildlife habitat, among other things. Management projects to reduce the severity of wildfire effects by implementing hazardous fuel reduction treatments also pose risks. How can land managers determine which risk is greater? Comparison of risks and benefits from fuel treatment projects to risks from severe wildfire effects is consistent with policies requiring public land managers to analyze short- and long-term environmental effects. However, formulating the problem as a comparison of temporal considerations often results in decisions to reject fuels treatment projects near imperiled species habitat, even though the adverse effects of short-term project actions may result in substantial long-term net benefits from reducing the severity of wildfire effects. Consistent with widely accepted ecological risk assessment methods, the problem is formulated in a conceptual model. Salmonid fish populations are the risk assessment endpoint, and one stressor adversely affecting them is sediment from wildfire or logging. The model compares short-term effects of implementing fuels reduction treatments to longer-term wildfire effects with and without fuel treatments, including risk reduction benefits. Used quantitatively or qualitatively, the model may contribute to sustainable resource management decisions by improving communication among stakeholders, risk managers in land and resource management agencies, and risk assessors in agencies responsible for enforcing the Endangered Species Act.

KELLEY (4120-Department of Biological Sciences, Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics Section, Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois 61790-4120). High white tailed deer density has negative impact on tallgrass prairie forbs. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 128:381-392, 2001.-We studied the effect of deer browsing on prairie forbs under conditions of high deer density (30 to 42 deer km(2)) on a single remnant tallgrass prairie in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources' Heidecke Lake Fish and Wildlife Area in northeastern Illinois. Almost no grasses or sedges were browsed and the frequency of browsing of graminoids was nearly the same in deer exclosure and reference plots. In contrast, deer browsed 3.5% to 18.9%, of the standing crop of forb stems depending upon time of sampling. Deer selectively browsed 2690 percent of the 100 species of (orbs sampled in at least one of nine samples taken over three growing seasons. However, most species ( 17 of 26 selected species) were selected in only one sample. Highest browsing intensity occurred during late June and early July. Flowering sterns of 3 species of forbs were significantly less abundant in the reference plots than in the exclosure plots. indicating a potentially adverse effect of deer browsing on the reproductive success of these prairie forbs. Deer are most likely to influence prairie vegetation by causing a shift in plant species abundance and competitive abilities in a way that favors grasses over forbs and reduces prairie plant diversity.

AB  - In order to understand the variation of Estonian calcareous thin-soil grasslands on Ordovician or Silurian lime stone (alvars), 58 stands, distributed over the whole alvar region of Estonia, were described and clustered numerically using TABORD. Alvars are characterized by a high species richness. These mainly semi-natural communities have mostly developed after clear-cutting of forests. Grazing by domestic animals and removal of woody plants is needed for their maintenance. Primary (natural) alvar grasslands are found in a few places in coastal regions or in areas with thin-soil on monolithic bedrock. In data processing a whole stand, described by several small releves, was used in the classification as one description, including species frequencies as a quantitative measure. Seven clusters were separated and their configuration checked in a PCA-ordination. The resulting classification agreed with the previous 'rough' classification. Both geographical and ecological factors were related with the clustering and the ordination. The broad classification units, suggested for Estonian alvar grasslands, were quite similar to the ones described earlier for alvar vegetation on Oland, Sweden. Clusters differed in their species richness, environmental conditions and life-form spectra. Differences in species richness were defined by regional species pools. Compared to earlier surveys, only a small fraction of alvars still remains in Estonia. Active conservation, i.e. suitable manage ment is needed to protect the still surviving valuable plant communities. The present study can provide guidelines on how to protect and manage different types of alvars in Estonia.

AB  - Because of the considerable uncertainties associated with modeling complex ecosystem processes, it is essential that every effort be made to test model performance prior to relying on model projections for assessment of future surface water chemical response to environmental perturbation. Unfortunately, long-term chemical data with which to validate model performance are seldom available. The authors present here an evaluation of historical acidification of lake waters in the northeastern United States, and compare historical changes in a set of lakes to hindcasts from the same watershed model (MAGIC) used to estimate future changes in response to acidic deposition. The historical analyses and comparisons with MAGIC model hindcasts and forecasts of acid-base response demonstrate that the acidic and low-ANC lakes in this region are responsive to strong acid inputs. However, the model estimates suggest lakewater chemistry is more responsive to atmospheric inputs of sulfur than do the estimates based on paleolimnological historical analyses. A 'weight-of-evidence approach' that incorporates all available sources of information regarding acid base response provides a more reasonable estimate of future change than an approach based on model projections alone. The results of these analyses have important implications for predicting future surface water chemical change in response to acidic deposition, establishing critical loads of atmospheric pollutants, and other environmental assessment activities where natural variation often exceeds the trends under investigation (high noise-to-signal ratio). Under these conditions, it is particularly important to evaluate future model projections in light of historical trends data.

AB  - Recent advances in high throughput phenotyping have made it possible to collect large datasets following plant growth and development over time, and those in machine learning have made inferring phenotypic plant traits from such datasets possible. However, there remains a dirth of datasets following plant growth under stress conditions along with methods for inferring them using only remotely sensed data, especially under a combination of multiple stress factors such as drought, weeds and nutrient deficiency. Such stress factors and their combinations are commonly encountered during crop production and being able to accurately detect and treat such stress conditions in an automated and timely manner can provide a major boost to farm yields with minimal resource input.
   We present a generic framework for remote plant stress phenotyping that consists of a dataset with spatio-temporal-spectral data following sugarbeet crop growth under optimal, drought, low and surplus nitrogen fertilization, and weed stress conditions, along with a machine learning based methodology for systematically inferring these stress conditions from the remotely measured data. The dataset contains biweekly color images, infra-red stereo image pairs and hyperspectral camera images along with applied treatment parameters and environmental factors like temperature and humidity, collected over two months. We present a plant agnostic methodology for deriving plant trait indicators such as canopy cover, height, hyperspectral reflectance and vegetation indices along with a spectral 3D reconstruction of the plants from the raw data to serve as a benchmark. Additionally, we provide fresh and dry weight measurements for both the above (canopy) and below (beet) ground biomass at the end of the growing period to serve as indicators of expected yield. We further describe a data driven, machine learning based method to infer water, Nitrogen and weed stress using the derived plant trait indicators. We use the plant trait indicators to evaluate 8 different classification approaches from which the best classifier achieved a mean cross validation accuracy of 93, 76 and 83% for drought, nitrogen and weed stress severity classification respectively. We also show that our multi-modal approach significantly improves classifier performance over using any single modality.
   The presented framework and dataset can serve as a valuable reference for creating and comparing processing pipelines which extract plant trait indicators and infer prevalent stress factors from remote sensing data under a variety of environments and cropping conditions. These techniques can then be deployed on farm machinery or robots enabling automated, precise and timely corrective interventions for maximising yield.

AB  - Knowledge brokering is a process of communication and interaction aimed at knowledge exchange and learning between parties with different knowledge bases This paper examines knowledge brokering in Arctic environmental assessment (EA) as a mechanism to support learning, build capacity, and sharing power. The study assessed enabling conditions and challenges to knowledge brokering in the eastern Canadian Arctic under the Nunavut EA process, managed by the Nunavut Impact Review Board. Methods included focus groups and review of legislation, process documents, and EA guidance to examine how the regulatory environment and Board's EA process support knowledge brokering. Results illustrate that if EA is to support knowledge brokering, it should focus not only on communities but also on EA institutions - those that directly enable and support knowledge brokering, and those that provide ancillary information and have important regulatory roles. Enabling EA as a platform for brokering knowledge also requires investment beyond that provided through project-by-project funding models. While many jurisdictions are catching up to EA systems in Canada's Arctic, and learning how to incorporate best-practices for Indigenous engagement and knowledge sharing, Nunavut's co-managed process offers a model and learning opportunities for exploring the implementation conditions necessary for effective knowledge brokering through EA.

TI  - Preference of German farmers for lease adaptation clauses referencing climate change and shifts in agricultural policy conditions
T2  - BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - Increasing fluctuations in yields and prices due to climate change and uncertainties due to changing agricultural policy conditions are leading to ever greater fluctuations in farm incomes. Furthermore, increased competition in the agricultural rental markets is leading to a rise in rental prices. In contrast to the income fluctuations, the annual rent to be paid represents a fixed annual amount, which can endanger the liquidity of the agricultural enterprises in low-income phases. Against this background, rent adjustment clauses can also cause the otherwise fixed rent to fluctuate depending on various exogenous variables, thus imitating a natural hedge. This study therefore seeks to examine which kind of lease contract and/or lease price adjustment clause farmers would prefer in the conclusion of a new lease contract generally and with regard to the twin risks of climate change and shifts in agricultural policy conditions. For this purpose, 156 German farmers were interviewed in the last quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 by means of an online survey. The results show that farmers generally prefer a lease without an adaptation clause when signing a new contract, whereas adaptation to on-farm indicators is preferred with regard to the sources of risk mentioned above. The results are therefore of interest for follow-up studies but also for tenants, lessors, agricultural advisors and agricultural economists.

AB  - The relationship between dew and airborne particles is important in urban ecosystems, but the capability of dew to remove airborne particles remains unclear. During 2015 in Changchun, China, 74 dew and particle samples were collected simultaneously to investigate their chemical characteristics under normal, fog, and haze conditions. Analyses included measuring total dissolved solids, total suspended particulates, PM2.5 and PM 10 concentrations, major cations ( NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), major anions (F-, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3-), and organic and elemental carbon. Results showed that air quality deteriorated during haze but improved in fog. The particle size distributions, major cations, and carbonaceous species documented in the dew and airborne particles demonstrated consistent synchronous patterns with values descending in the order haze > normal > fog conditions. We found that dew is a good indicator of near-surface air quality. Specifically, its water-soluble ions and carbonaceous species could be used to distinguish emission sources and to identify the presence of secondary organic carbon. Dew is more effective at removing airborne particles in normal weather than in haze or fog conditions; PM2.5 removal rates were 21.5%, 15.2%, and 13.7% on normal, foggy, and hazy days, respectively. Dew condensation processes reduce concentrations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in the near-surface layer.

AB  - Growing populations, changing market conditions, and the food security risks posed by rainfed cropping and climate change collectively indicate that Sub-Saharan African nations could benefit from transforming agricultural production to more intensive yet resilient and sustainable systems. Although highly underutilized, emerging evidence indicates that groundwater may be more widely available than previously thought, highlighting its potential role in facilitating such a transformation. Nevertheless, the possibility for such a transition is conditioned by number of complex factors. We therefore construct a transition index that integrates data considering groundwater and energy availability and cost, market access, infrastructural needs, farm conditions and natural resource stocks, labor availability, climate, population density, as well as economic and political framework variables, using a principal component analysis based methodology. Using the consequent multi-dimensional transition index and constituent intermediate indices, we provide an assessment of groundwater irrigation potential discussed in consideration of Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zambia, Namibia, Cameroon, and Zimbabwe. Our results, though preliminary, provide a methodology for conducting such an integrated assessment, while deriving a holistic set of policy options considering the transition towards appropriate use of groundwater for agricultural development.

AB  - Environmental factors such as seasonal cycles are the main chronic stress cause in fish increasing incidence of disease and mortality and affecting productive performance. Arapaima gigas (pirarucu) is an Amazonian air-breathing and largest freshwater fish with scales in the world. The captivity development of pirarucu is expanding since it can fatten up over 1 kg per month reaching 10 kg bodymass in the first year of fattening. This work was conducted in three periods (April to July 2010, August to November 2010, and December 2010 to March 2011) defined according to rainfall and medium temperatures. Seasonality effect analysis was performed on biochemical (lectin activity, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase activities) and hematological (total count of red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and hematimetric Wintrobe indexes) stress indicators, as well as on growth and wellbeing degree expressed by pirarucu condition factor developed in captivity. All biochemical and hematological stress indicators showed seasonal variations. However, the fish growth was allometrically positive; condition factor high values indicated good state of healthiness in cultivation. These results reinforce the robust feature of pirarucu and represent a starting point for understanding stress physiology and environmental changes during cultivation enabling identification and prevention of fish adverse health conditions.

AB  - Rivers are representative lotic freshwater ecosystems and are regarded as the lotic belt for transportation of nutrients and pollutants from the land to the sea. To understand the global research profile and fronts of river phytoplankton, 13,434 publications regarding river phytoplankton indexed by Web of Science during 1991-2016 were analyzed using a bibliometric approach. The EU Water Framework Directive presents a good case for promoting not only frequent cooperation between European countries but also the development of river phytoplankton studies. Such directives are anticipated to promote global consistency of the water evaluations and management in the future. Phytoplankton play important roles in bio-assessments and energy flow of river ecosystems. The trait-based method has many advantages compared with traditional methods based on community composition and metric indices. The trait-based method considers a complex mixture of stressors by combining qualitative and quantitative parameters but also transfers different geographic taxonomic compositions to a similar complement of traits. Moreover, phytoplankton-based food chains are generally considered to transfer energy and carbon more efficiently to higher trophic levels than bacterial-based food chains. Algae are a high-quality food for higher trophic levels, compared with bacteria and terrestrial material. The algal component of periphyton has been demonstrated to be the major basal component of stream food webs.

AB  - A concise methodological and conceptual overview of the present state of phytosociology, 100 years after its foundation, is presented. The fullness of phytosociology as a synecological science is highlighted. This scientific approach, which was inherent in phytosociology from the very beginning, has made great strides forward thanks to the detailed analysis of the conditions of vegetation populations, from the community level to that of dynamic successions found in landscape contexts. This has led to the creation and development of several integrated areas of analysis that have helped to produce highly predictive models based on the distribution of environmental gradients, which thus act as valid bio-indicators that can be used in environmental and planning management. The development of phytosociology has led over time to the need to reconsider the basic concept of association. In this article, we propose a new definition of association, updating the one drawn up by Braun-Blanquet in 1928, so that it reflects the conceptual evolution of the discipline more closely. In this new definition, the concept of "characteristic species" is replaced by the concept of "preferential species" in statistical and structural terms, even in territorial terms. Taken together, these species constitute the "characteristic composition of species", which expresses the "particular and autonomous ecology" of the association referred to in Braun-Blanquet's definition. The new definition also considers the greater knowledge we have gained of dynamic processes, which are no longer regarded as marginal aspects in the study of communities but are considered to be of fundamental importance in the transformation of plant landscape. The introduction of the concept of ecological value in the definition expresses, in quantitative terms, the response and the field of existence of an association according to the change in an environmental factor. As regards dynamic phytosociology, which is related to the concept of vegetation series (sigmetum), we suggest replacing the concept of climax, which is used to define the more mature stage of the serial trial and expresses the vegetation potential within the area of the series (tesela), with that of "current potential vegetation", by which we mean the vegetation that is identified at present and that is interpreted according to the historical study of successions. We also present the phytosociological approach to plant landscape, which leads to the definition of the landscape unit named geosigmetum, made up of an integrated system of vegetation series that is repeated in an area with the same edaphic, bioclimatic and biogeographic conditions. Nowadays such models express the distribution of vegetation according to environmental gradients; they allow the ecological meaning of different communities and serial successions to be assessed thoroughly, providing qualitative and quantitative values of the cenocline model that the geosynphytosociological analysis represents at the plant landscape level for every bioclimatic belt. Modern technologies in a GIS environment have led to huge progress being made in the cartographic representation of vegetation (vegetation map), of vegetation series (syndynamic vegetation map) and of the representation of plant landscape (plant landscape map). Lastly, some implementation issues are addressed within the context of the objectives of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), concerning the recognition of habitats and the definition of management plans.
   Furthermore, phytosociology has numerous applicaions in the agricultural sector thanks to the identification of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland areas and, more generally, to the new European Community Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is due to be implemented in 2013 and represents a radical reform of agricultural politics in favour of quality production and the environment.

AB  - Structural integrity assessment and monitoring of infrastructures are key factors to prevent and manage crisis events (natural disasters, terrorist attacks and so on) and ensure urban safety. This necessity motivates huge interest towards design, optimization and integration of non-invasive remote and in situ diagnostic techniques. In this framework, ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a well-assessed instrumentation, which allows one to attain information on the inner status of man-made structures while avoiding invasive tests. However, despite its potential, a more widespread use of GPR is actually affected by the difficulties in providing highly informative and easily interpretable images as an outcome of the overall diagnostics procedure. This drawback can be mitigated thanks to the use of microwave tomography (MT) as a data processing tool able to enhance the achievable reconstruction capabilities, and several proofs of its effectiveness have been already shown. In this paper, the potential of the MT approach is investigated in the framework of structural monitoring by an experiment carried out in the Montagnole test site in the French Alps, where the progressive damage of a one-scale concrete beam has been monitored thanks to the integration of several electromagnetic sensing techniques. In this framework, the capability of the MT-enhanced GPR strategy is examined with respect to the possibility of providing information about the damage of the rebar grid of the beam.

AB  - This study provides a unique method of inquiry for archaeological investigation with an aim to assess the intensity and effects of Neolithic and Bronze Age farming practices at Lough Dargan, northwest Ireland, through a multi-proxy analysis of a lake sediment core. Chironomid (non-biting midge fly) subfossils and lake sediment geochemistry (delta C-13, delta N-15 and C:N ratios) were used to assess changes in limnological conditions through time. The limnological data were compared with macroscopic charcoal concentration and pollen data to examine the potential influence that early farmers had on a freshwater lake system within a prehistorically active catchment. Results from the chironomid analysis show that the first substantial period of agricultural activity in the early Neolithic (c. 3730-3190 BC) resulted in a temporary shift to more eutrophic lake conditions. There is evidence of animal husbandry with substantial levels of animal waste reaching the lake, leaving an imprint in the geochemical record of increased delta N-15 values and decreased delta C-13 values and C:N ratios during this time. The chironomid community reverted back to its pre-impacted state c. 3190 BC in response to a period of reduced farming (c. 3390-3000 BC) which eventually led to a distinct lull in activity, with possible cessation of farming from 3000 to 2700 BC. A return to eutrophic conditions coincided with the gradual return of agriculture, with more permanently altered lake conditions dominating from 2400 BC, even during a 250-year period of reduced human activity commencing at c. 1440 BC. Increased sedimentation rate, along with increases in delta C-13, delta N-15 and C:N, the presence of chironomid taxa indicative of erosion, more eutrophic lake conditions and high concentrations of macroscopic charcoal all point to more intensive land use practices during the Bronze Age. Palaeolimnological data exhibited an immediate response to intensified farming during this time, and were especially responsive to pastoral farming due either to scale of activity or proximity to the lakeside. The success of this study demonstrates the effectiveness of palaeolimnological analysis in the investigation of prehistoric farming. This approach will help inform Neolithic and Bronze Age land-use practice and human environment relations in the region, and highlights the potential for chironomid-based archaeological research.

AB  - Secondary ion mass spectrometry is a powerful method for imaging biological samples with high spatial resolution. Whole section time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) scans and multivariate data analysis have been performed on the human spinal cord in order to delineate anatomical regions of interest based on their chemical distribution pattern. TOF-SIMS analysis of thoracic spinal cord sections was performed at 5 pm resolution within 2 h. Multivariate image analysis by means of principal component analysis and maximum auto correlation factor analysis resulted in detection of more than 400 m/z peaks that were found to be significantly changed. Here, the results show characteristic biochemical distributions that are well in line with major histological regions, including gray and white matter. As an approach for iterative segmentation, we further evaluated previously outlined regions of interest as identified by multivariate image analysis. Here, further discrimination of the gray matter into ventral, lateral, and dorsal neuroanatomical regions was observed. TOP-SIMS imaging has been carried out at submicrometer resolution obtaining localization and characterization of spinal motor neurons based on their chemical fingerprint, including neurotransmitter precursors that serve as molecular indicators for motor neuron integrity. Thus, TOP-SIMS can be used as an approach for chemical histology and pathology. TOP-SIMS holds immense potential for investigating the subcellular mechanisms underlying spinal cord related diseases including chronic pain and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Unspecific biological effects of chemically diverse solvents strikingly reveal the unifying motif of oxidant toxicity both in higher organisms and in aerobic bacteria. In a few spectacular cases, solvent metabolites with oxidant properties were demonstrated, which however cannot explain extrahepatic toxicity, e.g. in muscle and nerve cells. A common source of solvent-inducible oxidants, by contrast, is suggested to be located in mitochondria or, more general, in membranes where the respiratory chain operates. Orderly respiration depends on membrane integrity, which is invariably compromised by exposure to most solvents and many other lipophils. In rat mitochondria, toluene-induced membrane derangement has been directly implicated with superoxide production, resulting from autoxidation of the membrane-located respiratory redox-cycler ubisemiquinone. A related mechanism may occur in bacteria: Exposure of Escherichia coli to lipophils such as ethanol, tetralin, indole, chlorpromazine and procaine, or to heat shock, induces anti-oxidant proteins, which are reliable indicators of increased oxidant levels. Although many molecular details remain to be elucidated, this review documents that oxidant toxicity of lipophilic compounds is a common physiological phenomenon correlated with derangement of membranes where respiratory processes take place. Subjective consequences of acute oxidant injury are probably the hangover from alcohol and nicotine consumption, and the sudden death from recreational solvent abuse. Suggestions concerning oxidants as major contributors to ageing remain unchallenged.

AB  - There is an evidence that ginger enhance semen quality via improving different sperm parameters mainly count, viability, motility, morphology and DNA integrity. According to research results in various species, ginger seems to have strong antioxidant properties (due to the presence of active phenolic compounds) and androgenic activity. Ginger improves semen quality and increases fertility of sperm by disrupting the production of free radicals, dissolving oxidative chain reactions, reducing oxidative stress and altering the levels of gonadotropin hormones (LH, FSH) and sex hormones (such as testosterone). The antioxidant and androgenic properties of ginger give a sperm with normal morphological structure (head, middle and tail) and more integrated chromatin. The rate of DNA failure and damage to the mitochondrial genome in these cells is minimal and they have the most progressive motility, the highest viability and the best fertility. Therefore, the use of the ginger significantly improves the biological parameters of sperm (number, total motility, survival rate and normal morphology) and also increases all specialized fertility indicators of sperm. Tacking account of lacking literature and possibility of toxicity and adverse effect of ginger on vital organ, further clinical trial especially on evaluating the safety and clinical effect must be considered. Also, dose and duration of consumption by monitoring of health indicators and biochemical changes in all species such as human, animal and poultry must be applied.

AB  - Invertebrates are among the most diverse organisms on Earth, significantly contribute to ecosystem function and integrity, and possess high potential as bioindicators. By definition, invertebrates also are wildlife. Yet, inclusion of invertebrates in peer-reviewed wildlife journals has not been investigated. As such, our objective was to assess inclusion of invertebrates in prominent wildlife journals published in the last decade. Based on our review and first-hand experience, we also aimed to provide recommendations for integration of invertebrates into wildlife science, education, and peer-reviewed literature. We performed a systematic literature review by manually searching all issues and articles from 2003-2013 of the following journals: European Journal of Wildlife Research, Journal of Wildlife Management, South African Journal of Wildlife Research, Wildlife Biology, Wildlife Research, and Wildlife Society Bulletin. We analyzed data derived from our review to elucidate trends in the inclusion of invertebrates in these journals. We identified 4,916 articles that involved animal taxa, of which 122 (2.5%) included invertebrates and <1% included invertebrates as focal taxa. Our results indicated invertebrates are included in a minute portion of articles in top wildlife journals. We recommend a paradigm shift to a less taxonomically homogenized and vertebrate-centric approach to wildlife science and education, integrating invertebrates into wildlife studies, and publishing results of those studies in wildlife journals to facilitate effective management of all wildlife species.

AB  - In this paper I argue that the search for explainable models and interpretable decisions in AI must be reformulated in terms of the broader project of offering a pragmatic and naturalistic account of understanding in AI. Intuitively, the purpose of providing an explanation of a model or a decision is to make it understandable to its stakeholders. But without a previous grasp of what it means to say that an agent understands a model or a decision, the explanatory strategies will lack a well-defined goal. Aside from providing a clearer objective for XAI, focusing on understanding also allows us to relax the factivity condition on explanation, which is impossible to fulfill in many machine learning models, and to focus instead on the pragmatic conditions that determine the best fit between a model and the methods and devices deployed to understand it. After an examination of the different types of understanding discussed in the philosophical and psychological literature, I conclude that interpretative or approximation models not only provide the best way to achieve the objectual understanding of a machine learning model, but are also a necessary condition to achieve post hoc interpretability. This conclusion is partly based on the shortcomings of the purely functionalist approach to post hoc interpretability that seems to be predominant in most recent literature.

AB  - We observed the initial release rate of metals from four fresh (i.e., without long time exposure to the atmosphere) hydrothermal sulfide cores into artificial seawater. The sulfide samples were collected by seafloor drilling from the Okinawa Trough by D/V Chikyu, powdered under inert gas, and immediately subjected to onboard metal-leaching experiments at different temperatures (5 degrees C and 20 degrees C), and under different redox conditions (oxic and anoxic), for 1-30h. Zinc and Pb were preferentially released from sulfide samples containing various metals (i.e., Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) into seawater. Under oxic experimental conditions, Zn and Pb dissolution rates from two sulfide samples composed mainly of iron disulfide minerals (pyrite and marcasite) were higher than those from two other sulfide samples with abundant sphalerite, galena, and/or silicate minerals. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the high metal-releasing sample contained several galvanic couples of iron disulfide with other sulfide minerals, whereas the low metal-releasing sample contained fewer galvanic couples or were coated by a silicate mineral. The experiments overall confirmed that the galvanic effects with iron disulfide minerals greatly induce the initial release of Zn and Pb from hydrothermal sulfides into seawater, especially under warm oxic conditions.

AB  - The study seeks to do a pathological process for Tehran exhibition spaces and provide a solution for responsive space design to meet the needs of international exhibition by looking at the phenomenon of smart building. In this study, after examining the problems associated with existing and potential obstacles, it has been tried to design an appropriate space by using smart technology through explaining the available criteria and standards for exhibition space and also reviewing and analyzing successful examples of internal and external contexts and putting together the important indicators in an suitable and at the same time an economic attractive and ideal environment for users and comparison with the current situations and defects, which seems that besides preserving and conserving energy at high-traffic public places, provides a good physical condition for visitors.
   Localization and solving defects and possible barriers to hold exhibitions in order to attract more domestic and foreign audiences and promoting areas of mass communication are other objectives of this research. In order to perform the various stages of the thesis, we firstly describe, analyze and understand the current situation and then determine an outlook of ideal conditions and finally employ the result to design the space according to the exhibition space standards based on smart technology.

AB  - Evaluation of microbial water quality is commonly based on monitoring populations of fecal indicator organisms (FIO) such as Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT). The occurrence of elevated FIO concentrations in surface waters after storm events is well documented and has been attributed to runoff and sediment resuspension. The reasons for FIO concentration variation under baseflow conditions are less clear. The objective of this study was to quantify the variability of EC and ENT in two small streams running through agricultural land use areas. FIO concentrations were measured at upstream and downstream locations under baseflow conditions. Concentrations were not significantly different along cross-sections of the streams. Diurnal concentration trends were observed at each of the sampling locations. Significant differences in concentrations between upstream and downstream locations were noted for both creeks during baseflow periods when no runoff or sediment resuspension occurred. A hypothetical explanation is that indicator organisms are released from sediments during baseflow conditions due to the effect of groundwater influx into streams or due to the motility of indicator organisms. If confirmed, this hypothesis may affect our understanding of the role of sediments in the microbial quality of surface waters.

AB  - As the concept of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) has evolved, governments and other stakeholders have pursued three important frameworks for defining and pursuing SFM: public land forest policies, Criteria and Indicators and certification. In Canada, these three approaches frequently operate simultaneously as policy frameworks for private firms managing forests on public lands. Harmonization of these three frameworks could create potential benefits by simplifying a complicated array of sometimes conflicting forest management standards. But there are also potential costs of harmonization that could arise out of the diverse conditions that embody SFM. The diversity of social values and ecological conditions associated with forests creates difficulties in designing processes that are representative of stakeholders' interests. Moreover, this variety poses challenges to designing standards that are sufficiently flexible to address local conditions, yet useful in contributing to SFM planning and reporting at regional, provincial and national scales. Within this context, we suggest that the diversity inherent in SFM will continue to be accommodated by multiple management frameworks, unless a single framework arises that shows itself capable of being trusted by stakeholders and of being sufficiently flexible to accommodate various definitions of Sustainable Forest Management.

AB  - Flat pebble conglomerates were a common carbonate facies in Cambrian to Early Ordovician open marine settings, but they become extremely rare in these environments after this time. However, the Early Triassic witnessed an anachronistic reappearance of flat pebbles, together with other intraclast types, in a range of carbonate depositional settings. In south China, flat pebble conglomerates are encountered in storm-dominated, platform carbonates to deep basinal settings, while prefossilized bivalve intraclasts and flat pebbles are common in mid-ramp facies of northern Italy. The emplacement mechanisms of the intraclast-bearing beds appear to have been diverse and to have included basinal turbidity Bows and storm-generated hyperconcentrated flows: true storm beds, deposited under combined Bow conditions, are rare. The cause of the widespread early lithification implied by the Early Triassic intraclasts appears to have been twofold: suppression of bioturbation, allowing the preservation of thin beds, and rapid submarine lithification. Both features appear to be a response to the widespread development of benthic dysoxia/anoxia during and following the end-Permian mass extinction. This event appears to have temporarily recreated the conditions that pertained in Cambro-Ordovician shelf seas. Flat pebble conglomerates may, therefore, constitute a proxy indicator of stressed environmental conditions associated with global anoxic/dysoxic events.

AB  - Early microbial degradation processes and accumulation of carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids in seston aggregates under oxic and suboxic environmental conditions were studied. In laboratory experiments, aerobic decomposition of seston material increased after aggregation and maximum rates were reached after about 70 h. Seston material that became refractory to aerobic degradation was mineralized anaerobically with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor at a rate amounting to about 50% of the maximum rate during the previous aerobic incubation. During both early aerobic and anaerobic degradation of seston, a decrease in particulate organic carbon (POC) and the C:N ratio was observed. A net production of glyoxylate and glycolaldehyde occurred under anaerobic heterotrophic conditions and concentrations up to 4 and 30 mu g l(-1), respectively, were detected in the field when dissolved oxygen concentrations were below 3 mg l(-1). Glycolaldehyde was identified as an indicator of anaerobic degradation processes which occurred in the open water of the Elbe estuary for suspended seston aggregates less than or equal to 2 mm in diameter. Results indicate a strong coupling between aerobic and anaerobic processes in the aggregates whereby anaerobic net production of DOC could significantly enhance O-2 consumption.

AB  - Wheat is of particular interest for the Romanian growers because it has high ecological plasticity and ensures relative constant yields. Having into account that the wheat growers are interested in varieties that produce the highest yields with good milling and bakery value, the purpose of this paper is to highlight the yield yield components and yield quality of nine winter wheat varieties in the conditions of the reddish preluvosoil from the Romanian Plain. In this respect, under the specific climatic conditions of the 2018-2019 agricultural year, nine Romanian and foreign wheat varieties were tested under rainfed conditions on reddish preluvosoil within a field experiment in the Crop Production Didactic Field belonging to the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest.
   The following determinations were performed: number of ears per m(2); number of grains per ear; weight of grains per ear; thousand grain weight - TGW (g); grain yield (kg/ha) reported at 14% moisture content; grain test weight (kg/100 l); protein content (%); wet gluten content (%).
   The yielding capacity of a given wheat variety, which is determined by the values of the yield component, as well as the yield quality which is determined by several indicators are important traits in making growers to choose the variety to be cultivated.

AB  - The pasture condition score (PCS) system is a monitoring and assessment tool for pastureland in the USA. The original system has been modified to address specific variations in vegetation and soils by assigning weights to the individual indicators to emphasize or de-emphasize particular attributes. We compared the effects of different weighting systems on aggregate PCSs and their distribution among five management recommendation categories. Five regional weighting systems were used to compute aggregate PCSs from a data set of 178 observations of pasture condition indicators measured on 39 farms. Distributions of PCSs from the five systems were compared with those obtained from using the original system. In modifications of the original system, plant vigor was the most heavily weighted indicator, whereas plant residue was the least weighted. The various weighting methods tended to increase aggregate scores compared with nonweighted scores, which resulted in different management recommendations. The median score for the original system was 31 compared with a range of 33 to 36 for the weighted systems. Alterations of the PCS system to include weighted indicators attempt to adjust for different environments and site types and suggest the need for some form of standard reference site or classification to account for differences in site type.

AB  - In two consecutive summers, 21 and 18 cows, respectively, were monitored for blood parameters and milk yield, to assess their variation according to the level of heat stress at different stages of lactation. During both years, the cows were monitored according to their lactation phase (early, mid-, and late) at the beginning of the summer. Climatic conditions were described through the temperature humidity index. Cows were monitored for breathing rate, rectal temperature, blood metabolites and enzymes, and milk yield. In the first year, two hotter periods were identified, with more severe conditions in the second one, when cows had rectal temperatures higher than 40 degrees C. In the second year, only one hotter period was identified, with a heat stress comparable to that of the first period of the first year. Milk yield declined during the hotter period; in both years, a higher reduction in milk yield was recorded for cows in the mid-stage of lactation. The decrease in plasma glucose during the hotter period was evident in both years. Plasma cholesterol also decreased in those periods. The reduction in plasma ALP activity in the hotter period of both years confirmed the role of this enzyme as a quick and reliable heat-stress blood marker.

AB  - A model is derived for the probability of burial of a sediment particle as a function of time after initial deposition, in an environment where bottom sediment resuspension exceeds the amount of new sediment deposited in the interval between resuspension episodes. Under steady state conditions, the probability of burial is predicted to exponentially approach 1.0 over time. The characteristic burial time scale T(b) is a simple function of the ratio of resuspension to sedimentation N and the time between resuspension episodes T(r). T(b) has a secondary dependence on the fraction of T(r) during which bottom sediments are in suspension. but this dependence becomes negligible for large N. Allowing for erosion of previously buried sediments under nonsteady state conditions causes the probability of burial to vary about the exponential curve. Moderate departures from steady state do not seriously affect the validity of the results. but large departures from steady state cause large fluctuations in probability of burial and some departure from the exponential trend. Nevertheless, T(b) and the exponential burial probability model that it represents should be useful indicators under most conditions.
   Example calculations of T(b) are carried out with resuspension and sedimentation data from northern Chesapeake Bay. These estimates of T(b) range between a minimum of 7 d in the midbay channel in summer to a maximum of 30 d in the turbidity maximum channel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heavy metals (HMs) are environmental contaminants with toxic properties for wildlife and humans. The placenta is a privileged organ that, along with the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid, enables growth and development of the fetus during the physiological pregnancy. It also acts as a filter reducing the passage of harmful substances, protecting the embryo and then the fetus from exposure to pollutants. The placental barrier is not completely impermeable to the passage of harmful substances; indeed, HMs were detected not only in placental tissues, but also in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. The amniotic fluid can be considered as a valuable marker of prenatal exposure to exogenous factors, and as an indicator of the integrity of placental barrier. The effect of an intrauterine exposure to heavy metals has been amply evaluated during the last decades. Several studies investigated the exposure to HMs in order to evaluate the mechanism of placental transfer and the impact on fetuses and later children's health. In particular, the early exposure to Pb, Hg, and Cd was correlated to infant health effects, such as neurological, developmental, and endocrine disorders. The aim of this mini-review is to summarise the current state of knowledge about the interaction between HMs and placental barrier, considering possible implications on fetal health.

AB  - Public visits to parks and protected areas continue to increase and may threaten the integrity of natural and cultural resources and the quality of the visitor experience. Scientists and managers have adopted the concept of carrying capacity to address the impacts of visitor use. In the context of outdoor recreation, the social component of carrying capacity refers to the level of visitor use that can be accommodated in parks and protected areas without diminishing the quality of the visitor experience to an unacceptable degree. This study expands and illustrates the use of computer simulation modeling as a tool for proactive monitoring and adaptive management of social carrying capacity at Arches National Park. A travel simulation model of daily visitor use throughout the Park's road and trail network and at selected attraction sites was developed, and simulations were conducted to estimate a daily social carrying capacity for Delicate Arch, an attraction site in Arches National Park, and for the Park as a whole. Further, a series of simulations were conducted to estimate the effect of a mandatory shuttle bus system on daily social carrying capacity of Delicate Arch to illustrate how computer simulation modeling can be used as a tool to facilitate adaptive management of social carrying capacity.

AB  - The second messenger cascade of cyclic AMP (cAMP) plays an important physiological role in neurones, modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. The fluorescent probe FICRhR allows real time ratiometric imaging of cAMP changes inside cells (Nature 349 (1991) 694). Until now, the only way to introduce FICRhR into cells was microinjection, which restricted the use of FICRhR to large invertebrate neurones. This report describes the use of the patch-clamp technique to deliver FICRhR into the cytosol of several types of neurones in brain slice preparations. Direct activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin produced marked increases in fluorescence ratio, confirming that the probe can report cAMP increases. However, some neurotics failed to exhibit a cAMP response and this lack of response was related to the nucleus integrity. Stimulation of membrane receptors positively coupled to adenylate cyclase elicited cAMP increases in various neuronal cell types. This is the first report of a cAMP response to neuromodulators measured by an imaging technique in neurones in brain slices. The method described here could find many applications such as testing the ability of agonists to specifically activate the cAMP cascade in identified neurones, studying the kinetics of the cAMP response and determining the subcellular localisation of cAMP changes.

AB  - A key objective in the field of translational psychiatry over the past few decades has been to identify the brain correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD). Identifying measurable indicators of brain processes associated with MDD could facilitate the detection of individuals at risk, and the development of novel treatments, the monitoring of treatment effects, and predicting who might benefit most from treatments that target specific brain mechanisms. However, despite intensive neuroimaging research towards this effort, underpowered studies and a lack of reproducible findings have hindered progress. Here, we discuss the work of the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Consortium, which was established to address issues of poor replication, unreliable results, and overestimation of effect sizes in previous studies. The ENIGMA MDD Consortium currently includes data from 45 MDD study cohorts from 14 countries across six continents. The primary aim of ENIGMA MDD is to identify structural and functional brain alterations associated with MDD that can be reliably detected and replicated across cohorts worldwide. A secondary goal is to investigate how demographic, genetic, clinical, psychological, and environmental factors affect these associations. In this review, we summarize findings of the ENIGMA MDD disease working group to date and discuss future directions. We also highlight the challenges and benefits of large-scale data sharing for mental health research.

AB  - Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) have demonstrated good potential for oral peptide delivery. However, their hydrophobic nature generally accounts for low peptide entrapment efficiency (EE%). In this study, a new strategy was adopted to improve peptide EE% by incorporating a hydrophilic viscosity-enhancing agent (VA) within SLN cores to develop viscosity enhanced nanocarriers (VEN). Three agents namely, propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 and PEG 600, were tested with human insulin serving as a model peptide drug. The effects of VA were both concentration-and type-dependent. 70% w/w PG had achieved the highest EE% (54.5%), versus the two PEGs, compared to only 20.4% in unmodified SLN. PG based VEN had demonstrated good dispersion stability at gastrointestinal (GI) pHs and preferential uptake by intestinal Caco2 cells while showing low cytotoxicity. Additionally, they preserved the integrity of insulin and significantly protected it against GI enzymatic degradation. Freeze dried VEN had shown good stability upon storage at -20 degrees C. Orally administered insulin-VEN had achieved good hypoglycemic effect in fasted rats with relative bioavailability of 5.1%. To conclude, an easily implementable technique to improve peptide entrapment within SLN has been validated, and the resulting VEN had proved promising efficacy for oral peptide delivery.

AB  - Accumulated evidence suggests that schizophrenia is associated with subtle gray matter deficits throughout the cerebral cortex and regional cortical thinning. Although findings are not entirely consistent, healthy relatives of schizophrenia patients also show abnormalities in cortical gray matter volume, suggesting that this may be one aspect of an unexpressed genetic liability to the disorder. Cortical thickness and surface area are additional indicators of cortical cytoarchitectural integrity. To investigate the nature of cortical abnormalities in the healthy relatives of patients, this study used magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate gray matter volume, surface area, and thickness of 13 regions using an automated parcellation methodology. Compared with controls (n = 22), relatives (n = 19) had decreased volume and surface area in the right cingulate gyrus, a bilateral decrease in cingulate thickness, and decreased surface area in the superior temporal lobe. In addition, relatives had a subtle increase in gray matter volume and surface area in the left hemisphere, bilaterally in the parahippocampal gyri, and in the left middle temporal lobe. The results of this study suggest that the cortical regions most affected by the unexpressed genetic liability to schizophrenia may be the cingulate and temporal regions-regions associated with higher level cognitive, affective, and memory functions.

AB  - Altogether, 801 documents of consent (50% of all) issued under the EIA Act No. 244/1992 by the competent authorities in the Czech Republic between 1993 and 2001 were studied. The aim of the analysis was to find and characterize conditions prescribing to the developer to perform ex-ante and ex-post monitoring of potential impacts of projects submitted for approval. It was found that each of the studied documents (standpoints) contained on average three to four conditions prescribing to collect data on various environmental factors during the preparation, implementation and/or operation phase of the development in question. The number of monitoring conditions contained in the standpoints issued by the Ministry of Environment as well as by the District Offices increased during the period studied from about two to five per project indicating a growing interest in and/or need to obtaining such data. Even though there is a good legal background for collecting monitoring data from implementation and operation phase of new developments, the Czech EIA Act (similarly as EIA acts in other countries) does not provide any practical background for this activity. Without relevant institutional, personal and financial support the possibility to impose post-project monitoring to the developer remains rather a challenge to, not advantage of the Czech EIA Act.

AB  - The natural attenuation behavior of a ground water contaminant plume containing chromium and chlorinated ethenes in glaciated sediments was assessed using traditional and nontraditional methods. The mixed waste is transported, through and attenuated within an estuarine influenced ground water aquifer of spatially varying redox character and organic carbon content. Contaminant fate and speciation were assessed as a function of geochemical conditions. Total,. speciation-based, and sequential chemical extraction analyses were performed to determine contaminant partitioning and the redox capacity of the aquifer. Chromium speciation and partitioning were correlated With the reductive capacity and redox conditions of the aquifer sediments spatially,distributed within the aquifer. Reductive dechlorination and partitioning of chlorinated ethenes were correlated with the organic carbon content and redox conditions of the aquifer sediments. The data showed that sharp redox gradients existed within the aquifer. Active reduction and retardation of both chromium and chlorinated ethenes was exhibited. The aqueous hexavalent chromium concentrations decreased to. near nondetect levels in the vicinity of the receptor, whereas degradation products of higher-order chlorinated ethenes increased as a fraction of the total chlorinated ethene concentrations along the length of the plume. The potential for competition for reducing power under specific cases within the aquifer was suggested by the data, highlighting the need to include contaminant interactions in natural attenuation assessments.

AB  - Nowadays, aluminum alloy 7075-T6 has received a high demand in the automotive industry due to its advantages in the aerospace industry, which possessing exceptional mechanical combinations and chemical elements such as high tensile strength, high strength, high corrosion resistance, zinc, magnesium, and copper to increase their strength. Nevertheless, environmentally friendly approaches are necessary to improvise surface quality and machining performances as well as minimize the adverse environment. This has directly influenced the trend of approach or strategy of cutting fluids towards the machining of high-performance material in the automotive industry. There have been some probations to decrease the volume of cutting fluid application in machining. The approach of cutting fluids become prominent indicator in contribution to minimize the application of cutting fluid so that the machining of aluminum alloy 7075-T6 become more effective and environmental friendly. Thus, results can be found in the low tool wear, minimum heat energy generated and reduced machining cost in encouraging the application of MQL as viable formulations to enhance the machining performance and machined surface quality. The primary objective of review work is summarized all the emerging environmentally friendly approaches towards the high-performance material. Impact of machining process parameters on dependent variables such as surface integrity, tool wear, chip formation, and mechanical properties have been discussed in the light of the findings of the recent study.

AB  - Organophosphate triesters are high production volume additive flame retardants (OPFRs) and plasticizers. Shown to accumulate in abiotic and biotic environmental compartments, little is known about the risks they pose. Captive adult male American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were fed the same dose (22 ng OPFR/g kestrel/d) daily (21 d) of tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), or tris(1,2-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP). Concentrations were undetected in tissues (renal, hepatic), suggesting rapid metabolism. There were no changes in glutathione status, indicators of hepatic oxidative status, or the cholinergic system (i.e., cerebrum, plasma cholinesterases; cerebrum muscarinic, nicotinic receptors). Modest changes occurred in hepatocyte integrity and function (clinical chemistry). Significant effects on plasma free triiodothyronine (FT3) concentrations occurred with exposure to TBOEP, TCEP, TCIPP, and TDCIPP; TBOEP and TCEP had additional overall effects on free thyroxine (FT4), whereas TDCIPP also influenced total thyroxine (TT4). Relative increases (32%-96%) in circulating FT3, TT3, FT4, and/or TT4 were variable with each OPFR at 7 d exposure, but limited thereafter, which was likely maintained through decreased thyroid gland activity and increased hepatic deiodinase activity. The observed physiological and endocrine effects occurred at environmentally relevant concentrations and suggest parent OPFRs or metabolites may have been present despite rapid degradation.

AB  - Background: Modifications of intracellular transfer, resulting from a loss of membrane integrity may contribute toward setting the cell onto the pathway of apoptosis.
   Methods: We have developed an original technique of measuring simultaneously, with flow cytometry, changes in membrane fluidity and cell death status. Our aim was to assess the extent to which radio-induced cell death and membrane alterations are linked. Investigations were performed on lymphocytes 24 h after whole human blood gamma-irradiation.
   Results: Our results confirmed the expected increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells as a function of dose, but re revealed that the percentage of necrotic cells appeared stable after irradiation. At the same time, the fluorescence anisotropy of the living lymphocyte subpopulation decreased significantly and dose dependently as measured 24 h post-irradiation. With TMA-DPH, the anisotropy index of apoptotic lymphocytes was always lower than that of the viable lymphocyte subpopulation. On the other hand, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) anisotropy was similar in apoptotic and viable cells after irradiation. These findings suggest that apoptotic lymphocytes are characterised by a membrane fluidisation that mainly occurs on the cell membrane surface.
   Conclusion: Our study made technical advances in using cytometric fluorescence anisotropy measurement as an early biological indicator of apoptosis after cellular exposure to ionising radiation. Cytometry 39:151-157, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Soil degradation poses serious environmental problems and requires quantitative assessment. This study aimed to investigate the soil properties in rangelands with different management conditions. Based on the assessment of soil erosion, vegetation cover, vegetation composition, and vegetation vigor, 56 sites were selected in rangelands with moderate, poor, and very poor conditions located in 15 grazing-free areas and one wildlife refuge region. Soil samples (0-10 cm layer) were collected from these sites through a systematic-random method to compare their physical and chemical properties. Results showed that soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen content were significantly different between sites with different range conditions. The mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates and structural stability index in moderate rangelands were 1.56 mm and 3.98%, respectively, and declined towards more degraded rangeland (i.e. 0.84 mm and 0.83%). Grazing-free rangelands exhibited a relatively larger OC deficit; hence specific management measures and control of grazing are required to enhance the quality of soil in these sites. This study highlighted the role of organic matter in preserving soil structural stability. Increasing protection level of rangelands and decreasing grazing pressure may preserve soil quality and combat desertification in these arid regions.

AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate planktonic microcrustacean species composition, abundance, and diversity in lakes with different trophic status and to determine the relationship between microcrustacean community structure and lake environmental conditions. This study hypothesized that there are correlations between eutrophication levels and microcrustacean community structures in a lake. Three shallow lakes of different trophic status (Sembrong, Putrajaya and Subang lakes) were selected for this study. Two-Way Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) revealed differences in microcrustacean diversity and density amongst lakes, where the hypereutrophic condition in Sembrong lake resulted in the lowest diversity but the highest density of microcrustaceans. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis identified the discriminator species among lakes where the domination of small-sized microcrustaceans was observed in lakes with high levels of eutrophication; the hypereutrophic Sembrong lake (Ceriodaphnia cornuta, 74.0%); the meso-eutrophic Putrajaya lake (Bosmina longirostris, 46.9%;C. cornuta, 19.4%). Chlorophylla, total phosphorus and water transparency showed significant roles in the distribution of microcrustaceans. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) scores indicated that small-sizedC. cornutaandB. longirostriswere related to the eutrophic conditions of lakes. This study elucidated that the lake trophic status could be one of the main factors contributing to the community restructuring of microcrustaceans in tropical lakes.

AB  - There is evidence that COVID-19, the disease caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is sensitive to environmental conditions. However, such conditions often correlate with demographic and socioeconomic factors at larger spatial extents, which could confound this inference. We evaluated the effect of meteorological conditions (temperature, solar radiation, air humidity and precipitation) on 292 daily records of cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the 27 Brazilian capital cities during the 1st month of the outbreak, while controlling for an indicator of the number of tests, the number of arriving flights, population density, proportion of elderly people and average income. Apart from increasing with time, the number of confirmed cases was mainly related to the number of arriving flights and population density, increasing with both factors. However, after accounting for these effects, the disease was shown to be temperature sensitive: there were more cases in colder cities and days, and cases accumulated faster at lower temperatures. Our best estimate indicates that a 1 degrees C increase in temperature has been associated with a decrease in confirmed cases of 8%. The quality of the data and unknowns limit the analysis, but the study reveals an urgent need to understand more about the environmental sensitivity of the disease to predict demands on health services in different regions and seasons.

AB  - Surface energy balance models such as the surface energy balance system (SEBS) assume that the influence of soil moisture and biophysical parameters on evapotranspiration (ET), are implicitly encompassed in model input variables such as the land surface temperature. This simplification may generally be suitable for environments in which the available energy constrains ET but may prove to be inadequate during suboptimal environmental conditions. To address this limitation, the SEBSESF approach was proposed to better represent the influence of environmental stress on surface energy fluxes, using an empirically derived calibration factor to adjust the evaporative fraction previously determined in SEBS. SEBSESF was evaluated by comparing the modelled ET estimates against Eddy Covariance ET measurements (ECET) at two sites, with contrasting environmental conditions. Comparisons between ECET and modelled ET indicated that the implementation of SEBSESF resulted in an improved correlation between ECET and modelled ET estimates, as well as an increase in the percentage of modelled ET estimates within an acceptable accuracy range (+/- 15 to 30%). Overall, the results of the study demonstrate how potential improvements in the mapping of ET within arid and semi-arid environments can be achieved by accounting for environmental stress. This in turn provides an opportunity to better understand and quantify energy and water fluxes, using satellite-based ET estimation approaches.

AB  - There is a growing body of literature recognizing the importance of outpatient psychotherapy. Several studies investigated the efficacy of outpatient psychotherapy and aspects of the health care system under natural conditions. This paper gives an overview of studies from German speaking countries (TRANS-OP-, TK-, PAP-S- and QS-PSY-BAY-study). The results of the different studies indicate both, positive outcome of the therapies (e.g., reduction of symptoms with an average ES of 1,03; improvement of symptoms despite premature termination) as well as an economic benefit (end of treatment depending on treatment outcome and not limited by therapy sessions; extensions of psychotherapy only if patient is highly impaired and therapeutic alliance is positive; high reduction of supply costs and sick leave). However, the low health care density in rural areas and the waiting periods before starting therapy are indicators of structural problems of the health care system with respect to outpatient psychotherapy. The efficacy of outpatient psychotherapies under natural conditions is sufficiently supported. Future studies should investigate structural aspects of the health care system, for example by focussing on the establishment of inter-sectoral connections between different professional groups and a reduction of bureaucratic actions.

AB  - Species like black poplar characterized by an indeterminate growth, can acclimate to the changing environmental conditions during the seasons through a modification of morphological and physiological features. The acclimation results fundamental for the increasing evapo-transpirative demand and water availability. In this perspective, each generation of leaf becomes an indicator of physiologic performance, determining the short-term plasticity (acclimation) of a genotype to different environmental conditions. The main objective of this work is to analyse the physiological adjustment by morphological and physiological features of leaves in two contrasting genotypes of Populus nigra L., growing in a common environment. The mesic genotype 58-861 (Northern Italy) reacts to the increasing dry conditions keeping constantly higher values of delta C-13 while the xeric genotype Poli (Southern Italy) shows lower values, despite no significant differences in the gas exchanges. Morphological and stomatal leaf traits were the main drivers of the different behaviour in the two genotypes to face the "temporal" environment, but different from the provenance. In particular the results, especially in the development phases, demonstrate how phenotypic plasticity is evident at seasonal scale, playing a role for the success of an indeterminate-growing species. They could also be generalized for similar experiments and could support further investigation about short-term plasticity. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study examines the need for irrigation in pear trees (Pyrus Communis, cv. 'Conference') under low evaporative demand conditions, like in Belgium, in order to maintain a consistent fruit yield and high fruit size. To determine the sensitivity of the pear yield under low evaporative demand conditions three different orchards were monitored. The study shows that a Psi(soil) of -60 kPa during shoot growth has no effect on fruit yield but lower Psi(soil) values induced a decline in both fruit size and total yield. Just as for arid environments a Psi(stem) of -1.5 MPa is related to negative yield responses. In dry conditions lower Psi(soil) and Psi(stem) values were observed in root pruned trees compared to not root pruned trees in the same irrigation treatment, however without yield decline. In one orchard a biannual bearing tendency was observed after root pruning. Furthermore intensive Psi(soil) measurements show a high variation in Psi(soil) between orchards, and within an orchard. This underlines the need for irrigation management on a parcel level and the need for new irrigation scheduling techniques which take the spatial variation in the orchard into account.

AB  - In-situ biodegradation rates for a stream contaminated with toluene (< 350 mu g/L) were determined in laboratory experiments and compared to those determined in field studies within the same stream reported in the previous paper. The biodegradation rate constant obtained in batch studies (shake-flasks, 0.06-0.16 m/h) was comparable to the in-situ rate constant obtained in field studies (0.08-0.40 m/h) at similar temperature while the rate constant from column studies was only 2% of the in-situ rate constant. This data showed that the batch studies were better indicators oi in-situ biodegradation and also more accurately reflected field conditions. Streambed surfaces were responsible for virtually all degradation, with sediments and rocks providing the most important (> 95%)compartmental contributions. Rates determined in batch studies under winter conditions were 11-14% of rates determined under summer conditions. Batch,studies of mineralization rates determined with [U-C-14]toluene indicate that mineralization rates were 23% of biodegradation rates. The remaining toluene was converted to soluble intermediates (l5%) land 62% was taken up as biomass or converted to other insoluble material. Our results support the assertion that biodegradation was the most important environmental sink for toluene, with 70% of the toluene loss due to biodegradation over the studied stream reach.

AB  - The topic of sustainability is of high importance today. Global efforts such as the Montreal Protocol (1987) and the Kigali Amendment (2016) are examples of joint work by countries to reduce environmental impacts and improve the level of the ozone layer, the choice of refrigerants and air conditioning systems, which is essential for this purpose. But what indicators are to be used to measure something so necessary? In this article, the types of air conditioning and GWP (Global Warming Potential) levels of equipment in the project phase were discussed, the issue of TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) that measures the direct and indirect environmental impacts of refrigeration equipment and air conditioning and a new methodology for the indicator was developed, the TEWI DC (DC is the direct application for Data Center), and using the formulas of this new adapted indicator it was demonstrated that the TEWI DC for Chicago (USA) was 2,784,102,640 kg CO2/10 years and Curitiba (Brazil) is 1,252,409,640 kg CO2/10 years. This difference in value corresponds to 222.30% higher annual emissions in Chicago than in Curitiba, showing that it is much more advantageous to install a Data Center in Curitiba than in Chicago in terms of environmental impact. The TEWI indicator provides a more holistic view, helping to combine energy and emissions into the same indicator.

AB  - Using light shelves (LSs) is one of the passive-enhancement methods for energy saving and providing better thermal comfort conditions of the building users. The goal of this research is to create a consistent daylight environment that improves the visual and thermal comfort of users in buildings. Comfort effects on the four fronts of a building (in the Pars residential complex of Mashhad city in Iran as a case study) are investigated. Five types of LSs are suggested for improving the building's thermal and visual conditions. Then, the illuminance analysis is performed for the building with and without the LSs. Horizontal and vertical LSs are considered in building to enhance visual quality and uniformity of daylight in the building space. According to the highest and lowest light intensity in the investigated spaces, the LS that provides optimal visual conditions for space is selected. Then, the role of optimum LS in thermal comfort and energy indicators (heating, cooling, and electricity) has been investigated and compared with the base situation. Analyzing the results reveals that using the optimal LS causes an annual average improvement of 18%, 11%, and 7% in the demand for heating, cooling, and electricity, respectively, of the building throughout the year.

AB  - Introduction. When cultivating agricultural crops, it is necessary to take into account the plants' need for moisture, nutrients, location by area of nutrition, determining illumination, etc. Taking into account the biological characteristics of crops, various methods of sowing are used to create favorable conditions for plant growth and development. An important condition for sowing is the uniform arrangement of seeds along the sulcus, especially in the cultivation of testes of small-seeded cultures. A key role in the uniformity of seeding is provided by the design parameters and kinematic operating conditions of the sowing device.
   Materials and Methods. To determine the optimal parameters and operating modes of the disk sowing device, methods of factor experiment and multi-criteria optimization were used.
   Results. Mathematical models of the technological process of sowing seeds were obtained based of experimental studies.
   Conclusions. To ensure the improvement of the seeding quality of small seeds, the design parameters of the experimental seeder:. 4 - is the diameter of the cell;. 5 - the number of cells on the disk, will tend to the maximum values. The optimum circumferential speed of the sowing disk should be in the range from 0.127 to 0.192 m/s, and the speed of the machine's movement is no more than 2 m/s.

AB  - The malacofauna of the palaeolake deposits at Szymanowo (eastern Poland) was investigated. It represents the younger part of the climatic optimum of the Mazovian (Holsteinian) Interglacial (similar to MIS 11) and possibly the post-optimal period. The mollusc assemblage is composed of both standing and running water species, mostly connected with temperate climate. The presence of biostratigraphical indicators of the Mazovian, Viviparus diluvianus (Kunth, 1865), Lithoglyphus jahni Urbanski, 1975 and Pisidium clessini Neumayr, 1875, is noteworthy. Variability in the structure and composition of the assemblage enables palaeoecological reconstruction. Changes in the water-level, vegetation and energy conditions are inferred from the malacological succession. Three stages of the lake development were distinguished. The first one is connected with deeper conditions and predominance of V. diluvianus and L. jahni. The second one, dominated by Bithynia tentaculata (Linnaeus, 1758), records a fall of the water-level and the growth of aquatic plants, evidenced by high frequencies of Valvata cristata Muller, 1774 and Acroloxus lacustris (Linnaeus, 1758). The third stage corresponds to another rise of the water-level and an increase in V. diluvianus, L. jahni, Valvata piscinalis M ller, 1774 and Pisidium henslowanum (Sheppard, 1823), which evidence some higher energy conditions.

AB  - The structural complexity of the cell membrane makes analysis of membrane processes in living cells, as compared to model membrane systems, highly challenging. Living cells decorated with surface-attached colorimetric/fluorescent polydiacetylene patches might constitute an effective platform for analysis and visualization of membrane processes in situ. This work examines the biological and chemical consequences of plasma membrane labeling of promyelocytic leukemia cells with polydiacetylene. We show that the extent of fusion between incubated lipid/diacetylene vesicles and the plasma membrane is closely dependent upon the lipid composition of both vesicles and cell membrane. In particular, we find that cholesterol presence increased bilayer fusion between the chromatic vesicles and the plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane organization plays a significant role in the fusion process. Spectroscopic data and physiological assays show that decorating the cell membrane with the lipid/diacetylene patches reduces the overall lateral diffusion within the membrane bilayer, however polydiacetylene labeling does not adversely affect important cellular metabolic pathways. Overall, the experimental data indicate that the viability and physiological integrity of the surface-engineered cells are retained, making possible utilization of the platform for studying membrane processes in living cells. We demonstrate the use of the polydiacetylene-labeled cells for visualizing and discriminating among different membrane interaction mechanisms of pharmaceutical compounds. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite impressive growth in global biodiversity data, knowledge about the occurrence of species in many parts of the world remains incomplete because of major gaps in the underlying data. This can lead to ill-informed conservation decisions. The collective effort of citizen scientists can generate a great deal of data quickly, but how might we prioritize the powerful - but finite - effort? We argue that instead of simply filling empty spots on the map based solely on where biodiversity information is incomplete, near-term threats to the integrity or persistence of biodiversity assemblages could also be incorporated to prioritize citizen science sampling. Here we develop a quantitative framework illustrating how citizen science sampling and initiatives can be prioritized when simultaneously considering both the completeness of biodiversity sampling and the risk of habitat conversion. We illustrate this framework for birds using global citizen science data from the eBird platform and a global model of the risk of habitat conversion. We find that regions in Africa and southeast Asia would rank as the highest priorities for new and expanded citizen science initiatives. Our framework provides a mechanism to quantify where new biodiversity data are most urgently needed, ultimately helping to improve environmental decision-making. We anticipate this framework can be used in the future at a suite of relevant planning scales, ranging from local to regional to global.

AB  - There is an expectation that all researchers will act ethically and responsibly in the conduct of research involving humans and animals. While research ethics is mentioned in quality indicators and codes of responsible researcher conduct, it appears to have little profile in doctoral assessment. There seems to be an implicit assumption that ethical competence has been achieved by the end of doctoral candidacy and that there is no need for candidates to report on the ethical dimensions of their study nor for examiners to assess this integral aspect of researcher development. In the context of ensuring that institutions are fulfilling their responsibility of producing ethically sensitive and competent researchers, it is salient to investigate whether doctoral thesis examiners make comment about ethical issues in their reports. This study analysed an archive of examiner reports to identify the frequency, magnitude and nature of examiner comment about ethics. Although comment was rare (5% of reports) examiners provided: prescriptive instruction on ethical review processes; formative instruction on the design, conduct, and reporting of research projects; and positive or negative judgments about a candidate's ethical competence, the latter often aligned with meeting, or not meeting, 'doctoral standards'. The scarcity of ethics in examination criteria and examiner reports implies a silence that needs to be addressed to ensure graduating candidates are prepared to conduct ethical and responsible research.

AB  - Recently, crop management has involved excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, compromising public health and environmental integrity. Rhizobacteria, which can enhance plant growth and protect plants from phytopathogen, are eco-friendly and have been attracting increasing attention. In the current study, Bacillus subtilis RS10 isolated from the rhizosphere region of Cynodon dactylon, inhibited the growth of indicator strains and exhibited in vitro plant growth-promoting traits. A whole-genome analysis identified numerous biosynthetic gene clusters encoding antibacterial and antifungal metabolites including bacillibactin, bogorol A, fengycin, bacteriocin, type III polyketides (PKs), and bacilysin. The plant growth-promoting conferring genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, phosphate solubilization, hydrogen sulfide, phytohormones, siderophore biosynthesis, chemotaxis and motility, plant root colonization, lytic enzymes, and biofilm formation were determined. Furthermore, genes associated with abiotic stresses such as high salinity and osmotic stress were identified. A comparative genome analysis indicated open pan-genome and the strain was identified as a novel sequence type (ST-176). In addition, several horizontal gene transfer events were found which putatively play a vital role in the evolution and new functionalities of a strain. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the potential of RS10 antagonism against important pathogens and plant growth promotion, highlighting its application in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - DNA mismatch repair (MMR) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of genomic stability. The main MMR protein, MutS, was recently shown to recognize the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures, which, along with regulatory functions, have a negative impact on genome integrity. Here, we studied the effect of G4 on the DNA-binding activity of MutS from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (methyl-independent MMR) in comparison with MutS from Escherichia coli (methyl-directed MMR) and evaluated the influence of a G4 on the functioning of other proteins involved in the initial steps of MMR. For this purpose, a new DNA construct was designed containing a biologically relevant intramolecular stable G4 structure flanked by double-stranded regions with the set of DNA sites required for MMR initiation. The secondary structure of this model was examined using NMR spectroscopy, chemical probing, fluorescent indicators, circular dichroism, and UV spectroscopy. The results unambiguously showed that the d(GGGT)(4) motif, when embedded in a double-stranded context, adopts a G4 structure of a parallel topology. Despite strong binding affinities of MutS and MutL for a G4, the latter is not recognized by E. coli MMR as a signal for repair, but does not prevent MMR processing when a G4 and G/T mismatch are in close proximity.

AB  - Mono-culture fermentation by Rhizopus stolonifer could promote the healthiness of immune systems and cholesterol levels. Hence, we examined the effect of diet from mono-culture fermentation of Moringa oleifera seeds by R.stolonifer (MCF-MORS) on hematological parameters and fundamental indicators of hypercholesterolemia in rat. The animals were divided into six groups (n=6). Group 1 was placed on basal diet. Group II, III, IV and V were placed on a basal diets supplemented with 7.5%, 15%, 22.5% and 30%, respectively, of MCF-MORS. Group VI was placed on basal diet fed with unfermented M.oleifera seeds (UF-MOS). The experiment lasted for eight weeks. The results revealed 7.5% MCF-MORS as better biological method to augment PCV, RBC and Hb count in animal model. Also, 7.5% and/or 15% MCF-MORS demonstrated highest levels in centrophils, neutrophils and eosinophils, whereas the levels of lymphocytes, basophils and monocytes showed no significant difference. Similarly, 7.5% and 15% MCF-MORS modulated LDL and HDL, respectively, better than UF-MOS; but showing no difference in cholesterol level. MCF-MORS also maintained architectural integrity of villi and splenocytes better than UF-MOS. We therefore concluded that diet from MCF-MORS at 7.5% and 15% modulates HDL, LDL, cholesterol and immune system-related disorders better than UF-MOS in rat model.

AB  - Though effects of forest harvesting on small streams are well documented, little is known about the cumulative effects in downstream systems. The hierarchical nature and longitudinal connectivity of river networks make them fundamentally cumulative, but lateral and vertical connectivity and instream processes can dissipate the down stream transport of water and materials. To elucidate such effects, we investigated how a suite of abiotic indicators changed from small streams to larger downstream sites (n=6) within three basins ranging in forest management intensity (intensive, extensive, minimal) in New Brunswick (Canada) in the summer and fall of 2017 and 2018. Inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and water temperatures significantly increased longitudinally, whereas nutrients and the fluorescence index of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; indication of terrestrial source) decreased. However, some longitudinal trends differed across basins and indicated downstream cumulative (inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and to a lesser extent DOC concentration and humification) as well as dissipative (temperatures, nutrients, organic sediments) effects of forest management. Overall, we found that the effects previously reported for small streams with managed forests also occur at downstream sites and suggest investigating whether different management practices can be used within the extensive basin to reduce these cumulative effects.

AB  - The majority of fatigue crack growth (FCG) data sets available on steels in air and seawater environments are several decades old and may not be appropriate for structural integrity assessment of offshore wind turbine foundations, which are fabricated using contemporary materials and welding technologies. Therefore, the SLIC joint industry project was formed to investigate the fatigue crack initiation and growth behaviour in offshore wind welded steel foundations. The FCG test data from the SLIC inter-laboratory (round robin) test programme have been analysed using a new proposed shape function solution and the results are presented and discussed. The obtained FCG trends in air and seawater environments have been compared with the recommended trends available in standards. The Paris-law constants and Delta K-th values obtained from this programme can be used for defect assessment and remaining life prediction of offshore monopile weldments in air and seawater environments. The results from the SLIC project show that for a given value of Delta K the fatigue crack growth rate, da/dN, is on average around 2 times higher in seawater compared to air for the base metal and weldments. This factor of 2 in the seawater environment is almost half of the crack acceleration factor recommended by standards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess land use effects on the density, biomass, and instantaneous secondary production (IP) of benthic invertebrates in a fifth-order tropical river. Invertebrates were sampled at 11 stations along the Rio das Mortes (upper Rio Grande, Southeast Brazil) in the dry and the rainy season 2010/ 2011. Invertebrates were counted, determined, and measured to estimate their density, biomass, and IP. Water chemical characteristics, sediment heterogeneity, and habitat structural integrity were assessed in parallel. Total invertebrate density, biomass, and IP were higher in the dry season than those in the rainy season, but did not differ significantly among sampling stations along the river. However, taxon-specific density, biomass, and IP differed similarly among sampling stations along the river and between seasons, suggesting that these metrics had the same bioindication potential. Variability in density, biomass, and IP was mainly explained by seasonality and the percentage of sandy sediment in the riverbed, and not directly by urban or agricultural land use. Our results suggest that the consistently high degradation status of the river, observed from its headwaters to mouth, weakened the response of the invertebrate community to specific land use impacts, so that only local habitat characteristics and seasonality exerted effects.

AB  - Various environmental oxidative stresses are sensed by redox-sensitive regulators through cysteine thiol oxidation or modification. A few zinc-containing anti-sigma (ZAS) factors in actinomycetes have been reported to respond sensitively to thiol oxidation, among which RsrA from Streptomyces coelicolor is best characterized. It forms disulfide bonds upon oxidation and releases bound SigR to activate thiol oxidative stress response genes. Even though numerous ZAS proteins exist in bacteria, features that confer redox sensitivity to a subset of these have been uncharacterized. In this study, we identified seven additional redox-sensitive ZAS factors from actinomycetes. Comparison with redox-insensitive ZAS revealed characteristic sequence patterns. Domain swapping demonstrated the significance of the region (KFEHHFEECSPCLEK47)-F-33-F-37-S-41-L-44 that encompass the conserved HX3CX2C (HCC) motif. Mutational effect of each residue on diamide responsive induction of SigR target genes in vivo demonstrated that several residues, especially those that flank two cysteines (E39, E40, L45, E46), contribute to redox sensitivity. These residues are well conserved among redox-sensitive ZAS factors, and hence are proposed as redox-determinants in sensitive ZAS. H37A, C41A, C44A and F38A mutations, in contrast, compromised SigR-binding activity significantly, apparently affecting structural integrity of RsrA. The residue pattern around HCC motif could therefore serve as an indicator to predict redox-sensitive ZAS factors from sequence information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein is considered as a potential indicator of animal adaptation to harsh environmental stresses and its expression has been correlated with resistance to stress. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the seasonal variation in heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) and their association with frozen semen quality and fertility in buffaloes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During summer and winter, ejaculates (n = 32) were collected from buffalo bulls, diluted with freshly prepared Andromed extender (maintained at 34 degrees C) up to 80 million sperm per mL. The diluted semen was filled in French midi straws, equilibrated, and cryopreserved. The semen was evaluated at pre-freeze and post-thaw stages for heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90), and sperm quality parameters. RESULTS: The levels of HSP70 were significantly (P = 0.00) higher in summer season compared to winter season. The HSP70 had a positive correlation with mass motility (P < 0.05; r = 0.39), live sperm count (P < 0.05; r = 0.47), and acrosomal integrity (P < 0.05; r = 0.37). The first artificial insemination conception rate (FAICR) had a positive correlation with HSP70 (P < 0.05; r = 0.47), and HSP90 (P < 0.05; r = 0.59), in frozen-thawed semen. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the levels of heat shock proteins may help in predicting cryo-tolerance and fertility of buffalo semen during various seasons.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of ozone (O-3) deposition on ground level O-3 concentrations and subsequent human health and ecosystem risk under hot summer "heat wave" type meteorological events. Under such conditions, extended drought can effectively "turn off" the O-3 vegetation sink leading to a substantial increase in ground level O-3 concentrations. Two models that have been used for human health (the CMAQ chemical transport model) and ecosystem (the DO3SE O-3 deposition model) risk assessment are combined to provide a powerful policy tool capable of novel integrated assessments of O-3 risk using methods endorsed by the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. This study investigates 2006, a particularly hot and dry year during which a heat wave occurred over the summer across much of the UK and Europe. To understand the influence of variable O-3 dry deposition three different simulations were investigated during June and July: (i) actual conditions in 2006, (ii) conditions that assume a perfect vegetation sink for O-3 deposition and (iii) conditions that assume an extended drought period that reduces the vegetation sink to a minimum. The risks of O-3 to human health, assessed by estimating the number of days during which running 8 h mean O-3 concentrations exceeded 100 mu g m(-3), show that on average across the UK, there is a difference of 16 days exceedance of the threshold between the perfect sink and drought conditions. These average results hide local variation with exceedances between these two scenarios reaching as high as 20 days in the East Midlands and eastern UK. Estimates of acute exposure effects show that O-3 removed from the atmosphere through dry deposition during the June and July period would have been responsible for approximately 460 premature deaths. Conversely, reduced O-3 dry deposition will decrease the amount of O-3 taken up by vegetation and, according to flux-based assessments of vegetation damage, will lead to a reduction in the impact of O-3 on vegetation across the UK. The new CMAQ-DO3SE model was evaluated by comparing observation vs. modelled estimates of various health related metrics with data from both urban and rural sites across the UK; although these comparisons showed reasonable agreement there were some biases in the model predictions with attributable deaths at urban sites being over predicted by a small margin, the converse was true for rural sites. The study emphasises the importance of accurate estimates of O-3 deposition both for human health and ecosystem risk assessments. Extended periods of drought and heat wave type conditions are likely to occur with more frequency in coming decades, therefore understanding the importance of these effects will be crucial to inform the development of appropriate national and international policy to mitigate against the worst consequences of this air pollutant.

AB  - Domoic acid (DA) poisoning in the southern part of the California Current System has been associated typically with blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia australis. The environmental variables that promote growth and DA production in the Mexican part of this system have not been identified. The present study investigated the effect of temperature and two nutrient ratios on the growth characteristics and DA content of two (BTS-1, BTS-2) P. australis strains isolated from the Pacific coast of northern Baja California peninsula, Mexico. Of the different temperatures assayed (10, 12, 14, 15, 18 and 20 degrees C), the maximum cell abundance was detected at 12 degrees C for BTS-2 and 14 degrees C for BTS-1. The highest maximum specific growth rate (1.69 day(-1)) was measured at 15 degrees C for BTS-2. With the exception of cells maintained at 15 degrees C, growth characteristics were similar in P. australis cultured in a high Si:NO3 (2.5) or low Si:NO3 (0.5) ratio at each temperature. Dissolved (dDA) and cellular (cDA) DA content measured at the stationary phase of growth was similar in cells cultivated at the different temperatures. No difference in cDA (between 0.11 and 1.87 pg DA cell(-1)) was observed in cells cultivated at the two nutrient ratios. To evaluate if P. australis accumulates DA (cDA + dDA) at different stages of the culture and not only during the stationary phase of growth, the BTS-1 strain was cultivated at 14 degrees C and the content of this toxin was measured during culture development. The cultures were maintained at high (HL; 200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and low light (LL; 30 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and in the two nutrient ratios to evaluate the effect of these variables on DA content. The photosynthetic performance and pigment concentration were measured as indicators of the physiological condition of the cells. cDA was detected in all culture conditions and during the different stages of growth. The highest DA content was measured during the lag phase of growth and it was present mainly in the medium (dDA = 70.83 pg DA cell(-1)). Cells cultivated at HL produced more DA than LL cultured cells. P. australis cultured in HL presented lower photosynthetic rates than LL cells and had similar concentrations of photoprotective pigments and the highest maximum photosynthetic rates were detected during the lag phase of growth in all culture conditions. The results demonstrate that P. australis from northern Baja California peninsula presents a narrow temperature range for optimal growth under batch culture conditions. P. australis produce DA at different stages of growth, and DA content was related to the light intensity at which the cells were cultivated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As resource consumption rates soar, especially in rapidly industrialising Asia, improving resource efficiency will be an important agenda. This study analyses socio-economic conditions and policy statements on natural resources in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, to explore their motivation for resource efficiency policies and material flow analysis/accounting (MFA). Among them, Malaysia and Thailand could be significantly motivated to develop resource efficiency policies and MFA, particularly in terms of trade balance and manufacturing sector development. Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines do not have such conditions now. Indonesia and Vietnam, however, would be motivated in the longer term, considering their transition to an industrialised economy and the possibility of increasing domestic demand in an emerging economy context. Metals and industrial minerals are more imported than exported, would generally be prioritised resources in the study countries. This means that the 3Rs will be a vital approach for resource efficiency. In addition, some countries are resource exporting countries, which might consider the resource extraction impact. Whereas resource efficiency aspects are conceptually well reflected in their national strategies, concrete resource efficiency policies have not been developed. These various socio-economic conditions would be significant to emerging Asia to develop concrete resource efficiency policies and MFA indicators.

AB  - Aims of this investigation were to determine whether chlorophyll fluorescence values obtained from excised leaves of woody perennials subjected to salinity stress under laboratory conditions provided a measurable indicator of whole plant salinity tolerance. Laboratory tests consisted of measurements of the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) performed on excised leaves taken from thirty woody perennials following immersion in salt solutions ranging from concentrations of 2% to 7%. Based on reductions in F-v/F-m of excised leaves following salinity treatments plants were ranked in order of tolerance. Whole plants of six of the thirty species tested were then subjected to a foliar applied salt at a concentration of 7% and placed under glass for 14 weeks. Damage to, and recovery of whole plants from salt damage as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf necrosis and chlorophyll content mirrored tolerance ranking of excised leaves under laboratory conditions. In addition, based on reductions in plant growth at the cessation of the experiment, salt tolerance followed a similar order as that obtained from F-v/F-m values of excised leaves. Results indicate that testing of excised leaf material of woody perennials under laboratory conditions using chlorophyll fluorescence offers a potentially quick, reliable and inexpensive procedure that can provide a useful means of estimating whole plant salt tolerance.

AB  - Simultaneous comparison of differentially expressed protein profiles of Prorocentrum triestinum grown under different growth phases and growth conditions indicated the presence of phase-specific and stress-responsive proteins, respectively. Correlation studies on these proteins in relation to cell division phasing patterns and to models of phytoplankton growth inferred the possible functions. Most notable among these proteins were groups of proteins thought to trigger or mediate cells through specific phases of division of this alga, e.g., BP1, BP2, PB1, PB2, and PB3. Other proteins (e.g., group 1 proteins) thought to be responsible for maintaining and supporting cell concentration under adverse conditions were found. Furthermore, another group of proteins (group 2 proteins) thought to be stress- responsive were also detected. Taken overall, these differentially expressed proteins provided important information for uncovering various protective and adaptive mechanisms in the dinoflagellate's life cycle. These proteins have the potential to serve as "indicator proteins" for rapid assessment of the nutritional or metabolic status of these phytoplankton cells,and monitoring the differential expression of these phase-specific proteins and stress-specific proteins could be an important biomarker for bloom prediction.

AB  - Cheese wastewater has been treated by means of a coagulation-flocculation process. Three different coagulants have been used, namely, FeSO4, Al-2(SO4)(3), and FeCl3. When FeSO4 was used, the optimum conditions were obtained using 250 ppm of the salt at pH 8.5. At these conditions, 50 and 60% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were reduced, respectively. Al-2(SO4)(3) achieved slightly lower reductions of COD and BOD; however, the amount needed was significantly higher (1000 ppm). When FeCl3 was added, similar results to those obtained with FeSO4 were experienced; again, 250 ppm was enough to eliminate COD and BOD contents in the range of 40-60%, depending upon operating conditions. The sludge formed in the coagulation-flocculation process did show acceptable settling properties, which is crucial in settling tank design. A first approach to sedimentation tank design is also conducted on the basis of experimental results. The aerobic biodegradation of cheese whey wastewater achieves the reduction of the main contaminant indicators (COD and BOD) to values close to 100%; however, effluents coming from the coagulation-flocculation pre-stage necessitate half of the time required by the non-pretreated raw wastewater.

AB  - We investigate the evolution of female preference for one and two male ornaments, to address two issues in sexual selection: (i) what factors affect the evolution of female preferences; and (ii) how do preferences diverge between isolated populations, leading to speciation? We assume that the male traits are costly indicators of male condition ('handicaps'), and that females benefit directly from a high-condition mate. We find that optimal female preference for a single male trait equals (benefit of condition) x (detectability of male trait) x (honesty of male trait)/(costliness of preference). With two male traits to choose from, females should prefer the one with greatest honesty x detectability, and ignore the second. These results highlight the role of perception in the evolution of both male ornaments and female preferences, and provide a theoretical illustration of 'sensory drive'. They confirm that a less honest male trait can displace a more honest trait if its detectability is sufficiently high. Environmental differences can drive evolutionary divergence between populations in both the male trait and female preference. Even small differences between habitats in detectability of male traits can trigger dramatic change in the female preference. Finally, populations may drift apart in arbitrary directions if choice of different male traits yields equivalent benefits to females.

AB  - The composition and ecology of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPE) are essential for understanding microbial food web functioning. We hypothesize that the simultaneous use of flow cytometry (FCM) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tools will aid in discerning the dominant PPE groups contributing to abundance and biomass under prevailing environmental conditions. The PPE seasonal community abundance and pigment biomass were investigated from a southwest monsoon-influenced tropical bay from June 2015 to May 2016. A size-fractionated (<3 mu m) approach using FCM and HPLC revealed five and six PPE groups, respectively. Picocryptophytes dominated the PPE biomass under varied environmental conditions, whereas picodiatoms contributed substantially, being abundant under turbulent, low-temperature, nutrient (NO3-, SiO44-)-enriched conditions. The picochlorophytes dominated the community numerically. The relatively higher abundance and biomass of picoprasinophytes and a positive correlation with NO3- and NH4+ imply proliferation under higher nutrient concentrations. The least contributors to biomass were dinoflagellates and picoprymnesiophytes. The relatively larger cell size of picocryptophytes and picodiatoms resulted in higher cumulative biomass, signifying their role in the microbial food web. Our study proposes incorporation of additional indicator pigments in algorithms used to estimate coastal picophytoplankton contribution to total phytoplankton biomass to avoid discrepancies.

AB  - Current research focuses on new energy alternatives which could compete with the traditional energy sources based on fossil fuels, and eventually diminish the consequences on climate. Recently, butanol produced by ABE fermentation attracted more attention since its energy power is comparable to that of gasoline. But some hurdles are involved in the establishment of this fuel as an immediate substitute of fossil fuels, e.g. lower butanol concentration in the fermentation effluents and the expensive separation steps to purify the effluent.
   This work is the first to report the use of hybrid separation based on liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) combined with dividing-wall column (DWC) technology for the purification of the ABE (acetone-butanolethanol) mixture. The configurations proposed are the result of multi-objective optimization that aims to find designs that fulfill the tradeoff between those objectives: cost minimization, reduce environmental impact, and increase controllability.
   The downstream processing alternatives are designed and optimized by minimizing three objective functions simultaneously: the total annual cost (TAC) as an economical index, the eco-indicator 99 as an environmental function, and the condition number (CN) as control index. Among the four designs, the scheme where only a reboiler is included showed the best economic performances and relatively good values of condition number and eco indicator 99. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Based on element geochemical and total organic carbon (TOC) analyses of core samples from the Silurian Longmaxi Formation black shales in the Sichuan Basin, this study tried to figure out the temporal changes of palaoenvironmental settings for the shale deposition. The redox-sensitive element ratios, such as U/Th, V/Sr, V/Cr, Ni/Co and V/(V + Ni) are useful indicators to define the redox condition of marine black shale deposition. Element geochemical analysis of Longmaxi Shale samples taken from well W201 and Z106 in the southern Sichuan Basin shows that the organic-rich shales at the bottom of the Longmaxi Formation were deposited in an anoxic environment, while the upper part organic-poor shales were deposited in an oxic environment. Meanwhile, the sedimentary and paleontological characteristics show that pyrite and microfossils are concentrated mainly in the lower organic-rich black shales, indicating also an anoxic environment. All these geochemical, sedimentary and paleontological criteria indicate a paleoenvironmental change from bottom anoxic to middle and upper dysoxic/oxic conditions for the Longmaxi Formation shales. Furthermore, geochemical indicators should be combined with sedimentary and paleontological features in the study of palaeoenvironment conditions for shale deposition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An increasing number of large cities have experienced urban village transformation because of the rapid industrialization and urbanization in China. Extant literature largely focuses on urban village transformation and its ensuing developments. This research examined the social welfare change through six welfare categories of indicators, namely, economic condition, dwelling condition, development opportunity, social security, living environment, and psychology. Value change in fuzzy membership was used to reveal the changes in social welfare for rural migrants before and after urban village transformation. Data were collected from questionnaires distributed in four cities of Zhejiang Province in 2014. Fuzzy assessment model was developed to analyze the collected data. Results corroborated that nearly all the values of the welfare categories decreased, except for the value of dwelling condition. The findings confirmed that the rural migrants do not primarily receive the benefits of urban village transformation. In addition, such transformation does not improve urban village harmony. Various measures should be applied to improve rural migrant welfare, including enhancing rural migrant settlement intention, encouraging rural migrants to return to their respective hometowns, and implementing policies for regionally differentiated welfare rights. The findings of this study can provide references for local governments to substantially implement urban village transformation.

AB  - The kinetics of dye reduction, in photocatalyst indicator ink films on self cleaning glass, is studied with respect to dye concentration. The water-based, photocatalyst indicator inks comprised a redox dye, D-ox, a sacrificial electron donor (glycerol) and a polymer, hydroxyethyl cellulose. The dyes used were: Resazurin (Rz), dichloroindo-phenol (DCIP) and methylene blue (MB), although the latter required acidification of the ink (0.01M HCl) to make it work effectively under ambient conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, the photoreduction of each of the dyes, in an otherwise identical ink formulation, on Activ (TM) self-cleaning glass is zero-order with respect to [D-ox]. Seven commercial samples of Rz, each in a typical ink formulation, were tested on the same piece of self-cleaning glass under aerobic conditions and produced a striking range (over 280%) of different apparent activities for the glass, when there should have been none. The underlying cause of this variation in assessed activity is shown to be due to the combination of a variation in the purity of the commercial samples and the zero-order nature of the kinetics of indicator dye reduction. The relevance of this work and the latter observation, in particular to future use of these films for the rapid assessment of the activities of new and established photocatalytic films, is briefly discussed.

AB  - Edmondson's egg ratio (number of amictic eggs per female) is an important life history variable. which has been in wide use to understand and predict patterns of population growth in planktonic rotifers under field conditions. It is also useful as an indicator of the health of rotifers under culture conditions. Generally, an inverse relationship exists between the egg ratio and the density of females in a population. A number of abiotic and biotic factors influence the egg ratio. For example, temperature can cause marked changes in the egg ratio by influencing the frequency of egg production and the hatching times of parthenogenetic eggs. Also, preferential feeding on ovigerous females of rotifers by invertebrate predators such as As-planchna will lower the egg ratios of the population. The easy detachment of eggs. as may be the case in some members of the Brachionidae especially during enhanced reproduction when food levels are high, may also cause an underestimation of the egg ratio. In this review. we discuss the egg ratio of selected rotifer species in relation to the role of diel changes in egg production,. the frequency or the intensity of feeding. the problems of distinguishing between different egg types and the negative effect of stressors such as toxicants and diet quality.

AB  - Euryhaline tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus acclimates to the external spawning environment by modulating its mechanism for regulating sperm motility. Adaptation of sperm was performed by acclimating fish in various environments. In this paper, regulatory mechanisms of freshwater-acclimated tilapia were studied in detail. Tilapia sperm motility was vigorous in hypotonic conditions and decreased with increasing osmolality. Sperm motility was reduced in hypotonic conditions when extracellular Ca2+ was chelated; however, extracellular Ca2+ was not a major factor for motility activation since sperm were motile even when extracellular Ca2+ levels were nominally depleted by EGTA. The Ca2+ indicator, fluo 3, showed that intracellular [Ca2+] increased on motility activation independently of extracellular [Ca2+], accompanied by swelling of the sperm neck region called the sleeve structure. Intracellular [Ca2+] was not increased under hypertonic conditions, in which sperm were immotile, even on addition of extracellular Ca2+. It is possible that Ca2+ is stored in the neck region. Demembranated sperm were reactivated in the presence of Ca2+, but cAMP failed to reactivate the motility. Furthermore, we detected phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of three proteins at serine and threonine residues on motility activation. It is likely that hypotonic shock causes an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] that activates motility activation via phosphorylation of some flagellar proteins.

AB  - In this paper characteristics of loess are discussed from a pedological perspective. A new model of loess formation is presented, developed in different soil formation processes according to its pedogenic characteristics, including soil structure, organic matter content and CaCO3 content. Loess has all the characteristics of typical soils and all five soil-forming factors have important roles in loess formation. In this regard, loess is a type soil and the previous concept of loess actually comprises various kinds of palaeosols developed in cold and arid climatic conditions. The loess-forming process is, in fact, equivalent to a pedogenic process and loess layers with different characteristics represent different pedogenic processes indicative of different environments, such as desert-steppe, steppe or forest-steppe climatic conditions. In contrast to red-brown palaeosol layers, which develop in warm and wet climates, loesses-more accurately called 'loessial palaeosols'-are grey-yellow palaeosols and can be regarded as a reliable indicator of cold and arid climate. The model of loess formation suggests that aeolian dust transfers to grey-yellow palaeosols via pedogenesis and the characteristics of loess are mainly a result of climatic conditions and diagenesis processes after its sedimentation. This new model of loess formation also suggests that traditional pedological theory has its limitations when explaining soil formation processes.

AB  - In this study, productivity and physicochemical and microbiological (454 sequencing) parameters, as well as environmental criteria, were investigated in anaerobic reactors to contribute to the ongoing debate about the optimal temperature range for treating animal manure, and expand the general knowledge on the relation between microbiological and physicochemical process indicators. For this purpose, two reactor sizes were used (10m(3) and 16l), in which two temperature conditions (35 degrees C and 50 degrees C) were tested. In addition, the effect of the hydraulic retention time was evaluated (16 versus 20 days). Thermophilic anaerobic digestion showed higher organic matter degradation (especially fiber), higher pH and higher methane (CH4) yield, as well as better percentage of ultimate CH4 yield retrieved and lower residual CH4 emission, when compared with mesophilic conditions. In addition, lower microbial diversity was found in the thermophilic reactors, especially for Bacteria, where a clear intensification towards Clostridia class members was evident. Independent of temperature, some similarities were found in digestates when comparing with animal manure, including low volatile fatty acids concentrations and a high fraction of Euryarchaeota in the total microbial community, in which members of Methanosarcinales dominated for both temperature conditions; these indicators could be considered a sign of process stability.

AB  - Production over a complete life cycle, from egg to reproductive adult, is investigated in the carabid beetle Abax ater, as part of a study on the energy budget of this species. Research was carried out both in the laboratory under controlled conditions of temperature and photoperiod, and under semi-natural outdoor conditions to take into account natural fluctuations in climatic factors.
   Growth was considerable in the adult stage: 32% of a breeding adult's dry body mass were produced during larval development, while 59 and 9% were produced during the first and second year, respectively, after pupation. In both larvae and adults, growth was slower under semi natural conditions than in the laboratory during early development, but was compensated for by a stronger growth later, suggesting regulation of body mass through compensatory growth. Egg production was possible only after adult hibernation; it accounted for 21 % of total production in the adult stage, with a very low fecundity (12 eggs per female per year on average).
   Abax ater is characterised by a body growth that is slow and spread over both the larval and adult stages, a reproductive effort that is very small and spread over several years and over several months in each year, and a great longevity. These demographic and bioenergetic traits are typical for a 'conservation' K strategy.

AB  - The paper provides a methodology for the optimal control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems used in public buildings, with the purpose of obtaining high comfort and safety standards along with energy efficiency. The combination of the two concurrent objectives of minimizing energy use and guaranteeing high standards of occupant comfort is obtained by means of multi-objective optimization, in which a comfort model is combined along with a dynamic energy model of the building. The use of dynamic setpoints for the HVAC and the inclusion of comfort indicators represent a step forward, compared to the current design and operation procedures suggested by technical standards. The utilization of the proposed methodology is tested with reference to a case study, represented by an academic building used by the University of Pisa for educational purposes, whose extensive and variable occupancy can help to emphasize the importance of comfort in the operation of HVAC systems in different climatic conditions and with different occupancy profiles. We show how this optimization brings interesting results in terms of energy-saving (up to 30%), obtaining an increased comfort level (of more than 25%) compared to the operating conditions suggested by technical standards.

AB  - Purpose A building deteriorates over time due to aging, wear and tear, and inadequate maintenance. Building diagnosis requires a sound knowledge of engineering, building defects, and detection tools to assess the condition of a building. The physical deterioration of a building reduces its ability to perform its intended function, while environmental deterioration influences the comfort and health of building occupants. This study presents a multi-tiered framework for the inspection of building elements and the environmental conditions of a building. Design/methodology/approach A three-tiered building inspection framework is proposed in this study, which consists of the following: Tier-I-a preliminary inspection, Tier-II-a detailed inspection, and Tier-III-an expert investigation. Each tier of inspection assesses the severity of building defects using different technologies for different levels of inspection. Findings Proposed multi-tier inspection framework is tested and implemented on a case study. Results were promising, with organized data management on a common platform for both physical and environmental condition inspection having the potential to save time. Originality/value The application program developed for the implementation of structured multi-tiered building inspection provides better documentation and data management for building inspection data that can save time involved in manual data operations in traditional paper-based processes.

AB  - Energy-saving in regard to heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in data centers is strongly required. Therefore, to improve the operating efficiency of the cooling equipment and extend the usage time of the economizer used for cooling information-technology equipment (ITE) in a data center, it is often the case that a high air-supply temperature within the range in which the ITE can be sufficiently cooled is selected. In the meantime, it is known that when the ambient temperature of the ITE rises, the speed of the built-in cooling fan increases. Acceleration of the built-in fan is thought to affect the cooling performance and energy consumption of the data center. Therefore, a method for predicting the temperature of a data center-which simply correlates supply-air temperature with ITE inlet temperature by utilizing existing indicators, such as air-segregation efficiency (ASE)-is proposed in this study. Moreover, a method for optimizing the total energy consumption of a data center is proposed. According to the prediction results obtained under the assumption of certain computer-room air-conditioning (CRAC) conditions, by lowering the ITE inlet temperature from 27 degrees C to 18 degrees C, the total energy consumption of the machine room is reduced by about 10%.

AB  - High-resolution plant macrofossil records were examined alongside geochemical analysis (non-destructive X-Ray fluorescence and carbon stable isotopes), pollen, and micro-charcoal data of an ombrotrophic mountain peatland located in the Harz Mountains, central Germany, Europe. We hypothesize that increased deposition of dust and pollutants across the bog surface causes changes in habitat conditions, which in turn lead to shifts in moss-dominated communities. We observe that increases in the abundance of Sphagnum magellanicum macrofossils - a species with a wider ecological range that occurs even in weakly minerotrophic habitats - coincide with increases of pollutant concentrations in the peat; conversely, increases of Sphagnum rubellum and Sphagnum capillifolium populations - indicators of oligotrophic conditions - coincide with decreases of pollutant concentrations. Pristine Sphagnum populations in the studied ombrotrophic bog have thus repeatedly returned to their original oligotrophic state (an autogenic process) following declines in pollutant input. Modem levels of pollutants should be taken into account in peatland restoration efforts, as they exert a strong control on the composition of present day Sphagnum communities. Moreover, Sphagnum angustifolium in paleoecological studies might be considered as an indicator of water level rise. In this study, the presence of S. angustifolium apparently correlates with wetter moisture conditions.

AB  - Methods for in vivo monitoring of redox changes in different cellular compartments have been developed in recent years, and are mostly based on redox-sensitive variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). However, due to the thermodynamic stability of the introduced reactive disulfide bond, these sensors are limited to reducing compartments such as the cytosol and the mitochondria, and are not suited for more oxidizing environments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To overcome this problem, a family of redox-sensitive GFP variants that differed in their midpoint potential has been developed by the group of Remington (University of Oregon) and tested in vitro. Here, we report the first in vivo use of these novel roGFP1 variants for the measurement of redox conditions within the ER and cytosol in the yeast Pichia pastoris. With the fluorescence data obtained, it was possible to determine the reduction potential of the two compartments. Thereby, we could show that the ER, which is required for oxidative protein folding, is indeed more oxidizing than the cytosol. Contrary to previous results with roGFP, the optimized roGFP1_iE and roGFP1_iL constructs were not completely oxidized, and are therefore useful sensors for monitoring the ER under conditions when it is even more oxidized.

AB  - The aquatic ecosystem is constantly being disturbed by rising levels of different classes of pollutants of human origin in the form of urban, agricultural and industrial discharges. In this study, the health of fish Malapterurus electricus was examined, to serve as a reflection of the impact of anthropogenic disturbances in the Lekki lagoon. Eighty six samples of the fish were analysed for parasitic infections, heavy metals, microorganisms in their internal and external body parts while the proximate composition and fish condition factor were also determined using conventional methods. One parasite species, a cestode Electrotaenia malapteruri was found to infect the fish. Total parasite load was eighty five with a total prevalence of infection of 36%. Elements detected in sediment were of the order of Al>Fe>Mn>Pb>Cr>Zn>Cd>Ba>Cu>Ni while in water, it is Mn>Fe>Zn>Ba>Cd>Cr>Al>Cu>Ni>Pb. Metals analysed in the fish tissues were generally low and below regulatory limits. In the proximate analysis, moisture content has a value of 80.7%, while ash content had a value of 1.26%. Eight bacterial and two fungal species were isolated from the fish. The condition factor of fish varied between 1 and 2. The study provides valuable information for monitoring and management of heavy metal pollution in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are advised to study in quiet settings; yet, many professionals assert that environments devoid of external stimulus, are often unnecessary to facilitate optimal learning conditions. Empirical controlled trials examining this assertion are scarce. This study explored whether music improves reading performance of preadolescents with ADHD compared with typically developed (TD) peers, and its correlation with changes in heart rate variability (HRV), an autonomic nervous system indicator. After a pilot phase (N = 20; age = 12.05), additional independent sample of ADHD (n = 25; age = 10.28) and TD (n = 25; age = 10.44) preadolescents completed reading tasks under four conditions: without background music, with calm music without lyrics, calm music with lyrics, and rhythmic music with lyrics. Reading comprehension and mean-levels of HRV changes (before and during each task) were assessed using validated instruments. Reading comprehension significantly improved under the music conditions in ADHD group and deteriorated among TD. Differences in HRV changes were significant between groups, and explained reading performance. These findings suggest that music may improve attentive skills of preadolescents with ADHD, but not TD, and urge the need to identify an optimal fit between individual and contextual characteristics.

AB  - Shallow groundwater extraction for irrigating park trees in the Taipei Basin is a sustainable solution for environmental resource management and urban landscape preservation because it reduces the potential for damage to the underground infrastructure caused by rising groundwater levels. This study identified appropriate locations with clean and stable groundwater for irrigating park trees in the metropolitan Taipei Basin according to variability conditions of water quality. First, six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater associated with the Taiwan irrigation water quality standard were collected from a 12-year Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration survey. The first, second, and third quartiles of the six hydrochemical parameters were obtained to establish three estimation thresholds. According to the irrigation water quality standard, multivariate indicator kriging (MVIK) was adopted to probabilistically evaluate the integration of the six hydrochemical parameters. Subsequently, entropy based on the MVIK estimates was applied to quantify the spatial and seasonal variability of the hydrochemical parameters. Finally, the locations with high estimated probabilities and low local uncertainties were identified as appropriate locations for extracting groundwater to irrigate park trees. The results revealed that MVIK and entropy can be combined to determine the variability conditions of groundwater quality parameters and identify parks suitable for extracting groundwater for irrigation.

AB  - In this study, the effects and mechanism of pretreating digestates with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and coal fly ash (CFA) were investigated. The water content (WC) and specific resistance of filtration (SRF) of the digestates were measured to evaluate the digestate dewaterability. The protein (PN) content, polysaccharide (PS) content, zeta potential and particle size of the digestates were measured to probe the mechanism of pretreatment. The results indicated that the digestate dewatering performance was effectively improved by joint conditioning with CTAB and CFA. For straw digestate (St-digestate), pig manure digestate (PM-digestate), cow dung digestate (CD-digestate) and kitchen waste digestate (KW-digestate), the optimum dosage of CTAB was 50%, 30%, 20% and 50% dry solid (DS) of digestate, respectively, and the optimum dosage of CFA was 100% DS of digestate. Co-conditioning with CTAB and CFA resulted in clear advantages compared to CTAB or CFA conditioning alone for decreasing the WC of digestates. The proposed mechanism is the synergistic effect of CTAB and CFA. CTAB releases extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and neutralizes charge, and CFA acts as a skeleton builder in the dewatering process to enhance dewaterability. Finally, a green degree method for the environmental assessment of chemical processes was adopted to evaluate digestate dewatering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While modeling algal productivity outdoors is crucial to assess the economic and environmental performance of full-scale cultivation, most of the models hitherto developed for this purpose have not been validated under fully relevant conditions, especially with regard to temperature variations. The objective of this study was to independently validate a model of algal biomass productivity accounting for both light and temperature and constructed using parameters experimentally derived using short-term indoor experiments. To do this, the accuracy of a model developed for Chlorella vulgaris was assessed against data collected from photobioreactors operated outdoor (New Zealand) over different seasons, years, and operating conditions (temperature-control/no temperature-control, batch, and fed-batch regimes). The model accurately predicted experimental productivities under all conditions tested, yielding an overall accuracy of +/-8.4% over 148 days of cultivation. For the purpose of assessing the feasibility of full-scale algal cultivation, the use of the productivity model was therefore shown to markedly reduce uncertainty in cost of biofuel production while also eliminating uncertainties in water demand, a critical element of environmental impact assessments. Simulations at five climatic locations demonstrated that temperature-control in outdoor photobioreactors would require tremendous amounts of energy without considerable increase of algal biomass. Prior assessments neglecting the impact of temperature variations on algal productivity in photobioreactors may therefore be erroneous.

AB  - The city of Sao Paulo is located in a subtropical region whose climate exhibits few defined seasons as well as frequent oscillations in temperature and rainfall throughout the year. In addition to interfering with physiological processes, these peculiar climatic dynamics influence the formation of O-3 and its influx into leaves, causing species used as bioindicators in temperate climates to be ineffective here. This study evaluated gas exchange variations in CO2 and H2O and leaf injuries induced by O-3 in Nicotiana tabacum Bel-W3 in relation to oscillations in environmental conditions. Plants were exposed to an O-3-polluted environment for fifteen periods of fourteen days each throughout 2008. Gas exchange and O-3 were higher during the summer and winter but were highly variable in all seasons. Severe injuries occurred during the winter and spring, with significant variation in this parameter being observed throughout the year. An analysis of biotic and abiotic variables revealed complex relationships among them, with great importance of meteorological factors in plant responses. We conclude that under unstable climatic conditions, the relationship between O-3 flux and injury is weak, and the qualitative character of biomonitoring is further confirmed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We conducted a manipulative experiment to investigate the influential factors of locomotor ability in steppe toad-headed lizards. By using a video-base method, we measured running speed of the lizards when they run on sands of different grain sizes. We also considered body condition, tail length and sex as fixed factors to analyze their effects on running speed of the lizard. Results showed that running speed of the lizard significantly differed among different trials of sand grain size. Specifically, the peak and the nadir values of the running speed were found on sands of 0.5-1 mm and 0.075-0.25 mm grains, respectively. When lizards ran on sands of different grain size their running speed changed significantly. Body condition and tail length also had significant effects on running speed. The findings indicated that locomotor ability of lizards depended on both body condition and the external environment. We hypothesized that sand grain size is one of the factors that influence the habitat selection in steppe toad-headed lizards. Moreover, this lizard may be used as an indicator of the development of sand dunes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pyrite framboid diameter and the extractable organic matter from the Middle Famennian rhythmic succession of limestones, nodular limestones and marly shales with pyritized fauna (KPG horizon) from the Holy Cross Mountains (Poland) were analyzed in order to constrain the water column structure during their deposition. In all samples investigated, small framboids (<5 mu m) that may have formed in the water column occur but the majority of the framboids have larger diameters, characteristic for their formation within the sediments, below an oxic or dysoxic water column. This suggests that during deposition of the KPG horizon, the depositional environment was highly dysoxic, but not anoxic. Low concentration of the aryl isoprenoids and isorenieratane, and very high values of the AIR parameter point to the episodic photic zone euxinia and later post-depositional, partial degradation of the OM in suboxic conditions. Intermittent, but certainly short-lasting, anoxic conditions on the sea-floor, may also be supported by the lamination of the rock matrix and increased mortality of the juvenile ammonoids. The results of this study indicate that anoxic conditions prevailed in the shallow depths below the water-sediment interface, where pyritization following by dissolution of aragonitic shells of fauna occurred.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that dieting, or the restriction of caloric intake, is ineffective because it increases chronic psychological stress and cortisol production-two factors that are known to cause weight gain; and to examine the respective roles of the two main behaviors that comprise dieting-monitoring one's caloric intake and restricting one's caloric intake-on psychological and biological stress indicators. Methods: In a 2 (monitoring vs. not) x 2 (restricting vs. not) fully crossed, controlled experiment, 121 female participants were assigned randomly to one of four dietary interventions for 3 weeks. The monitoring + restricting condition tracked their caloric intake and restricted their caloric intake (1200 kcal/day); the monitoring only condition tracked their caloric intake but ate normally; the restricting only condition was provided 1200 kcal/day of food but did not track their calories, and the control group ate normally and did not track their intake. Before and after the interventions, participants completed measures of perceived stress and 2 days of diurnal saliva sampling to test for cortisol. Results: Restricting calories increased the total output of cortisol, and monitoring calories increased perceived stress. Conclusions: Dieting may be deleterious to psychological well-being and biological functioning, and changes in clinical recommendations may be in order.

AB  - Soils are typically considered to be suboptimal environments for enteric organisms, but there is increasing evidence that Escherichia coli populations can become resident in soil under favorable conditions. Previous work reported the growth of autochthonous E. coli in a maritime temperate Luvic Stagnosol soil, and this study aimed to characterize, by molecular and physiological means, the genetic diversity and physiology of environmentally persistent E. coli isolates leached from the soil. Molecular analysis (16S rRNA sequencing, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a multiplex PCR method) established the genetic diversity of the isolates (n = 7), while physiological methods determined the metabolic capability and environmental fitness of the isolates, relative to those of laboratory strains, under the conditions tested. Genotypic analysis indicated that the leached isolates do not form a single genetic grouping but that multiple genotypic groups are capable of surviving and proliferating in this environment. In physiological studies, environmental isolates grew well across a broad range of temperatures and media, in comparison with the growth of laboratory strains. These findings suggest that certain E. coli strains may have the ability to colonize and adapt to soil conditions. The resulting lack of fecal specificity has implications for the use of E. coli as an indicator of fecal pollution in the environment.

AB  - Characterisation of the leaching behaviour of waste-containing materials is a crucial step in the environmental assessment for reuse scenarios. In our research we applied the multi-step European methodology ENV 12-920 to the leaching assessment of road materials containing metallurgical slag. A Zn slag from an imperial smelting furnace (ISF) and a Pb slag from a lead blast furnace (LBF) are investigated. The two slags contain up to 11.2wt% of lead and 3.5wt% of zinc and were introduced as a partial substitute for sand in two road materials, namely sand-cement and sand-bitumen. At the laboratory scale, a leaching assessment was performed first through batch equilibrium leaching tests. Second, the release rate of the contaminants was evaluated using saturated leaching tests on monolithic material. Third, laboratory tests were conducted on monolithic samples under intermittent wetting conditions. Pilot-scale tests were conducted for field testing of intermittent wetting conditions. The results show that the release of Pb and Zn from the materials in a saturated scenario was controlled by the pH of the leachates. For the intermittent wetting conditions, an additional factor, blocking of the pores by precipitation during the drying phase is proposed. Pilot-scale leaching behaviour only partially matched with the laboratory-scale test results: new mass transfer mechanisms and adapted laboratory leaching tests are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Plant phenology is affected by climate conditions and therefore provides a sensitive indicator to changes in climate. Studying the evolution and change in plant phenology aids in a better understanding of and predicting changes in ecosystems. Vegetation Indices (VIs) have been recognized for their utility in indicating vegetation activity. Understanding climatic variables and their relationship to VI support the knowledge base of how ecosystems are changing under a new climatic scenario. This study evaluates grassland growth phenology in the Biobio, Chile, biweekly with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Four growth parameters for the six agro-climatic regions were analyzed from 2001 to 2020: start and end of the season, time and value of maximum NDVI. For this purpose, the NDVI time series were smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filtering. In addition, by using monthly gridded database climate data, we studied correlations between phenology markers and rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature. The results show that both the start and end of the growing season did not significantly change; however, all agro-climatic regions grow faster and more vigorously. Thus, climatic conditions in Biobio have become more conducive to grassland growth over the 2001-2020 period.

AB  - In this work, a method of extracting natural indicators, anthocyanins, present in black beans was optimized. The best extraction condition was obtained with 50 g of beans and 93 g of water, under agitation at 150 rpm, at a temperature of 40 degrees C for 24 h. The wavelengths of greatest absorption for the indicator in its acidic and basic form were 523 nm and 620 nm respectively and these wavelengths were used to determine the pKa of the indicator. At least three pKa values were observed: 1.9; 7.2 and 10.7. A simplified condition for anthocyanins extraction, the same amount of water, tap water in these case, and beans kept together for 12 h without agitation and temperature control, was also evaluated. Both extracts were impregnated with qualitative filter paper, coffee filter paper and cotton buds and the materials impregnated with the indicator were tested with solutions of HCl, vinegar, NaOH and milk of magnesia. A comparison between the impregnated material and a universal pH indicator paper using buffer solutions pH 4.0, 7.0, 10.0 and 11.2 proved the applicability of the developed material since it presented adequate distinction in its color for the different pH conditions.

AB  - Osmotic adjustments play a fundamental role in plant responses to water deficit. For apple (Mains domestica) trees growing in the primary production areas of China, drought and low phosphorus (P) levels are the main sources of abiotic stress. Although tolerance to drought and low P are important breeding goals for cultivar improvement, there is little information on natural variation within Malus for these traits or the molecular mechanisms that may mediate tolerance. In this study, it was found that in plants grown under conditions of osmotic and low P stress, electrolyte leakage and photosynthetic parameters were significantly higher, but chlorophyll concentrations were lower compared with nonstressed plants. These physiological indicators revealed that, under low P condition, the order of osmotic stress resistance (high to low) was Malus sieversii (Ms) -> Malus prunifolia (Mp) -> Malus hupehensis (Mh). Expression of the phosphorus transporter genes PHT1;7,PHT1;12, and PHT2;1 in the roots and PHT1;12 and PHT4;5 in the leaves was positively correlated with plant osmotic resistance. It is proposed that the highly expressed PHT genes might improve P absorption and transport efficiency, resulting in the high osmotic stress resistance under low P level conditions in Malus species.

AB  - The black chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is believed to be tolerant to environmental stresses, but no systematic study on its cold tolerance selection for breeding a cold-tolerant cultivar has been reported so far. In this study 28 black chickpea accessions were screened to identify genetic variability under field conditions and selected accessions, showing different performance, were compared for some physiological indexes, including indicators of injury (Electrolyte Leakage Index (ELI) and accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA)) following cold-induced oxidative stress under short-term cold acclimation (STCA) and non-acclimation conditions. The cold-tolerant accession (4322) showed a lower membrane damage (ELI and MDA levels) compared to cold-sensitive accessions. CAT activity with cooperation of other antioxidant enzymes like GPX and PPO could play a significant role in defence against H2O2, especially after STCA in accession 4322 under cold stress (CS). The results suggested that accession 4322, as an appropriate cold tolerant candidate, showed an early higher tolerance to cold-induced oxidative stress compared to other accessions, as inferred from antioxidative activities of enzymes and higher yield (YLD) in field conditions. Thus, our results showed that, along with field studies, ELI and MDA under short-term cold treatments can be used to evaluate cold tolerance of chickpea profitably, in a short time.

AB  - We present the energy use situation in Hong Kong from 1979 to 2006. The primary energy requirement (PER) nearly tripled during the 28-year period, rising from 195,405 to 566,685TJ, about two-third of which was used for electricity generation. The residential and commercial sectors are the two largest electricity end-users with an average annual growth rate of 5.9% and 7.4%, respectively. The monthly consumption in these two sectors shows distinct seasonal variations mainly due to changes in the air-conditioning requirements, which are affected by the prevailing weather conditions. Principal component analysis of five major climatic variables-dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, global solar radiation, clearness index and wind speed-was conducted. Measured sector-wide electricity consumption was correlated with the corresponding two principal components determined using multiple regression technique. The regression models could give a very good indication of the annual electricity use (largely within a few percents), but individual monthly estimation could differ by up to 24%. It was also found that the climatic indicators determined appeared to show a slight increasing trend during the 28-year period indicating a subtle, but gradual change of climatic conditions that might affect future airconditioning requirements.

AB  - Sediments collected from the northwestern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean) were exposed to anoxic bottom-water conditions for more than 2 mo in order to examine the resistance of dominant meiobenthic taxa to prolonged anoxia. Copepods appeared to be most sensitive to anoxia, with densities being reduced to zero within 11 d. Compared to oxic conditions, densities of both nematodes and soft-shelled foraminifera were significantly lower under prolonged anoxia. In contrast, total hard-shelled foraminiferal densities did not differ significantly. This differential response resulted in a change in the meiobenthic community structure which was apparent after 1 mo. The change is reflected, and can be followed, in the foraminifera:nematode ratio, which is proposed as a bio-indicator of prolonged anoxia. The results clearly demonstrate that, among the meiobenthos, hard-shelled foraminifera are most resistant to prolonged anoxia. However, conditions resulting from the anoxic treatment (e.g. decreased biological interactions) were beneficial to some foraminiferal genera. This resulted in a shift in faunal patterns eventually leading to a strong reduction in foraminiferal generic diversity. Results also indicated that details of these trends may not be evident if only the part of the foraminiferal assemblage retained on a 63 mu m sieve is examined.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether biometric features of plants collected from single-species phytocoenoses developing in ponds can be used to describe habitat conditions of these water bodies. The biometric measurements were carried out in 148 field small water bodies at a total of 198 sites. The length of plants, their dry biomass, and volume of plant shoots were analyzed, converted to 1000 dm(3) of water. The biometric measurements showed very large differences in individual parameters of different macrophyte species. The biggest differences were found in the length of elodeids and helophytes (from 1 cm to > 900 cm), regardless of trophic conditions. Although the Polish flora is dominated by plants having a wide ecological range, there are species whose parameters correspond to specific habitat fertility. The highest biometric parameters were found for Ceratophyllum submersum, Sparganium erectum, Typha latifolia and Schoenoplectus lacustris in ponds characterized by increased trophic conditions. In contrast, Myriophyllum spp. alone showed a negative correlation with trophic state indices. The trophic effect on the studied parameters becomes more apparent for species with optima in fertile water bodies. The parameters of Ceratophyllum submersum can be considered as the trophic state index (TSI).

AB  - Perinatal M.S.G. treatment causes a syndrome characterized by damage to the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, other circumventricular areas, parts of the visual system and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The resulting hormonal dysfunction may be responsible for developmental anomalies of organ systems, obesity, and alterations in sensory/motor performance. We have shown that some behavioral indicators of M.S.G. toxicity in rats can be masked by rearing them in enriched housing conditions. Here, we evaluated the impact of six housing conditions on M.S.G.-induced alterations of organ systems and behavior. Perinatal M.S.G. treatment reduced adrenal, heart and testes weights, as well as total white blood cell (WBC) counts, and increased tail flick latencies. These measures were unaffected by the housing condition. M.S.G.-induced reductions in body weight, grip strength, water maze and dominance task performance varied as a function of housing. Deficits in water maze performance were most evident following social and isolated single-cage housing. We propose that deficits in water maze performance following perinatal M.S.G. may be attributable to hippocampal damage that can be alleviated by rearing the rats in stimulating environments.

AB  - Promoting sustainable use of wild animals and plants is a global target in biodiversity conservation. However, the role of wild harvest as a conservation tool remains controversial. When unsustainable, wild harvesting leads to population decline or even extirpation of species. When sustainable, it has the potential to promote win-win solutions for conservation and development. We reviewed 87 cases of wild harvesting of vertebrates and plants in developing countries to understand the conditions influencing its sustainability. We used random forest and logistic regression to find the most important predictors among a range of biological, demographic and economic indicators, and to detail the predicted effects on sustainability of harvest. Species resilience, GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratio were the strongest predictors of sustainability. Species resilience was positively related to sustainability of harvest, whereas GDP per capita and poverty ratio were negatively related. Harvesting a species with low resilience is more likely to be unsustainable when harvested in a middle-income, high poverty ratio country than in a low-income, low poverty ratio country. This study highlights the risks of wild population harvest under the challenging economic conditions inherent in developing countries, and visualize where efforts are most needed to achieve sustainable harvest.

AB  - Phlorotannins, marine polyphenols from the brown seaweeds, are a promising biologically active substance. This study aimed to optimize the extraction conditions for phlorotannin recovery from the brown seaweed Ecklonia cava using response surface methodology. Ethanol concentration (X-1, %), extraction temperature (X-2, degrees C), and extraction time (X-3, h) were chosen as independent variables. The dependent variables were total phlorotannin content (TPhC; Y-1) and yield of phlorotannins (Y-2). Estimated optimal conditions were as follows: TPhC (Y-1): X-1 = 95%, X-2 = 80 degrees C, X-3 = 22.8 h, and yield of phlorotannins (Y-2): X-1 = 88.3%, X-2 = 80 degrees C, X-3 = 24 h. Predicted values of dependent variables under each optimal condition were TPhC (Y-1) = 570.2 mg phloroglucinol equivalents/g (mg PGE/g, dry basis) and yield of phlorotannins (Y-2) = 7.8% and were similar to the experimental values. In addition, content of dieckol, which is known as an indicator of phlorotannin products, was measured. Dieckol contents of the phlorotannin extracts with the highest (565.7 mg PGE/g) and lowest (315.4 mg PGE/g) TPhC were 49.1 and 34.4 mg/g (dry basis), respectively.

AB  - Diatoms are used as environmental indicators in the Florida Everglades, a large subtropical wetland highly impacted by phosphorus pollution. However, the taxonomy of the diatom flora, a mix of temperate and tropical diatoms, is understudied. Therefore, we analyzed the taxonomy of 71 diatom taxa collected in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A). Diatoms were analyzed from sediment cores and from floating algal mats collected in phosphorusenriched northern WCA-2A and in relatively unenriched southern WCA-2A. In addition, diatoms were analyzed from experimental mesocosms in southern WCA-2A dosed with 0-126 mu gL(-l) P-PO4. Total phosphorus optima were calculated for dominant taxa. Average percent abundances in phosphorus-enriched and unenriched conditions are given for all taxa. Eleven taxa were dominant (>5% abundance in at least one sample) in unenriched conditions, 17 taxa were observed only in phosphorus-enriched conditions, and 9 taxa were observed only below 2 cm in sediment cores. We compared the flora to taxonomical accounts of diatoms from temperate and tropical regions, with a special focus on nearby Antillean islands (Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico). Light microscope images of each taxon and SEM images of selected taxa are presented. Taxonomical measurements are given for each taxon, and differences from descriptions in other taxonomical accounts are discussed. A new combination, Achnanthes caledonica Lange-Bertalot = Achnanthidium caledonicum (Lange-Bertalot) comb. nov. is proposed.

AB  - Carbon allocation to the cambium along the stem is represented by a reaction-diffusion model along a continuous sink. Vertical variations of stem area increment along the stem are then theoretically connected to partitioning coefficients between tree compartments, at different spatial scales. This model is very sensitive to environmental growth conditions, and demonstrates the importance of topology and geometry in models of secondary tree growth. An analytical resolution is proposed to describe the vertical profile of stem area increment between crown basis and soil level. An empirical parametric equation is derived from this theoretical model. The 3 parameters of this equation are related to the internal and environmental conditions of the tree. These parameters can be used as indicators in order to study the variability of stem taper. This equation is separately fitted on data from two experiments, with different silviculture and site quality, for Picea abies of different ages. Variation in the parameters is discussed according to growth conditions. This equation is further integrated in order to predict stem volume increment. Finally, some simple characteristic heights are derived from this function as indicators of functional crown basis. These heights are systematically calculated to predict crown recession. They are finally compared to heights measured during field work.

AB  - The fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu & R.S. Soper (Enthomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae) was found in the north-east Bosnia and Herzegovina populations of Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) in summer 2013 at 5 localities (Figure 1, Table 1). Since the first introduction of this pathogen in Bulgaria in 1999 several southeastern European countries confirmed its presence in subsequent years. Recent findings of this pathogen in the neighbouring countries, especially in Croatia and Serbia, and also regarding to the progradation of L. dispar populations in some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attracted the attention of the researchers on the possibility of finding this highly selective fungal pathogen. The sampling localities were selected based on pre-collected data of reported L. dispar population progradation, but also to the relative geographical vicinity regarding the new Croatian positive sites with E. maimaiga fungal pathogen. Large areas were aerially sprayed with a Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki - based bacterial insecticide and larval development was closely inspected in the field. In the last 70 years, from the first reported outbreak of L. dispar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, many outbreaks have been reported, causing the supstantial economical and ecological damage in forestry but also in agriculture production. Biological insecticide based on the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, commonly used for the suppression of the local populations of L. dispar, does not always produce the desired impact. Consequently, the highly selective, host specific, fungal pathogen that could be put in use as a biological control agent of the L. dispar populations is found to be very interesting for both science and professional application thus deminishing the economical and ecological negative feedback of this indigenous defoliator. The research was carried out during July 2013 throughout the north-east part of Bosnia and Herzegovina where gypsy moth populations continued an ongoing outbreak. From five selected localities, where excessive mortality was observed, larval cadavers were sampled from tree trunks 0,5 - 1,5 m above the ground. Only older larval stages (L-4-L-6)were sampled due to the late sampling period. Cadavers were inspected, and larval tissue samples were prepared under the stereo microscope (LEICA Leitz MZ8) and light stereo microscope (Motic SMZ - 168 TLED). Process was digitaly documented with Olympus SP - 500UZ digital camera equipped with the Olympus QuickPHOTO CAMERA 2.3 digital imaging software. Larval tissue samples were inspected under light microscope (Olympus BX53) and images were recorded by digital camera Motic MoticamPro 252A. Measurements of azygospores and conidia (conidiospores) were made via digital imaging software Motic Images Plus 2.0 and Motic Images Advanced 3.2. associated with a compound microscope. Microscopic analysis of the dead tissue larvae, in all five locations, confirmed both conidia and azygospores or azygospores only, of the E. maimaiga species. Spore dimensions were as follows: pear-shaped conidia crosswise 25,7-35,1 mu m and 34,6-43,7 mu m lenghtwise; azygospores 32,2-47,9 mu m in diameter (Figure 2, Figure 3). The type of spores (conidia or azygospores or both) that will form after host death is determined by the pathogen and the type of host infection, host-related factors and environmental conditions. Macroscopic symptoms of E.
   maimaiga attack were easily recognizable on the tree trunks along with some signs of larval mortality caused by Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polihedrosis virus (LdMNPV) (Figure 4). There were very few signs of parasitoid mortality, but unlike in the Croatian sites (Hragovec et al. 2013), with a great abundant presence of gypsy moth predators like Calosoma sycophanta L. (Figure 5), which could be an indicator that the pathogen has emerged when the L. dispar population was already starting its descent into a retrogradation phase. Just like in the Croatian localities where the sampling took place (Hragovec et al. 2013), dead larvae were hanging from the tree trunks head down all through the sites and no living larva or viable pupa could be found in the area. Based on the field collections and microscopic analysis, entomopathogenic fungus E. maimaiga, a pathogen of L. dispar introduced on the European continent, has been confirmed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Extensive monitoring of the fungal pathogen in the following years will give us the information on pathogen spatial spread, its speed and the possibility for establishing its permanent position among the other local indigenous species. Nevertheless, there are some concerns whether E. maimaiga may show some direct and indirect impacts on non-targeted and beneficial organisms in the future, or change the basic community structure of folivore insect guilds on oaks, maybe resulting in increasing populations of other defoliating insect groups such as tortricids, geometrids and sawflies. These concerns will demand more scientific attention in the future.

AB  - Building envelopes can manage light, heat gains or losses, and ventilation and, as such, play a key role in the overall building performance. Research has been focusing on increasing their efficiency by proposing dynamic and adaptive systems, meaning that they evolve to best meet the internal and external varying conditions. Living organisms are relevant examples of adaptability as they have evolved, facing extreme conditions while maintaining stable internal conditions for survival. From a framework based on the inspiration of living envelopes such as animal constructions or biological skins, the concept of an adaptive envelope inspired by the Morpho butterfly was proposed. The system can manage heat, air, and light transfers going through the building and includes adaptive elements with absorption coefficients varying with temperature. This paper presents the developed framework that led to the final concept as well as the concept implementation and assessment. A prototype for heat and light management was built and integrated into a test bench. Measurements were performed to provide a first assessment of the system. In parallel, geometrical parametric models were created to compare multiple configurations in regards to indicators such as air, light, or heat transfers. One of the models provided light projections on the system that were compared with measurements and validated as suitable inputs in grey-box models for the system characterization.
