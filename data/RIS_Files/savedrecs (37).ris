AB  - Since the 1990's, forest resource maps and small area estimates have been produced by combining national forest inventory (NFI) field plot data, optical satellite images and numerical map data using a non-parametric k-nearest neighbour method. In Finland, thematic maps of forest variables have been produced by the means of multi-source NFI (MS-NFI) for eight to ten times depending on the geographical area, but the resulting time series have not been systematically utilized. The objective of this study was to explore the possibilities of the time series for monitoring the key ecosystem condition indicators for forests. To this end, a contextual Mann-Kendall (CMK) test was applied to detect trends in time-series of two decades of thematic maps. The usefulness of the observed trends may depend both on the scale of the phenomena themselves and the uncertainties involved in the maps. Thus, several spatial scales were tested: the MS-NFI maps at 16 x 16 m(2) pixel size and units of 240 x 240 m(2), 1200 x 1200 m(2) and 12 000 x 12 000 m(2) aggregated from the MS-NFI map data. The CMK test detected areas of significant increasing trends of mean volume on both study sites and at various unit sizes except for the original thematic map pixel size. For other variables such as the mean volume of tree species groups, the proportion of broadleaved tree species and the stand age, significant trends were mostly found only for the largest unit size, 12000 x 12 000 m(2). The multiple testing corrections decreased the amount of significant p-values from the CMK test strongly. The study showed that significant trends can be detected enabling indicators of ecosystem services to be monitored from a time-series of satellite image-based thematic forest maps.

AB  - Background: Geriatric syndromes affect the quality of life of older adults and pose a heavy burden on society and families. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multi-dimensional diagnotic process including medical assessment, physical function assessment, cognitive and psychological function assessment, social/environmental factors assessment.
   Objective: This study investigated ten common geriatric syndromes by CGA in hospitalized patients and aimed to provide guidance for the comprehensive management of senile patients.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 376 older inpatients from two tertiary hospitals in Chengdu, China. The survey contained ten geriatric syndromes, including daily living capacity, swallowing disorders, polypharmacy, comorbidities, chronic pain, malnutrition, falls, urinary incontinence, chronic constipation, and pressure sore. Frequency and influencing factors of these geriatric syndromes were assessed by CGA.
   Results: The highest prevalence of CGA in this study was functional independence which accounted for 89.10% of the 376 patients, followed by malnutrition risk (69.68%), chronic pain (68.09%), potypharmacy(65 .16%), chronic constipation(51 .60%),urinary incontinence (40.96%). Risk of falls accounted for 35.11% of the total, which was similar to the pressure ulcers risk (33 .51%). 13.83% had dysphagia. Only 3.72% of all the patients had comorbidities. There were significant differences in the prevalence of chronic pain and high risk of falls between men and women (P <0.05). There were statistic differences in the prevalence of polypharmacy, chronic pain, high risk of falls, urinary incontinence, and constipation among elderly patients of dfferent ages (P <0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that the age was the most important factor for geriatric syndromes. Besides, gender, exercise, diet, smoking, economy, culture, marriage, living condition and medical payment were also the influencing factors of geriatric syndromes.
   Conclusions: Geriatric syndromes were common in China elderly inpatients and age is the most important influencing factor.

AB  - Background Physical, cognitive and social frailty is increasingly being recognized as a prognostic factor in the perioperative treatment of older patients; however, the concept of frailty has not been introduced into clinical routine in anesthesia. Objectives Definition of terms, presentation of tools for determining the degree of frailty and measures to improve the clinical outcome of patients at risk. Proposal of a pragmatic approach for the detection and treatment of high-risk patients in everyday clinical practice. Material and methods Evaluation of current reviews and original publications. Discussion and modification of established frailty assessment tools in context of the needs in perioperative medicine. Results The degree of frailty is associated with the postoperative outcome. Depending on the definition used, the term frailty refers to a degraded resilience in the physical, mental or social domain. Although there is still no universal definition of frailty, it is clear that frailty is directly correlated with survival and postoperative morbidity. Classical perioperative risk markers such as age or ASA classification do not reach such high predictive value. For the perioperative screening and evaluation of frail patients, an adapted version of the MAGIC assessment in combination with two signal questions is recommended. The extent of frailty in a patient can be improved by a sufficient diet, by physiotherapeutic exercises and by providing cognitive aids; however, scientific proof that preoperative improvement of the frailty status subsequently improves postoperative results is available for only a few specific clinical conditions. Conclusion In contrast to commonly used perioperative risk classifications, frailty is a sensitive marker for the patient's biological age. Therefore, it appears more suitable for estimating the perioperative risk than chronological age or other conventional tools, such as the ASA classification and is therefore a prerequisite for patient centered treatment pathways.

AB  - The Upper Missouri River headwaters (UMH) basin (36400 km(2)) depends on its river corridors to support irrigated agriculture and world-class trout fisheries. We evaluated trends (1984-2016) in riparian wetness, an indicator of the riparian condition, in peak irrigation months (June, July and August) for 158 km(2) of riparian area across the basin using the Landsat normalized difference wetness index (NDWI). We found that 8 of the 19 riparian reaches across the basin showed a significant drying trend over this period, including all three basin outlet reaches along the Jefferson, Madison and Gallatin rivers. The influence of upstream climate was quantified using per reach random forest regressions. Much of the interannual variability in the NDWI was explained by climate, especially by drought indices and annual precipitation, but the significant temporal drying trends persisted in the NDWI-climate model residuals, indicating that trends were not entirely attributable to climate. Over the same period we documented a basin-wide shift from 9% of agriculture irrigated with center-pivot irrigation to 50% irrigated with center-pivot irrigation. Riparian reaches with a drying trend had a greater increase in the total area with center-pivot irrigation (within reach and upstream from the reach) relative to riparian reaches without such a trend (p<0.05). The drying trend, however, did not extend to river discharge. Over the same period, stream gages (n = 7) showed a positive correlation with riparian wetness (p<0.05) but no trend in summer river discharge, suggesting that riparian areas may be more sensitive to changes in irrigation return flows relative to river discharge. Identifying trends in riparian vegetation is a critical precursor for enhancing the resiliency of river systems and associated riparian corridors.

AB  - The objects of study were 150 samples of natural dry red and white grape wines of Russian origin, obtained by traditional technologies from European and hybrid grape varieties grown in wineries in Krasnodar Krai in 2010-2016. Natural red (Cabernet, Merlot) and white (Aligote, Riesling, Pinot Noir) (alcohol content of 9-13 % by volume, acidity of 4-7 g/dm3), as well as blend wines based on Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot Noir wines made under experimental conditions were analyzed. Chromatographic and electrophoretic methods were used to determine the content of volatile components and amino acids in the studied samples. A sensory assessment of wine quality was carried out by wine specialists working in the wine industry and having professional experience in the field of sensory analysis. Using statistical modeling we carried out a comparative assessment of the role of amino acids - threonine, proline, arginine and volatile compounds - methanol, acetic acid, furfural in the perception of taste and aromatic properties of wines, a general indicator of which is the average tasting rating. High adequacy of the regression model constructed using covariance analysis indicates that mainly amino acids and volatile compounds determine the sensory properties of wines. The dominant role of amino acids in the perception of taste and aromatic characteristics compared to other wine components is mathematically justified in accordance with the criterion of one-dimensional significance. It has been shown that more than 82% of the sensory characteristics of the analyzed wines group fall on the amino acids and volatile compounds under consideration, and less than 18% - on all the others, including titrated acids, free amino acids, mineral components, phenols, etc.

AB  - We investigated the impacts of two natural disturbances (i.e., heavy rain and dry events) on benthic macro-invertebrates at three different stream types: perennial, intermittent and ephemeral streams. Co-occurrence networks displayed the differences of macroinvertebrate community stability among three different stream types. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling demonstrated distinct impacts of heavy rain and drought on macroinvertebrate communities. The samples from the heavy rain and dry events were clearly classified under different clusters than other samples regardless of the stream type. Lotic preferred species such as Kiotina decorata and Sweltsa nikkoensis were selected as an indicator species in the perennial stream, whereas lentic preferred species such as Ephemera strigata and Davidius lunatus were chosen in the intermittent stream. In the ephemeral stream, oligochaetes such as Dorydrilus sp. and Fridericia sp., which are readily found in unstable habitats with their short-life cycle, were selected as indicator species. Based on the Random Forest model, the amount of precipitation was the most influential factor, mainly for determining the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrate species, followed by electric conductivity and velocity. The Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) detected 32 (17.6%) of 182 taxa in total as robust 42 response, and most of the taxa (26 taxa) were sensitive to the increase in precipitation, whereas 6 taxa were tolerant. The community change points for the amount of precipitation were 121.2 mm/month for tolerant species and 36.6 mm/month for sensitive species. Finally, our results revealed that the occurrences of two extreme hydrological disturbances (i.e., heavy rain and dry events) were primary factors for determining the spatial and temporal extent of habitat diversity and stability in the Korean peninsula streams under the least disturbance conditions.

AB  - The Soltanieh Formation in the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran is not only a key lithostratigraphic unit for reconstruction of the Iranian geological history, but also a globally outstanding succession to reveal variations in seawater composition across the Precambrian-Cambrian (PC-C) transition. Mineralogical and geochemical data from a continuous stratigraphic record of Lower and Upper Shale members of the Soltanieh Formation are used to define their provenance, tectonic setting as well as geochemical variations during the PC-C transition. The Soltanieh mudrocks are composed of quartz and plagioclase, with minor constituents of illite, chlorite and montmorillonite. The chemical index of alteration, A-CN-K (Al2O3 - CaO + Na2O - K2O) relations, index of compositional variability, and Th/Sc versus Zr/Sc ratios indicate low chemical weathering in source areas, compositionally immature and first-cycle sediments. Immobile trace-element ratios and discrimination diagrams, chondrite-normalized rare Earth element (REE) patterns and negative Eu anomaly, along with low total REE abundances and negligible Ce anomalies, demonstrate that the Soltanieh Formation was mainly derived from proximal felsic-intermediate Cadomian magmatic arc sources and deposited in a continental-arc-related basin on the proto-Tethyan active margin of Gondwana. The palaeoredox indicators exhibit a remarkable change in environmental condition from a suboxic to an oxic state across the PC-C transition from the Kahar Formation to the Upper Shale Member of the Soltanieh Formation. Moreover, a significant upwards increase of P, Ba, and Ca is likely associated with enhanced fluxes of nutrient elements during the PC-C transition, coeval with the building of collisional mountain belts during the amalgamation of Gondwana.

AB  - Background and approachCommon standards for laboratory studies of non-target organisms are recognised as prerequisite to assist the risk assessments regarding the evaluation of environmental effects of transgenic crops. Here, we provide specific recommendations significant for experimental procedures of laboratory studies to test potential adverse effects of Bt maize on larvae of non-target Lepidoptera. We searched and analysed both ecotoxicological test protocols for pesticides in the EU as well as the non-target tests with Lepidoptera applied in unpublished industry studies submitted officially by agro-companies for the GMO authorisation in Europe.ResultsThe classical ecotoxicology protocols applied for testing pesticides could serve as general guidelines, but do not completely fit the specific and differing requirements for assessing non-target effects of transgenic crops. The analysis of the non-target studies submitted for the application of the cultivation of Bt maize in Europe revealed critical limitations, thus corroborating the urgent need for common quality criteria. Based on our evaluations, we identified several issues requiring harmonisation or standardisation of the experimental conditions and approach, e.g., the application of Bt maize pollen, synthetic toxins, the provided diet for larvae, experimental controls, magnitude and duration of exposure to Bt, relevant variables to be recorded, and sufficient statistical power.ConclusionsOur recommendations should stimulate the development of precise guidance for the authorities, and support the operationalisation of the required laboratory tests for the evaluation of non-target effects of Bt maize pollen on non-target Lepidoptera, also contributing to standards of other ecotoxicity tests with Lepidoptera larvae, e.g., for pesticides.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is very important for sugarcane yield improvement, but the excessive application of N fertilizer brings about N pollution and a cost increase. Through distinguishing the difference of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), we can reasonably apply N fertilizer according to the NUE characteristics of sugarcane varieties, and thus reduce N loss and maintain high yield. The present study showed the pot experiment results of identifying NUE types of nine main sugarcane varieties in the main sugarcane producing areas of China under controlled conditions, and identified the key physiological and agronomic indictors which can help to determine the NUE types of sugarcane. The test clones were exposed to varying levels of N fertilizer and 15 parameters that are likely to impact NUE were measured. The key results are (1) Sugarcane variety ROC22 has the high plant dry weight (PDW) and NUE among nine varieties under different N rates, it can take advantages under low N supply (225 kg/hm(2) urea), and less N fertilizer can be applied properly in production. (2) Varieties of GT32 was good performing genotype for PDW and NUE under low N supply (225 kg/hm(2) urea), GT42 was more suitable for moderate N environment (450 kg/hm(2) urea), while YT94-128 was at middle N and high N supply (450-675 kg/hm(2) urea). (3) Late stage of shoot elongation is suitable for differentiating sugarcane clones for NUE. (4) Leaf glutamine synthetase activity is the most reliable predictor of NUE in sugarcane. The result of pot experiment is sufficient to differentiate clonal variation for NUE in sugarcane as it reflects field experimental results. This study can set up a basis for identification the NUE types of sugarcane varieties and the development of reasonable N fertilizer application.

AB  - Opencast coal mining activities can cause severe changes to terrestrial ecosystems, leading to soil degradation. Soil pores play an important role in the transport and storage of water and nutrients. Soil macropore systems may be used as an indicator of soil quality, and soil macropore characteristics can reflect the quality of reclaimed soil in opencast coal mining areas. In this study, unmined, unreclaimed and reclaimed soils from the Antaibao opencast coal mine of the loess area from China were scanned to acquire information regarding soil macropores using a high-resolution, non-destructive computed tomography (CT) technique. The 3D distributions of different soil macropores were reconstructed using the Matlab platform, and the quantitative characteristics of soil macropores were determined by analyzing the number of individual detached soil macropore and the volume of individual detached macropore. The results indicated that 3D reconstruction technique can visually and accurately characterize the macropore system of compacted soils in opencast coal mining area. The number and volume of individual detached soil macropores can be acquired from a 3D soil model. The macroporosity of unreclaimed soils was poor due to the compaction of heavy machinery during mining activities, and it was about 3% based on CT technique. The macroporosity and functions of reclaimed soils significantly improved with increasing reclamation age. The number of individual detached soil macropores had a good linear relationship with macroporosity. With increasing macroporosity, the diversity of macropore sizes decreased and the volume of the largest individual detached macropore increased. To improve the macropore conditions of compacted soils, land reclamation (including land consolidation, surface soil covering, and vegetation planting) should be carried out as soon as possible.

AB  - The Spermonde Archipelago is a complex of similar to 70 mostly populated islands off Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia, in the center of the Coral Triangle. The reefs in this area are exposed to a high level of anthropogenic disturbances. Previous studies have shown that variation in the benthos is strongly linked to water quality and distance from the mainland. However, little is known about the fish assemblages of the region and if their community structure also follows a relationship with benthic structure and distance from shore. In this study, we used eight islands of the archipelago, varying in distance from 1 to 55 km relative to the mainland, and 3 years of surveys, to describe benthic and fish assemblages and to examine the spatial and temporal influence of benthic composition on the structure of the fish assemblages. Cluster analysis indicated that distinct groups of fish were associated with distance, while few species were present across the entire range of sites. Relating fish communities to benthic composition using a multivariate generalized linear model confirmed that fish groups relate to structural complexity (rugosity) or differing benthic groups; either algae, reef builders (coral and crustose coralline algae) or invertebrates and rubble. From these relationships we can identify sets of fish species that may be lost given continued degradation of the Spermonde reefs. Lastly, the incorporation of water quality, benthic and fish indices indicates that local coral reefs responded positively after an acute disturbance in 2013 with increases in reef builders and fish diversity over relatively short (1 year) time frames. This study contributes an important, missing component (fish community structure) to the growing literature on the Spermonde Archipelago, a system that features environmental pressures common in the greater Southeast Asian region.

AB  - The demographic and labor resource situation in the municipal formations of the Stavropol Territory is characterized by a decrease in the number of the rural population due to migration outflow, which is not compensated by natural growth. The demographic dependency ratio between persons of unemployable age and people of working age is increasing. Agricultural organizations feel a labor shortage. The share of young people under 30 in the structure of agricultural organizations in certain areas of the Stavropol Territory is less than five percent. The value of this indicator depends on the migration increase, the amount of investment per hectare of agricultural land and the level of wages. Accounting for these factors is necessary for the interrelated solution of the problems of investment and demographic development in rural areas of the region.
   The analysis revealed the demographic features of the formation of the human capacity of agricultural organizations in the Stavropol Territory. The socio-economic situation in the rural areas of the region contributes to the attraction of migrants, but cannot ensure their full securing and retain their own inhabitants, does not contribute to the rise in births, leads to an increase in the demographic burden of the unemployable ages for persons of working ages.
   Agricultural organizations have an unmet need for manpower, while the resources of young ages for replenishment are very limited. In these conditions, the investment activity of agricultural producers and the level of material incentives for employees are among the main factors in securing young people in the countryside. Their account is necessary for the justified adoption of strategic decisions on the development of agricultural production in the Stavropol Territory, the definition of targeted measures to improve the current and prospective demographic situation and to prevent its deterrent influence on the development of the rural economy.

AB  - Neuroinflammation precedes neuronal loss in striatal neurodegenerative diseases and can be exacerbated by the release of proinflammatory molecules by microglia. These molecules can affect trafficking of AMPARs. The preferential trafficking of calcium-permeable versus impermeable AMPARs can result in disruptions of [Ca2+](i) and alter cellular functions. In striatal neurodegenerative diseases, changes in [Ca2+](i) and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) have been reported. Therefore, this study sought to determine whether a proinflammatory environment alters AMPA-stimulated [Ca2+](i) through calcium-permeable AMPARs and/or L-type VGCCs in dopamine-2- and dopamine-1-expressing striatal spiny projection neurons (D2 and D1 SPNs) in the dorsal striatum. Mice expressing the calcium indicator protein, GCaMP in D2 or D1 SPNs, were utilized for calcium imaging. Microglial activation was assessed by morphology analyses. To induce inflammation, acute mouse striatal slices were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we report that LPS treatment potentiated AMPA responses only in D2 SPNs. When a nonspecific VGCC blocker was included, we observed a decrease of AMPA-stimulated calcium fluorescence in D2 but not D1 SPNs. The remaining agonist-induced [Ca2+](i) was mediated by calcium-permeable AMPARs because the responses were completely blocked by a selective calcium-permeable AMPAR antagonist. We used isradipine, the highly selective L-type VGCC antagonist to determine the role of L-type VGCCs in SPNs treated with LPS. Isradipine decreased AMPA-stimulated responses selectively in D2 SPNs after LPS treatment. Our findings suggest that dorsal striatal D2 SPNs are specifically targeted in proinflammatory conditions and that L-type VGCCs and calcium-permeable AMPARs are important mediators of this effect.

AB  - Striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) are the main host for the Hantaan virus (HTNV), the cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in central China. It has been shown that host population density is associated with pathogen dynamics and disease risk. Thus, a higher population density of A. agrarius in an area might indicate a higher risk for an HFRS outbreak. Here, we surveyed the A. agrarius population density between 2005 and 2012 on the Weihe Plain, Shaanxi Province, China, and used this monitoring data to examine the relationships between the dynamics of A. agrarius populations and environmental conditions of crop-land, represented by remote sensing based indicators. These included the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation, net photosynthesis (PsnNet), gross primary productivity, and land surface temperature. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to detect the possible causal relationship between PsnNet, A. agrarius population density and HFRS risk. The results showed that A. agrarius was the most frequently captured species with a capture rate of 0.9 individuals per hundred trap-nights, during 96 months of trapping in the study area. The risk of HFRS was highly associated with the abundance of A. agrarius, with a 1-5-month lag. The breeding season of A. agrarius was also found to coincide with agricultural activity and seasons with high PsnNet. The SEM indicated that PsnNet had an indirect positive effect on HFRS incidence via rodents. In conclusion, the remote sensing-based environmental indicator, PsnNet, was highly correlated with HTNV reservoir population dynamics with a 3-month lag (r = 0.46, p < 0.01), and may serve as a predictor of potential HFRS outbreaks.

AB  - Infant mortality is a sensitive indicator of urban environmental conditions, and investigating the geography of such an indicator provides insight into variables affecting public health in urban North America in 1880 and 1920. Geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis now provide a means by which to view past infant mortality distributions from a new perspective, one not available at the time. This study makes use of data collected from the 1880 and 1920 Vital Statistics Death Records for Baltimore, Maryland - mapping each infant death to his or her place of residence. Previous work with the 1880 data indicates an uneven distribution of infant deaths with some degree of spatial clustering. The current study takes these findings a step further through the use of the local spatial autocorrelation statistic, Gi*, to identify the locations of clusters in one or both years. The aim of the comparison is to determine whether the location of infant mortality clusters remained the same over time indicating persistent environmental, and possibly demographic, challenges in certain neighborhoods. The data indicated hotspots of infant mortality in both years with persistence in the Fells Point area of Baltimore. The significant clusters appeared in neighborhoods with large African American and/or immigrant populations in both years. The hotspots in the primarily African American neighborhood were only significant in 1880 despite presenting some intriguing questions about what caused such a change, particular when the population in that part of the city did not change. This work offers insights into the spatial distribution of infant mortality in the past and clues regarding which parts of the city need additional investigation to better understand their social and environmental characteristics.

AB  - Collisions and attendant shock compaction must have been important for the accretion and lithification of planetesimals, including the parent bodies of chondrites, but the conditions under which these occurred are not well constrained. A simple model for the compaction of chondrites predicts that shock intensity as recorded by shock stage should be related to porosity and grain fabric. To test this model, we studied sixteen ordinary chondrites of different groups (H, L, LL) using X-ray computed microtomography (mu CT) to measure porosity and metal fabric, ideal gas pycnometry and 3D laser scanning to determine porosity, and optical microscopy (OM) to determine shock stage. These included a subsample of six chondrites previously studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize microstructures in olivine. Combining with previous data, results support the simple model in general, but not for chondrites with low shock-porosity-foliation (low-SPF chondrites). These include Kernouve (H6), Portales Valley (H6/7), Butsura (H6), Park (L6), GRO 85209 ( L6), Estacado ( H6), MIL 99301 (LL6), Spade (H6), and Queen's Mercy (H6), among others. The data for these meteorites are best explained by high ambient heat during or after shock. Low-SPF chondrites tend to have older Ar-40/(39) Ar ages (similar to 4435- 4526 Ma) than other, non-low-SPF type 6 chondrites in this study. We conclude that the H, L, and LL asteroids all were shock-compacted at an early stage while warm, with collisions occurring during metamorphic heating of the parent bodies. Results ultimately bear on whether chondrite parent bodies have internal structures more akin to a metamorphosed onion shell or metamorphosed rubble pile, and on the nature of accretion and lithification processes for planetesimals.

AB  - In given study the results of measurements of heavy metals content (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Co, Ni, Mn) and oil hydrocarbons in a soil cover of Ivanovo city are presented. The chemical pollution of soils was estimated with the comparison of obtained results with normalized values as well as on parameters which are indicators of unfavorable impact on a population health that is on the coefficient of concentration of chemical substance (Kc) and total parameter of chemical pollution (Zc). It has been established that the content of lead and oil products exceeds the standardized values by a factor of 6.7 and 3.9 times, respectively, and for all other controlled compounds their concentrations in all the test samples exceed the background values, with the exception of cobalt and manganese. For a determination of level pollution and for revealing main sources of anthropogenic impact the territory under study was divided on the following zones: buffer areas of gasoline stands, zones with the intensive vehicular traffic and residential zones. On Zc value the residential zones refer to category of permissible level of pollution (Zc<16) whereas territories near roads and gasoline stands are characterized with the average level of pollution (16<Zc<32). The dynamics of the change in the value of the complex indicator of the level of chemical contamination of soil (Zc) for the period from 1999 to 2014 indicates a deterioration in the environmental condition of the soil, namely, the value of Zc increased from 12 to 18, which is probably associated with growth of vehicles (an average increase of 6% per year). On the basis of the method of geochemical mapping the reasonable assumption was made that the main contribution to soil contamination is provided by local sources of city.

AB  - Sources of contamination such as animal feces runoff, organic fertilizer application, and the release of partially treated or untreated sewage can lead to the contamination of aquatic environments by Cryptosporidium spp. The quality of mussels as food is closely related to the sanitary conditions of the marine environment where these bivalves are found. Marine mollusks are filter feeders that are able to retain Cryptosporidium oocysts in their tissue, thus functioning as bioindicators. A total of 72 pooled mussel samples of the species Perna perna were collected at two sites (A and B) in the municipality of Mangaratiba, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Sampling involved removal of 30 mussels, from each collection site every month for one year. The 30 mussels from each sampling were then allocated into three groups of 10. Two Cryptosporidium spp. genes (18S and GP60) were targeted for DNA amplification from the samples obtained. After purification, all of the products obtained were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Of the 72 samples analyzed using the nested-PCR for the 18S gene target, 29.2% were positive for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. Of these samples, 52.4% were collected at site A (ie 11/21) and 47.6% at site B (ie 10/21). The 18S genes of all the samples considered positive for Cryptosporidium spp. were sequenced, and the following three species were identified: Cryptosporidium parvum, C. meleagridis, and C. andersoni. Three distinct C. parvum subtypes (IIaA19G2R2; IIaA20G2R2; IIaA20G3R2) were identified using the GP60 gene. More studies to evaluate the zoonotic potential of this species should be performed as both sampling locations contain human and/or animal fecal contaminants. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - In order to provide the scientific basis for the environmental risk assessment of cycloxaprid and 6-Cl-PMNI (intermediate of cycloxaprid), the degradation properties of 6-Cl-PMNI in aerobic, anaerobic and/or sterile soil, as well as in water with different pH values at different temperature were explored under laboratory conditions using HPLC for its kinetics study and UPLC-MS/MS for the identification of its metabolites/degradation products. Fortification study showed that the recoveries of 71.4-100.5% with the maximum coefficient variation (CV) of 7.47% were obtained. The linear range was 0.1-10 mg/L with the good linearity of R-2 = 0.9990. For standard, the method LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) was 0.03 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L, respectively. Results demonstrated the good performance of the developed method. Kinetics study indicated that the degradation half-lives (t(0.5)) in pH 3-pH 10 buffers varied from 111.8 d to 288.8 d at 25 degrees C but rapidly shortened to 1.6-25.7 d at 70 degrees C. Good negative linear ships (R-2 >= 0.8423) between half life and temperature were found. 6-Cl-PMNI could be readily degraded in non-sterile soil (t(0.5) 0.8-7.5 d) while slowly degraded in sterile soil (t(0.5) 64.8-91.2 d). Three hydrolytic products and one metabolite of 6-Cl-PMNI in aerobic soil were identified. The C=C olefinic bond reacted with H2O by Markovnikov Additive Reaction and the split of C-Cl were mainly proposed as the possible reaction pathway for 6-Cl-PMNI degradation in water and in soil, respectively.

AB  - A palaeolimnological study of the annually laminated sediment sequence of Lake Xiaolongwan, a small maar lake in northeastern China, revealed distinct diatom responses to Lateglacial and early Holocene climate change between c. 19 700 and c. 10 700 a BP. In addition to analyses of diatom assemblage composition and of the bio-volume accumulation rate of planktonic diatoms, geochemical (total nitrogen, total organic carbon) and physical (varve type and thickness) indicators were used to assess past environmental change. The diatom assemblages reveal a complex interplay between direct climate effects on the seasonal lake conditions (timing of ice cover break-up, water column mixing and thermal stratification), catchment-mediated effects on the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon and, possibly, biotic interactions between the different algal groups present in the phytoplankton of Lake Xiaolongwan (diatoms, Chrysophyceae and Dinophyceae). The most remarkable changes in the aquatic system were: (i) a sharp increase in Asterionella formosa and the collapse of Handmannia balatonis at c. 14 780 a BP, corresponding with the onset of the Bolling - Allerod interstadial; (ii) a sharp rise in Stephanodiscus minutulus at c. 12 840 a BP, marking the start of the Younger Dryas event and (iii) when the lake phytoplankton became dominated by Dinophyceae instead of diatoms at c. 11 170 a BP, after the Pre-Boreal oscillation. Two diatom assemblage zones characterize the Younger Dryas at Lake Xiaolongwan, suggesting a bipartite division of this stadial event as in several records from eastern Asia and Europe. The quasi-synchronicity of these events with the oscillations described in the North Atlantic realm demonstrates that during the Lateglacial, North Atlantic dynamics at centennial and millennial time scales had a strong control upon the climate in northeastern China.

AB  - Stability and maturity are important criteria to guarantee the quality of a compost that is applied to agriculture or used as amendment in degraded soils. Although different techniques exist to evaluate stability and maturity, the application of laboratory tests in municipalities in developing countries can be limited due to cost and application complexities. In the composting facilities of such places, some classical low cost on-site tests to monitor the composting process are usually implemented; however, such tests do not necessarily clearly identify conditions of stability and maturity. In this article, we have applied and compared results of stability and maturity tests that can be easily employed on site (i.e. temperature, pH, moisture, electrical conductivity [EC], odor and color), and of tests that require more complex laboratory techniques (volatile solids, C/N ratio, self-heating, respirometric index, germination index [Gip. The evaluation of the above was performed in the field scale using 2 piles of biowaste applied compost. The monitoring period was from day 70 to day 190 of the process. Results showed that the low-cost tests traditionally employed to monitor the composting process on-site, such as temperature, color and moisture, do not provide consistent determinations with the more complex laboratory tests used to assess stability (e.g. respiration index, self-heating, volatile solids). In the case of maturity tests (GI, pH, EC), both the on-site tests (pH, EC) and the laboratory test (GI) provided consistent results. Although, stability was indicated for most of the samples, the maturity tests indicated that products were consistently immature. Thus, a stable product is not necessarily mature. Conclusively, the decision on the quality of the compost in the installations located in developing countries requires the simultaneous use of a combination of tests that are performed both in the laboratory and on-site.

AB  - The potential for using stable isotope analysis in risk assessment of environmental contaminants is crucially dependent on the predictability of the trophic transfer of isotopes in food webs. The relationship between contaminant levels and trophic position of consumers is widely used to assess biomagnification properties of various pollutants by establishing trophic magnification factors (TMF). However, contaminant-induced variability of the isotopic composition in biota is poorly understood. Here, we investigated effects of toxic exposure on delta N-15 and delta C-13 values in a consumer, with a main hypothesis that these effects would be largely mediated via growth rate and metabolic turnover of the test animals. The cladoceran Daphnia magna was used in two experiments that were conducted to manipulate growth and body condition (assayed as C:N ratio) by food availability and temperature (Experiment 1) and by toxic exposure to the pesticide lindane (Experiment 2). We found a significant negative effect of growth rate and a positive effect of temperature on the consumer-diet discrimination factor for delta N-15 and delta C-13, with no effects on the C:N ratio (Experiment 1). In lindane-exposed daphnids, a significant growth inhibition was observed, with concomitant increase in metabolic costs and significantly elevated size-specific delta N-15 and delta C-13 values. Moreover, a significantly higher incorporation of carbon relative to nitrogen, yet a concomitant decrease in C:N ratio was observed in the exposed animals. Together, these results have methodological implications for determining trophic positions and TMF in polluted environments, where elevated delta N-15 values would translate into overestimated trophic positions and underestimated TMF. Furthermore, altered delta C-13 values may lead to erroneous food-chain assignment of the consumer in question.

AB  - There has been an increased interest in using sustainability indicators for evaluating the impacts of development and conservation projects. Past and recent experiences have shown that sustainability indicators can be powerful tools for measuring the outcomes of various interventions, when used appropriately and adequately. Currently, there is a range of methods for applying sustainability indicators for project impact evaluation at the environment-development interface. At the same time, a number of challenges persist which have implication for impact evaluation processes especially in developing countries. We highlight some key and recurrent challenges, using three cases from Kenya, Indonesia and Brazil.
   In this study, we have conducted a comparative analysis across multiple projects from the three countries, which aimed to conserve biodiversity and improve livelihoods. The assessments of these projects were designed to evaluate their positive, negative, short-term, long term, direct and indirect impacts. We have identified a set of commonly used sustainability indicators to evaluate the projects and have discussed opportunities and challenges associated with their application. Our analysis shows that impact evaluation processes present good opportunities for applying sustainability indicators. On the other hand, we find that project proponents (e.g. managers, evaluators, donors/fundets) face challenges with establishing full impacts of interventions and that these are rooted in monitoring and evaluation processes, lack of evidence-based impacts, difficulties of measuring certain outcomes and concerns over scale of a range of impacts.
   We outline key lessons learnt from the multiple cases and propose ways to overcome common problems. Results from our analysis demonstrate practical experiences of applying sustainability indicators in developing countries context where there are different prevailing socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. The knowledge derived from this study may therefore be useful to a wider range of audience who are concerned with sustainable integration of development and environmental conservation.

AB  - Forest soils store vast amounts of terrestrial carbon, but we are still limited in mechanistic understanding on how soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization or turnover is controlled by biotic and abiotic factors in forest ecosystems. We used phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) as biomarker to study soil microbial community structure and measured activities of five extracellular enzymes involved in the degradation of cellulose (i.e., -1,4-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase), chitin (i.e., -1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and lignin (i.e., phenol oxidase and peroxidase) as indicators of soil microbial functioning in carbon transformation or turnover across varying biotic and abiotic conditions in a typical temperate forest ecosystem in central China. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine the interrelationship between individual PFLAs and biotic and abiotic site factors as well as the linkage between soil microbial structure and function. Path analysis was further conducted to examine the controls of site factors on soil microbial community structure and the regulatory pathway of changes in SOC relating to microbial community structure and function. We found that soil microbial community structure is strongly influenced by water, temperature, SOC, fine root mass, clay content, and C/N ratio in soils and that the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and actinomycetes explained most of the variations in the specific activities of soil enzymes involved in SOC transformation or turnover. The abundance of soil bacterial communities is strongly linked with the extracellular enzymes involved in carbon transformation, whereas the abundance of saprophytic fungi is associated with activities of extracellular enzymes driving carbon oxidation. Findings in this study demonstrate the complex interactions and linkage among plant traits, microenvironment, and soil physiochemical properties in affecting SOC via microbial regulations.

AB  - Changes in the Caribbean coral fauna associated with Plio-Pleistocene extinctions are unique in that origination preceded extinction. This pattern is particularly evident in free-living solitary and flabello-meandroid (FSFM) corals. Here we use the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen to assess the paleoautecology of pre-turnover FSFM corals from the Cibao Basin, northern Dominican Republic. We assess photosymbiosis and resource utilization within FSFM corals and how changing Neogene paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic conditions may have contributed to originations and extinctions within this unique ecological group. Measurements of delta C-13 and delta O-18 were compared between two known zooxanthellate coral species, two known azooxanthellate species, and six FSFM species of the Cibao Basin. Skeletal delta C-13 provided the best indicator of resource utilization by FSFM corals. For both modern reef corals and Mio-Pliocene reef corals from the Cibao Basin, values of delta C-13 fall between 0 parts per thousand and -2 parts per thousand whereas the PC values of azooxanthellate corals generally fall between -3 parts per thousand and -9 parts per thousand. Both modern and fossil FSFM corals lie intermediate to these end members. FSFM values of delta C-13 fall between 1 parts per thousand and 4 parts per thousand and suggest reduced photosymbiosis in comparison to typical reef corals. Reduced photosymbiosis of FSFM corals in comparison to reef corals is also reflected in a stronger covariation between delta C-13 and delta O-18. Though FSFM corals are clearly utilizing translocated carbon from associated algal symbionts, the more depleated values of delta C-13 and covariation with delta O-18 suggest a greater dependence on heterotrophic feeding. This ecological lifestyle likely has made FSFM corals sensitive to changes in primary productivity that characterize the Caribbean Neogene.

AB  - Enterophages are a novel group of phages that specifically infect Enterococcus faecalis and have been recently isolated from environmental water samples. Although enterophages have not been conclusively linked to human fecal pollution, we are currently characterizing enterophages to propose them as viral indicators and possible surrogates of enteric viruses in recreational waters. Little is known about the morphological or genetic diversity which will have an impact on their potential as markers of human fecal contamination. In the present study we are determining if enterophages can be grouped by their ability to replicate at different temperatures, and if different groups are present in the feces of different animals. As one of the main objectives is to determine if these phages can be used as indicators of the presence of enteric viruses, the survival rate under different conditions was also determined as was their prevalence in sewage and a large watershed. Coliphages were used as a means of comparison in the prevalence and survival studies. Results indicated that the isolates are mainly DNA viruses. Their morphology as well as their ability to form viral plaques at different temperatures indicates that several groups of enterophages are present in the environment. Coliphage and enterophage concentrations throughout the watershed were lower than those of thermotolerant coliforms and enterococci. Enterophage concentrations were lower than coliphages at all sampling points. Enterophages showed diverse inactivation rates and T-90 values across different incubation temperatures in both fresh and marine waters and sand. Further molecular characterization of enterophages may allow us to develop probes for the real-time detection of these alternative indicators of human fecal pollution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The spread-plate and double agar layer (DAL) methods are common for the enumeration of bacteria and viral indicators (bacteriophages). However, they may become cumbersome in large matrix experiments or when the titer of the organism varies by several orders of magnitude. A bacterial spot-titer assay has been available for decades but has not been adapted to bacteriophages and has rarely been applied to the analysis of environmental samples. In this study, a spot-titer culture-based method was investigated for bacteria and bacteriophages. The method involves spot-plating replicate 10-mu l volumes of several sample dilutions on a single plate, incubating, and counting colonies or plaques. Parallel assays of laboratory cultures and environmentally isolated organisms show that the spot-titer method is equally straightforward and statistically comparable to the spread-plate and DAL methods (R2 = 0.989 for laboratory strains and R2 = 0.972 for environmental samples), while more cost- and labor-efficient.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   The spread-plate and double agar layer (DAL) methods currently used for enumeration of bacteria and viral indicators, may become labor- and resource-intensive (culture media, plates, technician time and incubator space) in large matrix experiments, which are often needed in the laboratory to evaluate environmental conditions. The spot-titer method has several advantages over the spread-plate and DAL methods: (1) it requires less time to dispense spots than to spread the microbe; (2) it uses fewer materials (15-20% of the laboratory supplies as the traditional methods); (3) it requires less effort; and (4) since the sample is distributed in distinct spots, colony/plaque counting is faster and less labor intensive. The spot-titer method was found to economize resources without sacrificing accuracy or precision, and is a practical method for routine use in large matrix experiments (e.g., survival or disinfection studies) and enumeration of high-titer environmental samples.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability among young adults. Numerous safety improvements in the workplace, the addition of airbags to vehicles, and the enforcement of speed limits have all helped to reduce the incidence and severity of head trauma. While improvements in emergency response times and acute care have increased TBI survivability, this has heightened the necessity for developing reliable methods to identify patients at risk of developing secondary pathologies. At present, the primary clinical indicators for the presence of brain injury are the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil reactivity, and head computed tomography (CT). While these indices have proven useful for stratifying the magnitude and extent of brain damage, they have limited utility for predicting adverse secondary events or detecting subtle damage. Biomarkers, reflecting a biological response to injury or disease, have proven useful for the diagnosis of many pathological conditions including cancer, heart failure, infection, and genetic disorders. For TBI, several proteins synthesized in astroglial cells or neurons have been proposed as potential biomarkers. These proteins include the BB isozyme of creatine kinase (CK-BB, predominant in brain), glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and S100B.
   The presence of these biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, and their correlation with Outcome, Suggest that they may have utility as surrogate markers in clinical trials. In addition, many of these markers have been found to be sensitive indicators of injury, and therefore may have the potential to diagnose persons with mild TBI. In addition to biomarkers, that correlate with long-term outcome, a few studies have identified prognostic biornarkers for secondary injury that may be useful in individualizing patient management.

AB  - 1. Based on carotenoids' antioxidant and pro-vitamin functions, carotenoid pigmentation, particularly in birds, has been hypothesized to honestly advertize condition and health. As antioxidants, carotenoids protect the body from oxidative damage caused by internal or external stressors (e.g. growth, infection and anthropogenic pollution). However, the relative importance of carotenoids in the avian antioxidant defence has been questioned, and the positive relationship between colouration and health may be a 'red herring'.
   2. In the present study, we investigate carotenoid-based plumage colouration and circulating carotenoids in relation to plasma non-enzymatic total antioxidant activity (TAA) in adult and nestling great tits (Parus major). The study was conducted in urban vs. rural populations, with documented differences in oxidative stress level and plumage pigmentation.
   3. First, we found that there was no relationship between TAA and plumage pigmentation (carotenoid chroma) or plasma carotenoids. Second, urban environment significantly influenced TAA; old (2+ years) urban birds had higher activity than old rural birds, and also compared to younger (1 year) urban adults. This is likely to be due to the increased demand for plasma antioxidants as a consequence of urban environmental stress. Third, nestlings' TAA showed no difference between urban and rural environments. However, it was highly influenced by brood, but not related to parental levels, therefore most likely due to differences in the nestling environment.
   4. We suggest that carotenoids are not significant contributors to extra-cellular antioxidant defence in great tits, and that carotenoid pigmentation may be an overrated health indicator in this respect. Honest carotenoid signalling, when present, is thus likely to be mediated by some other constraint, such as nutrition or uptake, or other health-modulating mechanisms.

AB  - The spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is the most destructive insect defoliator of forests in North America. Climatic influences on this species' life history are considered a major factor in restricting the extent and intensity of outbreaks. We examine the life history traits of the spruce budworm and related Choristoneura populations with respect to forecasting the conifer-feeding responses of these insects in changing environments. Analysis of the evolutionary relationships between Choristoneura entities, including their hybridization, genetic distances, and their degree of sympatry leads us to distinguish 15 possible Choristoneura 'biotypes'.
   Population trend has been associated with recruitment to the feeding stage, and two indicators of recruitment, egg weights and phenological development, are both 'biotype' and climate dependent. Among Abietoid feeding 'biotypes' and among spruce budworm populations, those from locations with extreme winters tend to have heavier eggs than those from the more benign environments. In spruce budworm, this genetically based adaptation allows populations to increase their potential recruitment substantially where winters are mild.
   All biotypes feed on the newly developed shoots of their host trees in spring, and are thus vulnerable to the uncertain timing of budbreak. Genetic control of spring emergence is weak so larvae from a single family typically exit from hibernacula over a prolonged period. This guarantees some synchronization with budburst. However, hybrid populations have high heritabilities. This allows rapid adaptation to new conditions (e.g. mixed host-species stands). Geographic variation in phenological development after establishing feeding sites is largely genetically controlled.
   The importance of variation in these traits is examined with respect to competing population dynamics theories to evaluate their utility in forecasting future trends in defoliation. We finish with a plea for jointly using alternative approaches in forecasting spatiotemporal patterns of defoliation.

AB  - There has been much research and collection of data about chemistry of soils in Estonia but we face problems when correlating the national classification with an international soil taxonomy especially with regard to the lower taxa. One aim of our study was to clarify the need of soil chemical analysis to enhance soil classification in Estonia using WRB and Soil Taxonomy classifications to examples. Estonian soil classification is based on concepts of soil genesis and their morphological outcomes. Because of our limited range of environmental conditions few chemical analyses are needed to classify soils in the field at the level of soil type. In fact. all the necessary chemical and physical analyses needed to classify soils can readily be done in the field. An important criterion for recognizing soils in Estonia is the occurrence of free carbonates in soil, detected with 10% HCl and the depth of "fizz". Soil acidity measured by universal indicator gives additional information but is not so important for soil classification. Finger testing for determining soil texture has been sufficient to recognize significant differences for management and use. Soil genetic horizons are separated by color, texture and intensity of processes measured by horizon thickness. In many cases no additional analyses are necessary for characterizing soil, however specific laboratory analyses, such as base saturation, cation exchange capacity, levels of Al, Fe and Si measured with different methods etc., are needed to correlate our national soil types with international classification. General relationships (rules of thumb) between our field laboratory data related to genetic concepts and the defined diagnostic properties of WRB and ST would facilitate correlation decisions and this study may be a start. Procedures to determine degrees of partial membership among data sets would be a useful alternative to the current "all-or-nothing" approach requiring detailed chemical data for correct placement of soils in international systems.

AB  - Paleolimnological techniques were used to identify environmental changes in and around Lake Dudinghausen (northern Germany) over the past 4800 yr. Diatom-inferred total phosphorus (DI-TP) changes identify four phases of high nutrient levels (2600-2200 BC, 1050-700 BC, 500 BC-AD 100 and AD 1850-1970). During these high DI-TP phases, fossil pollen, sediment geochemistry and archaeological records indicate human activities in the lake catchment. Although the same palco-indicators suggest increased human settlement and agriculture activity during the late Slavonic Age, the Medieval Time and the Modem Time (AD 1000-1850), DI-TP levels were low during this period. In the sediments, iron and total phosphorus were high from similar to AD 100 to 1850, likely due to increased inflow of iron-rich groundwater into the lake. Increased iron input would have lead to a simultaneous binding and precipitation of phosphate in the upper sediment and overlying water column. As a result, anthropogenic impact on Lake Dudinghausen was masked by these phosphorus-controlling processes from AD 1000 to 1850 and was not evident by means of DI-TP. In accordance with fossil pollen, sediment geochemistry and limited archaeological records, DI-TP levels were low from AD 100-1000. Groundwater levels likely rose during this period as the climate gradually changed toward colder and/or moister conditions. Such climate change likely led to reduced settlement activities and forest regeneration in the catchment area. Our results are concordant with similar studies from central Europe which indicate rapid decreasing settlement activities from AD 100 to 1000. (c) 2006 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

AB  - Green herbage ratio (GR), the equivalent of the biomass/(biomass + necromass), is an important biophysical parameter as it is a fundamental indicator of photosynthetic activity of vegetation components, pedoclimatic conditions and the phenological state of vegetation. GR is strongly correlated with photosynthesis and respiration rates, the major processes that drive ecosystem simulation models. To compare grasslands GR predictability from remote sensing data and in order to test the possibility of producing spatially distributed maps, the GR estimation technique has been tested with data produced from sensors on aerial and satellite platforms. For this purpose, ASPIS (Advanced SPectroscopic Imaging System) aircraft sensor and IRS satellite LISS-III sensor imagery of the Viote of Monte Bondone (Italian Alps) grassland area has been compared. Ten differently managed grasslands reflectance was measured in the field and calculated from aircraft and satellite platforms. From these data 10 different vegetation indices were calculated to estimate GR predictability from aircraft and satellite platforms.
   At the aircraft platform, a significant linear regression could be found between GR and the calculated indices; nine of the 10 investigated indices showed an R-2 > 0.70, all values being included within a small range of R-2. With aircraft data, Green-NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index calculated using NIR and green bands) was one of the most correlated indices, the R-2 value (0.74) being comparable to those found at ground level (R-2 = 0.80). For satellite-derived data, only Green-NDVI showed a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.63, p < 0.05). Green-NDVI aircraft and satellite-derived values correlated well with Green-NDVI ground values. According to these results, Green-NDVI was shown to be the only index that produced significant correlations with all the analyzed datasets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied epiphytic macrolichen communities in northern and central California to 1) describe how gradients in community composition relate to climate, topography, and stand structure and 2) define subregions of relatively homogeneous lichen communities and environmental conditions. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to characterize landscape-level trends in lichen community composition from 211 plots. We found two gradients in lichen community composition that corresponded with macroclimatic gradients: one correlated with temperature variables and elevation, the second with moisture variables. Moist, warm plots supported more cyanolichen species, while warm but dry plots supported a diverse nitrophilous flora. Ammonia pollution, which was not accounted for in the analysis, may also explain spatial patterns in nitrophilous species and deserves further study. Cluster analysis and indicator species analysis were used to divide lichen communities into more homogeneous groups and identify group indicator species. Three groups of plots differing in geography, macroclimate, and community composition were defined: the Greater Central Valley group; the Sierra, Southern Cascades, and Modoc group; and the NW Coast group. Communities in the Greater Central Valley group were typically diverse and dominated by nitrophilous species, averaging 14 species and 40% nitrophiles. Cyanolichens common to this group were mainly diminuitive species from the genera Leptogium and Collema. Indicator species strongly associated with the Greater Central Valley included Melanelia glabra, Candelaria concolor, and Parmelina quercina. Communities from the Sierra, Southern Cascades, and Modoc group had the lowest species richness and total lichen abundance. Cyanolichens were absent, while nitrophiles such as Candelaria concolor and Xanthoria fulva were frequent. Indicator species included Letharia vulpina, L. columbiana, and Nodobryoria abbreviata. The NW Coast group had the highest species richness, cyanolichen diversity, and cyanolichen abundance while nitrophiles were rare. Indicator species included Platismatia glauca, Esslingeriana idahoensis, and Cetraria orbata.

AB  - Almost all terrestrial and aquatic assays that are accepted as standardized, or that have been proposed, involve the exposure of confined organisms to toxicants. If avoidance (sensu evasion, displacement) of contaminants occurs in real situations, then bioassays involving forced exposure severely underestimate pernicious effects of contamination. Two main objectives were achieved in this study: To verify the occurrence of avoidance of copper by cladocerans; to determine the association between avoidance and other toxicity endpoints (lethality and feeding depression), and therefore, to ascertain if fully acclimated individuals from a reference field population exhibited a genetically determined avoidance markedly different from those belonging to a historically metal-stressed population. Twelve cloned lineages of the cladoceran Daphnia longispina, collected from two field populations, were selected according to their lethal sensitivity to copper and acclimated to controlled conditions for more than 30 generations. A 1.1-m test chamber with five compartments was built, allowing the establishment of a dissolved toxicant gradient and the free movement of individuals. In the absence of any toxicant, juveniles from each cloned lineage distributed themselves randomly along the test chamber and furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the two replicates, attesting the repeatability of this novel assay. All lineages showed significant avoidance to copper when exposed to a gradient from 3 to 87 mug/L. The most sensitive lineages to lethal levels of copper began avoiding this metal earlier than resistant ones. An intense association was observed between other endpoints and avoidance; furthermore, avoidance was determined to be much more sensitive than lethality. Therefore, avoidance assays should be recommended as a complementary tool in ecological risk assessments and effluent biomonitoring because such assays can provide cost-effective and ecologically relevant information.

AB  - Babesiosis, caused by the virulent haemoprotozoan parasite Babesia canis rossi, is an important disease of dogs in South Africa. The nitric oxide metabolites, nitrate and nitrite (collectively termed reactive nitrogen intermediates or RNIs) were measured in admission sera from dogs in a babesiosis-endemic area. Five groups were prospectively studied: mild uncomplicated (n = 9), severe uncomplicated (severe anaemia) (n = 10) and complicated babesiosis (n 11); and two groups of healthy aparasitaemic dogs: endemic controls from the study area (n 10) and experimental dogs kept in tick-free conditions (n = 10). Four measures of RNI production were studied: (i) serum RNI; (ii) serum RNI/creatinine ratio; (iii) fractional clearance of RNI (FCRNI); (iv) fractional excretion of RNI (FCRNI).
   Marked elevations of serum RNI occurred in only two dogs, both in the severe uncomplicated group. The highest concentration (log value 5.29 mumol/l) was in a dog that died, but concentrations in the other four dogs that died were unremarkable (0, 0.34, 1.66 and 2.64 mumol/l). Age, appetite and free serum haemoglobin were significant covariates for measures of RNI production. There were no significant differences among the babesiosis groups for serum RNI. Adjustment for creatinine had minor effects on the results. All babesiosis groups had significantly higher serum RNI and RNI/creatinine than the tick-free control group, but did not differ from the endemic controls except for the severe uncomplicated group, which had higher RNI/creatinine. The complicated group had significantly lower FCRNI and FERNI than all other groups, except for the tick-free control group, which had similar FERNI. The results indicate that, in an endemic area, measures of RNI production are unlikely to be useful indicators of severity or outcome in canine babesiosis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper describes the petrological and mineralogical features of the quartz-muscovite metasandstones (QMM), a lithology found in the form of tectonic slices in an augen-gneissic environment N and W of Jasenie, Nizke Tatry Mts., Western Carpathians. These rocks have an exemplary psammitic texture, and are composed of detritic phases, represented by oval quartz grains, large muscovite flakes and sparse individual grains of albite and metamorphic phases consisting mainly of quartz and microcrystalline aggregate of muscovite-phengitic mica. Small amounts of tiny, metamorphic, newly formed albite and needle-like tourmaline are accompanied by scattered scales of chlorite and crystals of magnetite. Neither the QMM nor the associated siderite-ankerite metasandstones and phyllites (SAMP) contain biotite indicating that their metamorphic degree did not reach the biotite subzone. The total content of alkalies in the metamorphic muscovite-phengites is fairly high (>0.86 per formula unit), thus, they should be illite-free and their estimated degree of metamorphism should correspond to the epizone. This estimate is also supported by the incomplete compositional and grain size equalization between clastogenic and metamorphic white potash micas at their contacts. In contrast, the metamorphic white micas are considerably enriched in the phengite molecule. The X-ray and selected area electron diffraction (SAD) analyses made to visualize and to measure the crystallinity of individual carbonaceous matter (CM) particles revealed that most samples are composed of a mixture of anthracitic and graphitic carbon. While the anthracite is an indicator of very low metamorphism, the graphite first forms under greenschist facies conditions. A search for non-graphitizing carbons, such as shungite, skeleton crystals, or fullerenes, which form under medium or high-grade metamorphism, has been unsuccessful. Thus, all the ill-ordered carbons in the samples developed under low-grade metamorphism. This conclusion supports the authors' earlier view that the rocks under study are metasediments and not diaphthorites.

AB  - Slow wave potentials (SWPs) are transient depolarizations which propagate substantial distances from their point of origin. They were induced in the epidermal cells of pea epicotyls by injurious methods such as root excision and heat treatment, as well as by externally applied, defined steps in xylem pressure (P-x) in the absence of wounding. The common principle of induction was a rapid increase in P-x. Such a stimulus appeared under natural conditions after (i) bending of the epicotyl, (ii) wounding of the epidermis, (iii) rewatering of dehydrated roots, and (iv) embolism. The induced depolarization was not associated with a change in cell input resistance. This result and the ineffectiveness of ion channel blockers point to H+-pumps rather than ion channels as the ionic basis of the SWP. Stimuli such as excision, heat treatment and pressure steps, which generate SWPs, caused a transient increase in the fluorescence intensity of epicotyls loaded with the pH-indicator DM-NERF, a 2', 7'-dimethyl derivative of rhodol, but not of those loaded with the pH indicator 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Matching kinetics of depolarization and pH response identify a transient inactivation of proton pumps in the plasma membrane as the causal mechanism of the SWP. Feeding pump inhibitors to the cut surface of excised epicotyls failed to chemically simulate a SWP; cyanide, azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol caused sustained, local depolarizations which did not propagate. Of all tested substances, only sodium cholate caused a transient and propagating depolarization whose arrival in the growing region of the epicotyl coincided with a transient growth rate reduction.

AB  - The Belgian carbonate Devonian forms a 1.5 km thick series and shows a succession of silico-carbonate ramp systems and carbonate platforms with slight slope and no real barrier. The succession of these diffferent sedimentological units is primary controlled by relative seawater level variations. The sedimentation is rhythmic and usually controlled biologically at a small scale [5th and 6th order sensu Vail et al., 1991] and by seawater level at a middle scale (4th and 3th orders, ib.).
   The Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic data, in addition to reflecting directly lagoonal and marine sedimentation, reveals the mixing of marine and meteoric aquifers during the Lower Givetian and highlights the pre-evaporitic conditions of the Upper Givetian. This study also permits to constrain the source regions (Caledonian massifs) of the continental inputs with time and provides some constraints on the palaeoclimatic evolution during Givetian times, from a humid tropical climate at the Lower Givetian to a dry tropical climate at the Upper Givetian. partial derivative(18)O values reflect the role of diffusion processes related to the water expelled from clays during burying process. The reverse stratigraphic gradient marked by lighter partial derivative(18)O values towards the Upper Devonian is not in favour of a temperature reequilibration and leads to consider the series as different clay-carbonate sandwiches forming an open system at a small scale and closed at a wider scale for oxygen. Together with the initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, partial derivative(13)C values also show a rhythmicity at the scale of 6th and 5th orders reflecting the role of early diagenetic processes and the existence of closed systems for Sr and C. Strontium isotope geochemistry confirms also the extreme briefness of the 6th order cycles (less than 1,000 yrs to a few thousands years).

AB  - The paper presents a study regarding the identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fresh waters and surface sediments on the western shore of Admiralty Bay over four sampling seasons from 2017 to 2018. The results were compared to literature data from 2016 to provide a more comprehensive image of the environmental fate of PAHs over the years. The highest value of Sigma PAHs was 82.9 ng/L and 445 ng/g dw in water and sediment samples, respectively. The analysis of PAH indicator ratio values showed that pyrogenic or mixed sources contribute to the PAH pollution in Antarctic sediments and water more than does petroleum. The main source is the combustion of biomass (e.g. as a result of fires) and coal, and PAHs are mostly associated with the activity of stations or are transported to a lesser extent by long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) from South America. The values of the Sigma LMW/Sigma HMW ratio in sediments indicate that petrogenic sources contribute to PAH contamination, but among the six PAH ratios tested, petrogenic sources were identified as dominant in approximately 17-19% of cases. Lack of coherence in the obtained results confirms the mixed origin of PAHs in the studied samples. Although the differentiation of PAHs sources is still ambiguous, caution is recommended in light of the Antarctic system's evident and rapid response to global and local PAH emissions, and the dependency of accumulation and release cycle processes on weather conditions. A reduction in petrol usage in favour of renewable energy sources, and restriction of tourism are strongly recommended for better preservation of the pristine Antarctic environment.

AB  - Blowing snow processes are crucial in shaping the strongly heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of snow and in regulating subsequent snowpack evolution in mountainous terrain. Although empirical formulae and constant threshold wind speeds have been widely used to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow in regions with sparse observations, the scarcity of in situ observations in mountainous regions contrasts with the demands of models for reliable observations at high spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, these methods struggle to accurately capture the high local variability of blowing snow. This study investigated the potential capability of the decision tree model (DTM) to detect blowing snow in the European Alps. The DTMs were constructed based on routine meteorological observations (mean wind speed, maximum wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity) and snow measurements (including in situ snow depth observations and satellite-derived products). Twenty repetitions of a random sub-sampling validation test with an optimal size ratio (0.8) between the training and validation subsets were applied to train and assess the DTMs. Results show that the maximum wind speed contributes most to the classification accuracy, and the inclusion of more predictor variables improves the overall accuracy. However, the spatiotemporal transferability of the DTM might be limited if the divergent distribution of wind speed exists between stations. Although both the site-specific DTMs and site-independent DTM show great ability in detecting blowing snow occurrence and are superior to commonly used empirical parameterizations, specific assessment indicators varied between stations and surface conditions. Events for which blowing snow and snowfall occurred simultaneously were detected the most reliably. Although models failed to fully reproduce the high frequency of local blowing snow events, they have been demonstrated to be a promising approach requiring limited meteorological variables and have the potential to scale to multiple stations across different regions.

AB  - Thermal desorption (TD) is an effective physical remediation technology for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated soil. Reaction temperature is the key of TD, and the increase of the vacuum degree and addition of catalysts could improve the remediation efficiency. Therefore, testing of TD experiments (test equipment and method: Patent No. 201220468562.5) under different heating temperature and vacuum-enhanced and alkali-assisted conditions at low temperature was conducted to remediate soil contaminated by PAHs from a coking plant. The aim of the test was to improve PAHs removal efficiency and investigate its influence on physicochemical properties of contaminated soil. The results indicated that the removal efficiencies of PAHs increased with the increase of heating temperature, which reached 85.4%, 87.1%, 83.0%, and 76.2% removals of n-ary sumation PAHs, PAHs containing 2-3 benzene rings (LPAHs), PAHs containing 4 benzene rings (MPAHs), and PAHs containing 5-6 benzene rings (HPAHs) at 450 degrees C, respectively. But the residual concentrations of Phe, BbF, and DBA were still higher than the corresponding screening levels for soil environmental risk assessment of residential land in Beijing. The vacuum-enhanced and alkali-assisted TD improved the removal of PAHs compared with the TD at 200 degrees C, especially the vacuum-enhanced TD, which could remove almost all the available PAHs and partly unavailable PAHs owing to the lowered of melting point and increased steam flow rate by vacuumizing. Relative high-temperature TD (450 degrees C) and vacuum-enhanced TD had a greater effect on the dissolved organic carbon, and specific surface area (SSA) of bulk soil, and volatilization of pollutant and agglomeration of particles affected the SSA during TD simultaneously, which led to the difference of removal efficiencies of PAHs probably.

AB  - The presence of pyrite has been reported previously in the Longmaxi and Niutitang Formations in southern China, and can serve as an important indicator of the sedimentary environment. In order to systematically investigate the differences between the paleoenvironments of samples from the two formations, complementary experiments were conducted on six samples from the same well (three from each of formations). The methods included nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) for in situ sulfur isotope analysis, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for comparison with the data from NanoSIMS, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) to observe the pyrite forms, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the analysis of trace elements, LECO carbon/sulfur analyzer for determining the total organic carbon (TOC) content, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the mineral compositions. The results suggest that NanoSIMS can analyze submicron pyrite grains visually, which could help to differentiate euhedra and framboids during the analyses. The sulfur isotope ratios inside the framboidal pyrite analyzed by NanoSIMS suggest that the formation of the framboidal pyrite occurs from the center to the surface, as against the assumed process wherein iron non-sulfide spheroids are pseudomorphically replaced by pyrite. The size distribution of the framboidal pyrite and the redoxsensitive trace elements of the bulk rock jointly indicate that the bottom water redox conditions of the Niutitang Formation were reduced more compared those of the Longmaxi Formation. The sulfur isotopic characteristics of the framboidal pyrite imply that the two formations were deposited in an open sedimentary system (a depositional system where sulfate radical ions could diffuse into the system from the external environments); in this regard, the Niutitang environment was found to be progressively closing while the Longmaxi environment was found to be gradually opening.

AB  - The euhalophyte species Salicornia europaea is cultivated for oilseed and as a fodder crop in various parts of the world. In saline coastal environments it possesses great potential for the subsistence of the most disadvantaged farmers. We investigated the effect of salinity levels in irrigation water on the germination capacity, shoot biomass and seed productivity as well as diverse quality traits (nitrogen content in shoots and seeds and fatty acids, in seeds) and physiological traits (stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and ion content) of two accessions collected in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The three salinity levels tested were irrigation with fresh water (0.3 dS m-1), brackish water (25 dS m-1) and sea water (40 dS m-1). In addition, a hypersaline condition (80 dS m-1) was also tested for germination. The best germination rates were achieved with seeds exposed to fresh and brackish water, while imbibition with sea water decreased germination by half and hypersaline water inhibited it almost totally. However, the best irrigation regime in terms of biomass and seed yield involved brackish water. Moreover, rising salinity in the irrigation increased the stable isotope composition of carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N), together with the Na+ and K+ of shoots and seeds, and the lipid levels of seeds, while the total nitrogen content and the profile of major fatty acids of seeds did not change. Differences between the two ecotypes existed for growth and seed yield with the best ecotype exhibiting lower delta 13C and higher K+ in both shoots and seeds, lower Na+ and higher delta 15N in shoots, and lower N in seeds, together with differences in major fatty acids. Physiological mechanisms behind the response to irrigation salinity and the ecotypic differences are discussed in terms of photosynthetic carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

AB  - The prognostic predictors of an unfavorable course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its complications with manifestations of pneumonia and the need for oxygen support and connection to the invasive mechanical ventilation were studied. Clinical and laboratory associations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, the possible predictors of connection to the invasive mechanical ventilator in 37 patients were identified. Patients were hospitalized on day 6.65 +/- 3.32 of the disease, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) depended on the severity of the disease and response to therapy. Positive significant correlations between the level of growth stimulating factor (ST2) and D-Dimer, creatine phosphokinase MB fraction (CPK-MB) and D-dimmer, CPK-MB and ST2 were revealed, as well as of ferritin and D-Dimer with ST2. There were no significant associations with troponin. C-reactive protein (CRP) probably correlated with CPK-MB and ferritin. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) indicator had significant correlations with D-dimmer, ST2 and CPK-MB. Cox regression analysis showed that the survival curve has a stepwised nature and the highest risk of deterioration, which requires mechanical ventilation, was noted on the 6th day of illness (95.0% CI = 0.9-1.0, with an average SpO(2) level =87.3%). ROC analysis showed the presence of a possible relationship between D-Dimer, ST2 protein, CPK-MB and the risk of developing a critical condition requiring mechanical ventilation in patients. The study showed that COVID-19 disease has a phase nature, when after the first phase of the disease, the pulmonary phase and hypercytokinemia progress in some patients with the development of hypoxia, a decrease in SpO(2). Therefore, the identification of markers of disease progression is essential for predicting the course and possible prevention of the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome with the use of invasive mechanical ventilation.

AB  - The quantification of electrolytes in biological fluids plays an important role for evaluating the human health condition. This work proposes a disposable and simple microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) for the quantitative colorimetric detection of salivary Na+, K+ and Ca2+, relying on ion-selective optodes (ISOs). Nanoscale ISOs composed of pluronic F-127 surfactant-based micelles were used as a colorimetric indicator system, reducing the assay time compared to the previously reported bulk membrane approach. Devices consist of three functionalized paper layers assembled by lamination, with the optical signal read out from the bottom layer. Saliva was chosen as the biological specimen because it is painlessly collected and easy-to-handle, which makes it suitable for POC assays. Simultaneous Na+, K+ and Ca2+ detection by a single mu PAD was successfully confirmed by using aqueous metal ion samples with various concentrations of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ within the biologically relevant range. The simultaneous detection of the three cationic species enabled the correction of the three ion quantities by eliminating the interference from other ions using the calculated selectivity coefficients. For proof-of-concept, Na+ quantification in a human saliva sample was conducted by the developed mu PADs. The calibration curve for this assay was prepared by applying artificial saliva to the mu PADs. The concentrations of Na+ in spiked human saliva were also measured by the mu PADs. The obtained recovery rates were 78-132 %, which indicates the quantification of the added Na(+ )in the real sample matrix. Finally, this mu PAD was successfully integrated into a smartphone-based assay, which enables salivary electrolyte quantification in resource poor settings. The developed mu PADs satisfy the criteria of low-cost (< $0.3/device), rapidity (< 5 min) and simple analytical procedure compared to the conventional ion-selective electrode (ISE) method.

AB  - Information about the past evolutionary changes in the soil cover is essential as a retrospective basis for long-term forecasts of soil development under the changing climatic conditions, and also for understanding the present-day problems of desertification and land degradation in the south of the East European Plain. The principal task of the present study was to estimate quantitatively the shift of the boundary between the steppe and desert-steppe zones in this region during the late Holocene under the impact of global climate variations. The properties of about 100 paleosols of archaeological sites widely represented in the region were used for quantitative reconstruction of paleoprecipitation, paleotemperature, and climate aridity. To obtain regional calibrations, the dependences of the magnetic properties of modern soils on climatic parameters in the south of the East European Plain were analyzed in detail. Samples of 35 soil profiles along the 1500-km-long Voronezh-Volgograd-Astrakhan-Elista-Voronezh transect were used. This transect crosses several natural climatic zones with gradients in the annual precipitation of about 500 mm/yr and in the annual temperatures of about 3 degrees C, which allowed us to obtain reliable relationships between the climatic parameters and the properties of recent soils. Limitations for paleoclimate reconstructions based on the magnetic properties of soils in the range of mean annual precipitation <600 mm/year were identified. Cartographic reconstruction of changes in the De Martonne aridity index (IDM) using GIS modeling methods and paleopedological data indicates that the Volga-Don interfluve has undergone repeated changes in the climatic situation over the past 5000 years resulting in the shifts of the boundaries between soil-geographical zones to distances of up to 200-300 km.

AB  - The decay of organic matter of anthropogenic origin in a highly contaminated shallow groundwater system occurs permanently regardless of the availability of oxygen. Oxidation of organic matter smoothly changes from aerobic to anaerobic and vice versa. Hydrogeochemical transformations occurring in the interior of the contaminant plume are conditioned by the position in the 3D zone of the so-called "redox reactor" and its edge. The primary reaction initiating the decay of organic matter (TOC max 1620 mg/L, phenol max 613 mg/L) is its aerobic oxidation. In the case of the consumption of free oxygen, the decay undergoes anaerobic oxidation, where the source of electrons are oxides and hydroxides (MnO2, Fe(OH)(3)). As a result of these reactions, mobile ions Mn2+ and Fe2+ pass into the aqueous environment creating a concentration anomaly (max 15 mg/L for Mn2+, 673 mg/L for Fe2+). The presence of Fe2+ in groundwater is crucial. A strong correlation between the organic matter decay processes and concentration of the Fe2+ showed that "iron index" may be a preliminary marker for the hydrogeochemical recognition of aquifer and allows to diagnose zones with an intense organic matter decay, especially by anaerobic oxidation through redox reactions. At the edge of the "redox reactor" redox sensitive metals (Fe2+, Mn2+ and also Cu2+, Cr3+, Hg2+) undergo aerobic oxidation due to the access of oxygen as a result of mixing of contaminated groundwater and oxygenated pure Quaternary water. These transformations produce oxides and hydroxides (MnO2, Fe(OH)(3))-new reaction products, however, are used for anaerobic oxidation of organic matter. Organic matter decay is an cyclic system of redox processes up to the full decay of pollutants and generation of the anomalously high concentrations of redox sensitive metals in the ground.

AB  - Body mass declines during wing moult in numerous, but not all, populations of Anatidae. We assessed two leading hypotheses for body mass dynamics during wing moult: (1) body mass dynamics are adapted to attain a target body mass at the end of wing moult (restraint hypothesis) vs. (2) body mass dynamics reflect environmental constraint on the nutrient-energy balance during wing moult (constraint hypothesis). We used regressions of mass of breeding female Black Brant Branta bernicla nigricans on ninth primary length (a measure of moult stage) for each of 16 years to assess mass dynamics during wing moult and used regression equations to predict mass at the beginning and end of wing moult each year. We also included gosling mass at 30 days (an indicator of forage availability) in models of adult mass to assess how mass dynamics varied as a function of foraging conditions. Predicted body mass (+/- 95% CI) at the start of wing moult (ninth primary = 0 mm) varied significantly among years from 1032 +/- 52 to 1169 +/- 27 g. Similarly, predicted mass in late wing moult (ninth primary = 142 mm) ranged from 1048 +/- 25 to 1222 +/- 28 g. The rate of mass gain was significantly related to gosling mass at 30 days: interaction between adult ninth primary length and gosling mass = 0.0031 +/- 0.0020 (P = 0.003). Females initiated wing moult at lower body masses, gained mass more rapidly and ended with wing moult heaviest when goslings were heaviest. Body mass dynamics of female Black Brant during wing moult were consistent with the constraint hypothesis. The positive association between gosling mass and rate of body mass gain by adult females during wing moult was also consistent with the constraint hypothesis.

AB  - To make more realistic predictions about the current and future effects of pesticides, we need to better understand physiological mechanisms associated with the widespread higher toxicity of many pesticides under increasing mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs). One overlooked, yet insightful, mechanism are bioenergetic responses as these provide information about the balance between energy gains and costs. Therefore, we studied how the bioenergetic responses to the insecticide chlorpyrifos were affected by a higher mean temperature and a higher DTF in lschnura elegans damselfly larvae. To quantify bioenergetic responses we measured energy availability (Ea), energy consumption (Ec) and total net energy budget (cellular energy allocation, CEA). Exposure to chlorpyrifos considerably reduced CEA values when a high mean temperature was combined with a high DTF (up to -18%). Notably, chlorpyrifos had little effect on CEA at a constant 20 degrees C, meaning that the bioenergetic impact of chlorpyrifos would have been underestimated if we had only tested under standard testing conditions. The chlorpyrifos-induced reductions in CEA under warming were driven by reductions in Ea (up to -16%, mainly through large reductions in sugar and fat contents) while Ec was unaffected by chlorpyrifos. Treatment groups with a lower CEA value showed a higher mortality and a lower growth rate, indicating bioenergetic responses are contributing to the higher toxicity of chlorpyrifos under warming. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating the effects of pesticides under an increase in both mean temperature and DTF to improve the ecological risk assessment of pesticides under global warming.

AB  - In Romania there are many types of historical oil soil contamination the most important being the land ones in Prahova County. The damage caused by this pollution may be permanent and takes a long time to remedied, sometimes requiring the ecological reconstruction of the polluted area. A major role in the remediation of soils polluted with oil plays the vegetation, some plant communities having a higher capacity to adapt and accelerate the process of mineralization of oil, hurrying decontamination. The goal of this paper was to realize an inventory of the oil-contaminated zones in Prahova County (historical oil pollution areas), to study the vegetation cover structure in selected representative sites and to identify potentially useful indicator species in terms of the ability to grow in extreme conditions for ecological restoration and remediate contaminated soils. Inventory of oil contaminated areas and historical data collection related to polluted areas and type of pollution were recorded. The vegetation studies have also been carried out in these areas. The richness of species in areas contaminated with oil is low (44 plant species - Tintea respectively 49 - Pisculesti, forming two different plant communities structure (Jaccard similarity index of about 1%) with low biomass production and productivity (338 DW/sqm). The number of nitrogen fixing plants is higher at Pisculesti (6) compared to Tintea (4) which can be explained by the fact that the nitrogen soil content at Pisculesti is much less than at Tintea. The conclusion was that the plants recommended for use in the reconstruction of historically polluted areas with oil, must have a genetic structure that enables them to adapt a high plasticity in terms of metabolism and root absorption, availability of absorption at radicular level in relation with chemical nitrogen forms. The most important are the plant species that develop the nitrogen fixation formations with different bacterial species.

AB  - Understanding and interpretation of soil quality is crucial to strategize land management practices for sustaining agricultural productivity while mitigating environmental degradation. A medium-term cover crop (CC) trial, established in 2007 and repeated in 2008, at Ridgetown, Ontario was used to evaluate the comprehensive assessment of soil health (CASH), to develop a weighted soil quality index (WSQI), and to compare scores of CASH, Haney soil health test (HSHT), and WSQI in surface soil (15 cm) in 2015 and 2016 (herein referred to as site-years). Out of 25 potential soil quality indicators, 19 soil indicators were responsive to CC treatments and represented a total dataset. Using principal component analysis (PCA) of the total dataset, a minimum dataset (five indicators; pH, organic matter (OM), Solvita labile amino N (SLAN), Solvita CO2-burst, and water extractable organic C (WEOC)) was identified to calculate a WSQI. The WSQI and CASH scores were equivalent in detecting CC treatment differences in site-year 2015, but CASH detected greater magnitude (12.1%) of treatment differences than WSQI (5.7%) in site-year 2016. Cereal rye and a mixture of oilseed radish and rye (OSR + Rye) led to greater soil quality values than other tested CCs. Our results indicate the potential of CCs in significantly improving soil quality in the medium-term (6 years). This study is the first independent evaluation of CASH in a horticultural system in a humid, temperate climate, and first study to compare WSQI with commercial soil quality tests. Even though CASH and WSQI differentiated between CC treatments for soil quality evaluation in both site-years, we recommend WSQI as a valuable and practical tool (lesser number of indicators; five vs. 15), for quantifying soil quality in similar production regions and climatic conditions.

AB  - Regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests are of great importance for the quality of life among city dwellers. To reach a maximum contribution to well-being in cities, the urban regulating ecosystem services (URES) must match with the demands in terms of space and time. If we understand the matches or mismatches between the current urban dwellers' desired quality conditions (demand) and the supply of URES by urban forests (UF) in the cities, this will facilitate integrating the concepts of ecosystem services in urban planning and management, but such an assessment has suffered from major knowledge limitations. Since it is complex and problematic to identify the direct demands for URES and the spatiotemporal patterns therein, improving the demand indicators can help to determine the actual requirements. In this paper, a methodological approach based on indicators is presented and demonstrated for two important URES: air quality improvement and global climate change mitigation provided by urban trees and shrubs. Four air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets were used and compared to supplies of the URES in Tabriz, Iran. Our results show that the mean contribution of the URES supply to air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets is modest. Hence, in Tabriz, there is a strong mismatch between demand and supply. Mismatches at the city scale will have to be reduced by both a reduction in pollutant emissions and an increased provisioning of URES supply through urban greenery. The presented assessment approach and the results for Tabriz make it explicit how different the demands and supplies of the two studied URES are, and we expect similar mismatches in many other cities. Therefore, our approach, relatively simple but still realistic and easy-to-apply, can raise awareness about, and the utility of, the ecosystem services concepts for urban planning and policymaking.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The present review will focus on recently published data of solid organ allograft recipients reporting that patients with de-novo donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) that fix complement in vitro have a significantly higher risk for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and/or graft loss compared to patients whose de-novo DSA do not fix complement or patients who present with preexisting complement fixing DSA.
   Recent findings
   HLA DSAs that fix complement in vitro appear to be a key indicator for rejection and failure of kidney, heart, and lung allografts from studies performed around the world. The majority of these studies are population based and retrospective in nature. Although these studies seemingly indicate that in-vitro complement activating DSAs represent a higher clinical risk than noncomplement fixing DSAs, the majority have not accounted for false-negative reactions attributable to the so-called prozone/interference phenomenon. In the limited number of published studies addressing that concern, high mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value noncomplement fixing DSAs correlate as well as complement fixing DSAs with AMR and graft loss. Combined with the cost of additional testing, these observations bring into question whether there is sufficient clinical applicability to warrant routine testing for complement fixing antibodies.
   Summary
   Complement fixing DSAs are clearly associated with AMR and/or loss of transplanted allografts. However, under appropriate testing conditions, complement fixing capability typically correlates with MFI values of the DSAs. As such, the routine implementation of in-vitro assays to determine whether DSAs fix complement is of questionable value especially when considering additional issues such as cost of testing, logistics, and whether the test results factor into individualized patient care.

AB  - Crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs) in olivine are widely used to infer the mechanisms, conditions, and kinematics of deformation of mantle rocks. Recent experiments on water-saturated olivine were the first to produce a complex CPO characterised by bimodal orientation distributions of both 1100] and (001] axes and inferred to form by combined activity of (001)1100], (100)1001], and (010)1100] slip. This result potentially provides a new microstructural indicator of deformation in the presence of elevated concentrations of intracrystalline hydrous point defects and has implications for the interpretation of seismic anisotropy. Here, we document a previously unexplained natural example of this CPO type in a xenolith from Lesotho and demonstrate that it too may be explained by elevated concentrations of hydrous point defects. We test and confirm the hypothesis that combined (001)1100], (100)10011, and (010)(100] slip were responsible for formation of this CPO by (1) using high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction to precisely characterise the dislocation types present in both the experimental and natural samples and (2) employing visco-plastic self-consistent simulations of CPO evolution to assess the ability of these slip systems to generate the observed CPO. Finally, we utilise calculations based on effective-medium theory to predict the anisotropy of seismic wave velocities arising from the CPO of the xenolith. Maxima in S-wave velocities and anisotropy are parallel to both the shear direction and shear plane normal, whereas maxima in P-wave velocities are oblique to both, adding complexity to interpretation of deformation kinematics from seismic anisotropy.

AB  - In many tropical nations, mangrove forests are essential ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation in coastal regions as they provide important forest resources as well as a suite of other benefits to communities including carbon sequestration. Empirical growth and yield modelling methods derived from terrestrial forestry, which are often robust with respect to forestry forecasting and management, have not often been assessed in mangrove forests yet they are important for underpinning sustainable forest management. We surveyed 89 Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plantations with age ranges from 4 to 26 year old in Vietnam, destructively harvesting 25 trees for biomass measurements and 70 for stem analyses, to assess increments in biomass and standing timber. Systems of equations were developed to model site index, mean diameter, dominant height, stocking, biomass and timber volume. We found that conventional forest growth modelling methods fitted the observed data well. Similar to terrestrial forests, stand height is a good indicator of site productivity. Mean errors for stand volume and biomass estimated from yield tables were both less than 5.3%. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the biomass model was 12 and RMSE of the volume model was 10.8, suggesting that these methods are applicable to evenly aged monoculture mangrove plantations in Vietnam. Our research also indicated high variation in mean annual increment of biomass (MAI) in the surveyed plantations due to a wide range of age and site conditions. Some R. apiculata plantations in Vietnam can reach a peak aboveground biomass MAI of 22.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which is among the highest of published values from plantations of the same species worldwide. Further studies addressing the application of terrestrial forest growth methods to mangrove systems are suggested in order to develop reliable and useful tools for sustainable management of this important ecosystem.

AB  - The Ore Treatment Unit (in Portuguese Unidade de Tratamento de Minerios - UTM) located in Caldas, MG, Brazil is a disabled uranium mine. Environmental conditions generate acid drainage leaching metals and radionuclides from the waste rock pile. This drainage is treated to remove the heavy metals and radionuclides, before allowing the release of the effluent to the environment. To validate the treatment, samples of the released effluents were collected at the interface of the installation with the environment. Sampling was carried out from 2010 to 2015, and the activity concentration (AC, in Bq.l(-1)) of uranium in the liquid effluent was analyzed by arzenazo UV-Vis spectrophotometry of the soluble and particulate fractions, and of the sum of both fractions. Descriptive statistics, Z test and Pearson R-2 correlation among the fractions were performed. Then, the data were organized by year and both ANOVA and Tulcey test were carried out to group the means by magnitude of AC. The annual mean ranged from 0.02 Bq.l(-1) in 2015 to 0.11 Bq.l(-1) in 2010. The soluble fraction showed a higher AC mean when compared to the mean of the particulate fraction and no correlation of the data could be observed. Concerning the magnitude of the release, the ANOVA associated with the Tukey test, identified three groups of annual means (AC(2010) > AC(2011) AC(2012) = AC(2013) = AC(2014) > AC(2015)). The mean values of uranium release at the interface installation-environment checking point (point 014) were within the Authorized Annual Limit (AAL) set by the regulator (0.2 Bq.l(-1)) indicating compliance of treatment with the licensing established for the unit. Finally, the data showed a decreasing tendency of U release.

AB  - Mangrove swamp rice cultivation is important for food security in some countries of West Africa including Sierra Leone. In this agro-ecology, rice is cultivated during the rainy season when freshwater flows in the rivers and salt and acidity concentrations have reduced to non-toxic levels. Rice yields in the mangrove ecosystem of Sierra Leone are higher than in other agro-ecologies and weed, disease and pest pressures are minimal. However, salinity, acidity and crabs negatively affect rice productivity in the mangrove swamps. Due to the differences in levels of flooding, salinity and acid sulphate conditions of mangrove swamp soils, it is assumed that there is variability of soil properties of mangrove swamps along the associated river, which may impact the choice of suitable rice varieties and soil management practices. The purpose of this study was to understand the soil physical and chemical properties of mangrove swamp soils along the Great Scarcies River of Sierra Leone. A soil sampling survey was designed and implemented using transects to collect composite soil samples of 1 ha area at 0-0.2 m depth at 11 different sites located from the estuary of the Great Scarcies River to approximately 35 km inland. The soil samples were air-dried, processed and analyzed for selected physical and chemical properties by recommended methods. Statistical analysis generated mean, standard deviations, coefficient of variation, correlation matrix and principal components. The high variability in soil physical and chemical characteristics of mangrove swamp soils along the Great Scarcies River could be attributed to the complex interactions between the twice daily tidal inundations and depositions of soil organic matter, physical particles and nutrients onto the mangrove swamp soils along the river. The result of this is a soil fertility gradient down-stream.

AB  - The article analyses the works of Vladimir K. Arseniev (1872-1930), a traveller and researcher of the Far East, with the aim of identifying the representational potential of the region's image as constructed by him. Archival data (field diaries, memories, and newspapers) and literary works of his were used as major sources in the analysis. Based on the methodology of social constructivism, scientific and artistic ways of assembling the image of the Far East are defined and analysed, and the role of each of these in Arseniev's works is shown. A particular emphasis is placed on the role of the researcher himself in the creation of a stereotypical picture of the region, and the techniques of his doing so are considered, among them scientific description, naming of territories, mapping, visualisation, and literary work. The article demonstrates that Arseniev's narratives would evoke in the reader's mind an image of the Far East with a strong emotional component to it and thus a multi-dimensional (nonlinear) idea of the region and its inhabitants would form. The variety of the techniques he used in the study of the Far East, on the one hand, helped avoid the use of excessively scientific language in the representation of the region, and on the other, was least subject to any political rhetoric. The authors conclude that thanks to the works of Arseniev, the image of the Far East was instilled into collective consciousness as a complex of ideas combining pictures of nature and wildlife, Russian colonists and seaside 'pathfinders'(and in this form was communicated to the international audience). This image assumes the character of a cultural construct, conditions the assessment of the region, and is distinctively tenacious.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address two questions: who commits? And who engages? For example, does an individual's likelihood of committing/engaging vary with his/her age; or with the level of his/her qualifications; or with his/her occupation? Of what consequences are the characteristics of the workplace at which the individual is employed?
   Design/methodology/approach - The investigation uses the Skills and Employment Surveys Series Data set to construct the indicators of commitment and engagement. Using an ordered-logit model and an OLS model, these indicators are analysed to identify their covariates.
   Findings - Who commits and who engages depends upon the indicator used to measure the attitude/behaviour in question. Changing these indicators sometimesmeans that an individual no longer commits/engages. Further, even for the same indicator of commitment/engagement, who commits/engages varies across individuals.
   Research limitations/implications - The indicators of commitment and engagement examined are derived from the responses in a pre-existing data set which has its origins in survey instruments which had quite comprehensive terms of reference. Owning to the cross-sectional nature of this data set and the statistical methodology applied, the statistical results are correlations between some possible indicators of commitment and engagement and some variables which denote the personal characteristics of individuals and the characteristics of the organisations with which they are employed. Causation cannot be inferred from these correlations.
   Originality/value - Commitment and engagement are central to many models of the management of human resources. However, the likelihood that an individual commits and/or engages differs across the workforce has rarely been examined. This paper addresses this research lacuna using a data set which is rich in detail about an individual's personal characteristics.

AB  - Shale oil has been found in the Paleogene lacustrine source rocks in the second (Eh(3)(2)) and third beds (Eh(3)(3)) of the third member of the Hetaoyuan Formation from the Biyang Depression of the Nanxiang Basin, eastern China, but the formation environments of the organic-rich shales are still unclear, which restricts the shale oil exploration. Here, this paper discusses the paleoenvironment and its control on the organic-rich shale formation. Our study suggests that shales from the Eh(3)(2) and Eh(3)(3) beds display some heterogeneities in total organic carbon (TOC) contents and oil potential as a result of their different paleoenvironments. During Eh(3)(3) deposition, the paleoproductivity was moderate to high, which was diluted by moderate to high terrigenous detrital matter (TDM) input. During Eh(3)(2) deposition, the TDM and terrigenous organic matter (TOM) inputs increased. The paleoproductivity was moderate, which was greatly diluted by the high TDM content. The redox conditions were anoxic during the two source rock intervals. Paleoproductivity is the main controlling factor of source rock formation during Eh(3)(2) and Eh(3)(3) depositions, which has a strong positive correlation with the burial of organic carbon. However, anoxia did not promote deposition of the richest source rocks. During Eh(3)(3) deposition, shales with high contents of TOC values and better oil potential could be formed in this environment on account of the moderate to high paleoproductivity. In contrast, during Eh(3)(2) deposition, high TOM input did not obviously improve the burial of organic carbon bin high TDM input significantly diluted the paleoproductivity. The bottom water became semi-saline to hypersaline, but it did not enhance the anoxic environment. Shales with medium TOC values and oil potential could be formed in this environment as a result of moderate paleoproductivity.

AB  - The aim of this observational study was to investigate if a relationship exists between the calculated overall individual welfare score (as an indicator of the welfare quality) and the neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio (as a stress indicator) in working (draught) and reproduction horses (breeding stallions and broodmares), in two different seasons. The welfare of the horses was assessed by a protocol which included health and behavioural parameters. An individual welfare score was computed, the total and differential WBC count was established and the N:L ratio was calculated for each of the 1482 assessed horses. Using all these parameters, comparisons were made between the horse categories (working horses, breeding stallions, broodmares) in two assessment seasons. Finally, the relationship between the individual welfare score and the N:L ratio was studied in light of the significant correlations found. The highest frequency of health problems was recorded in working horses. The human-animal relationship did not present significant differences between the horse categories. The individual welfare scores were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the working than in the breeding animals, in both assessment seasons. The N:L ratio was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the working horses than in those kept for reproduction. The season had no significant influence (P > 0.05) on the investigated parameters. All the significant correlations found between the N:L ratio and the individual welfare score were negative. The results obtained indicate poor welfare in the working horses, comparing with the breeding animals. The findings of our study confirmed that the N:L ratio increases in horses with a poor welfare state. The multiple correlations of the N:L ratio with the individual welfare scores of the assessed horses emphasised the efficiency of this parameter in identifying the acute and chronic stress conditions in the living environment of the animals.

AB  - Determining species occurrence in ecosystems of high conservation concern is especially important for recommending habitat management techniques and identifying suitable restoration sites. We investigated (1) how stand- and landscape-scale attributes affect occupancy of priority bird species associated with longleaf pine (Pines palutris) ecosystems, (2) if these priority birds can be used as indicator species for desired open pine forest structure, and (3) if these indicator species are positively correlated with greater avian richness. We compared priority bird occupancy among 12 stand types (habitat types) throughout the historic range of longleaf pine in Mississippi. We found stands resembling the historic longleaf pine ecosystem were positively associated with Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) occupancy probabilities, but were not significantly correlated with Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) occupancy. Both of which were too generalized in their occurrence to be useful indicators. Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow occupancy probabilities positively correlated with desired forest structure metrics of longleaf pine ecosystems such as low midstory density (<10%) and basal area (9.2-16.1 m(2)/ha) and 40-60% canopy cover suggesting they are effective indicators of historic longleaf pine conditions. Co-occurrence of Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow was positively correlated with avian richness, indicating these species can be used in conjunction as effective indicators for desired open pine endpoints used for restoration and management. Inclusion of priority bird species in management efforts provides assurance that restored areas will incorporate desired forest structure endpoints that have been linked to open pine priority bird presence. Correlation between priority bird species and avian species richness ensures restored areas provide suitable habitat for local avian communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethiopia has established protected areas throughout the country and designated many areas of land in order to conserve the natural resources and biodiversity. Hence, identification of the diversity in these protected areas is essential for conservation and management purposes. The study was conducted with the objective to investigate and document the floristic composition and plant community types of Maze national park. A preferential sampling technique was used as a sampling design and a total of 65 plots with a size of 20 m x 20 m (400 m(2)) were laid out for the woody species; a sub-plot of 5 m x 5 m was used at the center of each quadrat to assess the herbaceous species. A total of 144 species of vascular plants belonging to 109 genera and representing 37 families with, 40%, 37%, 17%, and 6% herbs, trees, shrubs and climbers respectively were recorded and identified. The most diverse family was Fabaceae followed by Poaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Asteraceae. Combretum adenogonium, Rhus natalensis, Panicum maximum, are the most frequently occurring tree layer, shrub layer and herb layer plant species respectively. The output of TWINSPAN (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis) has shown a cluster of 6 plant community types. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) has shown that there was statistically significant difference among plant communities in species richness, altitude, diversity and evenness at 95% confidence interval with a P value < 0.05. Anthropogenic activities in Maze National Park were identified to exert high pressure on the vegetation and wildlife in the area resulting in the loss of biodiversity underpinned by troubled natural habitat. The most feasible recommendation to reverse the undesirable condition in the national park is to actively participate the local people in the conservation activities of the national park via ecotourism which is one form of sustainable tourism.

AB  - Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a crucial antioxidant enzyme playing the first defense line in antioxidant pathways against reactive oxygen species in various organisms including marine invertebrates. There exist mainly two specific forms, Cu/Zn-SOD (SOD1) and Mn-SOD (SOD2), in eukaryotes. SODs are known to be concurrently modulated by a variety of environmental stressors. By using central composite experimental design and response surface method, the joint effects of water temperature (18-34A degrees C) and copper ion concentration (0.1-1.5 mg/L) on the total SOD activity in the digestive gland of Crassostrea ariakensis were studied. The results showed that the linear effect of temperature was highly significant (P < 0.01), the quadratic effect of temperature was significant (P < 0.05); the linear effect of copper ion concentration was not significant (P > 0.05), while the quadratic effect of copper ion concentration was highly significant (P < 0.01); the interactive effect of temperature and copper ion concentration was not significant (P > 0.05); the effect of temperature was greater than that of copper ion concentration. The model equation of digestive gland SOD enzyme activity towards the two factors of interest was established, with R-2 and predictive R-2 as high as 0.961 6 and 0.820 7, respectively, suggesting that the goodness-offit to experimental data be very satisfactory, and could be applied to prediction of digestive gland SOD activity in C. ariakensis under the conditions of the experiment. Our results would be conducive to addressing the health of aquatic animals and/or to detecting environmental problems by taking SOD as a potential bioindicator.

AB  - Soil disturbance is recognized as an important driver of biodiversity in dry grasslands, and can therefore be implemented as a restoration measure. However, because community re-assembly following disturbance includes stochastic processes, a focus only on species richness or establishment success of particular species will not inform on how plant communities respond ecologically to disturbance. We therefore evaluated vegetation development following disturbance by quantifying species richness, species composition and functional trait composition. Degraded calcareous sandy grassland was subjected to experimental disturbance treatments (ploughing or rotavation), and the vegetation was surveyed during four subsequent years of succession. Treated plots were compared with control plots representing untreated grassland, as well as nearby plots characterized by plant communities representing the restoration target.
   Species richness and functional diversity both increased in response to soil disturbance, and rotavation, but not ploughing, had a persistent positive effect on the occurrence of specialist species of calcareous sandy grassland. However, no type of soil disturbance caused the plant species composition to develop towards the target vegetation. The disturbance had an immediate and large impact on the vegetation, but the vegetation developed rapidly back towards the control sites. Plant functional composition analysis indicated that the treatments created habitats different both from control sites and target sites. Community-weighted mean Ellenberg indicator values suggested that the observed plant community response was at least partially due to an increase in nitrogen and water availability following disturbance. This study shows that a mild type of disturbance, such as rotavation, may be most successful in promoting specialist species in calcareous sandy grassland, but that further treatments are needed to reduce nutrient availability. We conclude that a functional trait based analysis provides additional information of the vegetation response and the abiotic conditions created, complementing the information from the species composition.

AB  - New palynological and ostracod data are presented from the Holocene Volga delta, obtained from short cores and surface samples collected in the Damchik region, near Astrakhan, Russian Federation in the northern Caspian Sea. Four phases of delta deposition are recognized and constrained by accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon ages. Palynological records show that erosive channels, dunes (Baer hills) and inter-dune lakes were present during the period 11,500-8900cal. BP at the time of the Mangyshlak Caspian lowstand. The period 8900-3770cal. BP was characterized regionally by extensive steppe vegetation, with forest present at times with warmer, more humid climates, and with halophytic and xerophytic vegetation present at times of drought. The period 3770-2080cal. BP was a time of active delta deposition, with forest or woodland close to the delta, indicating relatively warm and humid climates and variable Caspian Sea levels. From 2080cal. BP to the present-day, aquatic pollen is frequent in highstand intervals and herbaceous pollen and fungal hyphae frequent in lowstand intervals. Soils and incised valley sediments are associated with the regional Derbent regression and may be time-equivalent with the Medieval Warm Period'. Fungal spores are an indicator of erosional or aeolian processes, whereas fungal hyphae are associated with soil formation. Freshwater algae, ostracods and dinocysts indicate mainly freshwater conditions during the Holocene with minor brackish influences. Dinocysts present include Spiniferites cruciformis, Caspidinium rugosum, Impagidinium caspienense and Pterocysta cruciformis, the latter a new record for the Caspian Sea. The Holocene Volga delta is a partial analogue for the much larger oil and gas bearing Mio-Pliocene palaeo-Volga delta.

AB  - For species with precocial young, survival from hatching to fledging is a key factor influencing recruitment. Furthermore, growth rates of precocial chicks are an indicator of forage quality and habitat suitability of brood-rearing areas. We examined how growth and fledging rates of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) chicks were influenced by landscape features, such as hatchling density (hatchlings per hectare of remotely sensed habitat [H ha(-1)]), island vs. mainland, and wind fetch (exposure to waves) at 2-km segments (n = 15) of Lake Sakakawea, North Dakota, during 2007-2008. Hatchling growth was comparable with published estimates for other habitats. Models for fledging rate (fledged young per segment) assuming density dependence had more support (w(i) = 96%) than those assuming density independence (w(i) = 4%). Density-dependent processes appeared to influence fledging rate only at densities >5 H ha(-1), which occurred in 19% of the segments we sampled. When areas with densities >5 H ha(-1) were excluded, density-dependence and density-independence models were equally supported (w(i) = 52% and 48%, respectively). Fledging rate declined as the wind fetch of a segment increased. Fledging rate on mainland shorelines was 4.3 times greater than that on islands. Previous work has indicated that plovers prefer islands for nesting, but our results suggest that this preference is not optimal and could lead to an ecological trap for chicks. While other researchers have found nesting-habitat requirements to be gravelly areas on exposed beaches without fine-grain substrates, our results suggest that chicks fledge at lower rates in these habitats. Thus, breeding plovers likely require complexes of these nesting habitats along with protected areas with fine, nutrient-rich substrate for foraging by hatchlings.

AB  - Pendimethalin, an herbicide active substance frequently used in terrestrial systems, has detected in European aquatic ecosystems. Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C), 500 ng L-1 (P500), 800 ng L-1 (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl at 500 ng L-1 (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the high presence of herbicide in fish (613 +/- 163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore, antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following chronic exposure to 800 ng L-1 of pendimethalin concentration. While the glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water, while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with control. These significant differences between treatments in antioxidant defenses parameters measured, attesting to the irreversibility of the effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Enteric microbial pathogens originating from agricultural practices pose a serious threat to surface water quality and human health. A two-phase study was conducted in southern Illinois that examined the ability of various riparian buffer species to attenuate fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in overland flow, while also assessing E. coli persistence in associated buffer soils. Plots established with giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and non-vegetated control buffers were subjected to artificial flooding with cattle (Bos taurus) manure-laden water. Mean bacteria concentrations in overland flow exiting all plots were significantly higher than concentrations found in the source slurry. To assess E. coli persistence in plots, overland flow was collected from a simulated rainfall event 4 days following slurry application, and from natural rainfall events 22, 46, 94, 97, and 111 days after the application. Overland flow exiting all plots (including non-vegetated controls) exhibited mean E. coli concentrations significantly higher than those found in the initial slurry applied. The observed concentrations may have been the result of overland flow characteristics and high levels of ambient fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) present with plots. The moist, shaded conditions created by plot vegetation may have produced prime habitat to harbor FIB. Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) may have been effective at attenuating FIB, however, performance may have been masked by the exceptionally high ambient FIB populations that were present in adjacent soils. The young age of the VBS (< 1 year) may have also influenced their seemingly poor FIB attenuation. As the VBS age, increases in above and below ground vegetative material may act to increase VBS attenuation capabilities.

AB  - Five Tertiary deposits in the Czech Republic were studied using coal petrological and organic geochemical methods. Coal samples were chosen to cover four lithotypes: xylite rich coal, matrix coal, liptobiolith, and sapropelic coal. Xylite rich and matrix coals are characterized by higher ulminite and densinite contents, and lower textinite and resinite contents. Sapropelic coals from the North Bohemian and Zitava basins are formed by large amount of ulminite and densinite, and a high proportion of liptodetrinite, sporinite and alginite that prevails in sapropelic shale from the Uhelna relic. The essential difference between sapropelic coal and liptobiolith coal consists of high contents of liptodetrinite, bituminite, resinite, inertinite, and lower contents of clay minerals in liptobioliths. The biomarker composition of the aliphatic fraction includes n-alkanes, and their distribution varied according to coal lithotype: long n-alkanes were dominant in liptobioliths, sapropelic coals and shale, the mid-chain n-alkanes prevailed in xylite rich coals, and the short-chain n-alkanes were abundant in matrix coals. The prevalence of diterpenoids represented by phyllocladane type compounds indicated the presence of gymnosperm vegetation. Molecular indicators for angiosperms, present mainly as oleanenes, were also recognized in the lignite samples. Hopanoids were represented mainly by 17 alpha(H),21 beta(H)-homohopane and hop-17(21)-ene. The biomarker fingerprints and petrographic based indices show that the majority of the xylite rich, matrix and sapropelic coals and shale originated from mixed forests, formed by arborescent and herbaceous communities, aquatic plants and macrophytes, under wet and slightly dry and slightly oxic-anoxic conditions.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the optimal culling strategy in relation to biological and economic efficiency (BE and EE, respectively) and annualized net revenue (AN) in the Japanese Black cow-calf production system with special reference to the beef quality of culled cows. The herd model focused on two ways of mating: one-mating trial system (ONE) and continuous-mating trial system (CON). ONE assumed that heifers that fail to conceive are culled and cows that fail to conceive are culled at weaning of their calves, while CON assumed that mating continues until all females theoretically conceive. Least square means of carcass data of Japanese Black cows collected from a cooperative farm in Japan were used to estimate the carcass price of a cow by parity and Beef Marbling Standard (BMS) number. The simulation, assuming the current production situation in Japan, indicated that sales of culled cows accounted for 0.10-0.20 of total sales and was an important element in total production. Comparisons between ONE and CON showed that production efficiency in the current situation is higher in CON. The BE, EE and AN were higher in CON than in ONE. The two economic indicators were less sensitive to changes in annual discount rate but highly sensitive to changes in female calf price and BMS number of cows, indicating the importance of considering fluctuations in calf price and potential quality of culled cows' carcasses when estimating the economically optimal parity of culling. The three indicators derived different optimal solutions even in the same mating trial systems, stressing the importance of choice of production indicators when determining the culling strategy and evaluating animal production.

AB  - The response of four winter wheat cultivars, differing in resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB), to spray inoculation with four selected Fusarium graminearum isolates, mixture of these isolates and frequently used F culmorum isolate B was studied in five field and glasshouse experiments during 2008-2010. Analyses of variance showed highly significant main and interaction effects of cultivar, inoculum source and environment (year-trial) on all five examined traits indicative of disease severity, yield loss and accumulation of mycotoxins. The relations between traits were not evidently influenced by the used isolate. Resistance of host genotypes and environmental conditions accounted for a greater proportion of the total variation (8-36%) than the inoculation source (isolate) that substantially influenced the accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (12%), but expressed relatively low effects on symptom scores, percentage of fusarium damaged kernels and reductions of yield components (2-4%). Two-way and three-way interactions accounted for 25-40% of variation in the examined traits, which indicates great importance of multi-environment tests, using different Fusarium isolates for inoculation. Separate inoculation with F. graminearum isolates, differing in aggressiveness, did not appear to be more advantageous than their use in mixture that showed medium or below-average aggressiveness in all traits. The application of an isolate mixture could be recommended as a "less costly" alternative to inoculation with single isolates in trials repeated in different years and/or locations. It was indicated by these experiments that especially the detection of resistance/moderate resistance to FHB could be facilitated by the use of a carefully selected mixture of isolates. However, the application of aggressive isolates (isolate B of F. culmorum in these experiments) appeared to be beneficial to eliminate FHB susceptible materials in the breeding process.

AB  - Gullies as an indicator of human impact on loess landscape (Case study: North Western Part of Lublin Upland, Poland). The aim of this paper is to study the relationships between human agricultural activities and gullies in loess-covered areas of Eastern Poland, using the example of NW part of Lublin Upland. A clear connection between the main stages of cultural landscape development and the phases of gully erosion in the North Western (NW) part of Lublin Upland is shown. It is also found that in present times, on a local scale, i.e., within single catchments, gully development is conditioned to a considerable degree by anthropogenic factors such as the kinds of crops and field patterns. Several spatial (cartographic) analyses using GIS software were conducted in the test area of 28 km(2) (representing typical loess landscape of NW part of Lublin Upland). The influence of natural factors such as the type of surface deposits and relief on gully development is estimated. The analysis shows that gully development occurred most commonly in areas of moderate slopes (6-12 degrees) appearance. The effect of surface deposit type was not clear on a local scale. The conducted analysis shows that about 1/5 of the gully edges could be subjected to intensive erosion processes (due to land use). The potential threat of gully erosion to existing buildings and the most fertile soils is also examined. About 4.5% of buildings and 11% of the area with the best soils occur in the immediate vicinity of gullies (i.e. within 25 m from their edges). Relationships between the existing gully network and the changes in forest land cover during the last 100 years are demonstrated. A considerable increase of forest patches near gullies took place in the test area. About 82% of new forest areas grew within 100 m from the edges of gullies.

AB  - A sedimentary record from lake Stora ViA degrees arvatn in northeast Iceland records environmental changes over the past 2000 years. Downcore data include chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblage data and total organic carbon, nitrogen, and biogenic silica content. Sample scores from detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of chironomid assemblage data are well correlated with measured temperatures at StykkishA(3)lmur over the 170 year instrumental record, indicating that chironomid assemblages at Stora ViA degrees arvatn have responded sensitively to past temperature changes. DCA scores appear to be useful for quantitatively inferring past temperatures at this site. In contrast, a quantitative chironomid-temperature transfer function developed for northwestern Iceland does a relatively poor job of reconstructing temperature shifts, possibly due to the lake's large size and depth relative to the calibration sites or to the limited resolution of the subfossil taxonomy. The pre-instrumental climate history inferred from chironomids and other paleolimnological proxies is supported by prior inferences from historical documents, glacier reconstructions, and paleoceanographic studies. Much of the first millennium AD was relatively warm, with temperatures comparable to warm decades of the twentieth century. Temperatures during parts of the tenth and eleventh centuries AD may have been comparably warm. Biogenic silica concentrations declined, carbon:nitrogen ratios increased, and some chironomid taxa disappeared from the lake between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries, recording the decline of temperatures into the Little Ice Age, increasing soil erosion, and declining lake productivity. All the proxy reconstructions indicate that the most severe Little Ice Age conditions occurred during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a period historically associated with maximum sea-ice and glacier extent around Iceland.

AB  - Freshwater wetlands commonly occur along the boundaries between terrestrial upland and deep open-water systems, and are consequently prone to dynamic and often highly variable hydrological regimes. Physiological adaptations to drought would be advantageous in emergent vegetation, as wetlands are often susceptible to short periods of water scarcity through seasonal declines in precipitation and/or surface water runoff. This study used 15 1 microcosms to examine xylem water potential (psi(xylem))- and tissue water content (theta)-breakpoints in 2 wetland forbs (Justicia americana and Saururus cernuus) to determine how these plants respond to short-term (2 wk) water deficits. Overall, treatment responses by these forbs included reductions in both theta and psi(xylem) during the second week of drought, followed by rapid recoveries of theta and psi(xylem) within a few days of water repletion. Rapid tissue-water recovery, following extreme water deficits (soil moisture levels <3%), is beneficial to plants residing in areas prone to intense water fluctuations. Furthermore, while 0 and psi(xylem) breakpoints in S. cernuus occurred as soil moisture levels fell below 12% (ca. -800 kPa soil water potential), breakpoints for J. americana occurred at considerably lower soil moisture levels (ca. 7 and 10% soil water content for theta and psi(xylem) respectively; or less than -1500 kPa soil water potential). The lower breakpoints observed in J. americana were comparable to values reported for terrestrial grasses, including species adapted to dryer, xeric conditions. Therefore, the results from this study suggest that some wetland forbs are physiologically adapted to environments that undergo rapid changes in water hydrology, including the ability to tolerate short-term water scarcity comparable to dryer upland systems.

AB  - The vegetation of natural fir-beech forests on the western edge of the Carpathians was repeatedly surveyed in 1972(4) and 1994(5) on 34 plots in the Razula and Salajka reserves. Concurrently repeated whole-area dendrometric measurements of all live and dead trees were made together with maps of forest development stages. The maps were used to compare vegetation changes. The objective was to assess the tree layer dynamics, to discern vegetation development trends from cyclical changes, and to assess the changes of site conditions through phytoindication.
   The fir (Abies alba) population showed disrupted continuity of development associated with its pronounced withdrawal and replacement by beech (Fagus sylvatica). Rather than a cyclical change, the phenomenon is a trend that can be expected to become more dominant in the future. The reason for the interchange of the two species is seen in a fading response to the medieval colonization of Carpathian ridges connected with the exploitation of local forests for grazing and intensive litter raking.
   The herb layer was significantly modelled by changes occurring over time and by the dynamics of forest development stages. Species diversity in Razula was observed to increase. Salajka exhibited an invasion of acidophilous taxa (Luzula luzuloides, Vaccinium myrtillus) and decreased frequency of demanding taxa (Galeobdolon montanum, Dentaria enneaphyllos, Galium odoratum).
   Changes in the coverage of Dryopteris filix-mas, Rubus idaeus and Senecio ovatus were interpreted as cyclical changes. No significant shifts were found in the species diversity between the stages. The herb layer at a disintegration stage was homogenized and exhibited the lowest tendency to gain relative control of the undergrowth; the tendency was highest at the optimum stage.
   The stages of forest development exhibited changes in soil nitrogen and soil reaction.

AB  - Researchers resort to a wide range of simplified representations at the continuum scale, to model creep-fatigue damage in viscoplastic heterogeneous materials, such as Sn-Pb eutectic solders, caused by thermomechanical and mechanical cyclic loading (e.g., due to power cycling, environmental temperature cycling, vibration, etc.). Typically, in macroscale phenomenological damage models, the cyclic damage is assumed to depend on some loading parameter, such as cyclic strain range, work dissipation per cycle, partitioned strain range, partitioned work dissipation per cycle, cyclic entropy changes, cyclic stress range, integrated matrix creep, etc. In many instances, some of these variables are weighted with a factor to account for rate-dependent effects. The task of finding the best damage metric is difficult because of complex microstructural interactions between cyclic creep and cyclic plasticity due to the high homologous temperature under operating conditions. In this study, we use insights obtained from microstructural and more mechanistic modeling to identify the most appropriate macroscale damage metrics. The microstructural models are based on such phenomena as grain boundary sliding, blocking of grain boundary sliding by second-phase particles, volumetric and grain boundary surface diffusion, void nucleation, void growth, and plastic collapse of cavitating grain boundaries. As has been demonstrated in the literature, micro-structural models suggest that fatigue damage caused by cyclic plasticity should correlate well with either of the two most commonly used damage indicators: cyclic strain range and plastic work dissipation per cycle. This study, however, demonstrates that in the case of damage dominated by cyclic creep, microstructural models developed by the authors indicate closer correlation of fatigue damage with creep work dissipation per cycle, than with cyclic creep strain range.

AB  - The total fatty acid composition of nine species of caprellidean amphipods collected from the Strait of Gibraltar was investigated. All caprellids were characterised by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5(n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6(n-3); other major fatty acids were the saturate palmitic acid, 16:0, and the monounsaturate oleic acid, 18: 1 (n-9). In spite of this general uniformity, univariate and multivariate analysis showed that Caprella acanthifera and C. grandimana differed from the remaining species (C. danilevskii, C. equilibra, C. liparotensis, C. penantis, C. santosrosai, Phtisica marina and Pseudoprotella phasma). These two species (C. acanthifera and C. grandimana) showed higher concentrations of 18:1(n-7) and 20:4(n-6) and lower percentages of 22:6(n-3). These results. together with higher values of the biomarker ratio 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3) and a lower ratio 18:1(11-9)/18:1(n-7), Suggested a greater contribution of diatoms and macroalgae in the diet of C. acanthifera and C. grandimana and a lesser contribution of flagellates than in the remaining species. The cluster classification of the caprellid specimens fro the Strait of Gibraltar based on the fatty acid composition was in agreement with the Cluster output from data of feeding behaviour. Sex-related changes in the fatty acid composition were also explored in C. acanthifera, C. danilevskii and C. penantis; the percentage of 18:0, 20:4(n-6), and 20:5(n-3) was significantly higher in males, whereas 16: 1 (n-7) was higher in females. The intraspecific differences of fatty acids in different environmental conditions seem to indicate that the consumption of diatoms in contrast to flagellates increases with the degree of eutrophication.

AB  - Seven crude oils representing the different petroleum-bearing basins in the Western Desert were characterized by a variety of biomarker and nonbiomarker parameters. For comparison, one crude oil from the Gulf of Suez region has also been studied. The oils have been analyzed for geochemical biomarkers using GC and GC-MS techniques. The results reveal significant differences within the oils that suggest five oil types. Type 1 oils from the Gulf of Suez show C-29/C-30 17alpha(H) hopane ratio >1, high C-35 homohopane index, and the presence of considerable amounts of gammacerane indicating a marine saline carbonate or evaporite source rock and highly reducing (low Eh) conditions. Type 2 oils from Matruh basin and type 3 oils from Shushan basin are very similar and show relatively high Pr/Ph ratios, low sulfur and metal contents, paucity Of C-30 steranes and the presence of high relative abundance of 17alpha(H) diahopane (C-30*) suggesting that they probably originated from source rocks containing a significant proportion of higher plant material. Another related feature of these oils is the absence of 18alpha(H)-oleanane which suggests a source age older than Cretaceous. Type 4 oils from Abu-Elgharadig basin show terpane distribution dominated by C-24 tricyclic, absence Of C-30*-diahopane and medium diasterane/sterane ratios which reflect generation from marine siliciclastic source rocks. Type 5 oils from Alamein basin possess source biomarkers indicating a mixed contribution of terrestrial and marine sources. The presence of measurable amounts of oleanane in this type of oils suggests source rocks deposited in deltaic or near shore environment in Post-Cretaceous basin.

AB  - Sediment cores spanning the last two centuries were taken in Hagelseewli, a high-elevation lake in the Swiss Alps. Contiguous 0.5 cm samples were analysed for biological remains, including diatoms, chironomids, cladocera, chrysophyte cysts, and fossil pigments. In addition, sedimentological and geochemical variables such as loss-on-ignition, total carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, grain-size and magnetic mineralogy were determined. The results of these analyses were compared to a long instrumental air temperature record that was adapted to the elevation of Hagelseewli by applying mean monthly lapse rates.
   During much of the time, the lake is in the shadow of a high cliff to the south, so that the lake is ice-covered during much of the year and thus decoupled from climatic forcing. Lake biology is therefore influenced more by the duration of ice-cover than by direct temperature effects during the short open-water season. Long periods of ice-cover result in anoxic water conditions and dissolution of authigenic calcites, leading to carbonate-free sediments.
   The diversity of chironomid and cladoceran assemblages is extremely low, whereas that of diatom and chrysophyte cyst assemblages is much higher. Weak correlations were observed between the diatom and chrysophyte cyst assemblages on the one hand and summer or autumn air temperatures on the other, but the proportion of variance explained is low, so that air temperature alone cannot account for the degree of variation observed in the paleolimnological record.
   Analyses of mineral magnetic parameters, spheroidal carbonaceous particles and lead suggest that atmospheric pollution has had a significant effect on the sediments of Hagelseewli, but little effect on the water quality as reflected in the lake biota.

AB  - This first pantropical survey of distributional patterns of life forms, life strategies, and ecomorphological structures of trunk-epiphytic bryophytes along altitudinal transects in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, clearly revealed distinct common adaptive trends which occur regardless of familial relationships and differing species assemblages of the communities. They can be summarized as "functional types" characterizing the different communities of the altitudinal belts. Mat forming "passive" Perennial stayers and Perennial shuttle species with a uniform common "basic architecture" dominate the communities of the tropical lowland and submontane belt. This "functional type" is replaced in the cooler and more humid montane rain forests mainly by fan and weft forming "vegetative" Perennial stayers and Perennial shuttle species with an increased reliance on propagules and clonal growth for population maintenance. They show various ecomorphological structures for an effective and rapid condensation of water vapour from the fogs (e.g., fog-stripping by ciliate leaves), and for water storage and conduction. Within the more open, upper montane forests and oreal ericaceous woodland, where the epiphytes grow under increasingly xeric conditions, short turf, tall turf and cushion forming ''generative'' Perennial stayers and Perennial shuttle species predominate, characterized additionally by structures such as an abundant rhizoid tomentum and the development of an internal central strand. A third main life strategy category, the Colonists strategy, clearly is of no importance in undisturbed epiphytic communities of the tropics and is, if present, restricted to secondary forests. It can be seen as an indicator of disturbance. These adaptive trends occur worldwide and impressively demonstrate that life forms, life strategies and ecomorphological structures of tropical trunk-epiphytic bryophytes are co-evolved adaptive traits that evolved convergently under similar environmental pressures.

AB  - Genetic variation of 16 allozyme loci in 397 Halicryptus spinulosus (Priapulida) revealed overall polymorphism of P = 0.438 and Hardy-Weinberg expectations for heterozygosity of H-e = 0.060 for Baltic Sea stocks, H-e = 0.143 for the White Sea and H-e = 0.121 for Iceland. Maximal unbiased standard distances of D = 0.0693 separated Baltic and White Sea populations. Nordic and Baltic populations could be distinguished by allozymes, but Baltic subsamples proved cohesive. Gene flow amounted to effective exchange values per generation of N-m = 2.94 over 650 km of continuous habitat, N-m = 10.65 over 175 km, and N-m = 13.85 over 20 km. Gene flow started to decrease with geographic distance beyond a dispersal threshold of 20 km, but hierarchical G(ST)-statistics indicated light isolation by distance beyond a minimum of 8 km. Gene flow is high for a benthic worm assumed to lack dispersal by pelagic larva, a paradox which cannot be resolved now. Baltic populations are characterized by lower heterozygosity than Nordic stocks. In the Baltic Basin, temporally continuous brackish-water conditions have only existed for the past 7000 years. The two possible colonization routes of H. spinulosus to the geologically young Baltic Sea imply genetic drift, whether by founder effect (sweepstake colonization from Iceland) or by refugial bottlenecking during the Ancylus phase of the Baltic Basin after a direct connection to the White Sea had been sequestered. Continued genetic drift is emphasized by lower heterozygosity in the ecologically unstable Belt Sea compared to the central Baltic. Allozymes falsify the reduced-mutability hypothesis to explain bradytelic evolution of Priapulida. Regional genetic homogeneity, ample polymorphism, and preference for anoxic black mud qualify H. spinulosus populations as indicators of microevolutionary responses to water circulation regimes or pollution in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The relationships between the distributions of 82 chrysophycean cyst morphotypes and measured environmental variables in freshwater lakes in British Columbia were examined using ordination and regression statistics. After removal of unusual samples, 60 lakes were included in the analyses. Indirect and direct gradient analysis explained 23.2 and 14.0% of the variance in the cyst distribution data, and 31.4 and 53.7% of the variance in the cyst-environment relationship, respectively. Watershed area, Secchi depth and [Mg] were identified as the variables with the greatest contributions to the first ordination axis. Maximum depth contributed most strongly to axis 2. Constrained redundancy analyses were used to test the ability of individual environmental variables to explain the variance in the cyst data; no one variable was shown to have an overriding effect on cyst distributions. Five groups of cysts were identified using the ordination diagrams and the correlations between each cyst and each environmental variable. Partial least squares regression was used to construct inference models that quantified the relationship between the cyst distributions and four environmental variables (pH, [Mg], total phosphorus, and Secchi depth). For each variable, the best model included only those cysts which were significantly correlated with that variable. The inference model for pH yielded the strongest relationship (r(2) = 0.51) and best predictive ability (root mean square error of prediction = 0.32). All the inference models showed a strong trend in the residuals, such that inferences at the low end of the observed gradient tended to be overestimates and inferences at the high end tended to be underestimates. Thus, paleolimnological inferences of past environmental conditions using these models will tend to underestimate the degree of change.

AB  - Targeted recombinant aequorins represent to date the most specific means of monitoring [Ca2+] in subcellular organelles (Rizzuto, R., Simpson, A. W. M., Brini, M., and Pozzan, T. (1992) Nature 358, 325-328; Brini, M., Murgia, M., Pasti, L., Picard, D., Pozzan, T., and Rizzuto, R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4813-4819; Kendall, J. Ri., Dormer, R. L., and Campbell, A. R. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 189, 1008-1016). Up until now, however, only limited attention has been paid to the use of recombinant photoproteins for measuring, in mammalian cells, the [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm, a compartment for which effective Ca2+ probes are already available. Here we describe this approach in detail, highlighting the advantages, under various experimental conditions, of using recombinant cytosolic aequorin (cytAEQ) instead of classical fluorescent indicators. We demonstrate that cytAEQ is expressed recombinantly at high levels in transiently transfected cell Lines and primary cultures as well as in stably transfected clones, and we describe a simple algorithm for converting aequorin luminescence data into [Ca2+] values. We show that although fluorescent indicators at the usual intracellular concentrations (50-100 mu M) are associated with a significant buffering of the [Ca2+](c) transients, this problem is negligible with recombinantly expressed aequorin. The large dynamic range of the photoprotein also allows an accurate estimate of the large [Ca2+](c) increases that are observed in some cell types such as neurons. Finally, cytAEQ appears to be an invaluable tool for measuring [Ca2+](c) in cotransfection experiments. In particular, we show that when cotransfected with an alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation), cytAEQ faithfully monitors the subpopulation of cells expressing the receptor, whereas the signal of fura-2, at the population level, is dominated largely by that of the untransfected cells.

AB  - A clear divide typically exists between freshwater and marine microbial communities, with transitional communities found in estuarine zones. The estuarine communities can derive from inflowing rivers and the sea via tidal mixing and incursions or be comprised of unique brackish species, depending on flow regimes and retention time within an estuary. Only a few studies have been carried out in the Arctic, where moderate salinities associated with the influence of seasonal ice melt could potentially favor marine microbes adapted to lower salinities in fresh-to-saltwater transition zones irrespective of river flows and tidal mixing. To test this idea, we examined early summer microbial communities in 2 western Hudson Bay (Canada) river-to-sea systems: the Churchill and Nelson river systems. Both rivers originate from the same headwaters, suggesting similar catchment conditions, but differ in geomorphology and hydroelectric diversions that induce very different flow and stratification regimes. Using amplicons of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, we identified distinct riverine bacterial communities that were significantly different from the 2 associated estuaries and offshore communities. In the much smaller Churchill Estuary, the microbial community showed a marked influence of freshwater microbial species, along with marine influences. In contrast, in the larger high-flow Nelson River Estuary, riverine bacterioplankton were less evident in the estuary, where the marine signal was much stronger. The marine samples in both systems differed somewhat consistently with the phenology of the phytoplankton bloom in the Bay and tended to harbor distinct attached and free-living bacterial communities. Our results highlight the relevance of river flow and estuarine circulation on selection of bacterial species in estuaries, with ecological implications for food web functionality and biogeochemical cycles in the Anthropocene, where flow regimes would be affected by larger climatic variability.

AB  - Background: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. It refers to a subjective feeling of dissatisfaction with sleep duration and quality that affects social functioning, even though there are appropriate opportunities and environments for sleep. The disease for a long time can easily cause physical and mental fatigue, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia can worsen the condition. Acupuncture and Tuina therapy has been widely used in the treatment of chronic insomnia, and this study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of acupuncture plus Tuina in the treatment of chronic insomnia to clarify its efficacy. Methods: The following databases will be searched: Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Medline databases. In addition, we will also collect 4 databases of China: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database, and Wan-fang Database. We selected eligible studies published up to October 2021. We used Review Manager 5.4, provided by the Cochrane Collaborative Network for statistical analysis. Clinical randomized controlled trials related to acupuncture plus Tuina for chronic insomnia were included in this study. Language is limited to both Chinese and English languages. Study selection, data extraction, and study quality assessment were independently performed by 2 researchers. We then assessed the quality and risk of the included studies and observed the outcome indicators. Results: This study provides a high-quality synthesis to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus Tuina for treating chronic insomnia. Conclusion: This systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether acupuncture plus Tuina is an effective and safe intervention for patients with chronic insomnia. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol of the systematic review does not require ethical approval because it does not involve humans. This article will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences. Registration number: INPLASY2021100115

AB  - More wood for technical valorization is to be expected in Europe over the coming years, due to climate change and the bark beetle. To further independence from fossil-fuel resources a novel approach to the base-catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) of organosolv lignin into monomers and oligomers, while maximizing yields and minimizing coke formation, was scaled up in a theoretical wood-based biorefinery with a yearly input of 40 000 t of wood chips. Other process steps were modeled from the literature. A novel work-up approach was evaluated under laboratory conditions, implemented, and compared with a simulation-based pervaporation technique. The life-cycle assessment (LCA) showed that the biorefinery provided a significantly lower global warming potential (GWP) (excluding biogenic carbon) than its fossil counterparts. Moreover, the majority of impacts on the other midpoint categories was also smaller than for the fossil reference. However, after allocating the GWPs, it was evident that subsequent conversion of the C6 fraction to value-added products is necessary for optimal results. The discounted cash flow analyses for the biorefinery setups (40 to 400 kt year(-1)) showed that they were not profitable with prices based on fossil references. However, when using higher prices/t from the literature, such as euro1615 for monomers, euro2000 for oligomers, and euro510 for C6 sugars, a positive net present value could be reached at approximately 100 000-120 000 t processed annually. Hence, the conclusion was that a biorefinery utilizing wood not only brings environmental benefits and a reduction in the use of fossil resources but can also be financially beneficial.

AB  - The determination of crop water status has positive effects on the Chinese Brassica industry and irrigation decisions. Drought can decrease the production of Chinese Brassica, whereas over-irrigation can waste water. It is desirable to schedule irrigation when the crop suffers from water stress. In this study, a random forest model was developed using sample data derived from meteorological measurements including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and photosynthetic active radiation (Par) to predict the lower baseline (Twet) and upper baseline (Tdry) canopy temperatures for Chinese Brassica from 27 November to 31 December 2020 (E1) and from 25 May to 20 June 2021 (E2). Crop water stress index (CWSI) values were determined based on the predicted canopy temperature and used to assess the crop water status. The study demonstrated the viability of using a random forest model to forecast Twet and Tdry. The coefficients of determination (R-2) in E1 were 0.90 and 0.88 for development and 0.80 and 0.77 for validation, respectively. The R-2 values in E2 were 0.91 and 0.89 for development and 0.83 and 0.80 for validation, respectively. Our results reveal that the measured and predicted CWSI values had similar R-2 values related to stomatal conductance (~0.5 in E1, ~0.6 in E2), whereas the CWSI showed a poor correlation with transpiration rate (~0.25 in E1, ~0.2 in E2). Finally, the methodology used to calculate the daily CWSI for Chinese Brassica in this study showed that both Twet and Tdry, which require frequent measuring and design experiment due to the trial site and condition changes, have the potential to simulate environmental parameters and can therefore be applied to conveniently calculate the CWSI.

AB  - The wetlands of the New Jersey Pine Barrens (USA) have historically been utilized for large-scale cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) farming. In 2003, 3800 hectares of retired cranberry farm became the focus of restoration efforts by the New Jersey Conservation Foundation with the goal of returning much of its 2000 hectares of wetlands to the previous condition as Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thoides) swamp. Two different agricultural strategies had previously been employed throughout the farm: traditional- minimal soil and hydrological modification, and modernized- intensive management with soil replacement and major hydrological modification. During restoration, three different strategies were employed: hydrological restoration only, hydrological restoration with microtopographic modification, and hydrological restoration with microtopographic modification and planting of C. thyoides. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of these strategies on vegetation establishment a decade after restoration was initiated. Replicate nested quadrats were established at each study site, and vegetation was surveyed in both June and August of 2017. All restoration strategies produced robust plant assemblages with similar diversity and quality to each other and to the reference sites. However, the assemblages were set apart by their unique indicator species. Our results also suggest that planting C. thyoides seedlings may give the species selective advantage in a competitive successional setting. According to NMDS ordination, plant assemblages at restored sites were significantly different from reference sites; only continued monitoring will allow us to determine where their successional paths will lead. This study has important implications for future restoration projects in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and similar ecosystems, especially because the results suggest that as long as hydrological restoration occurs, this can promote the establishment of robust, diverse, and relatively high-quality plant assemblages.

AB  - Study Region: The Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes basin is found in the main Ethiopian Rift Valley system.
   Study Focus: Understanding the hydrological impact of El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is of a paramount importance for society since it substantially affects the environmental and socioeconomic conditions. The relation between ENSO indicators (SOI, MEI and Ni (n) over tilde o3.4) and streamflow magnitude was statistically evaluated with partial correlation, cross correlation, extreme streamflow indices and streamflow deficits to provide empirical evidence on how ENSO phases (La Ni (n) over tildea and El Ni (n) over tildeo) affect streamflow variability. Trends of streamflow and ENSO indicators were tested using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test.
   New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Our findings indicate that the partial correlation between the catchment area and ENSO effect on streamflow were not statistically significant at p < 0.05 after removing the south-north gradient. The direction of the ENSO effect is spatially inconsistent since El Ni<(n)over tilde>o (La Ni (n) over tildea) causes positive deviation in some catchments and negative deviation for other catchments. Though statistically insignificant, reduced flow is detected for many catchments during El Ni (n) over tildeo years. For most catchment, the extreme high flow has a larger magnitude during La Ni (n) over tildea than El Ni (n) over tildeo whereas the extreme low flow has a larger magnitude during El Ni (n) over tildeo than La Ni (n) over tildea years. Overall, the relationship between ENSO and streamflow of the study area is found spatially inconsistent and statistically insignificant for most catchments.

AB  - This study characterizes the impacts of transported peat-forest (PF) burning smoke on an urban environment and evaluates associated source burning conditions based on carbon properties of PM2.5 at the receptor site. We developed and validated a three-step classification that enables systematic and more rapid identification of PF smoke impacts on a tropical urban environment with diverse emissions and complex atmospheric processes. This approach was used to characterize over 300 daily PM2.5 data collected during 2011-2013, 2015 and 2019 in Singapore. A levoglucosan concentration of >= 0.1 mg/m(3) criterion indicates dominant impacts of transported PF smoke on urban fine aerosols. This approach can be used in other ambient environments for practical and location-dependent applications. Organic carbon (OC) concentrations (as OC indicator) can be an alternate to levoglucosan for assessing smoke impacts on urban environments. Applying the OC concentration indicator identifies smoke impacts on similar to 80% of daily samples in 2019 and shows an accuracy of 51-86% for hourly evaluation. Following the systematic identification of urban PM2.5 predominantly affected by PF smoke in 2011-2013, 2015 and 2019, we assessed the concentration ratio of char-EC/soot-EC as an indicator of smoldering- or flaming-dominated burning emissions. When under the influence of transported PF smoke, the mean concentration ratio of char-EC to soot-EC in urban PM2.5 decreased by >70% from 8.2 in 2011 to 2.3 in 2015 but increased to 3.8 in 2019 (p < 0.05). The reversed trend with a 65% increase from 2015 to 2019 shows stronger smoldering relative to flaming, indicating a higher level of soil moisture at smoke origins, possibly associated with rewetting and revegetating peatlands since 2016.

AB  - A country's competitiveness depends primarily on its economic development which in turn is affected by a number of factors. Some of these, such as investment, favorable business conditions, legal environment, etc., promote economic development, while others, such as low labor productivity, insufficient staff qualification that fails to meet the requirements of the labor market, etc., slow down the pace of economic development. The latter category describes the phenomenon of the shadow economy (SE). Research into shadow economies is dominated by the analysis of the local impact factors. Nevertheless, the results of such analyses do not reveal the general patterns of the shadow economy, without the knowledge of which it is difficult to develop effective preventive measures. The basic determinants of the shadow economy must first and foremost reflect national economic development, as these particular determinants have the most significant impact on the size of the phenomenon of the shadow economy. National economic development can be expressed by employing various indicators, but recently it has most commonly been expressed by GDP per capita. GDP reflects national competitiveness, integrates a number of domestic factors, and is easily accessible and publicly available in national and international statistical sources. In addition, this indicator is calculated by employing a unified methodology, which makes it universal, allowing the comparison of countries in different situations. As presented in this article, the analysis of the relationship between economic development and the size of the shadow economy allows the division of all the EU member states into characteristic groups by the level of their economic development as well as size of the country's SE. Our research attempts to reveal the regularity of the above-mentioned relationship: the higher the level of national economic development, the lower the size of the shadow economy.

AB  - The Anzali wetland (located in northern Iran) and many parts of its catchment are considered important habitats for the swan mussel (Anodonta cygnea). The habitat of this native bioindicator mussel is being threatened in many locations of the catchment due to various anthropogenic activities. The present study aimed to apply a classification tree model (J48 algorithm) to predict the habitat preferences of A. cygnea in 12 sampling sites based on various water quality and physical-habitat variables. The species was present in 50% of sampling sites, while it was absent in the remaining of the sampling sites. In total, 144 samples of A. cygnea (72 presence and 72 absence instances) were monthly measured together with the abiotic variables during 1-year study period (2017-2018). For the CT model, two-thirds of datasets (96 instances) served as a training and the remainder was employed for the validation set (48 instances). Among 25 environmental variables introduced to the model (with pruning confidence factor=0.10, threefold cross-validation and 5 times randomization effort), the validity of 6 variables was confirmed by the model in all three subsets. Water salinity, flow velocity, water depth and water turbidity were jointly predicted by the model in three subsets. The model predicted that the absence of A. cygnea might be associated with increasing flow velocity, total phosphate and water turbidity. In contrast, the presence of A. cygnea might be related to decreased water depth and increased calcium concentration. The model also confirmed that all predicted variables for the species might be completely dependent on the water salinity. According to the chi-square test (x(2)=26.53, p<0.05), the habitat condition of A. cygnea is influenced by significant variations in the spatio-temporal patterns.

AB  - Evaluation of aggregate formation in no-till farming systems and the effects on soil organic matter can provide relevant insights into soil carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and soil susceptibility to erosion. However, there is little information on the soil aggregate formation pathways in no-till systems. This study aimed to investigate the effect of no-tillage duration on soil aggregates and soil organic matter compared with undisturbed soil in the rainy and dry season. The following experimental sites were analyzed: NT2 (no-till management for 7 years), NT14 (no-till management for 14 years), NT23 (no-till management for 23 years) and AF, a preserved fragment of Atlantic Forest (reference area). Aggregate formation pathway was analysed/described according to the morphological pattern using a stereo microscope (LEICA M125), in magnification ranges between 20x and 40 x. Physical fractionation of organic matter was carried out by granulometric size separation, and humic substances were separated into humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions by differential solubility. No-till management affected the dynamics of soil aggregation and organic matter fractions. In the long term, no-till farming reduced biological aggregation (52.5 +/- 4.5 % in AF to 19.2 +/- 3.1 % in NT23), and increased physicochemical aggregation (21,2 +/- 2.1 % in AF to 47.2 +/- 5.1 % in NT23), may be because the traffic-induced compaction resulting from seeding. However, over the years, no-till farming increased soil particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) and humin contents because of the constant input of crop residues to surface layers. Our results suggest that the morphological classification analysis of soil aggregates was sensitive to changes in land use over time, consisting as an indicator practical, affordable, repeatable, and easily understood and interpreted, which may be used to ascertain changes in physical soil conditions.

AB  - The paper is devoted to identifying patterns of activity of Russian universities in the national innovation ecosystem. Decisions on the development of innovative activity, effective commercialization and implementation of scientific developments are substantiated in strategic documents of state development. In fact the level of innovative security of a country, the state of protection of national interests of the state from internal and external threats arising from the conditions of innovative development, depends to a large extent on the success of the implementation of scientific and development projects. The leading higher education institutions are entrusted with the task of becoming centers of regional innovation ecosystems, transforming universities into active participants of socio-economic and innovative development. Official statistics on national research universities of the Russian Federation have been used in order to identify patterns of the activity of higher education institutions in this area. An analysis of the changes in the analyzed indicators has made it possible to single out universities that implement the most promising models of scientific activity management in terms of world experience. These are primarily universities for which there is a positive relative increase in indicators of total R&D, the share of extra-budgetary funds in university income from R&D, and the share of income from R&D in total income. It has been established that the current stage of development of universities is characterized by the presence of both competitive advantages and challenges that form the features of their modernization. The response to the challenges should be the creation of a business model of the University 4.0 activity which includes new technologies, products and services that are in demand in the country.

AB  - Residents living in the vicinity of airports are exposed to noise from departing and approaching aircraft. Noise may be reduced by introducing novel aircraft technologies into vehicle retrofit, aircraft design and flight procedures. Nowadays, noise assessment and communication of noise are accomplished using conventional noise indicators that consider neither the perception of sound, nor its health effects. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a more comprehensive approach that supports the movement for perception-influenced design in order to reduce the negative environmental impacts and adverse health effects caused by increased air traffic noise. By means of auralization (the acoustical counterpart of visualization), possible future changes can be evaluated by considering the human perception of sound. In this study, in a virtual acoustic environment flyovers of different aircraft types and flight procedures are auralized for ground-based receiver locations, and subsequently evaluated in a psychoacoustic laboratory experiment with respect to short-term noise annoyance. Flight approaches of an existing reference aircraft, a possible low-noise retrofitted vehicle and a future low-noise vehicle design were simulated along standard and tailored flight procedures. To create realistic listening experiences of synthetic flyovers, auralization technologies were further developed regarding source synthesis, transitions between aircraft conditions, sound propagation effects and immersive sound reproduction. Listening experiments revealed significant annoyance reductions for low-noise aircraft types and tailored flight procedures, and that maximum benefit is achieved by the combined optimization of aircraft design and flight procedure. Further, it is shown that spatially distributed receivers need to be considered for a reliable low-noise aircraft technology evaluation. The reduction potential in terms of perceived noise by retrofitting current vehicles and designing new vehicle architectures is thus demonstrated. These findings suggest applying the proposed comprehensive approach to effectively reduce the impact of perceived air traffic noise in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The scientific novelty of the research is that for the first time differences in the conditions and characteristics of the ignition and burning of droplets of slurries prepared on the basis of coals and waste from their enrichment have been established. The practical significance of the research results is that they illustrate the prospects of utilization of the numerous coal enrichment wastes by combustion in the composition of aqueous slurries with the generation of a rather large amount of energy and a relatively small negative environmental impact. The most significant characteristics were compared: the limiting (minimum) temperature; the ignition delay times; the maximum combustion temperature; the concentration of the main gas anthropogenic emissions. It has been found that fuel mixtures prepared from wet waste of coal flotation are characterized by higher inertia and ignition temperatures compared to slurries with high-quality coal dust. However, the established differences considering the availability and low cost of filter cakes illustrate the prospects of waste derived fuel combustion. The combustion heat of the investigated slurries based on coal and filter cake with addition of petroleum products differs by no more than 5-30%. The average difference between the duration of ignition for fuel droplets based on dust and filter cake of coking and low-caking coals is about 20%. At that the addition of waste turbine oil (10% wt.) into the filter cake reduces the duration of ignition by 12-25% and the ignition temperature - by 10-15 degrees C without a significant increase in anthropogenic gas emissions. The difference between the minimum ignition temperatures of coal and waste coal based slurries was from 10 degrees C to 80 degrees C. On environmental and economic indicators, coal waste is more attractive than coal. (C) 2018 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article proposes a new methodological approach using a combination of expert knowledge-based (analytic hierarchy process, AHP), bivariate (statistical index, SI) and multivariate (linear discriminant analysis, LDA) models for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Mazandran Province, Iran. Tolerance and variance inflation factor indicators were used for assessing multi-collinearity among parameters, and three (i.e. profile curvature, soil type and topography wetness index) of 18 factors were eliminated because of multi-collinearity issues. Fifteen geo-environmental conditioning factors including elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, plan curvature, slope length, convergence index, stream power index, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, distance from fault, lithology, rainfall, land use/landcover and normalized difference vegetation index and 321 landslide locations (testing data set, 70% of total landslides) were used for modeling. The importance of factors showed that distance to road (AHP = 0.201, LDA = 0.301) was the most important factor in landslide occurrence. The validation results using validation data set (138 landslide locations, 30% of total landslides) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the ensemble models AHP-LDR (83%), AHP-SI (95%) and SI-LDR (83%) had higher prediction accuracies than the individual AHP (82%), SI (82%) and LDA (79%) models and combination of AHP and SI models along with ALOS-PALSAR remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) technique provide powerful tool in LSM in the study area. The results of proposed novel methodological framework can be used by decision-makers and forest engineers for forest management spatially forest roads conservation that have key importance in sustainable development in local and regional scales.

AB  - The pH-dependent availability and leaching of major and trace elements was investigated for a wide range of biomass ash from different fuels and conversion technologies. A technical and environmental assessment of selected biomass ash for application in soil or cement mortars was performed, using both the total content and leaching of elements. A large variation in biomass ash composition, yet consistent pH dependent leaching patterns were observed for most elements and conversion technologies. Chromium showed a distinct behaviour which was hypothesized to reflect redox conditions during conversion of the biomass.
   The leaching based approach was found to provide a more realistic assessment of the availability of desired (i.e. nutrients) and undesired elements (i.e. contaminants) in soil systems. When applied to a reference soil at a rate of 2% by weight, the selected biomass ash increased the concentration of particularly Cr, Mo and Zn in soil solution to a level of concern. For cement applications, the release of Ba, Cr and Mo can become of concern during the second life stage, but the release was not attributed to the included biomass ash.
   Both soil and cement matrixes were found to control the release of elements such as Cu, V and Ni (soil) and As, Cr and Mo (cement) when compared to the released from pure biomass ash, underlining the importance of evaluating the availability and leaching of desired and undesired elements in the application scenario.
   Given current regulatory criteria, beneficial utilization of biomass ash in cement may be more feasible than in soil, but regulatory criteria based on leaching rather than total content of elements may widen the application potential of biomass ash. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid industrialization and urbanization, China's mainland coasts have witnessed an increasing challenge of sustainable development. Policy-making and management in coastal development also need an in-depth understanding of long term land use changes. Historically, coastal land use and its policy in China experienced a complex and tortuous evolution from the preindustrial era to modern times. However, there is a lack of detailed treatment in previous studies, about the issues of the policy response to environmental and social-economic conditions. Using an approach of historical document analysis and multidisciplinary synthesis, based on the case from the Jiangsu coast, we explore the land use changes and its policy response for China's mainland coasts on a centennial time scale. The results show that the land use policy had different performances in response to the changes of environment and social-economy at different stages, with a dynamic shift from passive to active response. During the 18-19th centuries, the management framework was associated with the monopolized land use policy that was dominated by the government's interests of salt industry; there were few initiatives to take into account the environment changes and stakeholder conflicts. Yet, during the 20th century, the emphasis of the policy was placed on reclamation and diversified industry, reflecting the pressure from the coastal environment change and social-economic situation. At the same time, the adjustment of land use policy became more frequent. Population growth and physical environment change are the two major driving forces for the observed shifts. The study on the long term change of land use and policy response for China's mainland coasts may provide a reference frame to be considered for future sustainable development and adaptation.

AB  - Characterization of the sedimentary organic matter (SOM) within an intermittently open coastal lagoon in SE Uruguay was carried out using optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM), stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and mineralogical properties of the sedimentary pool were assessed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Additionally, chemical and biological variables including total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll-a in water and sediments, and benthic diatoms were analyzed. Potential sources of SOM (e.g., marine and riverine phytoplankton, terrestrial plant material) and fauna were collected during summer, autumn, and winter from seaward (South) to landward (North) zones. In the pore water, the high contribution of fluorescent, protein-like components, the delta C-13 values of sediments (-22% to -16 parts per thousand), and the low C/N ratios of sediments (similar to 7), indicate the dominant source of SOM is marine microalgae (benthic/planktonic, tychoplanktonic). Most of the diatom species recorded in the sediments were benthic marine/brackish species including the polyhaline species Pseudopodosira echinus. Furthermore, FTIR spectra showed higher contributions of quartz, carbonates, and feldspar towards the seaward zones. Clay minerals increase towards landward zones, indicating changes in the hydrodynamic energy within the lagoon with greater overall rates of sediment deposition in landward zones. In shallow systems, active resuspension and mixing conditions may help to explain spatial similarities in the composition of the sedimentary pool. The combined use of stable isotopes, FTIR, diatoms and nutrient measurements (rather than single approaches) represents an alternative comprehensive tool to infer information on the composition and sources contributing to the sedimentary pool.

AB  - The important role of spatial scale in exploring the geography of poverty as well as its policy implications has been noticed but with limited knowledge. To improve such limited understanding, we mainly investigated the spatial patterns and influencing factors of rural poverty (indicated by poor population and poverty incidence) at three different administrative levels in the Liupan Mountain Region, one of the fourteen poorest regions in China. Our results show that from a global perspective, poor areas are clustered significantly at the county-, township-, and village-level, and more greatly at a lower level. Locally, there is spatial mismatch among poverty hotspots detected not only by the same indicator at different levels but also by different indicators at the same level. A scale effect can be found in the influencing factors of rural poverty. That is, the number of significant factors increases, but the degree of their association with poverty incidence decreases at a lower level. Such scale effect indicates that poverty incidence at lower levels may be affected by more complex factors, including not only the new local ones but also the already appeared non-local ones at higher levels. However, the natural conditions tend to play a scale-independent role to poverty incidence. In response to such scale-dependent patterns and factors, anti-poverty policies can be 1) a multilevel monitoring system to reduce incomplete or even misleading single-level information and understanding; 2) the village-based targeting strategy to increase the targeting efficiency and alleviate the mentioned spatial mismatch; 3) more flexible strategies responding to the local impoverishing factors, and 4) different task emphasises for multilevel policymakers to achieve the common goal of poverty reduction.

AB  - The emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) from soils are of significant importance for global warming. The biological and physico-chemical characteristics of soil affect the GHG emissions from soils of different land use types. Methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) production rates from six forest and agricultural soil types in the Koteshwar hydropower reservoir catchments located in theUttarakhand, India, were estimated and their relations with physico-chemical characteristics of soils were examined. The samples of different land use types were flooded and incubated under anaerobic condition at 30 degrees C for 60 days. The cumulativeGHGproduction rates in reservoir catchment are found as 1.52 +/- 0.26, 0.13 + 0.02, and 0.0004 + 0.0001 mu g g soil(-1) day(-1) for CO2, CH4, and N2O, respectively, which is lower than global reservoirs located in the same eco-region. The significant positive correlation between CO2 productions and labile organic carbon (LOC), CH4 andC/Nratio, whileN(2)O and N/P ratio, while pH of soils is negatively correlated, conforms their key role in GHG emissions. Carbon available asLOCinthereservoir catchmentisfoundas3-14% of the total C'' available in soils and 0-23% is retained in the soil after the completion of incubation. The key objective of thisstudyto signify theC, N, andPratios, LOC, andpHwith GHGproduction rate by creating an incubation experiment (as inthecaseofbenthic soil/sediment) inthelabfor60days. In summary, the results suggest that carbon, as LOC were more sensitive indicators forCO(2) emissions and significant C, N, and P ratios, affects theGHGemissions. This study is useful for the hydropower industry to know the GHG production rates after the construction of reservoir so that its effect could be minimized by taking care of catchment area treatment plan.

AB  - Forests are experiencing significant changes; studying geographic patterns in forests is critical in understanding the impact of forest dynamics to biodiversity, soil erosion, water chemistry and climate. Few studies have examined forest geographic pattern changes other than fragmentation; however, other spatial processes of forest dynamics are of equal importance. Here, we study forest attrition, the complete removal of forest patches, that can result in complete habitat loss, severe decline of population sizes and species richness, and shifts of local and regional environmental conditions. We aim to develop a simple yet insightful proximity-based spatial indicator capturing forest attrition that is independent of spatial scale and boundaries with worldwide application potential. Using this proximity indicator, we evaluate forest attrition across ecoregions, land ownership and urbanization stratifications across continental United States of America. Nationally, the total forest cover loss was approximately 90,400 km 2, roughly the size of the state of Maine, constituting a decline of 2.96%. Examining the spatial arrangement of this change the average FAD was 3674m in 1992 and increased by 514m or 14.0% in 2001. Simulations of forest cover loss indicate only a 10m FAD increase suggesting that the observed FAD increase was more than an order of magnitude higher than expected. Furthermore, forest attrition is considerably higher in the western United States, in rural areas and in public lands. Our mathematical model (R-2 = 0.93) supports estimation of attrition for a given forest cover. The FAD metric quantifies forest attrition across spatial scales and geographic boundaries and assesses unambiguously changes over time. The metric is applicable to any landscape and offers a new complementary insight on forest landscape patterns from local to global scales, improving future exploration of drivers and repercussions of forest cover changes and supporting more informative management of forest carbon, changing climate and species biodiversity.

AB  - Species richness and composition of bryophyte communities on two species of trees at different stages of decay were studied on 57 logs of Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica in the natural montane beech-fir forest reserve Salajka (Czech Republic). There were 68 species of bryophytes. At the stand level, the species richness recorded on Fagus was higher than that on Abies. This is due to a higher diversity of epiphytic species on Fagus in the early stages of decay, when the conditions of logs are more heterogeneous and there are more microhabitats than on Abies. The log-level species richness was higher on Abies in later stages of decay because it is more favourable for epixylic species occurring on very acid and constantly moist substrates. Both at the stand- and log level, the highest species richness was recorded at intermediate stages of decay, which constitute a transitional phase in the decay succession in which species associated with all stages of decay overlap and therefore the overall number is relatively high. Species composition differed significantly on the two trees, with two clearly defined groups of indicator species. In contrast, the different stages of decay were not so sharply distinguished in terms of indicator species. We also found significant differences in pH both between the two trees and stages of decay, which may also affect compositional patterns on the logs studied. In conclusion, the species richness and composition of bryophytes on dead wood is associated with both stage of decay and species of tree and their various combinations, which further increase the total diversity. Therefore, successful bryophyte conservation should be focused on the preservation of mixed stands and the continuity of dead wood in the montane beech-fir zone of Europe.

AB  - Use of rooftops to produce locally grown vegetables is increasing. However, due to weight restrictions, shallow substrate depths, and potential harsh environmental conditions, optimizing production can be a challenge. Standard industry practices for ornamental extensive green roofs planted with succulents or other herbaceous perennials and grasses dictate that organic matter should be less than 20% of the original substrate mix. In rooftop agriculture, however, maximizing growth and yields are usually a primary objective and the amount of organic matter incorporated into these substrates are a major factor in this equation. In this study we quantified the optimal percentage of compost in a green roof substrate for optimizing growth and yields for cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) and peppers (Capsicum annuum). The study was conducted on raised green roof platforms over a period of 19 weeks and compared six substrates containing increasing amounts of a commercial compost produced from municipal yard waste (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%) mixed with a heat-expanded shale and sand base. These treatments were also compared to a typical garden plot at ground level. Plant performance evaluations such as plant growth, chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) as an indicator of plant stress, and fruit yields were used as an indicator for optimal substrate mixtures. Generally, the addition of 60 or 80% compost resulted in the greatest plant growth and fruit yields, although compost influenced growth and yield of peppers to a greater degree than cucumbers. In addition, the ground garden plots performed poorly which emphasizes the point that growing vegetables on a rooftop can be advantage because substrates can be engineered to maximize plant health, although the same could be done with raised beds in a garden plot.

AB  - The 'cognitive capacity hypothesis' states that song complexity could potentially be used by prospective mates to assess an individual's overall cognitive ability. Several recent studies have provided support for the cognitive capacity hypothesis, demonstrating that individuals with more complex songs or larger song repertoires performed better on various learning tasks. These studies all measured individuals' learning performance in social isolation. However, for gregarious species such as the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, testing individuals in a group context is socially and ecologically more relevant if song complexity is to be a meaningful indicator of cognitive ability. We tested whether song complexity correlated with performance on a suite of novel foraging problems in flocks of male zebra finches, starting by replicating the lid-flipping task used by Boogert et al. (Animal Behaviour, 2008, 76, 1735-1741), who provided the first support for the cognitive capacity hypothesis in zebra finches isolated during testing. We also presented flocks with a barrier task and two types of novel food. We found that males' song complexity scores did not correlate with their latency to solve any of these novel foraging problems in a social context. Individuals that solved the tasks likewise did not have more complex songs than nonsolvers. However, performance was positively correlated across the different foraging tasks. These results raise doubts as to whether the song complexity measures used by Boogert et al. are predictors of problem- solving performance, and perhaps cognitive ability, in a more ecologically relevant, social setting. Stress responsiveness might instead explain the association between song complexity and foraging task performance among isolated zebra finches reported by Boogert et al.

AB  - Fecal contamination in stormwater is often complex. Because conventional fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) cannot be used to ascertain source of fecal contamination, alternative indicators are being explored to partition these sources. As they are assessed for future use, it is critical to compare alternative indicators to conventional FIB under a range of stormwater delivery conditions. In this study, conventional FIB and fecal Bacteroides spp. were monitored throughout the duration of five storm events from coastal stormwater outfalls in Dare County, North Carolina, USA to characterize relationships among FIB concentrations, alternative fecal markers, and loading of contaminants. Water samples were collected multiple times during each storm and analyzed for Enterococcus sp. and Escherichia coli using enzymatic tests and fecal Bacteroides spp. by QPCR. Both conventional FIB and fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations in stormwater were generally high and extremely variable over the course of the storm events. Over the very short distances between sites, we observed statistically significant spatial and temporal variability, indicating that stormwater monitoring based on single grab-samples is inappropriate. Loading of FIB and fecal Bacteroides spp. appeared to be affected differently by various hydrologic factors. Specifically, Spearman correlations between fecal Bacteroides spp. and drainage area and antecedent rainfall were lower than those between conventional FIB and these hydrologic factors. Furthermore, the patterns of fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations generally increased over the duration of the storms, whereas E. coli and Enterococcus sp. concentrations generally followed the patterns of the hydrograph, peaking early and tailing off. Given the greater source-specificity and limited persistence of fecal Bacteroides spp. in oxygenated environments, differences in these patterns suggest multiple delivery modes of fecal contamination (i.e. landscape scouring versus groundwater discharge).

AB  - Introduction: Productivity is usually the main and ultimate goal for most organizations. At the present time, healthcare organizations must study and assess the productivity of their employees to a greater extent than ever before. This issue can be an important concern for healthcare managers who are striving to improve quality and contain costs. The goal of this study is to determine and measure productivity indicators for employees of an Iranian military hospital.
   Methods: The study was conducted in a cross-sectional design. The target group included 150 administrative employees of the military hospital, and a questionnaire was utilized for collecting data.
   Results: The group that was studied ranked high in terms of ability, job clarity, motivation, feedback, and environmental causes and condition indicators, with scores of 3.66, 3.34, 3.38, 3.25, and 3.29 in a 1-5 score Likert scale, respectively. However, the group's score in the organizational support category was 3.00, which is considered to be an intermediate score. The group's score for decision credibility was even lower, at 2.96.
   Discussion: In the study group, most of the employees' productivity indicator scores were better than the intermediate score of 3.00, but they were still considerably lower than the ultimate level.
   The most important problems in this regard consisted of failing to adequately consider the staff's views, the staff's jobs frequently were unrelated to their educational backgrounds, the lack of written duties for each job, poor matches between workloads and salaries, lower salaries than other comparable departments, and deficiencies in the workplace.
   In summary, the key factors identified for increasing the employees' productivity were suitable organizational structure, participative management, and periodic rotation of staff between jobs, job enrichment, and equal pay for equal work.

AB  - as people become more aware of the environmental footprint of different foods, consumers may modify their diets to reduce the impact of their diets on the environment. For this to occur, it is necessary to know the impact that individual food types have on the environment. This publication presents the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as the GHG emission intensity associated with various types of poultry production in Canada for the census years 1981 to 2006. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using the methodology from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change adjusted for conditions in Canada. Direct emissions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 from birds, their facilities, and the avian crop complex, corresponding to the area used to grow the crops that feed Canadian poultry, were estimated using poultry diet surveys. Between 1981 and 2006, because of the strong growth of broiler production, GHG emissions from the poultry industry increased by 40%. The main GHG was N2O, representing approximately 57% of the total emissions. Fossil fuel CO2 accounted for approximately 38%, whereas CH4 accounted for 5%. In western Canada, GHG emission intensities decreased owing to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels associated with the adoption of reduced- and no-tillage cropping systems, whereas in eastern Canada, the reduction was due to lower N2O emissions. The emissions of all 3 GHG from turkeys decreased because of the more rapid turnover of a marketable product (shortened life span) in later census years. Compared with other Canadian meat protein commodities in 2001, poultry emitted only 47% as much GHG per unit of live weight as pork and only 10% as much GHG per unit of live weight as beef.

AB  - Caves are arguably the hottest of the biodiversity hotspots as measured by endemism and threat, yet they receive very little attention or appropriate management. Some recent investigations in China have found that up to 90% of the animals collected in caves are new to science, yet environmental assessments for development projects in karst areas rarely if ever give attention to the cave fauna.
   The lack of light, and the cave-specific conditions of humidity, air flow and source of energy have resulted in extreme adaptations among the animals living within them.
   There is no government agency or non-governmental organization (NGO) on conservation concerned with caves in China or many other countries, and although there are caving expeditions, they concentrate on exploration rather than the cave fauna.
   Disturbance by limestone quarrying, visitors, tourism infrastructure, and changes in water flow through, or from above, the cave can have devastating effects on the highly adapted and range-restricted fauna.
   Some examples of World Bank-financed development projects which have led to cave conservation are given.
   Synthesis and applications. The cave biodiversity of China and neighbouring countries is worthy of conservation and there is a huge number of nationally endemic species, most of which are unknown. Destruction or damage to caves can cause entire communities of cave species to become extinct. To address this problem, the disparate, taxon-limited specialists interested in cave fauna need to reach out to the cave exploration community, the major conservation NGOs, and the state and local conservation agencies. Those charged with the task of conserving biodiversity should give thought to how the current national protected area systems and processes manage - and fail - to address the needs of the cave fauna, and look for the means to effect the necessary changes in management, based on the peculiar ecology of caves.

AB  - Drainage ditches can be a key conduit of phosphorus (P) between agricultural soils of the Atlantic Coastal Plain and local surface waters, including the Chesapeake Bay. This study sought to quantify the effect of a common ditch management practice, sediment dredging, on fate of P in drainage ditches. Sediments from two drainage ditches that had been monitored for seven years and had similar characteristics (flow, P loadings, sediment properties) were sampled (0-5 cm) after one of the ditches had been dredged, which removed fine textured sediments (clay = 41%) with high organic matter content (85 g/kg) and exposed coarse textured sediments (clay = 15%) with low organic matter content (2.2 g/kg). Sediments were subjected to a three-phase experiment (equilibrium, uptake, and release) in recirculating 10-m-long, 0.2-m-wide, and 5-cm-deep flumes to evaluate their role as sources and sinks of P. Under conditions of low initial P concentrations in flume water, sediments from the dredged ditch released 13 times less P to the water than did sediments from the ditch that had not been dredged, equivalent to 24 mg dissolved P. However, the sediments from the dredged ditch removed 19% less P (76 mg) from the flume water when it was spiked with dissolved P to approximate long-term runoff concentrations. Irradiation of sediments to destroy microorganisms revealed that biological processes accounted for up to 30% of P uptake in the coarse textured sediments of the dredged ditch and 18% in the fine textured sediments of the undredged ditch. Results indicate that dredging of coastal plain drainage ditches can potentially impact the P buffering capacity of ditches draining agricultural soils with a high potential for P runoff.

AB  - Coal-bearing Jurassic sediments (Gresten Formation; Lower Quartzarenite Member) are discussed as source rocks for gas and minor oil in the basement of the Alpine-Carpathian frontal zone (e.g. Hoflein gas/condensate field). Core material has therefore been analysed to characterize depositional environment and source potential of the Lower Quartzarenite Member (LQM). Geochemical data from the Hoflein condensate are used to establish a source-condensate correlation.
   The LQM was deposited in a flood basin with transitions to a delta-plain environment. Coal originated in frequently flooded mires and evolved within an oxygenated and acidic environment. It is inferred from geochemical data that organic matter from aquatic macrophytes and gymnosperms contributed to coal formation. Wildfires were abundant and oxidation of plant remains occurred frequently. This resulted in the formation of dull coal with very high inertinite contents. Bituminous shales were formed in deeper waters under dysoxic conditions. Apart from abundant algae and micro-organisms, it is concluded that there was an increased contribution of higher land plants relative to macrophytes to the biomass of the shales.
   Despite high inertinite contents, coal within the LQM has a significant oil potential. Bituminous shales contain a Type III-II kerogen. According to pyrolysis-gas chromatography data, coal and shale generate a high wax paraffinic oil. The organic matter is immature to marginal mature (0.55% Rr). Bituminous shales are considered a potential source for the Hoflein condensate. Coal may be the source for gas and minor oil in the Klement Field, but is not the source for the condensate. The equivalent vitrinite reflectance of the condensate is 0.8%, suggesting condensate generation at 4-4.5 km depth. The Gresten Formation reaches this depth near its depocentres, implying southward-directed migration of the Hoflein condensate.

AB  - Myriophyllum spp. have been proposed as a new standard laboratory aquatic macrophyte test species for the registration of pesticides. The main objectives of this investigation were to determine the power of Myriophyllum sibiricum and Myriophyllum spicatum toxicity data derived from an outdoor microcosm bioassay, to evaluate the variation of 10 different aquatic plant endpoints and to calculate the minimum detectable difference for these endpoints, to determine the replication required to detect ecologically significant changes from control for these endpoints, and to make recommendations for future field studies with Myriophyllum slip. Control data from four different studies that characterized haloacetic acid toxicity with Myriophyllum slip. for durations of three to six weeks during the summer of 1999 with five treatment levels (n = 3), including control, were examined. Endpoint coefficient of variation ranged, on average, from 6 to 28%. Node number and plant length endpoints were consistently the most statistically powerful for both plant species. It was possible to detect similar to30% change from control in both endpoints with high statistical power (beta = 0.2, alpha = 0.05, n = 3). The range of minimum detectable differences was 40 to 60% for the other endpoints. Replication to detect a greater than or equal to25% change from control would require an n of 2 to 21, depending on the endpoint. Myriophyllum sibiricum had slightly lower coefficients of variation and thus required fewer replicates than M. spicatum to be statistically significantly different from control values. Variation within microcosm studies was not significantly different from that of controlled laboratory studies, implying that most of the variation observed in the field is inherent in the plants. Based on statistical sensitivity, ecological relevance, and toxicological sensitivity, we recommend using plant length and root endpoints as indicators of toxicity under field conditions.

AB  - 1. Several genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops have cleared most of the regulatory hurdles required for commercial growing in the United Kingdom. However, concerns have been expressed that their management will have negative impacts on farmland biodiversity as a result of improved control given by the new herbicide regimes of the arable plants that support farmland birds and other species of conservation value.
   2. The Farm-Scale Evaluations (FSE) project is testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the management of GMHT varieties of beet, oilseed rape and maize and that of comparable conventional varieties in their effect on the abundance and diversity of arable plants and invertebrates. The FSE also aims to estimate the magnitude and consider the implications of any differences that are found.
   3. The experimental design of the FSE is a randomized block, with two treatments allocated at random to half-fields. The target sample is around 60-75 fields for each crop, selected to represent variation of geography and intensity of management across Britain. The experimental crops are managed by commercial farmers as if under commercial conditions.
   4. Biodiversity indicators have been selected from plants and terrestrial invertebrates to identify differences between crop management regimes that may result in important ecological changes over larger scales of space and time. Field sampling is at fixed points, mainly along transects from the field boundary, starting before the crop is sown and continuing into following crops.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The FSE is best considered as an investigation into the effects of contrasting crop management regimes on farmland biodiversity, rather than a study of the effects of genetic modification. It could become a model for future studies of ecological effects of the way we use and manage agricultural land.

AB  - Depolarization of the transverse tubules of a skeletal muscle fiber initiates release of Ca2+ ions via ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channels in the adjacent junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane at triad junctions. Discrete localized Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ "sparks") detected by confocal imaging of Ca2+ indicator-containing muscle fibers may arise from the coordinated opening of a small group of RyR Ca2+ release channels, or possibly even from the opening of a single channel. These discrete Ca2+ release events originate at triad junctions and can be gated by fiber depolarization or by physiological cytosolic ligands (e.g., Ca2+ and Mg2+) in functioning muscle fibers. The global increase in myoplasmic Ca2+ during fiber depolarization appears to consist of the summation of huge numbers of Ca2+ sparks initiated during a brief time interval. Study of Ca2+ sparks thus offers a unique window into the operation of groups of SR Ca2+ release channels or individual channels within the normal structural and molecular environment of a functioning fiber. The Ca2+ release underlying a spark appears to turn on and off abruptly respectively at the start and at the peak of a spark. Under many stimuli, the frequency and/or pattern of occurrence of the Ca2+ sparks is altered, indicating changes in the closed time ( or opening rate) of the channels that initiate the sparks. In contrast, the average values of the spatio-temporal properties of the individual events generally remain unchanged, indicating constancy of channel open time and constancy of total Ca2+ efflux via the channels generating a spark. A few conditions that alter the average properties of Ca2+ sparks provide rare insights regarding the open-time of the Ca2+ channels generating the Ca2+ spark.

AB  - Domestic appliances are long-lived and relatively expensive products that come under the new EC electrical waste recovery directive. In the UK, washing machines in particular tend to be unreliable; increasing the reuse of components could improve the economics of end-of-life operations. Trends in appliance design are towards more sophisticated control and networking; this makes adding functions to record data on the use of the machines feasible. The data would also have value for life cycle environmental assessment.
   This paper reports on the development of self-contained data acquisition units for washing machines based on a microcontroller and non-volatile memory. The data has applications in design, marketing and servicing as well as end-of-life. A batch of units have been manufactured and tested on limited field trials in washing machines. Ten parameters are continuously monitored, timed and/or recorded during appliance operation; error conditions are also logged for use during servicing. The data is then downloaded, either during servicing or at end-of-life; the dynamic data from use is combined with static data from manufacture. The information system which links all parties interested in the data is the key aspect of life cycle data acquisition.
   Two models are described which evaluate the economic benefits of adding such functions to products: a steady-state model as used by previous authors who were concerned with end-of-life product treatment and a more sophisticated transient model that accurately reflects the limited life of designs. Results show that in this case, more reusable components arise from servicing rather than from end-of-life recovery of parts. The cost savings from increased reuse are also estimated to be comparable to the additional cost of the system; greater savings could well arise from the use of the use data in marketing.

AB  - For people with chronic renal insufficiency the therapeutic goal is to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease, a serious condition that can only be treated with dialysis and kidney transplantation. Although restriction of dietary protein slows the progression of renal disease somewhat, the principal treatment to slow chronic renal disease is appropriate reduction of blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents, particularly those that produce sustained, long-term reductions in proteinuria, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, not only decrease blood pressure but also preserve renal function. Clinical trials to evaluate these and other drug therapies in renal disease progression have used both "hard end points" (e.g., dialysis, transplantation, death) and intermediate end points of renal disease progression (e.g., doubling of serum creatinine concentration, reductions in proteinuria). Trials that have used hard end points typically recruited patients with advanced renal disease to demonstrate a difference in therapies within a period of 2 to 5 years. However, proteinuria reduction, along with a decrease in the time to doubling of serum creatinine in very early diabetic renal disease, could demonstrate an altered natural history of renal disease. Although hard end points are indicators of a drug's efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events or preserving renal function, they do not assess the impact of a treatment on altering the natural history of early renal disease. For clinical trials of people with all but the most advanced renal disease, use of intermediate end points of renal disease progression is the only practical option for assessment of treatment efficacy and effectiveness. Given the available data on proteinuria reduction and doubling of serum creatinine from clinical trials, these end points, taken together, appear to provide an acceptable means of assessing a treatment's impact on slowing renal disease progression.

AB  - Principles and criteria for the objective assessment of 'damage' are presented as a basis for objective discussion and to promote targeted research. The topic will be considered from three different viewpoints-theoretical background, silviculture, and nature conservation. Examples of methods to assess 'damage' are given, as are the criteria and indicators for target values for growing stock.
   The objective existence of damage must be established by comparing the current status against a target. Only if the present status no longer permits achievement of the desired target can damage be claimed. The same is true for verification of 'benefit' resulting from an impact leading to a favorable status. Establishing the degree of browsing damage on forest regeneration allows forecasts of damage to be made, but the actual damage can only be determined at a future time, for example when the timber is harvested or when the function of the forest is seen to have been compromised. The earlier the forecast is made the more uncertain it is, because the compensatory responses of the forest can only be forecast to a limited extent. Silvicultural targets depend on the requirements of both, the forest owner and the public. Main indicators for assessing ungulate damage on forest regeneration are total tree density, species composition, and height structure. From the viewpoint of nature conservation the determination of target values is particularly difficult. The measurement of damage involves choosing the most relevant indicators of favorable condition of woodland habitats and assessing these in the field. With adequate resources this can be done quantitatively using a wide range of standard field measurement techniques. Alternatively, where: resources are limited, it can be done qualitatively by scoring different areas for a range of indicators. As yet, such qualitative methods are in their infancy. Specific research is now being undertaken in some European countries. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lung Lining fluid antioxidants represent a potentially important protective barrier of lung epithelial cells to damaging effects of air pollutants, yet no information is apparently available concerning lung lining fluid antioxidants in broilers. Therefore, goals of this study were to establish uric acid, ascorbic acid, reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, and protein concentrations in lung lining fluid obtained from male broiler chickens maintained for 6 to 7 wk within environmentally controlled rooms (Control) or chronically exposed to high levels of dust and ammonia within a broiler rearing house (House). The entire respiratory tract was carefully removed following an overdose of anesthetic and lavage fluid was collected after flushing the lungs with heparin-saline (10 mt per lung). There was no difference in GSH, but GSSG, uric acid, and protein concentrations were higher in House birds than in Controls. An increase in the GSSG to total glutathione (GSx) ratio, an indicator of oxidative Stress, was also observed in birds maintained in the House environment. Ascorbic acid was not detected in House-reared birds and detected in only 4 of 12 Controls. Regression analysis revealed positive correlations between lung lining fluid protein and uric acid (r = 0.71; P < 0.01), protein and GSSG (r = 0.73; P < 0.01), and uric acid and GSSG concentrations (r = 0.69, P < 0.01). Additionally, GSSG was positively correlated (r = 0.66; P < 0.01) with the right ventricular weight ratio, an index commonly used in identifying the development of pulmonary hypertension syndrome In broilers. These data, the first to document lung lining fluid antioxidants in avian species, indicate an oxidative stress can be detected in fluid of broilers exposed to high levels of dust and ammonia in a simulated poultry house environment.

AB  - Two enteric pathogens, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica, and the indicator bacterium Eschericiha coli, were investigated for survival in autoclaved lake water and susceptibility to chlorine at 4 and 10 degrees C. In addition, survival of Y, enterocolitica was investigated in oligotrophic lake water. The 3-log reduction (99.9% inactivation) time for Y enterocolitica in lake water was 17-18 days at 4 degrees C and 14-15 days at 10 degrees C. After exposure to 0.2 mg/l Cl-2 a 3-log reduction was obtained for C.jejuni in 10-15 s, for Y. enterocolitica in 20-180 s, and for E, coli in 20-25 s, depending on bacterial strain, plasmid content and temperature. The same reduction of C. jejuni was obtained with 0.02-0.04 mg/l of free chlorine in 12 min at 4 degrees C and 2 min at 10 degrees C. These results indicate that C, jejuni is more sensitive to chlorine than most other waterborne pathogens and E, coli, indicating that it may easily be controlled by present disinfection practices. Y. enterocolitica is about as sensitive to chlorine as E. coli, but may survive for a longer time in cold, clean surface waters. E. coli is an adequate indicator for C. jejuni both in water sources and in chlorinated drinking water. E. coli, however, is not a safe indicator for the presence of Y. enterocolitica O:3 under all conditions, and especially not in oligotrophic lake water. Furthermore, the results for Y. enterocolitica O:3 indicate an association between enhanced resistance to chlorine and the presence of a virulence plasmid. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - The quality demands of those working with cement and the desire of the cement producer to produce cement cost-effectively at a high quality level taking into account the environmental compatibility of the production process and of the product are closely interlinked, and will continue interlinked in the future to influence the entire process technology of cement manufacture. The demand for market-orientated high-performance cements is leading to quite a large number of cements with specific properties which are aimed at a particular area of application. Depending on the application, these demands are met by pure Portland cements with different finenesses and particle size distributions or by cements with different, and differing proportions of interground additives. Against this background the selection of the raw materials and fuels for producing the Portland cement clinker and of the interground additives used must be guided by the structural properties of the cement and by the environmental compatibility of the production process and of the cement. When intergrinding a cement with several main constituents the differing grindabilities of the individual components are of critical importance. The required cement properties can be obtained accurately by varying the additives, the proportion of additives and/or the cement fineness. The production of cement with several main constituents by separate grinding of the individual components followed by mixing places high demands on the homogeneity and uniformity of the intermediate products. When mixing intermediate products of flour fineness with defined and generated particle size distributions the cement properties can only be influenced further by changes in the percentages of the individual components. The particle size distributions of the individual intermediate products must therefore be matched very carefully to one another Under these conditions it is possible to produce cements of higer quality with a lower expenditure of grinding energy than for intergrinding.

AB  - There is a growing societal demand to increase the use of forest biomass for substitution of fossil fuels. The production of this biomass must be sustainable and an indicator for critical biomass harvesting (CBH) has been suggested in order to sustain forest soil fertility and mitigate soil acidification at whole-tree harvesting. The CBH indicator is based on an acidity mass balance approach in line with the critical load of acid deposition (CL) concept. Countries like Sweden, the Netherlands and the state of Quebec, Canada apply such mass balance approaches for developing forest biomass harvesting guidelines. The implementation of this type of policy instrument may restrict the use of harvest residues for bioenergy and thereby the substitution of fossil fuels. It may as well affect the forestry sector revenue negatively. To maintain credibility for enforced limitations, it is important that the risk assessment and suggested policy implications are based on solid scientific methods and assumptions. The mass balance approach have been criticized for being too uncertain and not sufficiently validated for being used to guide ecosystem management. In this paper we use published Swedish data on soils, acid deposition, forest production and information from international scientific literature to critically examine the CBH indicator. We conclude that the CBH indicator 1) does not account for all relevant processes 2) it exaggerates the sensitivity and correlates poorly to actual forest soil acid-base status and edaphic conditions and 3) data availability does not allow the indicator to be calculated at a high enough spatial resolution for advice on management for forest owners. The concerns for the mass-balance approach and CBH indicator are discussed in an international perspective.

AB  - Mosses are one of the best bioindicators in the assessment of atmospheric aerosol pollution by heavy metals. Studies using mosses allow both short- and long-term air quality monitoring. The increasing contamination of the environment (including air) is causing a search for new, cheap and effective methods of monitoring its condition. Once such method is the use of mosses in active biomonitoring. The aim of the study was to assess the atmospheric aerosol pollution with selected heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) from the smoke of fireworks used during New Year's Eve in the years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021. In studies a biomonitoring moss-bag method with moss Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. genus Pleurozium was used. The research was conducted in the town Proszkow (5 km in south direction from Opole, opolskie voivodship, Poland). The moss was exposed 14 days before 31 December (from 17 to 30 of December), on New Year's Eve (31 December and 1 January) and 2 weeks after the New Year (from 2-15 January). Higher concentrations of analysed elements were determined in samples exposed during New Year's Eve. Increases in concentrations were demonstrated by analysis of the Relative Accumulation Factor (RAF). The results indicate that the use of fireworks during New Year's Eve causes an increase in air pollution with heavy metals. In addition, it was shown that the COVID-19 induced restrictions during New Year's Eve 2020 resulted in a reduction of heavy metal content in moss samples and thus in lower atmospheric aerosol pollution with these analytes. The study confirmed moss usefulness in monitoring of atmospheric aerosol pollution from point sources.

AB  - The effects of wastewater infrastructure construction on regional and local environments is unknown. This project evaluated the effects of such projects in Monroe County, Florida, an area that had undergone regional wastewater infrastructure improvements. We used fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliform and enterococci), as a proxy indicator of beach water quality for an 18-year period of record. At the highest level of aggregation, FIBs for all 17 beaches within the county were combined to evaluate trends on a yearly basis. At the lower level, yearly FIB trends were evaluated for each beach separately. FIB data on infrastructure project period (categorical variables: before, during, and after construction), and the influences of environmental conditions (quantitative variables of rainfall and temperature) were also evaluated. In the multiple regression models, enterococci and fecal coliform were significantly associated with rainfall (24 h, p < 0.0001) and water temperature (p < 0.0001) when only the quantitative variables were considered. When both categorical and quantitative variables were considered, project period was significant for enterococci (p < 0.0001) and fecal coliform (p < 0.0001), as was 24 h lagged rainfall. Overall, the most significant factors for both fecal coliform and enterococci were rainfall and project period. Considering all beaches, infrastructure projects seem to have the collective desired effects in the years following construction, as there were decreased FIBs measured at beach sites. Only through the aggregation of all projects and measurements at all beach sites could the decreases in FIB levels be observed. Local analysis is needed to explain anomalies from these general trends for specific beaches. This understanding of FIBs, their responses to environmental and project factors, and the need for aggregated and local site analysis can provide guidance to managers at other locations with similar issues of failing wastewater infrastructure and frequent FIB exceedances.

AB  - Structural efficiency in mechanical systems has strongly targeted economic optimization and structural safety. Understanding the response of materials under adverse conditions is essential for designing a safe project. Oil and natural gas industry in deep waters has been facing enormous scientific and technological challenges. Dissimilar welds application on these industries is extensive and routine. After many years of successful service, a series of catastrophic failures have recently been reported during service [Burk; Ribardo, 2010; Haldorsen; Dodge, 2017], in special the AISI 8630 - alloy 625 combination. These facts have signalized a root lack of understanding of these failures that occurred around the dissimilar welded joint fusion line. Although numerous articles have been published in recently, mechanisms of this phenomena are not yet well defined. This work, whose central motivation emerges from the need to provide information about mechanisms of the crack tip behavior in order to mitigate technical engineering problems arising from deep-water exploration, it aimed to investigate the growth of cracks (from the perspective of fracture mechanics) located in a dissimilar welded joint (DWJ) frequently used (ASTM A-36, Inconel 625 and AISI 8630M) to join pipes in offshore oil production lines. The crack was placed 1 mm away from the fusion line of Inconel-AISI 8630M towards the AISI 8630M. The finite element method (FEM) was used to better understand the experimental results through analysis of the stress and strain fields generated during specimen loading. The FEM-based numerical analysis enabled observation of the critical stress area and the preferential plastic flow in the DWJ specimen, which the literature claims is an indicator of the crack growth path. The results obtained through the numerical analysis showed a convergent behavior in relation to the plastic flow, which was qualitatively and quantitatively in agreement with the experimental test results.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Increased frequency and intensity of drought events are predicted to occur throughout the world because of climate change. These extreme climate events result in higher tree mortality and fraction of dead woody components, phenomena that are currently being reported worldwide as critical indicators of the impacts of climate change on forest diversity and function. In this paper, we assess the accuracy and processing times of ten machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to detect dead canopy woody components.Materials and Methods:This work was conducted on five secondary dry forest plots located at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Costa Rica.Results:The coverage of dead woody components at the selected secondary dry forest plots was estimated to range from 4.8% to 16.1%, with no differences between the successional stages. Of the ten ML techniques, the support vector machine with radial kernel (SVMR) and random forests (RF) provided the highest accuracies (0.982 vs. 0.98, respectively). Of these two ML algorithms, the processing time of SVMR was longer than the processing time of RF (8735.64 s vs. 989 s).Conclusions:Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to detect and quantify dead woody components, such as dead stands and fallen trees, using a combination of high-resolution UAV data and ML algorithms. Using this technology, accuracy values higher than 95% were achieved. However, it is important to account for a series of factors, such as the optimization of the tuning parameters of the ML algorithms, the environmental conditions and the time of the UAV data acquisition.

AB  - Past Pleistocene topography of the loess uplands is rich in local sinks (closed depressions (CDs)) influencing sediment fluxes. Soil-sediment sequences from CDs constituting geoarchives where landscape changes under natural and anthropogenic conditions have been recorded. Pedo-sedimentary archives from 10 CDs in the Polish loess belt and human settlements were analysed. Phases of the Holocene evolution of the CDs were correlated with landscape dynamics in loess areas in Poland and Central Europe. Phases of infilling of CDs occurring (2) from the late Boreal/early Atlantic Period until the (middle) late Bronze Age/early Iron Age and (4) since the early Middle Ages until today were documented. These were phases of long-term soil erosion and colluviation corresponding to the increasing agricultural land use of Polish loess uplands. Phases of soil formation related to geomorphic stabilization of CDs occurred (1) from the late Vistulian until the late Boreal/early Atlantic Period and (3) from the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age until the early/high Middle Ages. These were phases of decreased soil erosion and landform conservation in a considerable part of Poland's loess areas. Pedo-sedimentary archives from the CDs have recorded soil erosion strongly related with human-induced land-use changes. The mean soil erosion rate in the catchment of CDs was 0.33 t center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) during prehistory and 4.0 t center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) during the last approximately 1000 years. Phases of CD evolution are representative for the main phases of sediment and landscape dynamics in Poland's loess areas recorded in various archives, and are not synchronous with some of these phases in Central Europe.

AB  - Biofilms are excellent bioindicators for water quality assessment because of their ability to integrate contamination, and their position at the base of the trophic chain in aquatic environments. Pesticides are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and can constantly interact with aquatic organisms, including those that make up biofilms, at fluctuating concentrations.
   The aim of this study was to describe pesticide behaviour in biofilms. Previous research highlighted that contaminant sorption was not always linear, but no study considered organic bioaccumulation isotherms and toxic impacts to biofilms concurrently. In order to characterize pesticide sorption isotherms in biofilms and the mechanisms involved in the uptake process, we simultaneously assessed bioaccumulation and toxic impact of diuron (a photosynthesis inhibiting herbicide) at the water-biofilm concentrations equilibrium. Mature biofilms grown on glass slides during one month were subsequently exposed in channels to 7 increasing concentrations of diuron from 1 to 500 mu g.L-1, plus a control condition, for 2 h with a flow velocity of 2 cm.s(-1). Then, a Langmuir isotherm equation was fitted to the bioaccumulation data, and an E-max model to toxic impact results.
   This study established that diuron bioaccumulation in biofilm is nonlinear, and allowed to calculate the Langmuir constant and maximal concentration of diuron potentially accumulated in biofilm (up to 17,771 mu g.g(-1)). In turn, we found that photosynthetic inhibition followed classical dose-response patterns with diuron concentrations in the water, and that EC50 could be established at 75 mu g.L-1. A continuous diffusion phenomenon was thus demonstrated but it was not linearly correlated to bioaccumulation, highlighting complex uptake mechanisms operating within the matrix. The coupling of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic approaches provided original information about pesticide behaviour and impact in periphytic microorganisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temporary ponds are important magnifiers of local biodiversity, especially in seasonal forested areas. Changes in the vegetation cover may along the banks of these water bodies alter the composition and structure of the intrinsic zooplankton community. Thus, we evaluate the hypothesis that the presence of riparian vegetation changes the structure of the zooplankton community found in temporary pools. A volume up to ten litres of water, collected from pools with riparian vegetation (CM) and lacking riparian vegetation (SM), was filtered using a 20 mu m-mesh size sieve. Data on chlorophyll-a and some limnological variables were also collected. All specimens were identified using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber under an optical microscope. Moreover, the data were treated regarding the composition and structure of the community (richness, frequency of occurrence, abundance and biomass) via performing a diversity analysis (Hill Series), canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and an indicator species analysis (IndVal). There were observed significant differences for the limnological variables in both conditions, especially for turbidity, total dissolved solids and chlorophyll-alpha, which demonstrated greater influence on the community structure. Although the diversity and biomass of rotifers were higher in the SM pools, the richness and biomass of cladocerans showed a higher value in the CM pools. The indicator species analysis demonstrated that some rotifers and microcrustaceans, as Ceriodaphnia cornuta G. O. Sars, 1885, Notodiaptomus cearensis Wright, 1936 and Ostracoda morf.2 are indicative of CM pools, whereas other species indicate environments with higher turbidity (SM pools), for example Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943 and Diaphanosoma spinulosum Herbst, 1975. In conclusion these results suggest an impressive distinction between riparian vegetation environment and that without such vegetation, which point to the importance of the former environment to the community structure. This reinforces the need for protective policies regarding temporary environments, since they are essential environments for the maintenance of local biodiversity.

AB  - Subclinical types of deficiency diseases are at present the most common disorders in farmed cattle. Their diagnosis is extremely difficult and should be verified by biochemical blood tests. The most effective as well as the cheapest method of supplementing subclinical deficiencies is the administration of oral mineral preparations. The objective of this work has been to assess the effectiveness of mineral preparations in equalizing subclinical hypophosphataemia conditions in dairy cows during the postpartum and early lactation period. The study was conducted on 42 dairy cows of the Holstein-Friesian breed (HF) originating from three farms in the Lublin region, from 7 days to 5 weeks after calving, diagnosed with subclinical hypophosphataemia. The animals which were selected for the study were divided into three experimental groups, 10 cows in each group, based upon the mineral preparation applied, and into the control group (12 cows). The following parameters were determined in the blood serum of the cows: inorganic phosphorus content (Pi), glucose concentration (GLUC), total cholesterol (CHOL T) and total protein content (TP), the total bilirubin level (BIL T), creatinine (CREA), as well as the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and creatinine kinase (CK). It was found that the most effective phosphate deficiency treatment was with sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, and that supplementation with this preparation allowed for the normalization of biochemical blood parameters. Long-term supplementation with increased doses of preparations containing phosphorus may lead to disruptions in the kidney and muscle functions, which is indicated by a significant increase in creatinine and CK activity levels. The therapeutic success of the treatment of subclinical deficiencies is dependent on the continuous monitoring of the health status of a herd due to the multietiological and multiform nature of metabolic diseases.

AB  - Eastern boundary upwelling provides the conditions for high marine productivity in the Canary Current System off NW-Africa. Despite its considerable importance to fisheries, knowledge on this marine ecosystem is only limited. Here, parasites were used as indicators to gain insight into the host ecology and food web of two pelagic fish species, the commercially important species Trichiurus lepturus Linnaeus, 1758, and Nealotus tripes Johnson, 1865. Fish specimens of T. lepturus (n = 104) and N. tripes (n = 91), sampled from the Canary Current System off the Senegalese coast and Cape Verde Islands, were examined, collecting data on their biometrics, diet and parasitisation. In this study, the first parasitological data on N. tripes are presented. T. lepturus mainly preyed on small pelagic Crustacea and the diet of N. tripes was dominated by small mesopelagic Teleostei. Both host species were infested by mostly generalist parasites. The parasite fauna of T. lepturus consisted of at least nine different species belonging to six taxonomic groups, with a less diverse fauna of ectoparasites and cestodes in comparison to studies in other coastal ecosystems (Brazil Current and Kuriosho Current). The zoonotic nematode Anisakis pegreffii occurred in 23% of the samples and could pose a risk regarding food safety. The parasite fauna of N. tripes was composed of at least thirteen species from seven different taxonomic groups. Its most common parasites were digenean ovigerous metacercariae, larval cestodes and a monogenean species (Diclidophoridae). The observed patterns of parasitisation in both host species indicate their trophic relationships and are typical for mesopredators from the subtropical epi- and mesopelagic. The parasite fauna, containing few dominant species with a high abundance, represents the typical species composition of an eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem.

AB  - Invasive Australian acacias can alter soil chemistry and microbial communities in areas they invade. After clearing invasive acacias, these changes can persist, and previously invaded areas can become dominated by nitrophilic weedy species. Restoration of viable native plant communities in cleared sites often fails due to a lack of native species re-establishment. Therefore, to improve restoration outcomes, it is important to understand the effects of soil chemical and biotic legacies, and of nitrophilic weedy species, on native species re-establishment. To investigate the effect of soil chemical legacies, we germinated and grew Protea repens seedlings (a native proteoid shrub) as an indicator species in soil taken from areas deared of Acacia saligna in lowland fynbos, as well as from non-invaded areas under controlled conditions. To investigate the effect of soil biotic legacies, we sterilized half the soil from each cleared or non-invaded area. We grew Ehrharta calycina (a native nitrophilic weedy grass species) in half of each treatment and measured the effect of treatments on P. repens germination and growth. Germination percentage, root and shoot dry mass of P. repens did not significantly differ between altered and native soil chemistry. The germination percentage of P. repens was significantly greater (93%) in the presence of soil microbial communities than in their absence. The presence of E. calycina significantly increased (29%) the root-to-shoot ratio of P. repens than their absence. Since the legacy of altered soil chemistry did not have a direct negative effect on P. repens germination and growth; we conclude that restoration efforts do not always have to manage altered soil chemistry after clearing invasive A. saligna.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are important primary producers of organic matter in diverse environments on a global scale. While mechanisms of CO2 fixation are well understood, the distribution of the flow of fixed organic carbon within individual cells and complex microbial communities is less well characterized. To obtain a general overview of metabolism, we describe the use of deuterium oxide (D2O) to measure deuterium incorporation into the intracellular metabolites of two physiologically diverse cyanobacteria: a terrestrial filamentous strain (Microcoleus vaginatus PCC 9802) and a euryhaline unicellular strain (Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002). D2O was added to the growth medium during different phases of the diel cycle. Incorporation of deuterium into metabolites at nonlabile positions, an indicator of metabolite turnover, was assessed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Expectedly, large differences in turnover among metabolites were observed. Some metabolites, such as fatty acids, did not show significant turnover over 12-24 h time periods but did turn over during longer time periods. Unexpectedly, metabolites commonly regarded to act as compatible solutes, including glutamate, glucosylglycerol, and a dihexose, showed extensive turnover compared to most other metabolites already after 12 h, but only during the light phase in the cycle. The observed extensive turnover is surprising considering the conventional view on compatible solutes as biosynthetic end points given the relatively slow growth and constant osmotic conditions. This suggests the possibility of a metabolic sink for some compatible solutes (e.g., into glycogen) that allows for rapid modulation of intracellular osmolarity. To investigate this, uniformly C-13-labeled Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were exposed to C-12 glucosylglycerol. Following metabolite extraction, amylase treatment of methanol-insoluble polymers revealed C-12 labeling of glycogen. Overall, our work shows that D2O probing is a powerful method for analysis of cyanobacterial metabolism including discovery of novel metabolic processes.

AB  - The aim of the work is to study the state of development of agriculture in Ukraine. The indicators of production and yield of the main agricultural crops and production of the main types of livestock products are analysed. The main directions of the development of agriculture are determined taking into account the transformations in the agrarian sphere. Solutions of the problem of investment support for the development of agriculture are investigated. The main factors that restrain the growth of the industry and inhibit the development of agricultural enterprises are given. Based on the results of the analysis, the main problems that the sector has faced recently are identified and the issues that require priority solutions are listed. The subject is the theoretical and methodological foundations and practical recommendations on the search for reserves for the development of the agricultural sector. Methodology. The study is based on a comparison of data from 2009 to 2015, using statistical compilations.The results of the research showed that the livestock sector begins to decline in Ukraine and this means that in the further such situation, it is possible to lose the opportunity not only to export livestock products abroad but also to meet the domestic needs of the country's population. The state of agriculture in Ukraine is considered. The results showed that the main reserves of the development of agriculture in Ukraine are the state regulation, assessment of the attractiveness of the investment climate, the use of environmentally safe technologies, the use of modern technologies and mechanisms for the economic stimulation of production and processing of agricultural products. Value/originality. The data obtained during the research years of the main reserves of agricultural development in Ukraine are able to provide a better understanding of the state of the agricultural sector in the conditions of the economic downturn in general and in Lithuania in particular.

UV treatment has become an attractive ballast water treatment technology due to its effectiveness, no harmful disinfection by products and easiness to handle. Two robust algae strains Microcystis viridis and Tetraselmis suecica were selected as indicator organisms to determine efficiency of medium-pressure (MP) UV-treatment on ballast water. Inactivation and potential repair of these two algae strains following MP UV irradiation were assessed under various turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC) and salinity conditions. The investigated range of UV doses was from 25 to 500 mJ/cm(2). For M. viridis, results indicated that disinfection efficiency was negatively correlated with all of these three factors at low doses (25-200 mJ/cm(2)). Photoreactivation and dark repair were promoted at high TOC levels (6-15 mg/L) with about 6-25% higher repair levels compared with those in distilled water, whereas no significant impacts were identified for turbidity and salinity on both of the photoreactivation and dark repair. For T. suecica, increased turbidity and TOC levels both hindered the performance of UV irradiation at high doses (200-500 mJ/cm(2)). Suppressive effects on photoreactivation and dark repair were consistently observed with changes of all of the three factors. In conclusion, generally these three factors resulted in repressive effects on UV disinfection efficiency, and TOC played a more significant role in the levels of reactivation than the other two. The responses of T suecica to these three factors were more sensitive than M. viridis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a high efficiency and clean power generation system. With the principle of energy cascade utilization and methodology of system integration, a cogeneration system for hydrogen and power from natural gas was proposed by thermally coupling high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) double-stage CLC and sorption-enhanced steam reforming unit. The effects of operating parameters on the different performances indicators (including product gas concentration, H-2 yield, and CH4 conversion) were investigated. The proposed novel process and a benchmark cogeneration process (i.e., natural gas CLC combustion unit along with sorption-enhanced steam reforming process) were both evaluated and compared from a thermodynamic point of view.
   Results show that increasing the Fuel(Hp)/C and Fuel(LP)/C ratio (i.e., natural gas as fuel for HP/LP-CLC divided by the feed molar flow for reformer ratio) leads significantly in improving the H-2 yield and CH4 conversion. The addition of Ca-based sorbent and steam in reformer also has positive impacts on system performances. Under the conditions of Fuel(HP)/C = 0.42 and Fuel(LP)/C = 0.70, the novel process has a H-2 concentration of 92%, H-2 yield of 3.64, and CH4 conversion of 75%, while for the benchmark process, the H-2 concentration is 89%, H-2 yield is 3.55, and has a CH4 conversion of 69%. In addition, the optimized process minimizes exergy destruction and increases exergy efficiency over 6% when compared to the base-case system. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Abnormal behaviors in captive animals are generally defined as behaviors that are atypical for the species and are often considered to be indicators of poor welfare. Although some abnormal behaviors have been empirically linked to conditions related to elevated stress and compromised welfare in primates, others have little or no evidence on which to base such a relationship. The objective of this study was to investigate a recent claim that abnormal behavior is endemic in the captive population by surveying a broad sample of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), while also considering factors associated with the origins of these behaviors. We surveyed animal care staff from 26 accredited zoos to assess the prevalence of abnormal behavior in a large sample of chimpanzees in the United States for which we had information on origin and rearing history. Our results demonstrated that 64% of this sample was reported to engage in some form of abnormal behavior in the past two years and 48% of chimpanzees engaged in abnormal behavior other than coprophagy. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the historical variables that best predicted the occurrence of all abnormal behavior, any abnormal behavior that was not coprophagy, and coprophagy. Rearing had opposing effects on the occurrence of coprophagy and the other abnormal behaviors such that mother-reared individuals were more likely to perform coprophagy, whereas non-mother-reared individuals were more likely to perform other abnormal behaviors. These results support the assertion that coprophagy may be classified separately when assessing abnormal behavior and the welfare of captive chimpanzees. This robust evaluation of the prevalence of abnormal behavior in our sample from the U.S. zoo population also demonstrates the importance of considering the contribution of historical variables to present behavior, in order to better understand the causes of these behaviors and any potential relationship to psychological wellbeing.

AB  - A baseline assessment of the Missouri River fish community and species-specific habitat use patterns conducted from 1996 to 1998 provided the first comprehensive analysis of Missouri River benthic fish population trends and habitat use in the Missouri and Lower Yellowstone rivers, exclusive of reservoirs, and provided the foundation for the present Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program (PSPAP). Data used in such studies are frequently zero inflated. To address this issue, the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model was applied. This follow-up study is based on PSPAP data collected up to 15years later along with new understanding of how habitat characteristics among and within bends affect habitat use of fish species targeted by PSPAP, including pallid sturgeon. This work demonstrated that a large-scale, large-river, PSPAP-type monitoring program can be an effective tool for assessing population trends and habitat usage of large-river fish species. Using multiple gears, PSPAP was effective in monitoring shovelnose and pallid sturgeons, sicklefin, shoal and sturgeon chubs, sand shiner, blue sucker and sauger. For all species, the relationship between environmental variables and relative abundance differed, somewhat, among river segments suggesting the importance of the overall conditions of Upper and Middle Missouri River and Lower Missouri and Kansas rivers on the habitat usage patterns exhibited. Shoal and sicklefin chubs exhibited many similar habitat usage patterns; blue sucker and shovelnose sturgeon also shared similar responses. For pallid sturgeon, the primary focus of PSPAP, relative abundance tended to increase in Upper and Middle Missouri River paralleling stocking efforts, whereas no evidence of an increasing relative abundance was found in the Lower Missouri River despite stocking.

AB  - REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) is the European Union's chemical regulation for the management of risk to human health and the environment (European Chemicals Agency, 2006). This regulation entered into force in June 2007 and required manufacturers and importers to register substances produced in annual quantities of 1000 tonnes or more by December 2010, with further deadlines for lower tonnages in 2013 and 2018. Depending on the type of registration, required information included the substance's identification, the hazards of the substance, the potential exposure arising from the manufacture or import, the identified uses of the substance, and the operational conditions and risk management measures applied or recommended to downstream users. Among the content developed to support this information were Derived No-Effect Levels or Derived Minimal Effect Levels (DNELs/DMELs) for human health hazard assessment, Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) for environmental hazard assessment, and exposure scenarios for exposure and risk assessment. Once registered, substances may undergo evaluation by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) or Member State authorities and be subject to requests for additional information or testing as well as additional risk reduction measures. To manage the REACH registration and related activities for the European olefins and aromatics industry, the Lower Olefins and Aromatics REACH Consortium was formed in 2008 with administrative and technical support provided by Penman Consulting. A total of 135 substances are managed by this group including 26 individual chemical registrations (e.g. benzene, 1,3-butadiene) and 13 categories consisting of 5-26 substances. This presentation will describe the content of selected registrations prepared for 2010 in addition to the significant post-2010 activities. Beyond REACH, content of the registrations may also be relevant to other European activities, for example consideration of worker DNELs/DMELs for occupational exposure level setting, discussion of this aspect will be presented for 1,3-butadiene.

AB  - Parrots are popular companion animals, but are frequently relinquished because of behavioral problems, including abnormal repetitive behaviors like feather damaging behavior and stereotypy. In addition to contributing to pet relinquishment, these behaviors are important as potential indicators of diminished psychological well-being. While abnormal behaviors are common in captive animals, their presence and/or severity varies between animals of the same species that are experiencing the same environmental conditions. Personality differences could contribute to this observed individual variation, as they are known risk factors for stress sensitivity and affective disorders in humans. The goal of this study was to assess the relationship between personality and the development and severity of abnormal behaviors in captive-bred orange-winged Amazon parrots (Amazona amazonica). We monitored between-individual behavioral differences in enrichment-reared parrots of known personality types before, during, and after enrichment deprivation. We predicted that parrots with higher scores for neurotic-like personality traits would be more susceptible to enrichment deprivation and develop more abnormal behaviors. Our results partially supported this hypothesis, but also showed that distinct personality dimensions were related to different forms of abnormal behavior. While neuroticism-like traits were linked to feather damaging behavior, extraversion-like traits were negatively related to stereotypic behavior. More extraverted birds showed resiliency to environmental stress, developing fewer stereotypies during enrichment deprivation and showing lower levels of these behaviors following re-enrichment. Our data, together with the results of the few studies conducted on other species, suggest that, as in humans, certain personality types render individual animals more susceptible or resilient to environmental stress. Further, this susceptibility/resiliency can have a long-term effect on behavior, as evidenced by behavioral changes that persisted despite re-enrichment. Ours is the first study evaluating the relationship between personality dimensions, environment, and abnormal behaviors in an avian species.

AB  - The matter of environmental concern prioritization integrated into globally used green building rating systems is a fundamental issue since it determines how the performance of a structure or development is reflected. Certain nationally-developed certification systems are used globally without being subjected to adjustments with respect to local geographical, cultural, economic and social parameters. This may lead to a situation where the results of an evaluation may not reflect the reality of the region and/or the site of construction. The main objective of this paper is to examine and underline the problems regarding the issue of weighting environmental concerns in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system, which is a US-originated but globally used assessment tool. The methodology of this study consists of; (i) an analysis of the approach of LEED in the New Construction and Major Renovations scheme in version 3 (LEED NC, v.3) and the Building Design and Construction scheme in version 4 (LEED BD + C, v.4), (ii) case studies in which regional priority credits (RPCs) set by LEED for four countries (Canada, Turkey, China and Egypt) are criticized with respect to countries' own local conditions, and, (iii) an analysis of the approaches of major environmental assessment tools, namely; BREEAM, SBTool, CASBEE and Green Star, in comparison to the approach in LEED, regarding the main issue of this paper. This work shows that, even in its latest version (v.4) LEED still displays some inadequacies and inconsistencies from the aspect of environmental concern prioritization and has not yet managed to incorporate a system which is more sensitive to this issue. This paper further outlines the differences and similarities between the approaches of the aforementioned major environmental assessment tools with respect to the issue of concern and the factors that should be integrated into future versions of LEED.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate a new application of structured expert judgement to assess the effectiveness of surgery to correct obstetric fistula in a low-income setting. Intervention effectiveness is a major input of evidence-informed priority setting in healthcare, but information on intervention effectiveness is generally lacking. This is particularly problematic in the context of poorly resourced healthcare settings where even efficacious interventions fail to translate into improvements in health. The few intervention effectiveness studies related to obstetric fistula treatment focus on the experience of single facilities and do not consider the impact of multiple factors that may affect health outcomes.
   Design: We use the classical model of structured expert judgement, a method that has been used to quantify uncertainty in the areas of engineering and environmental risk assessment when data are unavailable. Under this method, experts quantify their uncertainty about rates of long-term disability in patients with fistula following treatment in different contexts, but the information content drawn from their responses is statistically conditioned on the accuracy and informativeness of their responses to a set of calibration questions. Through this method, we develop best estimates and uncertainty bounds for the rate of disability associated with each treatment scenario and setting.
   Participants: Eight experts in obstetric fistula repair in low and middle income countries.
   Results: Estimates developed using performance weights were statistically superior to those involving a simple averaging of expert responses. The performance-weight decision maker's assessments are narrower for 9 of the 10 calibration questions and 21 of 23 variables of interest.
   Conclusions: We find that structured expert judgement is a viable approach to investigating the effectiveness of medical interventions where randomised controlled trials are not possible. Understanding the effectiveness of surgery performed at different types of facilities can guide programme planning to increase access to fistula treatment.

AB  - In Near Eastern archaeology, studies on crop management during the early stages of civilisation have been based on cuneiform texts and only recently have geoarchaeological surveys and archaeobotanical studies tried to identify agricultural practices. Nevertheless, direct evidence for irrigation and water management is very rare and difficult to interpret. New possibilities for analysing these ways of management have been provided by stable carbon isotope analysis of ancient crops. In this study carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) was performed to assess the growing conditions of fossil cereal grains. Charred grains of emmer and barley recovered from the same site, Arslantepe in eastern Anatolia, over a 1,000 years long continuous sequence during the third millennium b.c. have been analysed and compared. The variation in water availability during grain filling, estimated by Delta C-13, can be attributed to climate change and/or human practices. Distinguishing exactly which is to blame is complex but essential in reconstructing specific management practices. Variations in the C-13/C-12 ratio suggest that barley and emmer grew under different water regimes. In particular, a different management system was adopted between 3000 and 2800 cal. b.c. when emmer was sustained by human-induced water supply, whereas the more resistant barley was rain-fed and possibly assigned to more marginal terrains. Our results are compared with the stable carbon isotope data available for other Near Eastern sites. Emmer and barley records are also compared with deciduous oak Delta C-13 from Arslantepe in order to better understand the influence of environmental factors, climate and human impact.

AB  - Passive sampling methods (PSMs) allow the quantification of the freely dissolved concentration (C-free) of an organic contaminant even in complex matrices such as sediments. C-free is directly related to a contaminant's chemical activity, which drives spontaneous processes including diffusive uptake into benthic organisms and exchange with the overlying water column. Consequently, C-free provides a more relevant dose metric than total sediment concentration. Recent developments in PSMs have significantly improved our ability to reliably measure even very low levels of C-free. Application of PSMs in sediments is preferably conducted in the equilibrium regime, where freely dissolved concentrations in the sediment are well-linked to the measured concentration in the sampler via analyte-specific partition ratios. The equilibrium condition can then be assured by measuring a time series or a single time point using passive samplers with different surface to volume ratios. Sampling in the kinetic regime is also possible and generally involves the application of performance reference compounds for the calibration. Based on previous research on hydrophobic organic contaminants, it is concluded that C-free allows a direct assessment of 1) contaminant exchange and equilibrium status between sediment and overlying water, 2) benthic bioaccumulation, and 3) potential toxicity to benthic organisms. Thus, the use of PSMs to measure C-free provides an improved basis for the mechanistic understanding of fate and transport processes in sediments and has the potential to significantly improve risk assessment and management of contaminated sediments.

AB  - The activity of cholinesterases (ChE) has been recognized as a useful tool for assessing the toxicity in the environmental assessment programs. Nevertheless, the prior optimization of the experimental conditions for the appropriate measuring of the ChE activity enables us to get reliable results. Thus, the main objective of this study was to adapt and optimize a microplate assay for measuring the activity of ChE in the tropical cladoceran Pseudosida ramosa. The best readings for the reaction rates were obtained with buffers of pH 8.0 and molarity of 0.02 M. The measurements of the reaction rates for the different substrate concentrations showed that the maximum reaction rate (32 mOD min(-1)) was achieved by the final concentration of 2 mM of substrate. In relation to the enzyme concentration, reaction rates were directly proportional to the protein concentration, which confirmed the linear kinetics for a maximum reaction rate. On the basis of the results of the assays for the effect of the number of individuals and homogenate dilution on the reaction rate of substrate hydrolysis and ChE activity, we recommend using of 30 individuals (3 days-old) in 250 mu L of buffer, 20 individuals (7 days-old) in 250 mu L of buffer and 15 individuals (both 14 and 21 days-old) in 300 mu L of buffer. The limits of quantitation obtained were 1.419 mOD min(-1) (<= 72 h-old), 1.670 mOD min(-1) (7 days-old), 0.943 mOD min(-1) (14 days-old) and 0.797 mOD min(-1) (21 days-old). In conclusion, it was possible to measure the ChE activity in P. ramosa with the methodology adapted, thus contributing to the implementation of a biochemical biomarker in freshwater toxicity assessments in tropical regions.

AB  - Thioredoxin (Trx) and GSH are the major thiol antioxidants protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity. Redox states of Trx and GSH have been used as indicators of oxidative stress. Accumulating studies suggest that Trx and GSH redox systems regulate cell signaling and metabolic pathways differently and independently during diverse stressful conditions. In the current study, we used a mass spectrometry-based redox proteomics approach to test responses of the cysteine (Cys) proteome to selective disruption of the Trx- and GSH-dependent systems. Auranofin (ARF) was used to inhibit Trx reductase without detectable oxidation of the GSH/GSSG couple, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) was used to deplete GSH without detectable oxidation of Trx1. Results for 606 Cys-containing peptides (peptidyl Cys) showed that 36% were oxidized more than 1.3-fold by ARF, whereas BSO-induced oxidation of peptidyl Cys was only 10%. Mean fold oxidation of these peptides was also higher by ARF than BSO treatment. Analysis of potential functional pathways showed that ARF oxidized peptides associated with glycolysis, cytoskeleton remodeling, translation and cell adhesion. Of 60 peptidyl Cys oxidized due to depletion of GSH, 41 were also oxidized by ARF and included proteins of translation and cell adhesion but not glycolysis or cytoskeletal remodeling. Studies to test functional correlates showed that pyruvate kinase activity and lactate levels were decreased with ARF but not BSO, confirming the effects on glycolysis-associated proteins are sensitive to oxidation by ARF. These data show that the Trx system regulates a broader range of proteins than the GSH system, support distinct function of Trx and GSH in cellular redox control, and show for the first time in mammalian cells selective targeting peptidyl Cys and biological pathways due to deficient function of the Trx system.

AB  - In the present study, the importance of considering fish intestinal parasites i.e. the acanthocephalans in metal exposure assessment was estimated under low metal contamination conditions. Two acanthocephalan species, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Acanthocephalus anguillae were examined in 59 specimens of European chub (Squalius cephalus L.) sampled at 5 locations along the Sava River, Croatia. Concentrations of essential (Cu, Mn) and non-essential (Ag, Cd, Pb) metals were higher in intestinal parasites than chub gastrointestinal tissue, but levels of essential metals Fe and Zn were comparable or lower in parasites, respectively. The highest accumulation in both acanthocephalan species was found for non-essential metals and followed the order: Ag > Pb > Cd. Higher infection intensity with P. laevis allowed us to present their spatial metal distribution and evaluate the influence of P. laevis on metal levels and sub-cellular biological responses (total protein and metallothionein levels) in the host infected with P. laevis. Even in the river section with low metal contamination, parasitism affected metal levels, resulting in lower Cu, Cd and Pb concentrations in chub infected with P. laevis than in uninfected chub. Although total protein and metallothionein levels remained constant in infected and uninfected chub, acanthocephalans should be considered a potential confounding factor in metal exposure assessments. Moreover, P. laevis-chub system can be suggested as an appropriate tool in biomonitoring, since in both species increased Cu and Cd concentrations towards the downstream locations were found. Higher Cu and Cd levels in P. laevis suggest acanthocephalans to be sensitive bioindicators if low metal levels have to be detected. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of nitrite, the indicator of nitric oxide (NO) generation in vivo, provides a useful tool to study NO synthesis in vivo. A fast and sensitive fluorometric CE method was developed for determination of nitrite in human plasma through its derivatization with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN). Nitrite in human plasma was easily reacted with DAN under acid conditions to yield the highly fluorescent 2,3-naphthotriazole (NAT). Fluorescence detection was optimized to achieve subnanomolar detection which allows a direct analysis of plasma samples unlike most CE-UV methods using sample stacking. Acetonitrile was used to remove the protein. Short-end injection and a high voltage (-30 kV) were used to shorten the analysis time. The good separation was achieved with 20 mM borate buffer at pH 9.23. The separation of NAT was obtained within 1.4 min. The deproteinized plasma sample was injected hydrodynamically for 5 s at -50 mbar into a 60 cm x 75 mu m internal diameter uncoated fused-silica capillary. Excitation wavelength was selected with a broad-band filter (240-400 nm), and the emitted light was measured at 418 nm by the use of a cutoff filter. A good linearity (R-2=0.9975) was obtained in the range from 2 to 500 nM. The detection limit of nitrite was 0.6 nM in original plasma samples, which is 750 times lower than our previous CE-UV method. The developed fluorometric CE method offers the advantages of more simple system and lower cost compared with the current fluorometric HPLC methods without losing sensitivity. The detected mean nitrite concentration in human plasma by this method was consistent with the most frequently reported values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize quantitatively the temporal basal and induced ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity as indicator of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) function during embryonic development of medaka (Oryzias latipes). For this purpose, non-invasive methods over fluorescence images of the whole embryo (non-organ-specific [NOS] EROD activity) or specifically of the gallbladder (organ-specific [OS] EROD activity) were used. To induce this EROD activity, embryos were continuously exposed to beta-naphthoflavone (BNF: 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5 mu g/L). Analytical chemistry suggested no signs of BNF dissipation. Mean fluorescence intensity values for EROD induction increased with BNF concentration throughout embryonic development. Significant increments in the NOS activity were seen from exposures to >= 0.5 mu g BNF/L as early as 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), and in the OS EROD activity as soon as the gallbladder was conspicuous (i.e. 4 dpf). Morphometric in vivo analysis of the gallbladder during embryonic development did not indicate significant dilation after BNF treatment suggesting normal hepatic bile formation. The conditions optimized in this study using intact embryos should allow the quantitation of EROD activity induced by specific chemicals, mixtures and environmental samples in terms of BNF-equivalents, offering a proper estimation of their potency. These results demonstrate the utility of medaka in a fish embryo test for a non-invasive CYP1A analysis expressed as EROD activity, fitting in the three R principles for the minimization of animal use in ecotoxicology evaluations and that are among the objectives of the European Community regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH).

AB  - Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of precipitation, but our ability to model the consequences for soil respiration are limited by a lack of data from soils that are saturated and draining. In this study, we used large intact soil columns (28 x 30 cm) to 1) quantify changes in CO2 flux as soils drain from saturated conditions, and 2) to determine which soil water metrics best predict instantaneous maximum CO2 flux. The columns were from three agricultural landscape positions that vary in soil properties. We simulated water table fluctuations that were observed at the field site (and predicted to increase in future climate scenarios) by flooding the columns from bottom to surface and then allowing the columns to drain for 96 h while monitoring volumetric soil water content (VWC), water filled pore space (WFPS), water content normalized to field capacity, matric potential, and CO2 flux. Mean cumulative CO2 flux was 4649 mg CO2-Cm-2 96 h(-1). Regardless of landscape position. CO2 flux rates exhibited a single maximum slightly below saturation, near field capacity. This result suggests that many field studies have not captured soil respiration rates when water availability is optimum for heterotrophic respiration. Across landscape positions, matric potential was the most consistent indicator of instantaneous maximum CO2 flux, with maximum fluxes occurring within the narrow range of -0.15 to -4.89 kPa. In contrast, instantaneous maximum CO2 flux rates occurred between 95 and 131% of water content normalized to field capacity, 72-97% WFPS, and 29-45% VWC. Thus, our data suggest that instantaneous maximum CO2 flux rates, a key parameter in ecosystem models, can be predicted across an agricultural landscape with diverse soils if matric potential is used as a water scalar.

Determination of indices of multiple and Multiple Weighted Gcodiversity of landscape of the Piranhas-Assu river, Rio Grande do Norte - Brazil.

   Generally, one of the limiting factors to environmental studies is the scarcity of financial resources. It is often costly or even impossible to determine an entire search focus area or areas of study that will allocate more investigative effort, depending on the size of the area. Studies to guide public policies must work to show the complexity of the mosaic city, or even priority areas for preservation or conservation. To this end, it is essential to apply a methodology that satisfies these conditions in a clear, accurate and reliable, affordable and quick way. As the diversity is not evenly distributed, the critical issue in environmental policy lies in the location of areas that deserve conservation priority. To meet this need a multidisciplinary group of researchers who develop GIS applied to environmental studies, the Laboratory of GIS, Department of Geography Institute of Geosciences, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, developed an alternative approach using modeling a Geographic Information System to create indexes of diversity of landscape elements (indices Geodiversity), suggested as indicators of overall biodiversity. Thus, the work presented by the research group aims to provide access to methods that help to assess the distribution of environmental diversity. This study adopts the methodology provided by this group to assess the degree of wealth of the environmental diversity of the lower course of the Piranhas-Assu, located on the northern coast of Rio Grande do Norte.

AB  - Ostracod shells in surface sediments from Ulungur Lake (Xinjiang, China) belong mainly to Limnocythere inopinata as the dominant species, and Candona neglecta and Darwinula stevensoni as accompanying, less abundant taxa. Shells of an additional nine species were recorded only sporadically. The three most abundant ostracods have wide tolerance ranges in terms of salinity, substrate and water depth. The similarly recorded bivalve Pisidium subtruncatum, and the gastropods Gyraulus chinensis and Radix auricularia belong to the most tolerant representatives of the genera. The bivalve and gastropods, in addition to the ostracod assemblage, reflect the fact that Ulungur Lake has experienced strong lake level and salinity variations due to water withdrawal in the catchment and the counteracting diversion of river waters to the lake in recent decades. The substrate in Ulungur Lake is typically fine-grained, apart from the delta region of the Ulungur River channel, which is marked by relatively coarse-grained detrital sediments barren of ostracod shells. This channel was created 40 years ago to divert water to Ulungur Lake and support its local fisheries and recreational facilities. A reassessed Holocene ostracod record from the lake shows that a significantly higher salinity and lower lake level existed in the early Holocene before 6.0 ka in response to the regional climate. In contrast, a higher lake level and lowest salinity is inferred for the late Holocene period between ca. 3.6 and 1.3 ka before present. Afterwards, the lake level declined and salinity increased in response to regional moisture reduction, although conditions similar to the early Holocene lake status were not re-established. Our surface-sediment-derived data provide a baseline for analysis of future environmental variations due to global climate change and regional water management.

AB  - Zhao, Z., Chow, T. L., Yang, Q., Rees, H. W., Benoy, B., Xing, Z. and Meng, F. R. 2008. Model prediction of soil drainage classes based on digital elevation model parameters and soil attributes from coarse resolution soil maps. Can. J. Soil Sci. 88: 787-799. High-resolution soil drainage maps are important for crop production planning, forest management, and environmental assessment. Existing soil classification maps tend to only have information about the dominant soil drainage conditions and they are inadequate for precision forestry and agriculture planning purposes. The objective of this research was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for producing soil drainage classification maps at high resolution. Soil profile data extracted from coarse resolution soil maps (1:1000000 scale) and topographic and hydrological variables derived from digital elevation model (DEM) data (1:35000 scale) were considered as candidates for inputs. A high-resolution soil drainage map (1:10000) of the Black Brook Watershed (BBW) in northwestern New Brunswick (NB), Canada, was used to train and validate the ANN model. Results indicated that the best ANN model included average soil drainage classes, average soil sand content, vertical slope position (VSP), sediment delivery ratio (SDR) and slope steepness as inputs. It was found that 52% of model-predicted drainage classes were exactly the same as field assessment observations and 94% of model-predicted drainage classes were within +/- 1 class. In comparison, only 12% of maps indicated drainage classes were the same as field assessment observations based on coarse resolution soil maps and only 55% of points were within +/- 1 class of field assessed drainage classes. Results indicated that the model could be used to produce high-resolution soil drainage maps at relatively low cost.

AB  - Compared to hydrograph recession analysis, which is widely applied in engineering hydrology, the quantitative assessment of stream salinity with time (i.e. the salinograph) has received significantly less attention. In particular, while in many previous hydrological studies an inverse relationship between hydrograph and salinograph responses is apparent, the concept of salinity accession (the inversely related salinity counterpart to hydrograph recession) has not been introduced nor quantitatively evaluated in previous literature. In this study, we conduct a mathematical analysis of salinograph accession, and determine new quantitative relationships between salinity accession and hydroaraph recession parameters. An equation is formulated that reproduces the general trend in salinity accession. A salinity accession parameter k(c) is then introduced and is shown to be the ratio of direct runoff to total stream flow recession parameters: k(r)/k. The groundwater recession parameter k(g) was estimated using a simple and rapid method that uses both salinograph and hydrograph data. Salinity accession type-curves illustrate that under certain conditions, the relative steepness of individual salinographs is dependent upon the ratio of groundwater salinity to direct runoff salinity: C-g/C-r. The salinity accession algorithms are applied to two contrasting field settings: Scott Creek, South Australia and Sandy Creek, northern Queensland, Australia. It was found that k(g) > k during periods of obvious stream flow recession, for the events analysed. Salinograph accession behaviour was fairly similar for both sites, despite contrasting environments. Using assumed end-member salinities for groundwater and direct runoff based upon field observations, the behaviour of k(c) from the Scott Creek site was approximately reproduced by varying the initial groundwater to runoff flow ratio: Q(g0)/Q(r0), within reasonable parameter ranges. The use of salinograph information when used in addition to standard hydrograph analyses provided useful information on recession characteristics of stream components.

AB  - A comparative survey of the levels of contamination of the two gastropods, of the Potomidae family, has been done in the lagoon Ebrie close to the city of Abidjan. It revealed that Tympanotonus fuscatus radula ( TFR), adapt better to the conditions of the lagoon environment than Tympanotonus fuscatus fuscatus ( TFF). Besides, T. fuscatus radula shows a higher bioaccumulation capacity of the trace elements than T. fuscatus fuscatus: the ratios of contamination index of T. fuscatus radula to those of T. fuscatus fuscatus are in the order of 1.5 for copper (Cu), 4.9 for iron ( Fe), 3.2 for zinc (Zn), 95.9 for lead (Pb) and 6.7 for cadmium (Cd). Therefore T. fuscatus radula could be a better metallic pollution indicator than T. fuscatus fuscatus. A hierarchical classification analysis permitted, on the basis of trace elements contents in the soft tissues of T. fuscatus radula higher than 10%, to determine the polymetallic character of the pollution in the different sampling stations ( with the exception of Biet 3) as well as the differences in the bioavailability of the trace elements. Besides, possible health risks linked to the consumption of T. fuscatus radula exist because of the lead concentrations which, in 35.57% of the samples, are higher than the consumption standards of the European Union (EU) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Even if the contents in cadmium are lower than the consumption standards of the EU and the WHO, the health risks linked to this trace element still remains because of its cumulative character in some vital organs of human.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate differences in plant species composition between managed and unmanaged forests, and to assess if these difference give rise to a higher plant diversity in the unmanaged forest. Furthermore our aim is to relate forest structure to differences in plant species composition, identifying the structural attributes more strongly related to the unmanaged forest vegetation. We compared an old-growth forest and a managed highforest in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park (Central Italy). Plant species composition and diversity, deadwood components and live structure have been analyzed. We used permutational multivariate analysis of variance to test the response of species composition to management factor; furthermore, we compared species richness and beta diversity. Redundancy analysis has been used to relate plant species abundances to structural variables; the importance of dead and living wood components has been compared through variation partitioning. Plant species composition proved to be significantly different in the two sites, and the old-growth stand showed a higher plant diversity. From a structural point of view, we found differences especially in the amount and quality of deadwood, and in the diameter class distribution. These variables are also the most important in determining the old-growth stand plant species composition according to redundancy analysis. Variation partitioning confirmed the greater importance of the deadwood variables. Our results suggest that including deadwood surveys in traditional forest inventories could help in finding forests with both structural and floristic old-growth properties to be considered in conservation programmes. The imitation of natural dynamics, through the creation of gaps avoiding deadwood removal, could be an effective strategy for restoring old-growth conditions, also in terms of plant diversity.

AB  - The preferred management option for municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash in Denmark is milisation rather than landfilling, but the current environmental quality criteria for bottom ash to be utilised in bulk quantities are rather strict. To evaluate the impact and risk assessments, upon which those criteria are based, a large-scale test site has been established. Three different MSWI bottom ashes have been used as sub-base in six test units ranging from 100 to 200 m(2) with top covers of asphalt, flagstones and pebbles, respectively. All units, except one, are equipped with bottom liners and leachate collection equipment. The test site provides information on the leachate quality and quantity as a function of time under different conditions and on the flow pattern in asphalt and flagstone covered roads and squares with MSWI bottom ash sub-base. In addition, the leaching behaviour of the bottom ashes has been studied in the laboratory. The test site was established in October 2002 and the project is still ongoing. Water balance results indicate that the water flow distribution is strongly influenced by lateral flow on or in the upper part of the bottom ash layer and possibly by preferential flow. Comparisons between eluates from laboratory leaching tests on the bottom ashes and observations of the leachate from the site as a function of L/S show fairly good agreement for salts but less agreement for some trace elements. Most likely, this is partly due to the fact that the pH observed in the leachate from the field sites is lower than that observed in the eluates from the laboratory leaching tests.

AB  - In this paper the most important literature data on polymer and surface-active additives effect on flow drag reduction and heat transfer effect in pipeline systems, as well as on liquid film flow characteristics, are presented. Previous published reviews by Gyr and Bewersdorff [1995], Choi [2000] and Graham [2004] were concerned with drag reduction effects in polymer solutions, and drag reduction effects in surfactant solutions were reviewed by Zakin et al. [1998]. The authors of the present review paper limited themselves to review important issues related to drag reduction effect and heat transfer in turbulent flows without phase change. Special attention was directed to elaborate the similarities and differences of drag reduction in high-molecular polymers and surfactants solutions, which relate to the flow phenomena and the associated heat transfer in straight tubes, coils and in failing films. It has been underlined that despite the large amount of research, which includes applications of modern measurement techniques to study turbulence phenomena and the rheological characteristics, the details of the drag reduction and heat transfer mechanisms are still not well understood. In the experimental studies performed in the last years with mixed drag reducers systems (polymer/surfactant, surfactant/surfactant), it has been shown that the presence of other surfactants or polymer in drag reducing surfactant systems causes an increase of the system stability and of the temperature range in which the additives are most effective. Perhaps the zwitterionic surfactants with special additives have the potential to become very useful in the future. It has been shown that another important issue for future research is finding drag reducing systems for long-distance transport of non-polar fluids, taking into account changeable environment temperature conditions.

AB  - This study identifies the precursor signals of convective initiation within sequences of 1-km-resolution visible (VIS) and 4-8-km infrared (IR) imagery from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) instrument. Convective initiation (CI) is defined for this study as the first detection of Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) reflectivities >= 35 dBZ produced by convective clouds. Results indicate that CI may be forecasted similar to 30-45 min in advance through the monitoring of key IR fields for convective clouds. This is made possible by the coincident use of three components of GOES data: 1) a cumulus cloud "mask" at 1-km-resolution using VIS and IR data, 2) satellite-derived atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) for tracking individual cumulus clouds, and 3) IR brightness temperature ( TB) and multispectral band-differencing time trends. In effect, these techniques isolate only the cumulus convection in satellite imagery, track moving cumulus convection, and evaluate various IR cloud properties in time. Convective initiation is predicted by accumulating information within a satellite pixel that is attributed to the first occurrence of a >= 35 dBZ radar echo. Through the incorporation of satellite tracking of moving cumulus clouds, this work represents a significant advance in the use of routinely available GOES data for monitoring aspects of cumulus clouds important for nowcasting CI (0-1-h forecasts). Once cumulus cloud tracking is established, eight predictor fields based on Lagrangian trends in IR data are used to characterize cloud conditions consistent with CI. Cumulus cloud pixels for which >= 7 of the 8 CI indicators are satisfied are labeled as having high CI potential, assuming an extrapolation of past trends into the future. Comparison to future WSR-88D imagery then measures the method's predictive skill. Convective initiation predictability is demonstrated using several convective events-one during IHOP_2002-that occur over a variety of synoptic and mesoscale forcing regimes.

AB  - We report the discovery of intraspecific variation in both colony composition and patterns of paternity in two populations of the social common mole-rat Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotits. These two populations represent the mesic and and habitat extremes of the species' broad ecological range in South Africa. Until recently colonies of the common mole-rat were thought to consist of familial groups whereby all colony members were the offspring of a monogamous reproductive pair. The remaining colony members were thought to forego reproduction until both social and ecological conditions favoured dispersal and opportunities for independent outbreeding. Results from genetic assignment tests using microsatellite markers indicate that while colony composition is dominated by familial groups, colonies within both populations included both adult and subadult foreign conspecifics. Analysis of parentage reveals that the social organization of C. It. hottentotus is not that of strict monogamy; paternity of offspring was not assigned consistently to the largest, most dominant male within the colony. Moreover, a number of significantly smaller males were found to sire offspring, suggesting a sneak-mating strategy by subordinate within-colony males. Extra-colony extra-pair paternity (ECP) was also found to characterize C. It. hottentotus colonies, occurring with similar frequencies in both habitats. Both dominant established breeding males and subordinate males were identified as siring young in nonsource colonies. Furthermore, established breeding males were found to sire extra-colony young in the same season as siring young within their source colonies. We discuss the significance of these results within the context of the divergent ecological regimes characterizing the two sites and observe that our results revisit the accuracy of using behavioural and morphological characters, which have structured the basis of our understanding of the behavioural ecology of this species, as indicators of breeding status in mark-recapture studies.

AB  - Synthesis of 10-[(3'-N-benzylamino)propyl]phenoxazine [BAPP] is accomplished in two steps. The first step involved N-10-alkylation of parent phenoxazine via phase transfer catalysis (PTC) followed by iodide-catalysed nucleophilic substitution of the N-10-propyl chloride with N-benzylamine. BAPP formed is purified by column chromatography. In the second stage BAPP undergoes one-electron oxidation with Ce(IV) to form a pink radical cation [BAPP(+.)]. In the presence of more than one equivalent of Ce(IV), the radical cation undergoes a second one-electron oxidation to form a brownish yellow coloured dication [BAPP(2+)], which is characterized by UV-Vis, IR and mass-spectral methods. The biological functions of phenoxazines are connected to a great extent with their ability to undergo reversible redox conversion and therefore the electrochemical behaviour of BAPP is investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Other cyclic voltammetric parameters have also been determined. Bromine in acid medium oxidizes BAPP to three products as shown by HPLC. The tentatively predicted structures based on the mass-spectral data support the formation of three brominated oxidized products. In order to explore the analytical applications, the optimum conditions for the use of BAPP as redox indicator in the macro and micro estimation of ascorbic acid, methionine, isoniazid, phenylhydrazine hydrochloride and biotin using chloramine-T as an oxidant have been developed. The indicator gives sharp and stoichiometric end-points. During the titration, BAPP initially undergoes a reversible one-electron oxidation. With progress of titration, the radical pink cation is oxidized to a blue coloured dication with the loss of one more electron. The utilization of BAPP as an indicator for oxidation-reduction reactions for the volumetric determination of bioanalytically important species such as ascorbic acid, methionine and isoniazid in real samples is significant.

AB  - A variety of meteoric diagenetic features reveal the development of a syngenetic karst on lacustrine deposits of the Ebro Basin. Diagenetic processes that operated on lacustrine laminated and stromatolitic carbonates include the following. (1) A first syndepositional stage with processes such as dolomitization, desiccation and related breccia formation and sulphate precipitation, either as lenticular gypsum crystals or nodules. This stage took place under progressive evaporation due to lake level fall, when the previous carbonate deposits became exposed as a supra-littoral fringe surrounding saline mud flats of adjacent sulphate depositional environments. (2) A second early diagenetic stage in which processes such as sulphate dissolution and collapse brecciation, dedolomitization, calcite spar cementation and silicification occurred as a result of meteoric water input that caused a progressive rise in lake level. Light isotopic compositions (delta(13)C and delta(18)O) of diagenetic calcites, versus heavier compositions in primary laminated and stromatolitic limestones, confirm a meteoric influence. The syngenetic karst is best developed at the boundary between two allostratigraphic units and coincided with one of the extensive stages of sulphate deposition at the end of the Early Miocene. The karst facies occurred in an area that was a low-relief barrier that separated two sites of sulphate deposition during low lake levels, This indicates that the karat development was controlled by topographic changes within the basin and record a shift from arid to wetter climatic conditions, as suggested by the overlying freshwater carbonate deposits. The presence of diagenetic features such as those described in the central Ebro Basin affecting saline lacustrine carbonates is relevant because they can be used as indicators of subaerial exposure periods in terrestrial environments and they also reveal important palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic events of basinal extent.

AB  - Many changes in mammalian faunas occurred across the early (Wasatchian) to middle (Bridgerian) Eocene boundary as documented in the fossil record from the 'Western Interior of North America. One of the more striking changes took place within the tarsiiform primate family Omomyidae. In the early Eocene, omomyids were dominated, both in abundance and diversity, by the subfamily Anaptomorphinae. In the middle Eocene, the subfamily Omomyinae dominated in abundance, while both subfamilies were nearly equally diverse. Examination of a series of paleoecological indicators including leaf-margin analysis, cenogram analysis, ecological diversity analysis of trophic structure, the distribution and development of ancient soil horizons (paleosols), and the distribution of lacustrine and fluvial Facies in the Bighorn and southern Green River basins of Wyoming reveals factors that may have influenced the composition of omomyid primates. Subtle but important changes occurred in paleoclimates with mean annual temperatures reaching Cenozoic maximums at the end of the Wasatchian into the early Bridgerian. Both land mammal ages were typified by subtropical, closed forested conditions, but the Bridgerian was probably more humid and wetter than the Wasatchian. Paleohabitats most commonly sampled in the Wasatchian of the Bighorn Basin are proximal and distal floodplains, while those of the Bridgerian in the southern Green River Basin are lake margins and proximal floodplains. Changes in paleoclimate may have triggered a wave of omomyine immigration near the end of the Wasatchian with omomyines entering into habitats previously occupied by anaptomorphines. Lake margin and proximal floodplain habitats are those most commonly occupied by omomyines in the Bridgerian with anaptomorphines being more common in basin margin and distal floodplain areas not commonly sampled. Omomyine immigration and sampling of differing paleohabitats are two possible explanations for the changes documented in omomyid diversity and abundance. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - With the aim of analyzing the effects of prolonged thermal stress or food intake reduction on lymphoid cell proliferation and antibody synthesis, New Zealand White (NZW) male rabbits, both immunized and nonimmunized with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were kept in individual cages for 24 d at controlled climatic conditions. Both immunized and nonimmunized rabbits were divided into two experimental groups and one control group. The thermal-stressed rabbits (TS) were exposed to a room temperature of 33.5 degrees C, and dietary restricted rabbits (DR) were pair-fed on the basis of the average feed intake of the TS groups and maintained at a room temperature of 18.0 degrees C. The control group (Ctr) was maintained at 18.0 degrees C and was given ad libitum access to feed. All rabbits were maintained at relative humidity 62 +/- 5%. Sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood samples collected on d 0, 6, 12, and 24. Sera were used for determining total proteins and immunoglobulins (Ig) specific or not to mycobacterial antigens. Antibodies to heat-shock protein (HSP) were also determined. The PBMC were used to measure cell proliferation and in vitro Ig synthesis. Both experiments in vivo and in vitro suggest that thermal stress and dietary restriction severely affect the immune cell functions. In fact, both stress treatments decreased the capacity of PBMC to proliferate and inhibited the differentiation of B lymphocytes in antibody-secreting cells. However, a recovery of immune cell functions was only observed in vivo after 12 d of treatment, suggesting that other defensive mechanisms may come into play in vivo. Sera collected from both TS and DR rabbits after 24 d presented antibodies to HSP70, suggesting that the analysis of anti-HSP antibodies could represent a useful indicator to reveal the effects of different stress effecters regardless of the nature of the stress.

AB  - 1. Exposure to high light intensities (250 and 1000 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1)) caused a rapid and strong decline in F-v/F-M in hydrated lichens. However, all species except the old-forest indicators Lobaria pulmonaria and Evernia divaricata recovered original values of F-v/F-M within 2-3 days at 18 degrees C.
   2. Lichen indicators of long ecological continuity, especially within the threatened Lobarion community, were most susceptible to high light, also in evidence by increased chlorophyll degradation in hydrated thalli with increasing PFDs. Usneion species showed a moderate level of photoinhibition; those members of the family Parmeliaceae that are ubiquitous were the most resistant.
   3. A reduction in temperature from 18 to 19 degrees C during high-light treatment caused a larger and more permanent reduction in F-v/F-M in hydrated thalli of Lobaria pulmonaria than of Parmelia sulcata.
   4. F-v/F-M was permanently reduced in air-dry thalli subjected to high PFD; irreversible and very low levels of F-v/F-M developed within 2-3 days of high-light exposure for tested Lobarion species measured after 48-h recovery in moist conditions at low light. Ubiquitous Parmeliaceae species maintained fairly high F-v/F-M throughout the 7-day exposure; Usneion species were intermediate. The lichen indicators of long ecological continuity showed a large and highly significant chlorophyll degradation, whereas the remaining species had some kind of protecting mechanisms.
   5. Clear-fellings of forests are likely to be detrimental for presently declining lichens of ancient forests by causing a sudden increase in PFDs on remaining lichen thalli.

AB  - The Fluviovolcanic Series (= FVS) of the Jos plateau, Central Nigeria are an upper Eocene to middle Miocene time-equivalent to the Continental Terminal of the surrounding basins. It can be divided into a lower part with mafic to intermediate and even felsic volcanic rocks (according to the Zr/TiO2), fluvial or limnic sediments and an upper part of mafic volcanic rocks with intercalated transported pisoids and quartz grains. Palynomorphs of a limnic clay reflect a subtropical to montane tropical vegetation rich in plant species. The lower part of the FVS often shows distinct tilting as a result of neotectonic movement along a reactivated conservative plate boundary in continuation of the transatlantic Romanche fracture zone.
   The various rocks have been completely converted into deep (often > 80 m) polygenetic soils which consist of repetitive sequences of saprolite, mottled horizon and ferricrete. The ferricrete represents a paleosurface and protects the profiles against erosion. The mineralogy of 3 profiles consists essentially of kaolinite with various amounts of goethite and hematite; gibbsite appears in one confined horizon, whereas anatase and residual (weathered) ilmenite and quartz occur as accessories. The presence or absence of ilmenite, quartz and anatase in the various sections of the profiles were taken as an indicator for different parent rocks.
   The crystallinity of kaolinite (Hinckley index), the crystal size and Al substitution of goethite and hematite varied sectionwise indicating different weathering environments. For example, the goethite in laminar-massive ferricretes appearing at the base of all 3 profiles had lower Al substitution and somewhat larger crystals than that of the pisolitic-vermiform ferricretes and was associated with redoximorphic conditions. On the basis of mineralogical, paleontological, sedimentological and absolute K/Ar age of basalts, the profiles were placed into the transition from Paleogene to Neogene and stratigraphic correlation was suggested.

AB  - Colombo E., Michelangeli A. and Stanca L. La dolce vita: hedonic estimates of quality of life in Italian cities, Regional Studies. This paper investigates quality of life in Italian cities using the hedonic approach. It analyses micro-level data for housing and labour markets to estimate compensating differentials for local amenities within four domains: weather, environment, services and society. Large compensating differentials in housing markets are found, whereas the effects on wages are relatively small. Quality of life varies substantially across space and is generally better in large and medium-sized cities of the Centre-North. Services and social conditions are strongly related to overall quality of life. It is also found that, across cities, quality of life is positively and significantly related to subjective well-being.

AB  - Development and improvement of renewable energy sources is a vital task to cope with fossil fuel associated consequences on nature. Recently, green energy has been emerged as an alternative for the said challenge. Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) is the principal source of sucrose and bioethanol worldwide. However, unfavorable climatic condition particularly episodes of heat waves cause significant reduction in sugarcane biomass and sucrose accumulation. Selection of appropriate variety at formative stage is one of the vital approaches to cope with global warming and may reduce economic loss in cultivation of this annual crop. So, the study was formulated to a) elucidate the varietal differences for sucrose accumulation under thermal stress and b) understand the physiological and biochemical response towards high temperature. Therefore, two sugarcane cultivars viz S-2003-US-633 (high sucrose accumulation) and SPF-238 (low sucrose accumulation) were subjected to heat stress at formative stage. Cell membrane thermostability (CMT), lipid per-oxidation (LPO) and level of oxidative stress, were monitored as stress damage indicators while variation in proline accumulation showed osmoregulatory potentials. Non-reducing and reducing sugars proportion in the total sugar assessed and correlated with soluble protein concentration to mimic the activities of sugar metabolizing enzymes. Results revealed positive relationship of proline and protein content with total sugars in S-2003-US-633 as compared to SPF-238. The later crop had low sucrose may be due to low CMT, higher MDA, and H2O2. It is evident that cultivar S-2003-US-633 tolerated heat stress based on its physio-chemical managements and ensures high sucrose recovery. The study suggests potential application of the indices in field evaluation and selection of climate resilient sugarcane plant at formative stage to cope with yield and economic loss of this annual cash crop in times of climate change.

AB  - This study examines a green building retrofit plan through a system dynamics model (SDM) creating symbiosis embedded in a building-scale food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. An indicator approach was employed to exploit cross-domain seams via the use of carbon, water, and ecological footprints for sustainability, as well as food security and energy supply reliability ratio for resilience. The SDM was formulated to demonstrate a continuous stormwater treatment outflow model for rooftop farming with stormwater reuse for irrigation, nutrient cycling via the use of green sorption media, and green energy harvesting in support of rooftop farming. We prove that green energy use, stormwater reuse, and rooftop farming can lower carbon, water, and ecological footprints, avoid CO2 emissions via carbon sequestration in rooftop farming, and improve energy supply reliability and food security. Case 1 (Base Case) includes no retrofit (current condition), Case 2 includes rooftop farming and stormwater reuse, and Case 3 incorporates additional green energy harvesting for sustaining rooftop farming. All three scenarios were assessed using a life cycle assessment (LCA) to generate water and carbon footprints. Case 3 exhibited a 2.24% reduction of total building energy demand from the utility grid due to renewable energy harvesting, while the preservation of nitrogen and phosphorus via the use of green sorption media for crop growth promoted nutrient cycling by maintaining 82% of nitrogen and 42% of phosphorus on site. The ecological footprints for the three case studies were 0.134 ha, 0.542 ha, 6.50 ha, respectively. Case 3 was selected as the best green building retrofit option through a multicriteria decision analysis.

AB  - Simple summary Protocols were adjusted and established for biomarker assessment in two blood fractions: plasma and the post-mitochondrial fraction (S9). Basal biomarker values were determined in white stork (Ciconia ciconia) nestlings from Croatia, and biomarker responses in two different types of blood samples were compared. Novel fluorescence-based glutathione and reactive oxygen species detection was established providing the potential usage of blood for assessment of environmental impact at the molecular level. White stork (Ciconia ciconia) nestlings can provide quantitative information on the quality of the surrounding environment by indicating the presence of pollutants, as they depend on locally foraged food. This study represents the first comparison of biomarkers in two fractions of white stork nestling blood: plasma and S9 (the post-mitochondrial fraction). The aim of this study was to evaluate acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as to establish a novel fluorescence-based method for glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection in plasma and S9. Considering the enzymatic biomarkers, lower variability in plasma was detected only for AChE, as CES, GST, and GR had lower variability in S9. Enzyme activity was higher in plasma for AChE, CES, and GST, while GR had higher activity in S9. Regarding the fluorescence-based method, lower variability was detected in plasma for GSH and ROS, although higher GSH detection was reported in S9, and higher ROS was detected in plasma. The present study indicated valuable differences by successfully establishing protocols for biomarker measurement in plasma and S9 based on variability, enzyme activity, and fluorescence. For a better understanding of the environmental effects on nestlings' physiological condition, biomarkers can be measured in plasma and S9.

AB  - The Quaternary pteropod records published in the late 1990s from the Indian Ocean provided vital information on past oceanographic and climatic changes in this region. This paper reviews the published work on pteropod preservation and abundance in the Indian Ocean to evaluate the usefulness of this microfossil group in palaeoceanographic reconstructions. Their aragonitic shell chemistry makes them reliable indicators of ocean acidification, paleaoceanography and paleoclimate. An increased interest in studying this faunal group has arisen from recent findings on the vulnerability of aragonite shell preservation to human impacted water column chemistry changes. The compiled pteropod studies show that most of the pteropod databases contain information on abundance and distribution. However, the biogeochemical parameters and processes, such as aragonite production in the water column, their settling fluxes and the shell dissolution patterns are less explored. Despite the wide geographical range of pteropods and their significance in the marine food web, the ecology and taxonomy of the holoplanktonic gastropods in the Indian Ocean are poorly known. Though these pteropods are recovered in plankton tows (standing crop) and sediment traps (settling fluxes), the surface sediments in large parts of the northern Indian Ocean are completely devoid of them. Thus, assessing their fate in the water column and the sediment-water interface and their response to prevailing biogeochemical conditions are worth pursuing. Genomic studies and isotopic and elemental chemistry of living and fossil pteropods could help assess their response to ecological changes. To date, such modern techniques have been little utilized in studying Indian Ocean pteropods. A knowledge of their shell chemistry is crucial in the context of increased input of anthropogenic CO2 and the susceptibility of pteropod preservation to changing climate.

AB  - Successful interaction with the environment requires the dissociation of self-induced from externally induced sensory stimulation. Temporal proximity of action and effect is hereby often used as an indicator of whether an observed event should be interpreted as a result of own actions or not. We tested how the delay between an action (press of a touch bar) and an effect (onset of simulated self-motion) influences the processing of visually simulated self-motion in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) of macaque monkeys. We found that a delay between the action and the start of the self-motion stimulus led to a rise of activity above the baseline activity before motion onset in a subpopulation of 21% of the investigated neurons. In the responses to the stimulus, we found a significantly lower sustained activity when the press of a touch bar and the motion onset were contiguous compared to the condition when the motion onset was delayed. We speculate that this weak inhibitory effect might be part of a mechanism that sharpens the tuning of VIP neurons during self-induced motion and thus has the potential to increase the precision of heading information that is required to adjust the orientation of self-motion in everyday navigational tasks. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neurons in macaque ventral intraparietal area (VIP) are responding to sensory stimulation related to selfmotion, e.g. visual optic flow. Here, we found that self-motion induced activation depends on the sense of agency, i.e., it differed when optic flow was perceived as self- or externally induced. This demonstrates that area VIP is well suited for study of the interplay between active behavior and sensory processing during self-motion.

AB  - Green manures are a promising alternative for achieving the sustainable production of maize in the face of low soil fertility and increasingly long canicule periods, particularly in rainfed systems associated with the reproduction of local agrobiodiversity. However, it is necessary to investigate what are the advantages and disadvantages associated with different species of native and exotic pulse, as well as their overall contribution to the sustainable production of maize landraces. In order to do so, we followed the MESMIS method to assess five species of pulse (three native and two exotic) grown with maize in two plots with different soil conditions. This was done in the seasons of 2017 and 2018 the municipality of Villa de Zaachila, Oaxaca, a site with remarkable biological, agricultural and cultural diversity. A fully randomized complete block design was implemented with 11 treatments and three repetitions in the two plots. The output variables of the experiment were: land equivalence ratio, interspecific aggressiveness, content of soil organic matter, decomposition rate, plant survival rate and plant dry biomass. We also evaluated quantitative or qualitative indicators of cost, adaptability and contribution to food security. For all the possible maize-pulse combinations, except for one, polyculture outperformed maize and pulse monocultures. Exotic pulses (Crotalaria junscens spp. and Dolicho lablab) had a better performance in biomass, reincorporation of organic matter and possible nitrogen fixation, as well as greater resistance to drought in the second cycle. The native pulses (Phaseolus vulgaris and Phaseolus coccineus), however, had a greater acceptance and economic output and are important for the food security in our study site. Our results provide quantitative and qualitative elements to design combined schemes of green manures associated with maize that would help tackle current challenges regarding maize productivity, food security and response to climate change.

AB  - Intracellular pH (pHi) is a crucial parameter in cell biology; thus, a series of pH probes have been developed to determine pHi changes in living cells. However, more sensitive and non-perturbing ratiometric pH probes are needed for accurate pHi measurements. While the fluorescence of circular permutated YFP (cpYFP) is hypersensitive to pH changes due to its intrinsic properties, the single excitation peak of this protein restricts its capacity of becoming a rational type of pH sensor. Herein, we collected several cpYFP-based probes with dual excitation peaks and constructed their corresponding loss-of-function mutants to screen for a potential competent pH probe. The most sensitive probe was named NocPer. NocPer consists of cpYFP inserted into inactive-mutated GAF and AAA(+), which are two regulatory domains of E. coli NorR, a nitric oxide (NO)-specific transcription factor. Fluorescence emission of NocPer peaks at 517 nm while exhibiting dual excitation peaks at 420 and 495 nm, which can be used for ratiometric imaging. This new pH sensor has a large ratio response dynamic (pH range of 7.0-11.0), which covers the physiological pH range (pH 7.0-8.0), and exhibits an approximately 3-fold higher fluorescent signal in response to a pH increase from 7.0 to 8.0 than that of pHluorin. Using NocPer, we discovered a new biological phenomenon in which NO exposure decreases the E. coli pHi, which led to the hypothesis that pathogens decrease their own pHi during infection. Further, we elucidated that the NO-induced inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase in the respiratory chain is responsible for the decline in pHi, which might represent a protective strategy of E. coli under NO stress conditions. Our results demonstrated that NocPer is a ratiometric pH probe with high sensitivity for the physiological pH range.

AB  - Anthropogenic effects on the aquatic environment are ever present and ever increasing and while a plethora of aquatic contaminants are known to affect fishes, one ubiquitous and increasingly prevalent world-wide urban runoff pollutant is frequently disregarded, and that is pet waste. While dog waste has been identified as a significant factor contributing to bacteria and nutrient loading within receiving waters and the associated water quality changes are known to affect fishes, the impact of uncollected dog faeces on urban fish populations has never been directly investigated. In this study we exposed creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), a widespread tolerant stream minnow, to various realistic concentrations of dog waste as simulated urban park runoff testing both fresh and dried dog faeces in both stagnant and aerated water for 96 h to investigate the impact on fish survival and behaviour. Creek chub percentage mortality increased significantly relative to controls and across an exposure gradient and was likely caused by anoxic conditions. Survivors were initially smaller while those that died were initially larger and presented with abnormal abdominal subdermal lesions post-exposure. Additional indicators of physiological stress included significantly increased rates of aquatic surface respiration and changes in flume test derived swimming motivation metrics with increased exposure concentrations. Both mortality and behavioural responses were alleviated by aeration. Furthermore, trials with fresh and dried faeces differed only in time-to-death and swimming metrics where results from dried trials were similar to those from aerated experiments. Results demonstrated the impact that the global dog waste management problem can have on aquatic communities with effects on creek chub likely to be more severe for less pollution-tolerant species and also likely to be exacerbated under future scenarios that consider climate change and increased urbanization.

AB  - The purposes of this research were to study the characteristics chemistry of pH, anions and cations in rainwater, and to identify the possible sources that contributing to the acid precipitation during southwest monsoon season with occurrence of extreme drought event. During the southwest monsoon season, it normally occurs along with haze phenomenon that every year will hit Southeast Asia. This condition will aggravate with high acidic particles in the atmosphere due to the prolonged drought. The analysed parameters which involved pH, anions (NO3-, SO42- and Cl-) and cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) were analysed using pH meter, Hach DR 2800, argentometric method and ICP-OES. From the findings, it showed that acid rain occurred during the southwest monsoon season with the range of pH values from 4.95 +/- 0.13 to 6.40 +/- 0.03 and the total average of pH 5.71 +/- 0.32. Anions NO3-, SO42- and Cl- were found to be the dominant compositions of the acid rain occurrences with higher concentrations detected. In overall, rural area recorded with higher acidity of precipitation at total average of pH 5.54 +/- 0.39 compared to urban area at pH 5.77 +/- 0.26. Rural area surprisingly recorded higher frequency occurrences of acid rain with pH lesser than 5.6 and below compared to urban area. As for public health and safety, all rainwater samples during the acid rain event were found exceeded the allowable limits of NWQS and WHO standards, that shown not suitable for skin contact, recreational purposes even for drinking purposes.

AB  - Featured Application This research was designed to understand the effects of landfill soil gases on the events of subsurface landfill fires or elevated temperature which is experienced by many landfills during their operational and post-operational period. A framework proposed in this article can assist landfill authorities in controlling or preventing such hazardous incidents related to subsurface elevated thermal conditions. Subsurface temperature is a critical indicator for the identification of the risk associated with subsurface fire hazards in landfills. Most operational landfills in the United States (US) have experienced exothermic reactions in their subsurface. The subsurface landfill area is composed of various gases generated from chemical reactions inside the landfills. Federal laws in the US mandate the monitoring of gases in landfills to prevent hazardous events such as landfill fire breakouts. There are insufficient investigations conducted to identify the causes of landfill fire hazards. The objective of this research is to develop a methodological approach to this issue. In this study, the relationship was investigated between the subsurface elevated temperature (SET) and soil gases (i.e., methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and oxygen) with the greatest influence in landfills. The significance level of the effect of soil gases on the SET was assessed using a decision tree approach. A naive Bayes technique for conditional probability was implemented to investigate how different gas combinations can affect different temperature ranges with respect to the safe and unsafe states of these gases. The results indicate that methane and carbon dioxide gases are strongly associated with SETs. Among sixteen possible gas combinations, three were identified as the most probable predictors of SETs. A three-step risk assessment framework is proposed to identify the risk of landfill fire incidents. The key findings of this research could be beneficial to landfill authorities and better ensure the safety of the community health and environment.

AB  - Background Annual total Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP) and the annual total stored GPP and NPP are tightly coupled to land cover distributions because the distinct vegetation conditions of different land cover classes strongly affect GPP and NPP. Spatial and statistical analysis tools using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to investigate the spatial distribution of each land cover class and the GPP and NPP based on the CORINE land cover classification in the federal state, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany for the years 2000, 2006 and 2012. Results "Non-irrigated arable land" and "pastures" were the dominant land cover classes. Because of their large area, "non-irrigated arable land" and "pastures" had higher annual total stored GPP and NPP values than the other land cover classes. Annual total GPP and NPP hotspots were concentrated in the central-western part of Schleswig-Holstein. Cold spots were mainly located in the western and eastern Schleswig-Holstein. The distributions of the annual total GPP and NPP hotspots and cold spots were primarily determined by land cover and land cover changes among the investigated years. The average annual total NPP/GPP ratios were 0.5647, 0.5350 and 0.5573 in the years 2000, 2006 and 2012, respectively. The calculated respiration in 2006 was the highest, followed by those in 2012 and 2000. Conclusions The land cover classes with high-ability of carbon stocks in 2000, 2006 and 2012 in Schleswig-Holstein were identified in this study. Furthermore, it is recommendable to enhance the annual total GPP and NPP and the annual total stored GPP and NPP in Schleswig-Holstein by replacing the land cover classes showing low carbon stock capabilities with the classes showing high abilities for the purpose of increasing greenhouse gas fixation.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a trend analysis of three climate elements: precipitation, cloudiness and humidity. Almost the entire period of instrumental measurements (precipitation and humidity) and visual observations (cloudiness) are covered. In the observed 68-year period (1951-2018), the trend of annual and seasonal precipitation amounts is insignificant. Though, there is a significant decrease in the number of days with precipitation 1 mm, which implies a movement towards more arid conditions. On the other hand, the number of days with extreme rainfall >= 40 and 50 mm is increasing. In Podgorica, the annual statistics of days with snow cover decreases as well. There is also a decrease in the relative humidity and cloudiness, and with both elements the trend is insignificant only in the autumn season. The results of the trend calculation show that the number of gloomy days is more intensively reduced than the number of increasing bright days. In general, the results of the research show that the climate of Podgorica tends to be more arid with more extreme weather events. The climate variations happening in this city are, to small amount, caused by the urbanization process. Podgorica has the character of an urban heat island in a cooler environment, with an average annual intensity of about 0.7 degrees C and the highest in winter (about 0.8 degrees C). The most symptomatic indicator of urbanization is temperature, but anthropogenic heat production in the city (asphalt, constructions, increase of aerosols, etc.) also affects other climate elements. Compared to the non-urban environment, Podgorica has a higher annual rainfall of 100 mm and a lower humidity of 3%, while this difference is not noticeable in the overall cloudiness.

AB  - Coal combustion for thermal power generation causes serious environmental problems. Relatively efficient and clean coal utilization technologies need to be developed to alleviate the growing energy crisis and environmental pollution pressure. A novel integrated supercritical water gasification of coal system with 40 t/h throughput of coal and water was designed. A thermodynamic analysis and a life cycle environmental assessment under different conditions were performed using Aspen Plus 8.4 and SimaPro 9.0 based on the Ecoinvent 3 database, respectively. Results show that the maximum energy loss is induced by the waste heat of the effluent from the heat exchanger. By using organic Rankine cycle, the energy efficiency of the system could reach 53.3% when the temperature and coal concentration are 700 degrees C and 15 wt%, respectively. The global warming potential, acidification potential and nitrogen oxides are 0.058 kg carbon dioxide eq/(kW.h), 3.63 x 10(-4) kg sulfur dioxide eq/ (kW.h) and 7.04 x 10(-5) nitrogen oxides eq/(kW.h), respectively, for the process combined with carbon dioxide capture and storage under the temperature of 700 degrees C and the coal concentration of 15 wt%. The comparison of the thermodynamic and environmental performance among different systems shows that the exergy and energy efficiencies of integrated supercritical water gasification of coal system combined with organic Rankine cycle are higher than those of integrated gasification combined cycle, and the environmental emissions of the integrated supercritical water gasification of coal system are less than those of integrated gasification combined cycle system. This study reveals that the integrated supercritical water gasification of coal is a relatively clean and efficient coal utilization technology with good industrialization prospects.

AB  - Cumulus olivine from the Babbitt deposit in the troctolitic Bathtub intrusion (Duluth Complex) contains abundant CH4-rich fluid inclusions with common hydrous silicate and carbonate precipitates at their inclusion walls. Given the active rifting environment in which magma of the Duluth Complex (1.1 Ga) has intruded as repeated pulses, fluid inclusions in olivine are traceable throughout an entire stratigraphic drill core section with comparable textural features that enable a classification of three generations: (1) primary CH4-rich fluid inclusions oriented parallel to growth planes of olivine or arranged in clusters; (2) intragranular fluid inclusion planes of CH4-rich fluid inclusions extending towards grain boundaries and (3) transgranular fluid inclusion planes of CH4-rich fluid inclusions, closely associated with serpentinization. The hydrous minerals and carbonates contained in fluid inclusions of generations (1) and (2) indicate that original constituents of the early homogenous magmatic fluid must have been H2O and CO2. Upon cooling (below 700 degrees C), at fixed P-fluid (2 kbar) and fO(2)(fluid) at or below QFM conditions, an increase of X-CH4 at the expense of CO2 results in the CH4-rich chemistry of the fluid. The formation of late secondary fluid inclusion planes of generation (3) is related to extensive magma-country rock interaction. These inclusions contain no solids and their composition reflects the reduction of CO2 to CH4 during serpentinization in an upper stability limit of 620 degrees C. This study emphasizes fluid inclusions as powerful indicators in remodeling chemical changes of the magmatic fluid during crystallization of cumulus phases, magma-country rock interaction and subsequent alteration.

AB  - In the process of rapid urbanization, air environment quality has become a hot issue. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used to monitor air pollution effectively. In this paper, the Spearman coefficient is used to analyze the correlations between AOD and urban development, construction factors, and geographical environment factors in Shandong Province. The correlation between AOD and local climatic conditions in Shandong Province is analyzed by geographic weight regression (GWR). The results show that in the time period from 2007 to 2017, the AOD first rose and then fell, reaching its highest level in 2012, which is basically consistent with the time when the national environmental protection decree was issued. In terms of quarterly and monthly changes, AOD also rose first and then fell, the highest level in summer, with the highest monthly value occurring in June. In term of the spatial distribution, the high-value area is located in the northwestern part of Shandong Province, and the low-value area is located in the eastern coastal area. In terms of social factors, the correlation between pollutant emissions and AOD is much greater the correlations between AOD and population, economy, and construction indicators. In terms of environmental factors, the relationship between digital elevation model (DEM), temperature, precipitation, and AOD is significant, but the regulation of air in coastal areas is even greater. Finally, it was found that there are no obvious differences in AOD among cities with different development levels, which indicates that urban development does not inevitably lead to air pollution. Reasonable development planning and the introduction of targeted environmental protection policies can effectively alleviate pollution-related problems in the process of urbanization.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluation of the suitability of broiler chicken and turkey commercial feed mixes in the diets of grey partridge (Perdix perdix L.) during the rearing period. The study was carried out on a farm authorized by the Minister of the Environment to conduct breeding and farming of grey partridge, DL Pgl-6713-23/15852/13/RN dated 24 April 2013. The research material consisted of grey partridge chicks assigned to two groups: one, fed the complete feed mix for turkeys IB-1 till 4 weeks of rearing, followed by the complete feed mix for turkeys B-2 from 5 weeks on (group I, n = 22) and the other, fed the complete feed DKA-Starter for broiler chickens (group II, n = 22). The rearing cycle took 8 weeks. Observations within the experiment included deaths records and monitoring of health status, body weight, feed intake and maintenance conditions. Better parameters of partridges rearing were attained as a result of IB feeding. Birds fed with IB-1 and IB-2 feed mixes showed a higher body weight, as compared to chicks fed DKA-Starter (DKA-S). The difference persisted from the first week of rearing to the end of the feeding trial (respectively 0.32 g and 4.59 g). From day 1 until 8 weeks of age, partridges fed the IB feed showed greater average daily gains (4.17 g), a faster rate of growth (181.67%) and a greater final body weight, all at a lower feed intake compared to those fed mix with DKA-S. It has been found that the IB feed mix can successfully be used in the nutrition of grey partridges.

AB  - High-resolution grain-size investigations were carried out in two SW Polish loess sections: Bialy Kosciol (Niemcza-Strzelin Hills) and Zaprezyn (Trzebnica Hills). Each sequence was sampled by using the same methodology and samples were taken at 5 centimeters intervals. The particle size distribution was obtained with a Mastersizer 2000 laser, used for diffraction methods. From the obtained results the basic parameters and grain size indicators were calculated: Mz, Grain Size Index ratio, U-ratio and the percentage content of clay (< 4 mu m) and sand (> 63 mu m). Both loess-soil sequences are composed of interfluve and slope loess facies and consist of five litho-pedostratigraphic units developed during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene: two loess units L1LL1, L1LL2 and three polygenetic fossil soils sets S0, S1 and L1SS1. The distance between these two profiles is about 60 km. Zaprezyn, as a section located more to the north, has almost no lower younger loess and higher level of weathering which could be related to proximity of this site to the Ice Sheet margin. The climate here was more extreme and harsh. What is more, the difference in development of soil L1SS1 can be observed: while in Bialy Kosciol pedogenesis process was slower and less disturbed than in Zaprezyn. The upper part of L1SS1 in Bialy Kosciol was deformed by gelifluction, frost heave and other periglacial processes. Mz indicator by the grain-size distribution in these sediments reflects subtle variations in the climatic system. Moreover, in Zaprezyn the content of sand fraction is higher than in Bialy Kosciol what can be the evidence of short episodes of strong winds during cold period of sedimentation. The aim of this paper is to compare two loess profiles by their stratigraphical and lithological similarities which are result of climate conditions and features of surrounding environment.

AB  - Soil biota are a major component of agroecosystems, playing a decisive role in ecosystem services with synergistic effects on crop production. The conservation of their diversity has become a key component of a strategy towards agricultural sustainability. Over four years (2010-2014), under the "SOil Functional diversity as an Indicator of sustainable management of Agroecosystems" (SOFIA) project, we followed soil Collembola assemblages in response to the set-up of 5 cropping systems differing in crop rotations (annual or perennial), rate of N fertilization, and in tillage intensity (annual ploughing vs. shallow). Our results demonstrated that shifting from a conventional to conservation cropping system had a strong positive effect upon species richness and density of Collembola. Specifically, all treatments with a reduction in intensity of soil tillage fostered Collembola assemblages. At the end of our study, density and species richness were 3 to 4 times higher in reduced tillage (RT) than in conventional tillage (CT). Nevertheless, differentiation between the assemblages only occurred after 2 years but steadily increased until 4 years. At the last sampling date, all treatments contained significantly different Collembola assemblages (Anosim with Bray-Curtis distance). In parallel, we noticed shifts in the functional structure of the assemblages, even if globally, all life-forms were promoted under reduced tillage. However, contrary to our expectations, euedaphic Collembola were not promoted by restitution of crop residues. Our study over several years under field conditions showed that Collembola assemblages were more sensitive to tillage intensity than to either residue management or N fertilization. Clearly, conservation agriculture can foster one of the numerous services provided by the soil compartment, namely the soil biodiversity and therefore improve soil quality and health.

AB  - By using the standard climate in Beijing during 2000-2010 as baseline, a current and warming contrast experiment was conducted with the Water Transformation Dynamical Processes Experimental Device (WATDPED) to quantify the responses of a maize system to warming in terms of growth and water consumption. Under 2 degrees C warming, the maize growth period was shortened by 8 days. Chlorophyll content and N content of leaves were enhanced but C content and C/N ratio were decreased. Similarly, there were slight decreases in plant height and stem diameter. The stalk biomass component decreased in leaf and stem ratio, whenever increase in ear ratio over the total biomass. The 100-seed weight and yield were enhanced slightly as a result of the increase of net photosynthesis rate and the decrease of leaf area index. Although the daily evapotranspiration was increased, the total water consumption over the entire growth period was decreased mainly due to the shortened growth period. The values of water use efficiency leaf scale, ecosystem scale (irrigation water use efficiency), and ecosystem scale (evapotranspiration efficiency) were boosted to 28.88%, 6.78% and 5.38%, respectively. It was concluded from the experiments that under 2 degrees C warming at the p = 0.05 significant level, maize's yield did not change but the size of maize became smaller in terms of stalk diameter and biomass was higher on the ear. It showed a stronger physiological vigor (higher N content and chlorophyll content) plus a lower total water consumption. Maize's responses to warming were shown diversified and ensemble assessment by using multiple indicators including yield, biomass component, nutrient and water consumption among others is recommended.

AB  - The present work describes a multi-residue SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method aiming at the characterization of 68 compounds in natural waters, including parent compounds as well as their major metabolites and glucuronide conjugates. Development was conducted toward the quantitative determination of a broad range of analytes belonging to different class of psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, stimulants, opiates and opioids, anticonvulsants, anti-dementia drugs, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (as anthropic indicators) in the low ng L-1 range of concentration. Satisfactory extraction recoveries >70% were obtained for the majority of analytes (49 out of 68) allowing low limits of quantification. LOQranged between 0.1 and 17.8 ng L-1 and were lower than 5 ng L-1 for 94% of investigated analytes. Furthermore, addition of 25 isotopic labeled standards allowed to ensure reliability of the optimized method. Quantification errors were typically below 15% with relative standard variations <10% in intermediate precision conditions. Finally, the developed method was implemented in natural waters; sampling campaigns were conducted in the Seine River as a demonstration of the applicability and adequation of the method for its purpose. As a result, 48 out of 68 analytes were identified or quantified; some of them like memantine, rivastigmine, zolpidem 4-phenyl-carboxylic acid, zolpidem 6-carboxylic acid for one of the first time in surface waters. Among investigated psychotropic compounds and metabolites, tramadol, codeine, oxazepam, venlafaxine, 0-desmethylvenlafaxine, gabapentin, carbamazepine and I 0,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine were found to be the most abundant.

AB  - Hamilton Harbour, located on the western end of Lake Ontario, has a long history of cultural eutrophication as well as industrial contamination. We explored the structure and function of the microbial - planktonic foodweb during the growing seasons (May-October) of 2004 and 2006 in order to consider the flow of autochthonous production from lower to higher trophic levels. Our analyses included microscope based assessments of bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, phytoplankton and zooplankton as well as radioisotope based measurements of primary productivity and bacterial growth. While routine measures of total phosphorus (avg: 25-33 mu g l(-1)) and chlorophyll a (avg: 12-15 mu g l(-1)) were indicative of eutrophy, mean phytoplankton biomass in 2004 (2.0 g m(-3)) and 2006 (2.2 g m(-3)) suggested mesotrophic conditions. However, the appearance of algal blooms in the summer of 2006 was an obvious indicator of cultural eutrophication. With respect to the microbial planktonic foodweb, the organic carbon pool increased from a mean of 757.5 mg C m(-3) in 2004 to 1160.3 mg C m(-3) in 2006 and this increase was almost evenly split between autotrophs (198.7 mg C m(-3)) and heterotrophs (204.1 mg C m(-3)). The increased autotrophic carbon is readily attributable to the observed algal blooms driven by warmer temperatures and higher concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus. However, the increase in heterotrophic carbon, primarily heterotrophic nanoflagellates, was apparent from the earliest observations in 2006 and remained consistently high throughout the year. We hypothesize that the increased heterotrophic carbon was the consequence of increased allochthonous carbon being shunted through the microbial foodweb; the energy generated was not likely transferred to zooplankton and passed on to higher trophic levels. More research into the dynamics of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon in eutrophic environments is called for.

AB  - Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation between daily increases in airborne particulate matter (PM) concentration and the occurrence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Transition metals present in air PM were associated with adverse health effects after PM exposure. The aim of this work was to study lung O-2 metabolism after an acute exposure to transition metal-coated nanoparticles (NPs). Female Swiss mice (25 g) were intranasally instilled with a suspension of silica NP containing Ni (II), Cd (II), Fe (III), or Cr (VI) at 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 1.0 mg metal/kg body weight. Lung O-2 consumption was found to be significantly increased after the exposure to most doses of Ni-NP and Fe-NP, and the 0.05 mg metal/kg body weight dose of Cr-NP, while no changes were observed for Cd-NP. Lucigenin chemiluminescence (as an indicator of NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Only Ni-NP and Fe-NP have shown the ability to induce a significant increase in lucigenin chemiluminescence. In order to establish the possible occurrence of pulmonary oxidative stress, TBARS levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio were determined. The higher doses of Ni-NP and Fe-NP were able to induce an oxidative stress condition, as shown by changes in both TBARS levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Taken together, the present results show differential effects for all the metals tested. These findings emphasize the importance of transition metals present air PM in PM adverse health effects, and contribute to the understanding of the pathological mechanisms triggered by the exposure to environmental PM.

AB  - Recent archaeological studies in the Lori Depression of Armenia (Lesser Caucasus) revealed a series of multilevel Early Paleolithic (Acheulian) sites belonging to the Early-Middle Pleistocene stage of occupation of the Caucasus. In the uppermost layers of these sites, the paleosols and sediments contain carbonate features (CFs) whereas the lower layers are absolutely free from carbonates. The aim of this work is to examine the role of detected CFs as an indicator for reconstructions of the Early-Middle Pleistocene paleoenvironments, to determine the source, time and conditions of carbonates' accumulation in initially non-calcareous and high-degree weathered humid paleosols. Three sections were studied: Kurtan I, points 1-2 and Muradovo. There are different forms of CFs represented by the calcified root cells in the layer 1, the hard nodules in the layer 2 and the laminae-like carbonates in the layer 3 of the sites studied. All the CFs are of the aqueous (hydrogenic) origin. The CFs of the uppermost layers 1 and 2 in the Kurtan I, point 2 were accumulated in the Holocene lake. The calcified root cells were formed on the swamp shore whereas the hard nodules on the lake bottom under stagnant water. The laminae like carbonates in the layer 3 were accumulated in the Kurtan I and Muradovo sections due to strong erosion cycle(s) in the Late Pleistocene interglacial period(s) that led to the limestone scour in the region by ground and surface water. They reflect the earliest stage of the allochthonous carbonate accumulation in the area dated by radiocarbon method to approximately 20 ka cal BR Therefore, all the CFs cannot be regarded as indicative of Early and Middle Pleistocene environmental changes, as they appeared in the uppermost layers of the studied sections much later than the time of formation for the surrounding groundmass.

AB  - In natural conditions cereals can be infested by pathogenic fungi. These can reduce the grain yield and quality by contamination with mycotoxins which are harmful for plants, animals, and humans. To date, performed studies of the compounds profile have allowed for the distinction of individual species of fungi. The aim of this study was to determine the profile of volatile compounds and trichothecenes of group B, ergosterol, adenosine triphosphate content carried out on a representative sample of 16 genotypes of related cereals: triticale, bread wheat, and durum wheat. Based on an analysis of volatile compounds by means of gas chromatography mass spectrometry and with the use of an electronic nose, volatile profiles for cereals were determined. Differentiation is presented at four levels through discriminant analysis, heatmaps, principal component analysis (PCA), and electronic nose maps. The statistical model was built by subsequent incorporation of chemical groups such as trichothecenes (GC/MS), fungal biomass indicators ergosterol (HPLC) and ATP (luminometric) and volatiles. The results of the discriminatory analyses showed that the volatile metabolites most markedly differentiated grain samples, among which were mainly: lilial, trichodiene, p-xylene. Electronic nose analysis made it possible to completely separate all the analyzed cereals based only on 100 ions from the 50-150 m/z range. The research carried out using chemometric analysis indicated significant differences in the volatile metabolites present in the grain of bread wheat, durum wheat and triticale. The end result of the performed analyses was a complete discrimination of the examined cereals based on the metabolites present in their grain.

AB  - Removal of effluent organic matter (EfOM) from a wastewater secondary effluent by aluminum sulfate (alum) coagulation and its effects on haloacetic acid (HAA) formation were studied in the range of alum dose 0-120 mg/L and the pH range 4.0-9.0. Surrogate parameters, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV254, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and fluorescence regional integration method were employed to evaluate organic removal efficiency. Results indicated that incomplete coagulation noticeably increased HAA formation in treated effluent and that enhanced coagulation significantly reduced disinfection byproducts (DBPs) precursors. pH control was more important for reducing DBP formation than coagulant dosage in terms of precursor removal from the EfOM. Under the same coagulation conditions, removal efficiencies of DOC, UV254, and SUVA were very different, but all reached their maximum values at pH 6. Removal efficiency of EfOM by coagulation was not as high as that reported for natural organic matter removal in water treatment. This is likely due to the unique nature of the EfOM characterized by the inclusion of soluble recalcitrant microbial products in the effluent. In contrast to what was observed in water treatment, UV254 was found to be a better indicator for the precursor of HAA formation for the wastewater effluent. Dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid were the major species generated following chlorination of both the raw and treated effluent. Presence of bromide and iodide ions in solution increased formation of fractions of bromo-or iodoacetic acids and also total haloacetic acids (THAA) following chlorination after alum coagulation at all pH values. Minimum THAA formation was observed at the optimum coagulation pH of 6 regardless of addition of bromide ions and iodide ions.

AB  - During cold periods in the Quaternary, the intracontinental Pannonian Basin was part of the European periglacial zone, and aeolian erosion had a profound effect in shaping the landscape. Geomorphologically most effective winds were channelled between the Alps and Carpathians and entered the Pannonian Basin from the NW. To assess the nature of meteorological conditions producing these winds, field studies were carried out in the foreland of the basin entrance, in eastern Austria.
   As a result, we report on the first bedrock ventifacts from Austria and aeolian sand occurrence in the Bohemian Massif. Through a compilation of published data and field work, the distribution of ventifacts was mapped and appears to be controlled primarily by available lithologies. Palaeo-wind directions were identified using mesoforms of bedrock ventifacts, especially flutes. The acquired air flow directions are accordant with the orientation of erosional landforms on soft sediments and form a coherent system, with westerly to north-westerly winds in the west, which turn towards the entrance of the Pannonian Basin in the east. There are no directions referring to the direct influence of katabatic winds produced on the ice sheet, instead, the wind system must have been driven by synoptic-scale patterns like the polar front. The narrow distribution of wind directions suggests that the low-altitude air flow system was relatively stable even without a funnelling topography as in the Pannonian Basin, though the Alps could have acted to deflect the winds. OSL data from the Bohemian Massif indicate aeolian sand movement during the Late Pleistocene. The results provide data for aeolian transport studies, among them for loess provenance analyses and can be used as input for climate models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emotional state can influence decision-making under ambiguity. Cognitive bias tests (CBT) proved to be a promising indicator of the affective valence of animals in a context of farm animal welfare. Although it is well-known that humans can influence the intensity of fear and reactions of animals, research on cognitive bias often focusses on housing and management conditions and neglects the role of humans on emotional states of animals. The present study aimed at investigating whether humans can modulate the emotional state of weaned piglets. Fifty-four piglets received a chronic experience with humans: gentle (GEN), rough (ROU) or minimal contact (MIN). Simultaneously, they were individually trained on a go/no-go task to discriminate a positive auditory cue, associated with food reward in a trough, from a negative one, associated with punishments (e.g. water spray). Independently of the treatment (P = 0.82), 59% of piglets completed the training. Successfully trained piglets were then subjected to CBT, including ambiguous cues in presence or absence of a human observer. As hypothesized, GEN piglets showed a positive judgement bias, as shown by their higher percentage of go responses following an ambiguous cue compared to ROU (P = 0.03) and MIN (P = 0.02) piglets, whereas ROU and MIN piglets did not differ (P > 0.10). The presence of an observer during CBT did not modulate the percentage of go responses following an ambiguous cue (P > 0.10). However, regardless of the treatment, piglets spent less time in contact with the trough following positive cues during CBT in which the observer was present than absent (P < 0.0001). This study originally demonstrates that the nature of a chronic experience with humans can induce a judgement bias indicating that the emotional state of farm animals such as piglets can be affected by the way humans interact with them.

AB  - The present study was focused upon the assessment of acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) activity in the digestive gland (main metabolic center) and foot (highly innervated organ) of the green garden snail, Cantareus apertus (Born, 1778), exposed to different nominal dietary concentrations of Pb (25 and 2500 mg Pb/Kg), Cd (10 and 100 mg Cd/Kg) and their combination (25 mg Pb + 10 mg Cd/Kg and 2500 mg Pb + 100 mg Cd/Kg) for 60 days. AChE activity was lower in the foot than in the digestive gland (similar to 50%) and decreased with experimental time in both tissues. In metal treated snails, AChE activity was significantly decreased in both tissues to a 50-60% of the values recorded in control snails. This decrease followed a dose depending trend at each exposure time, albeit the response was attenuated at the long-term (60 d) in comparison with the short-term (7 d). Besides, the combination of both metals provoked interactive effects not seemingly related with the tissue levels of the metals. Thus, it was concluded that model toxic metals such as Pd and Cd cause a reduction in AChE activity in both studied tissues, more markedly at the short-term, although antagonistic effects were elicited by both metals in combination. As a whole, lowered AChE activity in C. apertus can be considered as a useful biomarker of the effects provoked by metals on cell signaling and therefore it may be suitable for ecosystem health assessment in metal polluted soils using this species as sentinel organism.

AB  - Faecal pellet count is an indirect census method used to estimate the density of an animal population. Factors that affect the accuracy and precision of this method are the defecation rate, the decay time and the detectability of the droppings. In this study, we analysed the influence of some variables on the detectability of droppings: (i) environmental variables, EV (vegetation type, grass height, meteorological conditions); (ii) subjective variables, SV (operator, subjective visibility); (iii) faeces-species related variables, SRV (Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758; Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758 and Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778). The average values of dropping detectability, expressed as percentage of observations from the minimum detectability (0) to the maximum (1), were: 0.99 (SD=0.07) for red deer faeces; 0.93 (SD=0.16) for roe deer faeces; 0.89 (SD=0.21) for European brown hare faeces. The red deer detectability value was statistically higher than the roe deer and European brown hare values (X-2=26.61, df=2, p<0.01). A generalised linear model (GLM) analysis shows that the variables which negatively affect the dropping detectability are different for the three species: (i) vegetation type, especially deciduous forest, for the red deer; (ii) grass height for the European brown hare; (iii) subjective visibility, especially the category "none", for the roe deer. These results suggest that the characteristics of both the study area and the species considered could affect the detectability of droppings, and therefore also the entire estimation density. So, faecal pellet count monitoring programmes should carefully take into account the environmental characteristics and should be performed when detectability is maximised (e.g. short grass, fewer leaves, less undergrowth).

AB  - This work analyses the distribution of living benthic foraminiferal assemblages of surface sediments in different intertidal areas of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), a polihaline and anthropized coastal lagoon. The relationships among foraminiferal assemblages in association with environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, Eh and pH), grain size, the quantity and quality of organic matter (enrichment in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids), pollution caused by metals, and mineralogical data are studied in an attempt to identify indicators of adaptability to environmental stress. In particular, concentrations of selected metals in the surficial sediment are investigated to assess environmental pollution levels that are further synthetically parameterised by the Pollution Load Index (PLI). The PLI variations allowed the identification of five main polluted areas. Concentrations of metals were also analysed in three extracted phases to evaluate their possible mobility, bioavailability and toxicity in the surficial sediment. Polluted sediment in the form of both organic matter and metals can be found in the most confined zones. Whereas enrichment in organic matter and related biopolymers causes an increase in foraminifera density, pollution by metals leads to a decline in foraminiferal abundance and diversity in those zones. The first situation may be justified by the existence of opportunistic species (with high reproduction rate) that can live in low oxic conditions. The second is explained by the sensitivity of some species to pressure caused by metals. The quality of the organic matter found in these places and the option of a different food source should also explain the tolerance of several species to pollution caused by metals, despite their low reproductive rate in the most polluted areas. In this study, species that are sensitive and tolerant to organic matter and metal enrichment are identified, as is the differential sensitivity/tolerance of some species to metals enrichment.

AB  - Background and aims - Gomphonema parvulum sensu lato contains a number of morphologically distinguishable varieties and forms that also show variation in their distribution and ecological ranges. As part of a study to investigate the ecophysiology of this taxon in relation to its use as a bio-indicator, clones from a range of sites in the UK were established and maintained in culture, monitoring their growth and morphology over extended periods of time.
   Methods - Clonal cultures of strains of G. parvulum were isolated and maintained in liquid medium under standard conditions, harvesting old cultures after each sub-culturing event. Wall morphology was monitored by light microscopy of permanent preparations, and a number of morphometric measurements obtained.
   Results - Four clones identified as belonging to two different varieties of G. parvulum, underwent autogamous sexual reproduction in culture, producing auxospores and initial cells, and then continuing to reproduce vegetatively. The two varieties gave rise to morphologically different cells that were identified as different Gomphonema species, i.e. G. gracile and G. hebridense. Continued culturing resulted in cell size reduction and changes in morphology towards that of the original isolates.
   Conclusions - Cells identified as part of G. parvulum sensu lato represent one end of the morphological spectra of taxa that also exhibit morphologies that would be assigned to other Gomphonema species. The morphological range of these taxa has previously been inadequately documented and species definitions must be re-visited. Any nomenclatural revision must follow priority rules, but it will be necessary to check type material of all the relevant species before making any nomenclatural changes. The ecological tolerances of the taxa involved should also be re-evaluated; it is improbable that cells at the opposite ends of the morphological spectra have different ecological responses.

AB  - Background: Irradiation with light wavelengths from the far red (FR) to the near infrared (NIR) spectrum (600 nm -1000 nm) has been shown to have beneficial effects in several disease models. In this study, we aim to examine whether 670 nm red light pretreatment can provide protection against hyperoxia-induced damage in the C57BL/6J mouse retina. Adult mice (90-110 days) were pretreated with 9 J/cm(2) of 670 nm light once daily for 5 consecutive days prior to being placed in hyperoxic environment (75% oxygen). Control groups were exposed to hyperoxia, but received no 670 nm light pretreatment. Retinas were collected after 0, 3, 7, 10 or 14 days of hyperoxia exposure (n = 12/group) and prepared either for histological analysis, or RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Photoreceptor damage and loss were quantified by counting photoreceptors undergoing cell death and measuring photoreceptor layer thickness. Localization of acrolein, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (Cox Va) were identified through immunohistochemistry. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1), complement component 3 (C3) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf-2) genes were quantified using qPCR.
   Results: The hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor loss was accompanied by reduction of metabolic marker, Cox Va, and increased expression of oxidative stress indicator, acrolein and Hmox-1. Pretreatment with 670 nm red light reduced expression of markers of oxidative stress and C3, and slowed, but did not prevent, photoreceptor loss over the time course of hyperoxia exposure.
   Conclusion: The damaging effects of hyperoxia on photoreceptors were ameliorated following pretreatment with 670 nm light in hyperoxic mouse retinas. These results suggest that pretreatment with 670 nm light may provide stability to photoreceptors in conditions of oxidative stress.

AB  - This study provides evidence on the sources and pathways of trace-metal contamination using isotopic tracers, delta S-34 of dissolved sulfate and Pb-206/Pb-207 of suspended particulate matter (SPM), in an urban French river. The trace-metal contamination of the Urge River watershed was correlated with a highly contrasted land-use pattern with mainly forests and agricultural lands upstream and a highly dense urban area (up to 8000 inhabitants/km(2)) downstream in the suburbs of the Parisian megacity. The increase in the sulfate concentrations (0.25-1 mmol/l) of the dissolved compartment (<0.45 mu m) monitored during a hydrological year (2010/2011) correlated with the dissolved sulfate delta S-34 and delta O-18 ratios (+2 to +12 and +6 to +13 parts per thousand, respectively). This result indicated that the runoff and sewage waters are important sources of water in the river, particularly for the highly urbanized sites. The lead enrichment factor in the SPM was observed to increase according to the urbanization gradient (1 to 6), and the associated Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio indicated that the signature of the lead-bearing particles transformed from a three-endmember system (2001 samples) to a two-endmember one (2010/2011 samples) over the last decade. These results suggest that gasoline-originated lead has disappeared from particulate fluxes since the lead additive prohibition in 2000. The lead-bearing species in the Urge River were also observed to originate mainly from urban activities, and the reactivity of selected urban lead-bearing species is discussed based on microscopic observations. Finally, coupling the delta S-34 and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios provided a powerful indicator of urban influence as a function of both river hydrodynamics and physico-chemical conditions.

AB  - The effect of packaging treatments on the attributes of commercial fresh chorizo sausages during chilled storage was studied. Four different types of commercial packaging were tested, namely, overwrapping, vacuum packaging and modified atmosphere packaging using 20%CO2/80%N2 (CO2/N2) or 30%CO2/70% argon (CO2/Ar). Characteristics of product were evaluated through pH levels, microbial growth, biogenic amines (BAs) formation, and sensory analysis. The sausages had high levels of lactic acid bacteria and total viable counts, which increased slightly (P < 0.05) on day 7 and then stabilized until the end of storage, without differences (P > 0.05) between lots. Except for spermidine and spermine, BA levels in the product were generally low. BA increased gradually over the storage period, but this trend could not be clearly related to microbial population levels. Overall acceptability decreased over the storage period, the highest scores (P < 0.05) were recorded for the unopened packages of the lots CO2/N2 and CO2/Ar. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This original research contains valuable data about the effect of different packaging conditions (overwrapping, vacuum packaging and modified atmosphere packaging using 20% CO2/80% N2 (CO2/N2) or 30% CO2/70% argon (CO2/Ar) on commercial fresh sausages during chilled storage. These types of packaging are currently used by the industry; however, their effects on microbiological quality, biogenic amine formation and sensory changes in commercial fresh pork sausages (chorizo) have not been evaluated. Biogenic amines present interest for two reasons. They may be indicators of quality in some foods also intake of foods containing high concentrations of biogenic amines may represent a health hazard as a result of the direct toxic effects of these compounds and/or their interactions with certain medicines. The results are practical in nature and are useful both for the industry and the research.

AB  - To examine if chronic exposure of feral fish to elevated Pb concentrations in the river water (up to 1 mu g L-1), which are still lower than European recommendations for dissolved Pb in surface waters (7.2 mu g L-1; EPCEU (Official J L 348:84, 2008)), would result in Pb accumulation in selected fish tissues.
   Lead concentrations were determined by use of HR ICP-MS in the gill and hepatic soluble fractions of European chub (Squalius cephalus) caught in the Sutla River (Croatia-Slovenia).
   At the site with increased dissolved Pb in the river water, soluble gill Pb levels (17.3 mu g L-1) were approximately 20 times higher compared to uncontaminated sites (0.85 mu g L-1), whereas the ratio between contaminated (18.1 mu g L-1) and uncontaminated sites (1.17 mu g L-1) was lower for liver (15.5). Physiological variability of basal Pb concentrations in soluble gill and hepatic fractions associated to fish size, condition, sex, or age was not observed, excluding the possibility that Pb increase in chub tissues at contaminated site could be the consequence of studied biotic parameters. However, in both tissues of Pb-exposed specimens, females accumulated somewhat more Pb than males, making female chubs potentially more susceptible to possible toxic effects.
   The fact that Pb increase in gill and hepatic soluble fractions of the European chub was not caused by biotic factors and was spatially restricted to one site with increased dissolved Pb concentration in the river water points to the applicability of this parameter as early indicator of Pb exposure in monitoring of natural waters.

AB  - High-resolution sedimentary records of major and minor elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Sr, Ti), total organic carbon (TOC), and profiles of pore water constituents (SO42+, CH4, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, alkalinity) were obtained for two gravity cores (core 755, 501 m water depth and core 214, 1686 m water depth) from the northwestern Black Sea. The records were examined in order to gain insight into the cycling of Ba in anoxic marine sediments characterized by a shallow sulfate-methane transition (SMT) as well as the applicability of barite as a primary productivity proxy in such a setting. The Ba records are strongly overprinted by diagenetic barite (BaSO4) precipitation and remobilization; authigenic Ba enrichments were found at both sites at and slightly above the current SMT. Transport reaction modeling was applied to simulate the migration of the SMT during the changing geochemical conditions after the Holocene seawater intrusion into the Black Sea. Based on this, sediment intervals affected by diagenetic Ba redistribution were identified. Results reveal that the intense overprint of Ba and Baxs (Ba excess above detrital average) strongly limits its correlation to primary productivity. These findings have implications for other modern and ancient anoxic basins, such as sections covering the Oceanic Anoxic Events which Ba is frequently used as a primary productivity indicator. Our study also demonstrates the limitations concerning the use of Baxs as a tracer for downward migrations of the SMT: due to high sedimentation rates at the investigated sites, diagenetic barite fronts are buried below the SMT within a relatively short period. Thus, 'relict' barite fronts would only be preserved for a few thousands of years, if at all. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to review nitrogen (N) controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) research methods used to measure nutrient release from CRFs. If CRF-N release patterns match vegetable crop needs, crop N uptake may become more efficient, thus resulting in similar or greater yields, reduced fertilizer N needs, and reduced environmental N losses. Three methods categories to estimate N release are: laboratory; growth chamber, greenhouse, or both; and field methods. Laboratory methods include a standard and accelerated temperature-controlled incubation methods (TCIMs); methods incubate CRF using selected time periods, temperatures, and/or sampling methods. Accelerated TCIMs, in contrast to the standard method, allow for shorter incubation periods. Growth chamber and greenhouse methods, including column and plastic bag studies, may be used to test new CRF products in conditions similar to particular vegetable production systems. However, the column method predicts N release from CRFs more effectively than the plastic bag method because of ammonia volatilization and lower N recovery rates associated with the bag method. Both field methods, pot-in-pot and pouch methods, are viable vegetable research options. The pouch method measures N remaining in the CRF prill and the pot-in-pot method measures N released from the CRY, thus each method can be applied to different research objectives. Nitrogen released during incubation may be measured using methods such as total Kjeldahl N (TKN), prill weight loss, combustion, colorirnetric, or ion-specific electrodes. The prill weight loss method is the least expensive but can only be used with urea CRF. Thus, the CRF-N source(s) and research objectives will determine the appropriate N analysis method. More research needs to be completed on correlations of field and laboratory CRY extractions. Field release methods should be considered the most reliable indicator of CRF-N performance until a laboratory method reliably predicts CRF-N expected field response.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the widely used anti-depressant fluoxetine on behaviour (locomotion), moulting, neuromuscular transmission, energy production and anti-oxidant defences' efficiency of the epibenthic crab Carcinus mamas. Crabs were individually exposed to fluoxetine concentrations for 7 d. Effects on locomotion were assessed at the end of the exposure using an open field test adapted to C. maenas in the present study. Tissue samples were later collected to evaluate fluoxetine effects on physiological functions using the activity of key enzymes and other parameters as biomarkers, namely: N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in the epidermis (moulting) and the hepatopancreas; cholinesterases (ChE) in muscle (neuromuscular cholinergic transmission); NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and lactate dehydrogenease (LDH) in muscle (energy production); glutathione S-transferases (GST) in hepatopancreas (biotransformation and oxidative stress system); glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidade (GPx), total glutathione levels (TG) and lipid peroxidation levels in the hepatopancreas (anti-oxidant defences and oxidative damage). Because no information on C. maenas NAGase activity was previously available, its variation during the moult cycle was also investigated. The results showed that locomotion was significantly increased at fluoxetine concentrations equal or above 120 mu g L-1, with animals spending more time moving, walking longer distances than controls. Levels of NAGase activity were found to vary in relation to C. maenas moult cycle, but no alterations were observed after exposure to fluoxetine. Significant increases in the activity of ChE, GST and GR enzymes, and the levels of TG were found, with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 120 mu g L-1. Effects on locomotion were significantly and positively correlated to those induced on ChE activity. The results raise concern when hypothesising conditions of chronic exposure in the wild.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are products of the incomplete combustion of organic materials and, therefore, occur ubiquitously in the environment and also in tobacco smoke. Since some PAH have been classified as carcinogens, it is important to have access to suitable analytical methods for biomarkers of exposure to this class of compounds. Past experience has shown that measuring a profile of PAH metabolites is more informative than metabolites of a single PAH. Assessment of environmental and smoking-related exposure levels requires analytical methods with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, these methods should be fast enough to allow high throughput. With these pre-conditions in mind, we developed and validated a high-performance liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of phenolic metabolites of naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene and pyrene in urine of smokers and non-smokers. Sample work-up comprised enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary conjugates and solid-phase extraction on C18 cartridges. The method showed good specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy for the intended purpose and was also sufficiently rapid with a sample throughput of about 350 per week. Application to urine samples of 100 smokers and 50 non-smokers showed significant differences between both groups for all measured PAH metabolites, and strong correlations with markers of daily smoke exposure in smoker urine. Urinary levels were in good agreement with previously reported data using different methodologies. In conclusion, the developed LC-MS/MS method is suitable for the quantification of phenolic PAH metabolites of naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene in smoker and non-smoker urine.

   The metropolitan area of Sao Luis represents one of the most densely-populated areas of the Amazon Coast, but the recreational use of its beaches has been prohibited by the local authorities due to the poor quality of the water. The present study aimed to estimate the Recreational Carrying Capacity (RCC), water quality and the perception of beachgoers at four beaches during peak visitation periods. Each of the four beaches was surveyed over a three-day period (Friday-Sunday) in July 2009. In each survey, the number of people present along a preestablished transect was counted every hour between 08:00 h and 18:00 h. Samples of the water were taken between 07:00 h and 19:00 h, and a sample of beachgoers were interviewed using questionnaires. Peak visitation times were similar at the four beaches, and Saturday and Sunday were the most popular days. Zones 1 (landward) was the most visited, while the use of zone 2 (intertidal zones) was influenced by tidal condition and the zone 3 (subtidal zone) was affected by poor water quality. The recreational carrying capacity of each beach was influenced by the day of the week, insolation, tide levels, and bacteriological contamination. However, the majority of the beachgoers interviewed during the study seemed to enjoy the beaches. Despite measures taken by the local authorities, such as the shutting down of some of the sewage outlets, the problem of poor water quality has not been resolved, and the beaches were still improper for bathing as of July, 2010.

AB  - Kizilirmak River receives substantial loads of nutrients, trace metals and other compounds, resulting from anthropogenic activities within its catchment. The main aims of this research were to evaluate spatial and seasonal trends in water discharge, nutrients and trace metals and also to compare data with water and sediment quality criteria and with certain quality indices such as water quality index (WQI), sediment quality index (SQI) and trophic state index (TSI), identifying the environmental pressures and assessing the impact of the loads to the coastal environment. Nine stations were sampled within the main stream of Kizilinnak River near to the Black Sea. Field measurements and routine laboratory water analysis were carried on the eight sampling stations seasonally. Wet sediment sample analyses were also performed for EC, pH, organic matter and moisture content within the range of 1.13-1.76 mS; 7.52-8.80; 1.41-4.60%; 18.92-33.65%, respectively. However, trace metal analyses including Cd, Ni and Pb were done by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) both on water and sediment samples with the total digestion methods. Since the analytical cost involved could be a limiting factor for river quality assessments in developing countries, certain quality indices were used in this study. For each type of indices calculations, different approaches from the literature were selected and compared. Calculated NSFWQI, WQI(new), and WQI(min.) values are in good agreement and the water quality of the river is considered at medium level. For the Derbent Dam of Kizilirmak River, two different trophic level index calculations have also the same results indicating eutrophic conditions where algal growth and blooms can occur. However, certain metal quality indices both for water and sediment measurements indicate that the river has medium quality of lead pollution which may be caused by automobile exhausts and urban storm run-off.

AB  - The production by enzymatic treatment of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) is a promising route to add value to fisheries proteinic co-products (fish frames, heads etc.). Indeed, FPH possess good nutritional properties and biological activities for food and feed uses. Pressure-driven membrane separations such as ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) can be used after the hydrolysis to, increase the specific activities of the FPH. This paper discusses the impact of a two-step UF/NF process producing four different fractions on two industrial FPH with different hydrolysis degrees. Fractionation is carried out in "realistic" conditions for an industrial process, on highly concentrated FPH solutions (about 100 g of dry matter/L) at a high volume reduction factor. For each step, UF or NF, the variation of the permeation flux in the course of the fractionation is discussed according to the FPH hydrolysis degree and the membranes cut-offs. The values of performance indicators defined in terms of nitrogen content are also examined, including the concentration factor (CF), the relative recovery in the retentate(eta(R)) and the mean and final retention factors (RFm and RFf). Computed values of these indicators are validated through the setting of volume and mass balances around each step. The impact of fractionation on the FPH peptidic population is shown. Peptidic populations are described in terms of chromatographic profiles (SEC-FPLC). The UF fractionation produces a permeate enriched with respect to the FPH smaller than a molecular weight of about 600-750 Dalton, and a retentate enriched in large peptides (above the same MW). A similar behaviour is found for the NF fractionation. Comparing the impact of the UF fractionation on the two hydrolysates allows to conclude that the membrane cut-off is well-suited when comprised between the MWs of the biggest and the most abundant peptides in the FPH.

AB  - Multiproxies of past environmental conditions, comprising 53 sediment samples analysed for thier lithostratigraphic properties (mainly their charcoal, phytoliths and pollen contents) from an AMS C-14-dated sequence of sediments accumulating at Guangfulin, Yangtze delta, are presented. The oldest sediments recovered date to the Lateglacial when a mosaic of mixed (conifer-deciduous) temperate forest and wetland vegetation characterized the Study area. The Lateglacial-Holocene transition and much of the early Holocene record to c. 7400 yr BP appears to be missing from the sequence. The earliest evidence possibly representing human activities in the study area (the remains of cereals and indicators of forest) date to c. 7000 yr BP. A large increase in macrocharcoal remains c. 4700 yr BP is a more certain indication of human activities close to the study site, and may indicate the first occupation of what is now the location of a major archaeological excavation at Guangfulin. Technological changes during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 Bc) may be responsible for an increased abundance of rice (Oryza sp.), and possibly also foxtail or Chinese millet (Setaria italica), detected in the Guangfulin record after c. 2400 yr BP. An abrupt sedimentary change at c. 4000 yr BP may represent a short-lived episode of catchment instability. Aside front this, the sediment record from Guangfulin contains no evidence of dramatic environmental changes that could have led to a major decline in agricultural productivity c. 4000 yr BP, as has been Suggested for the lower Yangtze by some researchers, who associate this with the cultural transition from Liangzhu to Maqiao. The findings do, however, add weight to the argument that developments in rice-based agriculture on the Yangtze delta varied both spatially and temporally.

AB  - In view of various studies looking for the merit of coliphages as indicators of water pollution with viruses originating from faecal material, a small agricultural community (population of approximately 1500 inhabitants of all ages, 2-3 km from Haifa) was selected in order to understand these bacteriophage ecology (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) in its sewer and oxidation pond system. Along the sewer lines, it was possible to isolate constantly both bacteriophage types (F-RNA and somatic coliphages) at 10(2)-10(4) plaque-forming units (pfu) ml(-1). The average numbers of somatic and F-RNA phages isolated from oxidation pond were 10(3)-10(4) pfu ml(-1); however, somatic coliphages were undetectable for several months (April-August). Significant high correlation (0.944 < R-2 < 0.99) was found between increased anionic detergent concentrations and F-RNA coliphage numbers. Infants less than 1 year old excreted both phage types and few only F-RNA coliphages (at high numbers > 10(5) pfu g(-1)) for up to 1 year. The excretion of F-RNA coliphages was highly linked to Escherichia coli F+ harborage in the intestinal track as found in their faecal content. Finally, three bacterial hosts E. coli F+, F- and CN13 tested for survivability in sewage filtrate revealed that E. coli F+ had the highest survivability under these conditions. Presence of somatic and F male-specific phages in sewer lines of a small community are influenced by several factors such as: anionic detergents, nutrients, temperature, source (mainly infants), shedding and survival capability of the host strain. Better understanding of coliphages ecology in sewer systems can enhance our evaluation of these proposed indicator/index microorganisms used in tracking environmental pollution of water, soil and crop contamination with faecal material containing enteric viruses.

AB  - Purpose - When acquiring advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT), the greatest caution should be taken regarding the performance measurement system to be used: the decision regarding new investments should not be conditioned by the excessive use of financial indicators to the detriment of the strategic objectives that motivated the investments. It is intended to analyze the aeronautical sector, for which the purchase of AMT is qualifying criteria, with two intentions: first, to identify the performance measurement systems that are used, and second, to test their correspondence with the objectives that motivated the investments.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey of the 20 plants in the population was conducted via a postal questionnaire plus a structured inter-view. The unit of analysis has been maintained through the triangulation of data sources.
   Findings - The findings suggest that both financial and non-financial indicators are used, with the latter gaining predominance over the former on some occasions, even though there is no clear correspondence between strategy and the measurement of performance. In the light of the findings, the question of what inspires a company's performance measurement system is still open, especially in those cases where there is no explicit strategy. With regard to practical implications, what seems to be indispensable is an improvement in the determination of the critical variables that should be used to measure performance.
   Research limitations/implications - Being valuable for academics and practitioners, this contribution relies, rather, on the possibility of a logical extrapolation to circumstances where the findings might apply, and researchers can judge whether the particular findings would be valid.
   Originality/value - Provides new evidence on the adaptation of the make-up and combination of the type of performance measures currently used by plants in the aeronautical industry, one of the sectors in which technological innovation is of the utmost importance.

AB  - Acrylic acid is a refractory compound for the non-catalytic wet oxidation (WO) process and can seriously damage the environment when released in industrial effluents. Oxidation of acrylic acid by catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) was studied in slurry conditions in a high-pressure batch reactor at 200 degreesC and 15 bar of oxygen partial pressure. Several solid cerium-based catalysts prepared in our laboratory were used (Ag/Ce, Co/Ce, Mn/Ce, CeO, MnO) and evaluated in terms of activity, selectivity and stability. Mn/Ce shows the higher activity in 2 h with 97.7% reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) followed by: MnO(95.5%) > Ag/Ce(85.0%) > Co/Ce(65.1%) > CeO(61.2%). Attempts were also carried out to analyze the influence of different Mn/Ce molar ratios. High percentages of Mn lead to practically total organic carbon concentration (TOC) abatements while low ratios lead to the formation of non-oxidizable compounds. Acrylic acid was readily degraded by all the catalysts pointing out the high importance of using a catalytic process. pH was an indicator of the reaction pathway and acetic acid was found as the major reaction intermediate compound; however it is completely oxidized after 2 h with exception for Co/Ce, CeO and MnO. Carbon adsorption and leaching of metals were poorly found for Mn/Ce indicating high stability. The catalyst microstructure after the reaction was analyzed and formation of whiskers of beta-MnO2 (or less probably MnOOH) were observed at the catalyst surface. Therefore, Mn/Ce revealed to be a promising catalyst for the treatment of effluents containing acrylic acid; nevertheless, its commercialization depends on further research. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Temporal and spatial variations were investigated in the viable diatom population of the microphytobenthic community from an intertidal sand flat of a tropical environment. The presence of diatoms to a sediment depth of 15 cm and their rejuvenation in culture revealed that their viability was not affected by the conditions prevailing at this depth. This depth harbored not only pennate (epipsammic and epipelic) diatoms, some of which are permanent residents of this area, but also centric diatoms of planktonic origin. The occurrence of diatoms such as Amphora and Navicula throughout the year in the sediments indicated that the two pennate forms were natives of this area. The centric diatom Thalassiosira, the vegetative cells of which were not observed in the sediments, must have appeared in culture through the germination of resting stages, which are regularly carried to the study area with coastal sediments and redeposited in intertidal sediments. Nutrients did not play an important role in the case of the pennates, which mainly reside in the sediments; whereas, in centric diatoms, nitrate and phosphate positively influenced their abundance. Multiple regression analysis revealed that some of the grain size fractions served as predictors of diatoms such as Amphora, Grammatophora, Pleurosigma and Thalasssiothrix. Wind stimulated the resuspension of the sediment, along with pennate diatoms, down to 5 cm depth. Correlation of chlorophyll a with diatom cell numbers, which has been generally used as an indicator of diatom abundance, revealed that chlorophyll a concentrations were good predictors of both pennate and centric diatom abundance, to 10 cm depth. However, a negative correlation between chlorophyll a and diatoms at the 10-15 cm depth, even when viable diatoms were found in appreciable numbers, suggests survival of these diatoms below the physical disturbance level through the adoption of survival strategies such as resting stage formation.

AB  - This paper examines the distribution of terricolous lichens at a regional scale across seven landscape types over 60000 km(2) in western New South Wales. Data are also presented on the distribution of lichens within a geomorphic sequence of runoff and runon zones on a red earth soil near Cobar. On a regional scale, 48 taxa from 23 genera were collected from 282 sites in semi-arid and arid eastern Australia, Of these, 74% were crustose or squamulose, and the remainder (26%) were foliose. Six genera (Acarospora, Endocarpon, Catapyrenium, Diploschistes, Peltula and Xanthoparmelia) accounted for 57% of species. Landscape type was a poor predictor of lichen floristics or crust cover. Instead, a core group of species comprising Collema coccophorum, Heppia despreauxii, Endocarpon rogersii, E. simplicatum var. bisporum, E. pallidum, Psora decipiens, Peltula patellata sap. australiensis, Catapyrenium squamulosum and Synalissa symphorea, occurred in all landscape types. Plains with red earths had the greatest mean number of species per site (11.2) and the greatest mean crust cover (27.7%). Plains of calcareous earths yielded the greatest number of species (38). Across all sites, crust cover was a poor predictor of lichen species richness. However, on landscape types with non-calcareous soils, mean crust cover explained 88% of the variation in mean number of species. Whilst there was no difference in total number of species across a sequence of geomorphic zones, crust cover was significantly greater in the interception zones (79.0%) compared with either the run-on (6.6%) or run-off (24.0%) zones. These distributional data are compared with other published and unpublished studies from similar areas in Australia. The role of terricolous crusts as indicators of ecosystem health, and the influence of land management on crust cover and subsequent landscape stability are discussed.

AB  - There are over 70 occurrences of manganese oxides throughout Scotland; of these, only 1,3 are sufficiently well developed to be worthy of description. The deposits are categorized on the basis of the formation processes; eight are supergene ground-water or soil deposits, three formed by weathering, and two are hydrothermal in origin. The chemistry of marine sedimentary exhalative deposits can be related to the paleospreading rate of the once-active ridge and, under favorable conditions of stratigraphic preservation, be used to estimate the half-width of the ancient ocean. This approach yields estimates of 5 cm yr-1 and about 1,000 km for the spreading rate and maximum half-width of the Ordovician Iapetus ocean, respectively: figures which compare favorably with earlier estimates from faunal migration studies.
   Several of the Scottish manganese outcrops are associated with Old Red Sandstone (Devonian) sediments-a continental fluvial-lacustrine facies in northern Scotland. Diagenetic remobilization, with subsequent oxidation and deposition, of the manganese within the lacustrine sediments led to the formation of a manganese-rich horizon in the uppermost sections of the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary pile. Previously immobile in the pre-Devonian inorganic reaction-dominant regime, manganese mobility increased dramatically with the introduction of large quantities of organic acids following terrestrial colonization by plants. Climate change from arid to tropical with increased vegetation development promoted the formation of thick, organic-rich soils with the concomitant increase in available manganese-chelating ligands. Organomanganese reactions fundamentally changed the pattern of manganese mobility in the postcolonization surficial environment, making the Devonian a stratigraphic geochemical boundary. These changes in weathering processes would also affect the dispersal patterns of other metals which form organo complexes, gold being an obvious example.

AB  - It has been proposed that the high-frequency, low-amplitude magnetic anomalies found over some hydrocarbon deposits are due to long-term microseepage of hydrocarbons into iron-rich sedimentary roof rocks, with subsequent precipitation of diagenetic magnetite or pyrrhotite at or near the water-table.  Aerogeophysical data sets, comprising both magnetic and gamma-ray spectrometer measurements, over the Formby oil-field, Lancashire, U.K., have been analysed for hydrocarbon-related anomalies.  Detailed ground magnetic traverses were also made to investigate some of the aeromagnetic anomalies.
   No hydrocarbon-induced magnetic anomalies were detected.  The majority of the high-frequency events occurring in the aeromagnetic data correlated with cultural features, others were attributed to artefacts of the data processing.  In particular there were no extensive areas of high-frequency, low-amplitude anomalies as might be expected from authigenic magnetic minerals.
   Borehole chippings from inside and outside the oil-field were examined.  High magnetic susceptibilities were due to contamination during drilling.  Magnetite, which was identified by mineralogical analysis, was found to be of detrital origin.  If any diagenetic magnetic material was present it was in such small quantities as to be insignificant.
   The oil-field did not possess a characteristic gamma-ray spectrometric signature.  Anomalies were found to be related to hydrological conditions and to the distribution of surficial deposits.  Attempts to suppress the influence of the drift geology had only limited success.
   It is concluded that the effectiveness of high-resolution aeromagnetic onshore surveys for direct hydrocarbon detection has yet to be established.  In particular, the anomaly found over the Formby oil-field was caused by the cumulative effect of borehole casing.  Similar cultural contamination by oil-field equipment may explain some of the anomalies discovered over hydrocarbon deposits in North America.  It is also unlikely that the spectrometric method can be applied diagnostically in any but the most simple and drift-free geological environments.

AB  - Composite biochar derived from crop straw and activated sludge may have great potential for remediating polluted environments. Few studies have addressed the influences of different modifying agents and modification procedures on the adsorption performance of composite biochar. In this work, the pre/post-KOH or H3PO4-modified composite biochar were generated from corn straw and activated sludge through co-pyrolysis at different blending ratios at 650 degrees C, and were tested for adsorption performance using methylene blue as an indicator pollutant. Results showed that the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir equations were deemed suitable for describing adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms, respectively. KOH modification was more favorable to improving the adsorption capacity than H3PO4 modification. The post-KOH or H3PO4 modification could not enhance adsorption capacity. The optimal blending ratio of corn straw and activated sludge was 80:20 (wt.%). The most promising result was obtained by the composite biochar with an 80:20 mass ratio of corn straw and activated sludge fabricated through pre-KOH modification, with excellent adsorption capacity for methylene blue (186.48 mg/g), which is attributed to increased oxygen-containing functional groups, aromaticity, and improved surface texture. The adsorption capacity of this composite biochar was significantly increased by increases of pH, MB concentration, and temperature. The optimal operational conditions for methylene blue adsorption on this composite biochar were 0.3 g/L of biochar dosage, 120 mg/L of methylene blue, a pH of 3, and 20 degrees C. This study revealed that the adsorption capacity of modified composite biochar highly depends on the blending ratio of corn straw and activated sludge and modification procedures.

AB  - Grapevine growth and wine production are both closely connected with weather and climate, making anthropogenic climate change a source of great uncertainty for the grape and wine industries. To assess the impacts of climate change on viticulture and oenology in the Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada, where no such assessment has been published to this date, a series of key indicators and critical thresholds were selected on the basis of their relevance to the local climate. Trends among these indicators and thresholds were calculated over a historic period (1970-2019) and projected over the twenty-first century for one intermediate-emissions climate change scenario and one high-emissions climate change scenario. Historic trends were assessed using Environment and Climate Change Canada weather station data from Abbotsford, British Columbia. Two statistical downscaling methods were evaluated with regard to their ability to reproduce observed conditions in the Fraser Valley, and the most effective method was used to create projections of local, daily climate change scenarios. During the historic period, temperatures increased significantly while precipitation and moisture variables displayed insignificant trends, reflecting the trends observed across other wine regions in Canada and the northwestern United States. Throughout the twenty-first century, warming is expected to continue while precipitation decreases modestly. Extreme heat is projected to become far more frequent, whereas extreme cold and potential frost days become rare. In the short term, modifications to vineyard and winery operations may be sufficient adaptation strategies. Over the long term, new grape varieties will most likely need to be planted in existing vineyards and suitability for cool-climate varieties may shift northward in direction or upward in elevation.

AB  - Sugarcane cultivation areas in the world are mostly done in light and medium texture as well as wet conditions. This study investigated energy, environmental and economic indicators for conventional and conservation tillage methods in sugarcane cultivation in arid and heavy land. Assessing the emission of agricultural inputs, improving energy efficiency and controlling costs in sugarcane production are among the concerns of this research. Calculations in sugarcane production were done using four tillage methods: T-1-first-time subsoiler (D8 bulldozer) + second-time subsoiler (D8 bulldozer) (conventional operation), T-2- Alpego tillage tool, T-3- Nardi tillage tool, T-4-subsoiler for the first time (D8 bulldozer) + subsoiler five Sheng. Sugarcane energy and economic indices registered. Electricity has the highest amount of energy inputs in the sugarcane production of different tillage systems. This large amount also leads to the release of energy in renewable, biomass, and renewable, water forms. Energy and economic indicators were calculated. The results between the four systems due to low production costs showed that the T-2 system is more suitable than the others. Economic analysis showed that the total value and cost of T-2 were 2255.55 $ ha(-1) and 689.60 $ ha(-1), respectively. Results of environmental impacts showed the largest emissions were related to marine aquatic ecotoxicity (42830.62 kg(-1),4-DB (eq).), abiotic depletion (fossil fuels) (1715.13 MJ) and global warming potential (155.29 kg CO2 (eq).) in T-1. The results of cumulative exergy demand showed that the amount of non-renewable, fossil is mainly due to sugarcane cutting plant for T-1 (60.90%), T-2 (59.30%), T3 (59.27%) and T-4 (56.06%) systems.

AB  - Flooding is one of the most destructive natural events that severely damage the ground and inundate underground infrastructure. Subway systems in metropolitan areas are susceptible to flooding, which may be exacerbated when land subsidence occurs. However, previous studies have focused on flood risk evaluation on regional/watershed-scales and land subsidence monitoring in plains, instead of on subway flood risk evaluation and how land subsidence aggravates the flood risk in subway systems. Using the proposed risk indicators and field survey data, we present a method assessing the flood risk of metropolitan subway systems under a subsidence condition based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) combined with a geographic information system (GIS). We use the regional risk level within the 500 m buffer zone of the subway line to depict the flood risk of the subway system. The proposed method was used to evaluate the flood risk of the Beijing subway system. The results show that the flood risks of the Beijing subway show a ring-like distribution pattern-risk levels decreasing from the central urban area to the suburbs. Very high and high risks are mainly located within third and fourth ring roads, accounting for 63.58% (29.40 km(2)) and 63.83% (81.19 km(2)) of the total area. Land subsidence exacerbated the Beijing subway system's flood risk level-the moderate to very high risk increased by 46.88 km(2) (16.33%), indicating that land subsidence is an essential factor affecting the flood risk level of subway systems. In addition to enhancing flood warnings, future subway flooding could be reduced by elevating the height of the stations' exit (entrance) and installing water stop plates and watertight doors. This study is of great significance for flood warning and prevention in the Beijing subway system; it provides a theoretical basis for flood risk evaluation in other metropolitan areas.

AB  - The political changes that affected the European area in the second half of the 20th century conditioned the development of European countries on the principle of Euroregions, as interesting creations of neighboring countries. Formed along the political borders of neighboring countries, Euroregions today play a significant role in the enlargement process of the European Union. At the end of the 20th century, the formation of Euroregions covered the area of the Western Balkans as well. In Podrinje, the border area of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the formed Euroregions have the goal of reviving and revitalizing rural areas. Tourism, as the most important economic activity, is integrated into the basis of the rural development of these areas. The subject of the research is related to the analysis of the development degree of border rural areas, under the influence of tourism. The research problem is focused on the rural areas of "Serbian" Podrinje. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to determine the change and burden of rural border area due to the development of tourism, using the indicator of tourist operation (I.T.O.) and the tourist function indices to measure the degree of the development of a destination. The results of the research indicate that three types of tourist destinations have been developed in the studied area: destinations with almost non-existent tourist activity (< 4), with small-scale tourist activity (4-10), and developed and eminently tourist destinations (40-100). The obtained results indicate that 83.3% of the destinations in "Serbian" Podrinje are destinations with almost non-existent tourist activity. These are the destinations where the development of tourism does not affect the transformation of space, but the original and preserved environment is promoted as a tourist attraction.

AB  - Glazing is considered as a preferred solution for the buildability, aesthetic, and comfort of commercial buildings since glass cover can protect occupants from external environmental conditions, ensure the light transmission, and provide view and ventilation. At the same time, in the context of climate change and global warming, the use of renewable solar energy, such as solar and wind power, are encouraged to be utilized. Specifically, solar energy has become a renewable energy source that is clean and endless, at reasonable cost, to contribute to energy security as well as ensure sustainable development. Therefore, the study proposes a method for supporting the decision making in installing solar panels on vertical glazing facades of the building in the worst case that the remaining radiant energy from the sun was only transferred to the inside of the building. The Life Cycle Assessment and the Life Cycle Costing methodologies are applied to consider both environmental and economic aspects. The proposed method can (1) minimize the project cost (including initial investment cost and operation cost) during the building lifetime; (2) analyze the optimal budget to minimize the total life-cycle cost of the building over its lifespan and maximize the renewable energy generated from the sunlight entering buildings in different directions. The results show that with different initial investments, the investor will have a corresponding solution for choosing an optimal installation ratio for each type of glass combined with the installation ratio of solar panels on the facades to reach the optimal energy efficiency as well as environmental performance. This study is beneficial for investors in selecting energy-saving solutions in office buildings in the beginning phase of the project life cycle.

AB  - The National Capital Region (NCR) of India, Delhi, has experienced high post-monsoon pollution along with several peak pollution episodes in recent years. Diwali, the festival of lights, which is among the biggest festivals of India celebrated during the post-monsoon season, is also considered a pollution event associated as it is with the lighting of a large number of firecrackers. 2016 Diwali pollution episode continued for a week creating severe discomfort to residents of Delhi, prompting the judiciary to ban the sale and use of firecrackers in Delhi from 2017 onwards. The current study analyzes different sectoral and temporal emissions contribution to the 2016 post monsoonal pollution episode over Delhi using a fully coupled chemical transport model. The findings of the study indicate that aerosols produced from crop residue open burning at the northwestern states contributed more than 60% of the total simulated surface concentration during the period under study. Model experimental simulations show that despite emissions from within the city, what explains the severity of pollution over Delhi during the period under consideration is an additional pollution load emanating from these intense crop open burning sessions from nearby areas. Further, model simulations show that while Diwali emissions can elevate the pollution load over Delhi, the effects do not last beyond 48 h. It is found that the stagnation of the pollutants several days beyond the 2016 Diwali day was due to favorable meteorological conditions like low surface temperature, lower boundary layer height, and weak northwesterly winds. The study shows that in order to improve air quality in Delhi during the post-monsoon period, mitigation efforts should target the adjacent rural areas, especially when there is massive burning of crop residue in those areas.

AB  - Traditional water treatment plants adopt multiple treatments to sequentially treat raw water for producing potable water. Besides complex treatment design and operation, they typically require a large space to accommodate different reactors. Furthermore, emerging issues (e.g. poor removal of persistent micro-pollutants) challenge the conventional treatment train. In this study, bench-scale tests were performed with real surface waters to evaluate ferrate(VI) treatment as a key alternative process for traditional water treatment. Of note, most earlier investigations on ferrate(VI) for water treatment utilized ferrate(VI) merely for pre- or post-treatment or simply as a disinfecting agent. Fundamentally different from the previous efforts, this study aimed to assess whether one-step ferrate(VI) addition, coupled with sedimentation, provided a comprehensive treatment, better than or equivalent to conventional surface water treatment. Results show that ferrate(VI) could simultaneously and effectively remove turbidity, degrade natural organic matter (NOM), and inactivate bacterial indicators in one single dose. The treatment performance relied heavily on ferrate(VI) dose and pH. Generally, higher ferrate(VI) dose improved the treatment results, except that it might re-suspend particles at a high dose at an alkaline condition. Lower pH favored coagulation due to reduction of zeta potentials on particle surface and promotion of their aggregation and enhanced the degradation of NOM because of higher Fe(VI) reactivity toward reductive moieties. In contrast, higher pH benefited the disinfection efficiency due to better stability and greater exposure of ferrate(VI). This study demonstrates that ferrate(VI) treatment can serve as a core treatment process in alternative water treatment designs for addressing various challenges. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the physiological responses of juvenile Lophiosilurus alexandri submitted to osmotic and thermic shock. Thirty juveniles were used for each test, of which 10 were not subjected to stress and remained in normal conditions (fresh water at 28.0 degrees C). The others were submitted to stress shock (saline water of 10.0 g of salt/L or water cooled to 18.0 degrees C). Blood samples were taken at 0 h (no exposure to the stress factor) and 1 h and 24 h after the tests. At 24 h, the survivorship was 100% in both tests. In both the osmotic and thermic shock tests, cortisol and glucose levels were higher at 1 h but then decreased after 24 h. Lactate dehydrogenase showed differences in the temperature test, but there was no difference between 1 and 24 h after exposure to osmotic shock (P > 0.05). The difference was recorded in blood gas variables (pH, PvCO(2), PvO(2), hemoglobin, sO(2), BE, tCO(2), HCO3-, and stHCO(3)(-)) and electrolytes (Na+, Ca++, nCa(++), and K+) in both experiments. With regard to hematology and blood biochemistry, exposure to thermal shock did not affect (P > 0.05) ALP, total plasma protein, hematocrit, and ALT and AST at 1 h and 24 h. ALP and total protein in the blood of fish submitted to the osmotic shock were lowest (P < 0.05) at 24 h. Leukocyte and erythrocyte counts exhibited differences after osmotic shock, in contrast to erythrocyte counts of the temperature test, which did not change in 24 h (P > 0.05). Juveniles of L. alexandri were able to reestablish the main indicators of stress (cortisol, glucose), while the others (hematological, biochemical, and gasometric) varied in compensation for normal physiological reestablishment.

AB  - Grazing exclusion by fencing is one of the most effective practices to recover the degraded alpine grasslands in Tibetan Plateau. In the present study, the effects of 8-year (GE8) and 4-year (GE4) grazing exclusion were studied in comparison with free grazing (FG) in the plant-soil ecosystems of alpine grasslands. Within fencing, improved plant characteristics such as aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB) and plant total cover developed without grazing and trampling were observed. Also, there were significant improvements of soil organic carbon (SOC), ammonia nitrogen (NH 4(+)-N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations usually in the topsoil (0-30 cm) but a stable C:N ratio with the number of years of grazing exclusion. Fencing enhanced soil main enzyme (invertase, phosphatase, urease and beta-glucosidase) activities by providing sufficient substrates for microbial activities. Unexpectedly, GE4 had higher soil invertase, phosphatase, urease and beta-glucosidase activities than GE8, which had less plant diversity, richness and higher total cover causing a lowering of soil temperature. Additionally, the results supported the allometric allocation hypothesis for the ABG versus BGB in the grasslands of Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that SOC and BGB can be used as indicators of the restoration process of degraded alpine grassland. Cautions should be taken for a long-term fencing in degraded alpine grasslands because of the loss of plant richness, diversity and soil enzyme activities. The present results also suggested that a suitable grazing regime combined with fencing should be focused in the future study of the alpine grasslands. Research results obtained in the present study should, therefore, be helpful to offer a better guidance towards the management practices of the degraded alpine grasslands.

AB  - To better understand and characterize the distribution of the dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus in the Pacific Ocean off Peru, we analyzed spatio-temporal catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from the artisanal longline dolphinfish fishery and oceanographic variables measured from October-March during 2010-2017. A Delta-GAM approach determined that high dolphinfish CPUE occurred during the period from November-January between 9-11 degrees S at an average of 190 nautical miles (nm) from the coast. From February-March, the highest CPUE was located along the coast up to 115 nm offshore between 12-13 degrees S, which suggested that dolphinfish migrate to the southeast during austral summer. However, there was no evidence of a reverse migration towards the northwest, although this result must be corroborated with data taken outside of the dolphinfish fishing season (October-April) in future studies. According to the environmental variables, dolphinfish preferred to stay in waters with sea surface temperatures (SST) that ranged from 22-24 degrees C, low chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL; < 1 mg m(-3)), and surface sea heights (SSH) that ranged from 0.10-0.20 m. The information derived from this study, such as the maps, spatial indicators, and time series, contribute to the knowledge of how the spatial distribution of the dolphinfish and dolphinfish CPUE may vary under future climate conditions and provide some clues that will facilitate fishing ground forecasts in both the short and long term. Finally, our results may provide tools to develop or improve the conservation and management strategies of this species, which supports one of the most important artisanal fisheries in Peru.

AB  - Desertification is a global land degradation problem faced both in the developed and developing countries alike. Kolli hill is one of the hills of the Eastern Ghats of India, currently undergoing conspicuous land degradation to such an extent, that it has already begun to witness an altered forest stand. Hence, the main goal of this study is to identify areas under actual and potential desertification risk by means of a modelling approach in which four indicator thematic layers (soil, climate, vegetation and anthropic pressure buffers) were overlaid in GIS environment. The cartographic data were transformed to structured numerical data (weighted layers) such that each of the layers was assigned knowledge based weightage values in relation to their influence and contribution to the process of desertification to get the final desertification risk state of the forest region. Climate models suited for the Indian condition were utilized to determine the areas under potential risk of desertification and three Representative Concentration Pathways were employed to study the pattern of desertification by the middle and the end of this century. The results of the study show the present scenario with an area of 200 km(2) falling in the medium risk state and an area of 7 km(2) falling in the high-risk state. On average, about 215 and 214 km(2) of the forest area fall under the medium risk category, while an area of 9.5 and 8.94 km(2) belong to the high risk state for the years 2050 and 2070 respectively. The areas experiencing these risk states belong to the foothills and mid slopes of the forest region and fall within the semiarid-dry sub-humid aridity zonation.

AB  - Background: Trauma-related disorders and personality disorders are prevalent in survivors of chronic childhood trauma and neglect. Both conditions have serious consequences for patients, their families, society and public health and a high risk of development of chronicity. However, information on the long term course trajectories is lacking and predictors of course outcome in survivors of chronic childhood traumatization are unknown. The first aim of the current study is to identify two-year course trajectories of pathology in patients with trauma-related disorders and personality disorders. The second aim is to examine predictors of the course, including demographics, clinical characteristics and comorbidities.
   Methods/design: The study is a naturalistic two-year follow-up of 150 patients consecutively admitted to the trauma treatment program and the personality disorder treatment program respectively at GGZ Friesland, a regular Dutch mental health care center. The only exclusion criterion is insufficient mastery of the Dutch language. Participants will be assessed after 2 years of treatment through measures that have been completed at baseline, including structured clinical interviews to measure childhood histories of trauma and neglect, (symptoms of) trauma-related disorders and personality disorders, and psychological questionnaire measures (e.g., general psychopathology, depressive symptoms and personality features). In addition, participants will complete an evaluation questionnaire to assess medication prescribed and treatment (s) received outside GGZ Friesland between baseline and follow-up. Information about (psychological and pharmacological) treatment received at GGZ Friesland during the follow-up period will be collected from patient files.
   Discussion: This study provides insight in the two-year course of (comorbid) trauma-related disorders and personality disorders. Identifying predictors of the course of trauma-related and personality disorders will allow to differentiate clinical profiles and will offer indicators for treatment.

AB  - Lacustrine stromatolites provide high-resolution and sensitive palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic records of their respective drainage basins and beyond. A well-developed stromatolite bed was discovered within the clastic deposits of the Early Miocene Taxihe Formation in the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, north of the Tian Shan Mountains. Their sedimentological features indicate a near-shore stable environment of a shrinking lake. The study of the stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in this stromatolite bed revealed that delta O-18 V-PDB values range from -11.3% to -5.6% and those of delta C-13 V-PDB from -1.8% to 1.7%. Lower values -10.2% and -8.2%, respectively, were determined from nearby lacustrine limestones of Oligocene age. The co-variation and overall increasing trend of the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values indicate deposition in a closed basin during a period of aridification. This environmental change can be related to the major uplift of the Tian Shan Mountains, the southern border of the Junggar Basin, during the Early Miocene. Several delta O-18 and delta C-13 records of lacustrine stromatolites ranging in age from Oligocene to Middle Miocene were reported: from localities in the Northern Tibetan Plateau and western Qaidam Basin. The similarity of the individual stable isotope records in stromatolites from Northwest China, indicate an underlying regional cause. These stromatolites were deposited during the period of major uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the Tian Shan Mountains. It is therefore concluded that the stromatolite records provide local snapshots of the effect of this major process on atmospheric precipitation and environmental conditions in Northwest China.

AB  - A two-year experiment was conducted to investigate the suitability of reference lines for irrigation scheduling based on maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) and midday stem water potential (psi(s)) in a commercial orchard of table grape cv. Crimson Seedless grafted onto Paulsen 1103 (V. berlandieri R. x V. rupestres du Lot). Vines were irrigated (from April to October) above their full crop water requirements (110% of crop evapotranspiration, ETc) in order to obtain non-limiting soil water conditions. The reference equations obtained for MDS and psi(s) with meteorological factors differed between the pre and post-veraison periods. Before veraison, MDS was the most reliable indicator for assessing the water status of vines, whereas psi(s) correlated better with meteorological variables after veraison. The sensitivity of MDS to ascertain the plant water status decreased during post-veraison due to its dependence on growth and to daily fluctuation of stem diameter. Moreover, it can also be induced by changes in the transpiration and also on the accumulation of xylem abscisic acid ([ABA](xylem)). Mean temperature (T-m) was the environmental variable that best correlated with MDS and psi(s) at pre-veraison. However, post-veraison reference lines can be obtained for MDS and psi(s) using reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and mean daily vapour pressure deficit (VPDm).

AB  - Response of maize to photoperiods affects adaption of this crop to environments. We characterize the phenotypes of four temperate-adapted maize foundation parents, Huangzao 4, Chang 7-2, Ye 478 and Zheng 58, and two tropically adapted maize foundation parents, M9 and Shuang M9 throughout the growth stage under three constant photoperiod regimes in a daily cycle of 24h at 28 degrees C, and analysed expression of 48 photoperiod response-associated genes. Consequently, long photoperiod (LP) repressed development of the tassels of photoperiod-sensitive maize lines at V9 stage, and caused subsequent failure in flowering; failure of photoperiod-sensitive maize lines in flowering under LP was associated with lower expression of flowering-related genes; photoperiod changes could make a marked impact on spatial layout of maize inflorescence. The larger oscillation amplitude of expression of photoperiod-responsive genes occurred in LP-sensitive maize lines. In conclusion, failure in development of tassels at V9 stage under LP is an early indicator for judging photoperiod sensitivity. The adaptation of temperate-adapted maize lines to LP is due to the better coordination of expression among photoperiod-sensing genes instead of the loss of the genes. High photoperiod sensitivity of maize is due to high expression of circadian rhythm-responding genes improperly early in the light.

AB  - Cold microclimatic conditions provide exceptional microhabitats to Pinus uncinata stands occurring at abnormally low altitudes in seven relict stands of the northern French Alps. Here, P uncinata is located at the lower bounds of its ecological limits and therefore expected to provide a sensitive indicator of climate change processes. We used dendrochronological analysis to study the growth patterns of closely spaced chronologies across an elevational transect and compare a relict low-altitude to a P uncinata stand located at the alpine treeline. Two detrending procedures are used to reveal high- and low-frequencies embedded in annually resolved ring-width series. Growth response of P uncinata to instrumental temperature and precipitation data is investigated by means of moving response function analyses. Results show an increase in the sensitivity of tree-ring widths to drought during previous summer in both stands. At the treeline stand, an increasing response to fall temperature is observed whereby fall temperature and radial tree growth increased in two synchronous steps around 1930 and from 1980-present. At the low-altitude stand, P uncinata appears more drought sensitive and exhibits a sharp growth decline since the mid-1980s, coinciding with increasing summer temperatures. Growth divergence between the two stands can be observed since the mid-1980s. We argue that the positive growth trend at the high-altitude stand is due to increasing fall temperatures which would favor the formation of metabolic reserves in conjunction with atmospheric CO2 enrichment that in turn would facilitate improved water use efficiency. At the relict low-altitude stand, in contrast, it seems that improved water use efficiency cannot compensate for the increase in summer temperatures.

AB  - Moisture content influences harvest timing and the consequent drying process and drying costs, and the development of spoilage fungi during pre- and post-harvest phases. Maize kernel development in the field can be partitioned into three phases: i) lag phase, ii) grain filling and maturation drying, and iii) post-maturity dry-down. A model simulating maize kernel moisture content during maturation can help either monitoring or foreseen maize kernel humidity during the harvest period. Also, it would be useful in simulation studies via crop models to estimate the infield feasibility of harvest but also the interaction with diseases responsible for mycotoxin production, against weather scenarios.
   A process-based model was developed, called MIMYCS.Moisture. When the hybrids were analyzed all together, MIMYCS.Moisture showed a good general predictive capability with an average error in moisture estimation of +/- 3.28% moisture (considering the root mean square error - RMSE). The model efficiency (EF) was positive (0.85) and the model was able to explain the 89.7% of variation. When the two sub-models were analyzed separately, the RMSE remained approximately at the same level of the general model, while the other indicators changed revealing the different characteristics of the two models. The developmental moisture sub-model has a slight tendency to overestimate, while the dry-down sub-model tended to underestimate final moisture content.
   However, when the model was analyzed separately for each hybrid, both calibration and validation results suggested that more data are needed to improve the model likely with respect to kernel characteristics of hybrids. Finally, the equilibrium moisture content equation used, taken from industrial drying models, might not be adequate for simulating the field conditions where temperature is well below the one in dryers and environmental air humidity may vary considerably across sites and harvest periods.

AB  - Cognitive bias, the altered information processing resulting from the background emotional state of an individual, has been suggested as a promising new indicator of animal emotion. Comparable to anxious or depressed humans, animals in a putatively negative emotional state are more likely to judge an ambiguous stimulus as if it predicts a negative event, than those in positive states. The present study aimed to establish a cognitive bias test for mice based on a spatial judgment task and to apply it in a pilot study to serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout mice, a well-established mouse model for the study of anxiety- and depression-related behavior. In a first step, we validated that our setup can assess different expectations about the outcome of an ambiguous stimulus: mice having learned to expect something positive within a maze differed significantly in their behavior towards an unfamiliar location than animals having learned to expect something negative. In a second step, the use of spatial location as a discriminatory stimulus was confirmed by showing that mice interpret an ambiguous stimulus depending on its spatial location, with a position exactly midway between a positive and a negative reference point provoking the highest level of ambiguity. Finally, the anxiety- and depression-like phenotype of the 5-HTT knockout mouse model manifested - comparable to human conditions - in a trend for a negatively distorted interpretation of ambiguous information, albeit this effect was not statistically significant. The results suggest that the present cognitive bias test provides a useful basis to study the emotional state in mice, which may not only increase the translational value of animal models in the study of human affective disorders, but which is also a central objective of animal welfare research.

AB  - Although tropical and subtropical environments permit two cropping cycles per year, maintaining adequate mulching on the soil surface remains a challenge. In some cases, leaving soils fallow during the winter as an agricultural practice to control pathogens contributes to reduce soil mulching. The aim of this study was to assess attributes associated with C and N cycling in a soil under conventional and no-tillage management, with contrasting uses in winter: black oats (Avena strigosa Schreb) as cover crop or fallow. No-tillage increased total C and N. irrespective the winter crop. Cropping black oats under no-tillage resulted in more microbial biomass C and N, and glutaminase activity (15.2%, 65.2%, and 24%, respectively) than no-tillage under fallow. Under conventional tillage, winter cropping did not affect the attributes under study. Available P was higher in the no-tillage system (9.2-12.3 mg kg(-1)), especially when cropped with black oats, than in the conventional tillage system (4.8-6.6 mg kg(-1)). A multivariate analysis showed strong relationships between soil microbiological and chemical attributes in the no-tillage system, especially when cropped with black oats. Soil pH, dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities were the most effective at separating the soil use in winter. Microbial N, total N, microbial to total N ratio, available P, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), and glutaminase activity were more effective at separating soil management regimes. The no-tillage system in association with winter oat cropping stimulated the soil microbial community, carbon and nutrient cycling, thereby helping to improve the sustainability of the cropping system.

AB  - We present the first quantification of forest community composition and its relationship with environmental factors in South American subtropical Atlantic Forests. In this region, rain, seasonally dry and mixed forests form an ecotonal zone near the parallel of latitude 30 degrees S. To investigate how well current knowledge on climatic effects and biogeographic distribution apply to subtropical ecotones, we tested the following expectations: (i) there is a floristic longitudinal gradient correlated to altitudinal and climatic gradients; (ii) climatic variables are more important than soil factors in shaping floristic composition; and (iii) there are three floristic regions in the southernmost limit of the Atlantic Forest biome that are expected to be distinct in composition, structure and biogeographical origin. We examined floristic composition and its relationship with environmental factors across 52 1-ha permanent study areas in subtropical Brazil, containing in total 269 tree species9.5 dbh (diameter at breast height). Climatic data, related to rainfall seasonality and temperature, as well as soil properties, were compiled from published sources or global data banks. Expectations one and two were confirmed, but expectation three was only partially met. Hierarchical cluster analysis divided the southernmost Atlantic Forests into four major groups (Rain, Seasonally Dry, Western Mixed and Eastern Mixed Forests). Overall, the tested environmental variables differed significantly among the four regions. Using indicator species analysis, we distinguished 46 indicator species, which had significant environmental preferences for one floristic region. These species can be used as indicators of environmental conditions or to determine to which floristic region a certain forest belongs. Biogeographic distributions differed between floristic groups, supporting the interpretation that Eastern Mixed Forests are relict forests of a temperate forest of Andean origin that occurred during colder palaeoclimates. Western Mixed Forests represent the main floristic ecotone between Seasonally dry and Eastern Mixed Forests.

AB  - One of the main challenges in environmental risk assessment of fullerenes is to develop analytical methods that detect and quantify fullerenes at low concentrations. In this paper we report on the development and optimization of a highly specific, robust, and relatively simple method for the quantitative determination of C-60, C-70, and six functionalized fullerenes, namely, [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester, [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid butyl ester, [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid octyl ester, [6,6]-bis(phenyl)-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester, [6,6]-thienyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester, and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70PCBM], in different aqueous matrixes. For this method fullerenes were extracted from the aqueous phase using solid-phase extraction (SPE), with subsequent analysis on a liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS) system. SPE was optimized by varying different conditions to improve recovery of all fullerenes. Different SPE column materials (C18, C18e, C8, CN) were tested, and recoveries appeared to be the highest for the C18-material. Recoveries were improved by adding NaCl to the water during extraction. Very low limit of detection (LOD) values were obtained for all compounds with this method, ranging from 0.17 ng/L for [70]PCBM to 0.28 ng/L for C-60, and subsequent limit of quantitation (LOQ) values of 0.57-0.91 ng/L. Recoveries for the fullerenes were on average 120% in ultrapure and drinking water. Recoveries appeared to be lower, but still acceptable (e.g., >78%), in surface water. The developed approach is promising and will be applied, for example, in (1) environmental monitoring, (2) a more in-depth study of environmental fate and transformation products, and (3) studying water treatment efficiency of C-60, C-70, and the various functionalized fullerenes.

AB  - Effective spatial planning is crucial for cost-effectively and sustainably developing biomass energy resources due to the diffuse nature of biomass and high transportation cost. Using the spatial analysis technology, economic models and scenario analysis, this paper presents a spatial planning framework to identify the appropriate developing areas of biomass energy at regional level. The methodology is applied in a case study of Fujian Province, China. Firstly, spatial distribution of two kinds of biomass resources and the technical potential, i.e. the amount of power generation from agricultural and forestry residues in each supply area, were estimated by incorporating the spatial data and the statistical data. The results indicate that total technical potential of agricultural and forestry residues is estimated at 25.13 TW h y(-1), equivalent to approximately 19% of total electricity consumption in Fujian in 2010. In the second step, the economic analysis assesses the cost of biomass generation for each supply area on the basis of current market conditions. Ranking of the supply areas is then performed by using the priority development index (PDI), which can measure the priority of each biomass supply area by combining several influencing indicators. Finally, the selection of supply areas for power plants can be carried out according to its order in PDI until the total planed capacity in the region is met. The priority of the sub-regions and the corresponding cost of biomass generation for different planning scenarios can be explicitly visualized. The methodology can be applied to a wide area and can support the local authorities to define and implement a strategy for future biomass energy development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the last few decades, Europe has suffered from a number of severe flood events and, as a result, there has been a growing interest in probing alternative approaches to managing flood risk via prevention measures. A literature review reveals that, although in the last decades risk evaluation has been recognized as key element of risk management, and risk assessment methodologies (including risk analysis and evaluation) have been improved by including social, economic, cultural, historical and political conditions, the theoretical schemes are not yet applied in practice. One main reason for this shortcoming is that risk perception literature is mainly of universal and theoretical nature and cannot provide the necessary details to implement a comprehensive risk evaluation. This paper therefore aims to explore a procedure that allows the inclusion of stakeholders' perceptions of prevention measures in risk assessment. It proposes to adopt methods of risk communication (both one-way and two-way communication) in risk assessment with the final aim of making flood risk management more effective. The proposed procedure not only focuses on the effect of discursive risk communication on risk perception, and on achieving a shared assessment of the prevention alternatives, but also considers the effects of the communication process on perceived uncertainties, accepted risk levels, and trust in the managing institutions.
   The effectiveness of this combined procedure has been studied and illustrated using the example of the participatory flood prevention assessment process on the Sihl River in Zurich, Switzerland. The main findings of the case study suggest that the proposed procedure performed well, but that it needs some adaptations for it to be applicable in different contexts and to allow a (semi-) quantitative estimation of risk perception to be used as an indicator of adaptive capacity.

AB  - Dental enamel hypoplasia is usually read as a sign of a systematic growth disturbance during childhood. Following the analysis of human teeth from Herculaneum (79 AD, Central Italy), the authors focused on linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) manifestations in order to delineate a possible correlation between their frequency and distribution and the earthquake that occurred in 62 AD, which is well documented in historical literature. The human remains from Herculaneum were buried at the same time as the Vesuvius eruption and represent an exceptional snapshot of life in the Roman Imperial Age. The Goodman and Rose method (1990) was used for attributing an "age at the moment of stress" for every skeleton in order to delineate the epidemiology of the enamel hypoplasia. When LEH frequency was analysed by age, two different age groups showed relevant patterns of hypoplasia: the first peak was evident in individuals between 14 and 20 years who were younger than 6 years at the time of the 62 AD earthquake, and a second peak was noted in adults of 30 5 years old, which suggests the presence of another stressful event that occurred 10 years before the earthquake, around 53 AD. The bimodal distribution of enamel hypoplasia could be the consequence of two different historical periods characterized by instability in the food supply, unhygienic conditions, and epidemic episodes; our data suggest that the first peak could be related to a decline in health status as an effect of the 62 AD earthquake. The relationship between recent natural disasters and variations in health status in modern populations is well documented in scientific literature. Our research represents the first attempt to correlate the status of health to an earthquake of known date in an archaeological population.

AB  - Dredged material management is a key issue for the protection of aquatic environments. The in situ approach using caged bioindicator species has been chosen lately as a new methodology for the assessment of dredged material. In a tier testing approach, neutral red retention (NRR) assay has been applied as a screening tool to detect adverse changes in health status associated with contamination. Nevertheless, to authors' knowledge, little is known about the application and validation of this technique in sediment bioindicator species and under field conditions. Caged Ruditapes decussatus and Carcinus maenas were exposed during 28 days to potentially contaminated sediments at three sites in Algeciras Bay (SW Spain) and one site in Cadiz Bay (SW Spain). Lysosomal membrane stability was measured over time in haemolymph samples of exposed clams and crabs using the NRR assay. Sediment characterization of the study sites was performed in parallel. NRR time did not vary significantly (p > 0.05) over time in organisms from Cadiz Bay. Conversely, significant differences (p < 0.05) in NRR time were found in clams and crabs exposed to sediments from Algeciras Bay, which exhibited a 30-70% decrease in haemocyte lysosome membrane stability compared to day 0. Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between the drop of haemocyte lysosome membrane stability, in both crabs and clams, and the presence of metals (p < 0.05) and PAHs (p < 0.01) in the studied sediments. The results obtained confirmed the use of NRR assay as a suitable and sensitive method to be used in the assessment of sediment quality using as bioindicator species the clam R. philippinarum and the crab C. maenas.

AB  - Thiamine pyrophosphate (vitamin B-1) is an essential nutrient in the human diet, and is often referred as the energy vitamin. Potato contains modest amounts of thiamine. However, the genetic variation of thiamine concentrations in potato has never been investigated. In this study, we determined thiamine concentrations in freshly-harvested unpeeled tubers of 54 potato clones, the majority of them originating from the Pacific Northwest Potato Development Program. Tubers from 39 clones were collected from four different environmental conditions. Thiamine concentrations ranged from 292 to 1,317 ng g(-1) fresh weight, which gives a good estimate of the genetic variation available in Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum. Thirteen clones/varieties contained > 685 ng g(-1) fresh weight and four had > 800 ng g(-1) fresh weight over multiple harvests, indicating that these genotypes would contribute a significant amount of thiamine in the diet (> 10% of the Recommended Daily Allowance based on a 175- or 150-g serving, respectively). Broad-sense heritability for thiamine content was calculated as 0.49 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.21-0.72, suggesting that genetic variation accounted for about 50% of the observed variation. There were significant clone and clone x environment effects. After accounting for environmental variation, 25 clones were unstable across environments. Tubers harvested at a mature stage late in the growing season had higher amounts of thiamine than tubers harvested at a young stage early in the season. Storage at cold temperature did not lead to significant thiamine loss; instead, thiamine concentrations slightly increased during storage in some genotypes. These results suggest that increasing the concentration of thiamine in potato is feasible and that all potato varieties may one day be a significant source of thiamine in the human diet.

AB  - The natural-like assessment of essential oils is a demanding task due to the growing trend toward adulterations. Usually chiral chromatography was used for this purpose due to the capability of assessing stereospecificity which is directly related to the enzymatic pathways of each plant species. On the other hand, the quality of an essential oil involves also the evaluation of its oxidative state, mainly connected with the age and storage conditions. In fact, some modifications in the chemical profile of the oil can occur if not properly preserved. Alterations of the components due to oxidative reactions lead to the formation of peroxides, endoperoxides and epoxides, such as ascaridole and 1,2,4-trihydroxymenthane, usually present in very low amount, formed by the oxidation of terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene, respectively. Therefore, in the present research, the quality of Australian Tea Tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden & Betche) Cheel, Myrtaceae) was investigated by means of a multi heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatographic system coupled to a mass spectrometer detector and by conventional enantio-GC. The MDGC system allowed the complete separation of the compounds of interest transferred from the first column to a second dimension based on a different separation mechanism. The MS detector at the end of the second column provided the identification of the peaks with high similarity values because of their high purities after the multidimensional separation. Method validation was carried out, in order to use this procedure for routine application, monitoring the repeatability of 1D retention times and 2D peak areas, LoD and LoQ. Finally, enantiomeric ratios for chiral compounds were established to support quality data obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Questions have been raised about the wisdom of low-income homeownership policies for many reasons. One potential reason to be skeptical: low-income homebuyers perhaps may be constrained to purchase homes in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This is a potential problem because home purchases in such neighborhoods: (1) may limit appreciation; (2) may reduce quality of life for adults; and (3) may militate against reputed advantages of homeownership for children. Our study examines the neighborhood conditions of a group of 126 low-income homebuyers who purchased their first home with assistance from the Home Ownership Program (HOP) operated by the Denver Housing Authority. Our approach is distinguished by its use of a comprehensive set of objective and subjective indicators measuring the neighborhood quality of pre-move and post-move neighborhoods. Do low-income homebuyers sacrifice neighborhood quality to buy their homes? Our results suggest that the answer to this question is more complex than it might at first appear. On the one hand, HOP homebuyers purchased in a wide variety of city and suburban neighborhoods. Nonetheless, a variety of neighborhood quality indicators suggest that these neighborhoods, on average, were indeed inferior to those of Denver homeowners overall and to those in the same ethnic group. However, our analyses also revealed that their post-move neighborhoods were superior to the ones they lived in prior to homeownership. Moreover, very few HOP destination neighborhoods evinced severe physical, environmental, infrastructural, or socioeconomic problems, as measured by a wide variety of objective indicators or by the homebuyers' own perceptions. Indeed, only 10% of HOP homebuyers perceived that their new neighborhoods were worse than their prior ones, and only 8% held pessimistic expectations about their new neighborhoods' quality of life. Finally, we found that Black homebuyers fared less well than their Latino counterparts, on average, in both objective and subjective measures.

AB  - We investigated how the history of local disturbances in a watershed can influence the regional coherence of ecosystem properties in lakes that have similar morphometry and climatic conditions. We measured sedimentary delta C-13, delta N-15, C:N and %BSiO2 in Sooke Lake Reservoir (SOL) and Shawnigan Lake (SHL), which are located within 4 km of each other on Vancouver Island, Canada. SOL is an impounded lake whose watershed has been fully protected over the last century, although the lake level has been raised 3 times via impoundment during this period. SHL has a similar limnological regime, but the surrounding watershed has been developed extensively for residential uses. We investigated how a pulse disturbance regime in SOL (i.e. repeated dam raising) and a press disturbance regime in SHL (i.e. persistent development) influenced the variability of paleoindicators in each system over time. We found that these contrasting disturbance regimes reduced the regional temporal coherence of aquatic productivity between the two lakes (indicated by %BSiO2), but did not influence the regional coherence of nutrient status or the main carbon sources of the lakes (indicated by %C, %N and delta C-13). In contrast, an indicator of the sources and cycling of nitrogen (delta N-15) showed increased coherence. Local disturbances also affected the variability of the paleoindicators within each system over time. In SOL, impoundments led to both declines (%N, delta N-15) and increases (delta C-13) in the variability of paleoindicators. In SHL, persistent watershed development led to lower variability of two paleoindicators (%N, %BSiO2). Overall, our data suggest that local disturbances can influence the %BSiO2 and C:N ratio of lake sediments, but are less likely to alter the regional coherence of %C, %N and delta C-13 between lakes.

AB  - To identify the most important environmental drivers of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in boreal springs at different spatial scales, and to assess how well benthic assemblages correspond to terrestrially derived ecoregions.
   Finland.
   Benthic invertebrates were sampled from 153 springs across four boreal ecoregions of Finland, and these data were used to analyse patterns in assemblage variation in relation to environmental factors. Species data were classified using hierarchical divisive clustering (twinspan) and ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling. The prediction success of the species and environmental data into a priori (ecoregions) and a posteriori (twinspan) groups was compared using discriminant function analysis. Indicator species analysis was used to identify indicator taxa for both a priori and a posteriori assemblage types.
   The main patterns in assemblage clusters were related to large-scale geographical variation in temperature. A secondary gradient in species data reflected variation in local habitat structure, particularly abundance of minerogenic spring brooks. Water chemistry variables were only weakly related to assemblage variation. Several indicator species representing southern faunistic elements in boreal springs were identified. Discriminant function analysis showed poorer success in classifying sites into ecoregions based on environmental than on species data. Similarly, when classifying springs into the twinspan groups, classification based on species data vastly outperformed that based on environmental data.
   A latitudinal zonation pattern of spring assemblages driven by regional thermal conditions is documented, closely paralleling corresponding latitudinal patterns in both terrestrial and freshwater assemblages in Fennoscandia. The importance of local-scale environmental variables increased with decreasing spatial extent. Ecoregions provide an initial stratification scheme for the bioassessment of benthic macroinvertebrates of North European springs. Our results imply that climate warming, landscape disturbance and degradation of spring habitat pose serious threats to spring biodiversity in northern Europe, especially to its already threatened southern faunistic elements.

AB  - Rates of C-14-phenanthrene mineralization in contaminated, undisturbed marine sediments were measured using the whole core injection method to assess microbial natural attenuation activity as a function of sediment depth. Submerged sediments were sampled from Eagle Harbor, a marine superfund site in Puget Sound. Experiments show significant biodegradation activities (0.0012-0.0036 day(-1) in the sediment horizons from 0 to 10 cm. The purpose and scope of this paper is to evaluate the range of experimental conditions giving valid results; a mathematical simulation described competing contaminant C-14-phenanthrene diffusion and simultaneous biodegradation (Monod kinetics), both retarded by sorption. The effect of aging was examined with two sorption models in presumed pseudo-homogenous sediments having effective properties. The simulation predictions provide quantitative guidelines for the successful use of the whole core injection method. (1) The effective Monod constant K-S' in sediment is increased by a large partition coefficient K-P between sediment and water and makes the apparent C-14-phenanthrene biodegradation approach first-order kinetics. (2) When K-S' > 1 mg(-1) l(-1) the measured C-14-phenanthrene biodegradation extent is biased by inadequately distributed injected tracer only when less than 7% of the sediment horizon is initially probed and mixed with injected tracer. (3) A short incubation time (< 20 days) is necessary when a mobile indicator, e.g., gaseous (CO2)-C-14, is used. For longer incubation times, predictions show that a (CO2)-C-14 indicator diffuses to adjacent horizons, thus smearing the depth profile of biodegradation. (4) This method employing a radiolabeled tracer provides accurate biodegradation rates for freshly contaminated sediments, and represents an upper limit to the natural phenanthrene biodegradation extents if the contaminant is aged over 50 days.

AB  - Quality assurance is a major issue in the food industry. The authenticity of food ingredients and their traceability are required by consumers and authorities. Plant species such as barley (Hordeum vulgare), rice (Oryza sativa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) are very common among the ingredients of many processed food products; therefore the development of specific assays for their specific detection and quantification are needed. Furthermore, the production and trade of genetically modified lines from an increasing number of plant species brings about the need for control within research, environmental risk assessment, labeling/legal, and consumers' information purposes. We report here the development of four independent real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays suitable for identification and quantification of four plant species (barley, rice, sunflower, and wheat). These assays target gamma-hordein, gos9, helianthinin, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase sequences, respectively, and were able to specifically detect and quantify DNA from the target plant species. In addition, the simultaneous amplification of RALyase allowed bread from durum wheat to be distinguished. Limits of detection were 1 genome copy for barley, sunflower, and wheat and 3.3 copies for rice real-time PCR systems, whereas limits of quantification were 10 genome copies for barley, sunflower, or wheat and approximately 100 haploid genomes for rice real-time PCR systems. Real-time PCR cycling conditions of the four assays were stated as standard to facilitate their use in routine laboratory analyses. The assays were finally adapted to conventional PCR for detection purposes, with the exception of the wheat assay, which detects rye simultaneously with similar sensitivity in an agarose gel.

AB  - The chemical compositions of 28 representative crude oils and oil sand samples collected from the Bamianhe region of the Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China were studied in detail in order to understand their genetic relationships, biodegradation ranking and thermal maturity level. Molecular geochemical parameters indicate the presence of one single oil family in the Cenozoic reservoirs. A number of biomarker features support deposition of the source rocks for these oils under conditions of enhanced salinity/stratified water columns. The extremely low maturity levels of these "immature oils", as indicated by sterane isomerization ratios, were not supported by other maturity parameters. The genetic relationship between the oils and the Es-4 and Es-3 members of the Eocene-Oligocene Shahejie Formation present in the deeper part of the Niuzhuang Sag, but not those along the Niuzhuang South Slope was suggested using a wide range of molecular parameters. Variation in the sterane concentrations observed from potential source rocks with different maturity levels in the study area suggests a high probability of migration contamination of mature oils by immature bitumens along migration pathways or from intra-reservoir shales. Variation in the level of oil biodegradation could also create anomalies in the use of gross oil compositions as an indicator of oil maturity. Although the recent rapid subsidence of the Bohai Bay Basin and the saline depositional environment of one of the potential source rocks favor oil generation at relatively low maturity levels, most of the economic oils discovered in the Bamianhe region appear to have derived from conventionally mature source rocks but contain lower maturity fluids admixed with them.

AB  - The effects of sowing lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) strips in irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields on soil quality was evaluated in a Vertisol at the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI), and in a Vertisol and an Alfisol at two on-farm sites in New South Wales, Australia, from December 1995 to February 1997. Chemical (pH, EC, CEC, exchangeable sodium percentage, organic C), physical (air-filled porosity, plastic limit, dispersion index, soil strength), and biological (earthworm activity) indicators of soil quality were measured in each site. Overall soil quality in cotton and lucerne strips was evaluated using a 'soil health condition report card' format to award a score to each soil quality indicator and summing up the individual scores to give a single value for each crop at any one site. The decision to award a particular score to any one indicator was based on a value range derived from the Literature. In comparison with cotton, lucerne strips had higher air-filled porosity and organic C in the sub-soil of both on-farm sites, but had no significant effect at ACRI. However, lucerne did result in higher organic C in the soil surface at ACRI. Soil strength was higher and EC lower within lucerne strips in all three sites. Sowing lucerne strips resulted in higher earthworm activity at ACRI and at one commercial site, with highest numbers of earthworm burrows being observed in the former. We suggest that this has affected liquid flow patterns at ACRI where preferential flow mediated via the earthworm burrows appears to dominate. Overall soil quality was improved by lucerne strips only at ACRI, whereas that in the on-farm sites was not affected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemical and microbial aspects of soil quality are an important consideration when evaluating the benefits of soil conservation efforts such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of CRP and wheat-fallow (W-F) soils using soil biological and chemical parameters and C and N mineralization processes. The study was conducted on 20 CRP/W-F paired sites in eastern Washington, on Ritzville silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Calciorthidic Haploxerolls). Soils collected from the paired fields were analyzed for chemical and biological parameters that have been suggested as indicators of soil quality. Potential enzyme activities and soil N were higher in the CRP soil than the W-F soil. Although there were no significant differences in total organic carbon (TOC) or microbial biomass carbon (MBC) the C mineralization potentials and C pools mere significantly different between the CRP and W-F soils. Soil biota measurements showed there was greater active bacterial biomass in the CRP soil but greater fungal-feeding nematodes, flagellates, and amoebae in the W-F soil. The C mineralization study suggests that there is a significant increase in the secondary C pool of the CRP soil, which may indicate a buildup of higher quality soil organic matter and the potential for higher enzyme levels. When grass or straw was added to each soil type, the W-F soil produced more CO2 with either substrate than the CRP soil, indicating C limiting conditions in the W-F soil. Since it is unknown what constitutes good soil quality, these shifts in chemical and biological parameters may seem subtle. However, in general, trends in the data indicated that soil quality in the CRP was improved after 4 to 7 yr, compared with its previous management in W-F cropland.

AB  - Glaciers flowing down the Athabasca River valley during the last glacial period were fed both by local montane glaciers and by Cordilleran ice moving easterly across the Continental Divide from British Columbia, resulting in a major eastward surge into the 'ice-free corridor'. The timing of this event has been disputed for many years and has important implications for the study of paleoenvironmental conditions and the north-south migration of biota in the corridor. Chronologic and lithostratigraphic data from the Jasper region suggest that this event took place in the Late Wisconsinan. Subtill radiocarbon dates on wood in the Athabasca River valley indicate that non-glacial alluvial sediments began accumulating there sometime before 48 ka. A finite date of 29,100 +/- 560 BP (GSC 3792) on wood under till near Jasper provides a maximum age for the onset of the last glaciation in the region, although ice from west of the Rocky Mountain Trench probably did not cross the Continental Divide until after 21.5 ka. The occurrence of supraglacial metamorphic erratics as well as the distribution and nature of mapped glacial deposits and the trend of subglacial paleoflow indicators in the region east of the Rockies suggests that Late Wisconsinan glaciers flowing from the mountains coalesced with Laurentide glaciers and were deflected southeasterly along the mountain front. An even more extensive glacial event may have effected the region in pre-Late Wisconsinan times. The model of Late Wisconsinan glaciation presented here is in agreement with all known radiocarbon data from the area and is especially attractive when supratill dates on non-woody lacustrine organics are viewed in light of possible contamination by old carbon.

AB  - Urban hailstorms are rarely studied in detail. This work documents five urban storms in Alberta where damage has, on three occasions, set the record for Canada's most costly natural disaster. Information from newspapers, insurance companies, and disaster assistance programs was utilized to supplement meteorological records and information obtained from public surveys.
   The record-breaking hail swath which accompanied the 1987 Edmonton tornado was mapped using over 800 responses to an unprecedented newspaper survey. Tennis ball sized hail struck 125 km(2) of the city. Record-sized hailstones for Alberta were collected. Citizens' measurements of giant hailstones were compared to laboratory measurements. The rural storms were tracked using lightning detector information and damage was mapped using crop insurance and disaster assistance claims. The tornado-bearing storm was found to have a unique track.
   A late-season hailstorm which struck Calgary in 1991 was mapped using homeowner insurance claims organized by postal areas. Nine out of thirty areas had claims rates exceeding 50%, mainly for shingle replacement. Experiences of claims adjustors and an informal public survey were also utilized. Rural storms were mapped using weather radar and crop losses. The radar beam was strongly attenuated when it passed through hail-bearing storms and, thus, its ability to detect large hail was compromised.
   Weather conditions, urban and rural damaged areas, and insurance payments were compared for all five local hailstorms. These storms were discussed within the context of the long history of Alberta hail research and current trends in technology implementation. Forecasting of these hailstorms using conventional severe weather indicators was difficult in Calgary because of that city's proximity to the mountains. Hailstorms that struck Munich, Denver, and Toowoomba (Australia) were also discussed, and the hailstones collected from the great Munich storm were compared to those collected from the Edmonton storms.

AB  - Organic solutes, in particular glycine betaine and proline, have been detected as osmoprotective compounds in many microorganisms and herbaceous species.  However, for woody plants, very little information is available on mechanisms of adaptation to salt stress.  In the present study, effects of NaCl treatment on betaine and free amino acid contents in a clone of Populus trichocarpa x deltoides micropropagated vitroplants were analyzed using HPLC and silicate plate chromatography.  The application during 12 days of 50 to 200 mM NaCl to vitroplants cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog 1962.  Physiol. Plant.  15:  473-497) led to a progressive decrease of growth, leaf senescence, abscission, and apical necrosis.  Populus trichocarpa x deltoides was characterized by the absence of glycine betaine and/or proline accumulation.  However, trigonelline was found to increase in vitroplants subjected to 100 mM NaCl.  Trigonelline was also present in dormant buds harvested in natural conditions and missing in active buds.  In vitroplants, the content of some amino acids was strongly modified by salt stress.  A progressive accumulation of alanine and gamma-amino butyrate was particularly significant in roots, whereas the relative concentration of glutamine was strongly enhanced in leaves.  Leaf content of glutamate and ornithine attained maximum in the presence of 100 and 150 mM NaCl concentrations, and then decreased.  Arginine and serine pools were not significantly modified by salt treatment.  The variations in vitroplants were of small amplitude compared to those observed in mature poplars where winter rest was associated with a very high arginine level and with a disappearance of nearly all other free amino acids.  The results are discussed in relation to previous data obtained with herbaceous species and in relation to some metabolic pathways in poplars where trigonelline could be considered as a sensitive stress indicator.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the biological actions of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) are mediated via increases in its intracellular second messenger guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP).  Because cGMP egresses rapidly from target cells after ANF binding to particulate guanylate cyclase-linked receptors, extracellular cGMP may be a useful biological marker for the action of ANF in vivo under pathophysiological conditions.  The present studies tested the hypothesis that the avid sodium retention and renal ANF resistance characteristic of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) are associated with attenuated renal cGMP responses to ANF.  We assessed the natriuretic and cGMP responses to endogenous and exogenous ANF during the evolution of CHF produced by 6 days of rapid ventricular pacing in conscious dogs (n = 6).  Simultaneous measurement of plasma and urinary cGMP concentrations allowed determination of the net renal generation of cGMP, an indicator of the renal contribution to total urinary cGMP excretion.  In early CHF, increased sodium excretion and renal cGMP production were observed in association with increases in plasma ANF.  Exogenous ANF administration (10-mu-g/kg iv) before CHF also produced parallel increases in sodium excretion and renal cGMP production.  In more advanced CHF produced by 6 days of pacing, we observed avid sodium retention in association with reversal of earlier increases in renal cGMP production despite progressive increases in circulating ANF.  Natriuretic and renal cGMP responses to exogenous ANF were similarly attenuated in chronic CHF.  These studies suggest that 1) renal cGMP production is a useful biological marker for the renal natriuretic action of ANF; 2) endogenous ANF contributes to the maintenance of sodium excretion in early CHF via increases in renal cGMP production; and 3) the avid sodium retention and renal ANF resistance in advanced CHF are, in part, linked to attenuated renal cGMP responses to endogenous and exogenous ANF.

AB  - In recent years, significant breakthroughs have been achieved in shale gas exploration and exploitation of marine and continental shales in petroliferous basins of China. As an important petroliferous basin in China, marine-terrestrial transitional shale was widely distributed among the Southern North China Basin (SNCB). However, biomarkers distribution characteristics of marine-terrestrial transitional shale in the SNCB, which can reveal the organic matter inputs and paleoenvironmental characteristics, is not widely concerned. In general, organic matter in a transitional environment can be affected by the amounts of organic matters input from fresh water and aquatic organisms from the sea. To systematically investigate the organic geochemical characteristics of biomarkers in marine-terrestrial transitional shale from SNCB, core samples from the Upper Shihezi, Shanxi and Taiyuan formations were obtained from a single borehole in the SNCB. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was conducted on the saturated hydrocarbons. n-Alkanes, acyclic isoprenoid alkanes, terpanes, and steranes were detected to study the change in organic matter inputs and sedimentary paleoenvironment of the marine-terrestrial transitional shale. The results reveal that organic matter inputs obviously changed during the sedimentary period in the study area of the SNCB. In addition, the terrestrial higher plants contributed more organic matter to shale from the Upper Shihezi Formation compared to the Taiyuan Formation and the Shanxi Formation. The shift of organic matter inputs is consistent with marine regression in the Early Permian period, which may significantly influence the organic matter input characteristics. Meanwhile, the marine-terrestrial transitional shale, including samples from the Taiyuan, Shanxi and Upper Shihezi formations, was deposited in a relatively oxic condition during the depositional process.

AB  - Statistical water quality forecast models are useful tools to assist with beach management. In particular, multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been successfully developed for prediction of fecal indicator bacteria concentrations for beaches in river, lake, and marine environments. Nevertheless, an unresolved challenging issue is the reliable prediction of infrequent events of high bacterial concentrations to inform beach closure decisions to protect public health. The number of field data available for the infrequent events is typically an order of magnitude less than that for days when the water quality criterion is met-MLR models often perform poorly in predicting bacterial concentrations on days when the beaches should be closed. For beach management in Hong Kong, MLR models have been developed to predict beach water quality indices in terms of four gradings (BWQI-1 to 4) based on Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based binary classification (EasyEnsemble) model using class-imbalance learning to predict "very poor" occasions (BWQI-4).when E. coli concentration exceeds 610 counts/100 mL. Models are developed for three marine beaches with different hydrographic and pollution characteristics using a 30 year data set spanning three periods with different water quality status. The model-data comparison over a wide range of conditions shows that the proposed method results in a significant improvement in the prediction of "very poor" water quality. The proposed class-imbalance method for predicting rare events has an F-score of 0.84, and it significantly outperforms MLR and classification tree (CT) models with corresponding F-scores of 0.39 and 0.69. A robust beach water quality forecast system can hence be developed using hybrid MLR-binary classification modeling.

AB  - One of the major impacts of climate change has been the marked rise in global temperature. Recently, we demonstrated that high temperatures (1-week exposure) disrupt prooxidant-antioxidant homeostasis and promote cellular apoptosis in the American oyster. In this study, we evaluated the effects of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) on tissue morphology, extrapallial fluid (EPF) conditions, heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), dinitrophenyl protein (DNP, an indicator of reactive oxygen species, ROS), 3-nitrotyrosine protein (NTP, an indicator of RNS), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein expressions, and cellular apoptosis in gills and digestive glands of oysters collected on the southern Texas coast during the winter (15 degrees C), spring (24 degrees C), summer (30 degrees C), and fall (27 degrees C). Histological observations of both tissues showed a notable increase in mucus production and an enlargement of the digestive gland lumen with seasonal temperature rise, whereas biochemical analyses exhibited a significant decrease in EPF pH and protein concentration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed higher expression of HSP70 along with the expression of DNP and NTP in oyster tissues during summer. Intriguingly, CAT and SOD protein expressions exhibited significant upregulation with rising seasonal temperatures (15 to 27 degrees C), which decreased significantly in summer (30 degrees C), leaving oysters vulnerable to oxidative and nitrative damage. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase in HSP70 mRNA levels in oyster tissues during the warmer seasons. In situ TUNNEL assay showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells in seasons with high temperature. These results suggest that elevated SST induces oxidative/nitrative stress through the overproduction of ROS/RNS and disrupts the antioxidant system which promotes cellular apoptosis in oysters.

AB  - Ethiopia has an estimated >10,000 MW of geothermal energy potential, more than double its current power generating capacity (4,400 MW). Electricity access stands at 44% of the total population, with 31% in rural areas, so effective development of this low-carbon resource could make a significant impact to equitable delivery of electricity. However, geothermal energy exploitation must be done responsibly to protect valuable water resources under stress from climate-change driven drought conditions and competing uses across agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors. Our review provides progress updates on geothermal developments-which soon aim to deliver more than 1,000 MW of electricity- and performs a high-level assessment of hydrochemical data for ground and surface waters across Ethiopia. A water quality database was built using publicly available information and three quality control criteria: well-defined sample location, cation-anion balance (CAB) of +/- 10%, and clear fluid type definition. Ethiopia hosts two major geothermal water types, sodium-alkalinity dominated in the Main Ethiopian Rift and sodium-chloride dominated in the Afar Depression, separated by sodium-mixed waters between Dofan-Fantale and Meteka. H and O stable isotopes suggest a largely meteoric source for geothermal waters, with delta O-18 enrichment adding to evidence of a high enthalpy resource at Tendaho. Hydrochemical investigations provide critical information for successful delivery of sustainable geothermal energy developments. However, the current lack of data available for Ethiopia poses a significant challenge for completion of predevelopment baselines and ongoing environmental impact assessment. We encourage the release of unpublished findings from private companies and government agencies to build upon our database and demonstrate social and environmental responsibility in the development of Ethiopian geothermal resources.

AB  - A 700 km long soil transect in the southern Russian plain was studied. The difference in the average annual precipitation within the transect was 240 mm/year, and the average annual temperature was 3 degrees C. The objective of this study was to understand the behaviour of chemical elements and features of chemical weathering in semiarid soils that developed on loesses and loess-like sediments. It was found that the semi-arid soils of the Russian plain are characterized by a low intensity of present chemical weathering. In an alkaline environment with a low amount of precipitation, the rate and direction of silicate weathering are determined not by the climate, but by the geochemical environment of the soil formation, which had already taken shape by the beginning of the Holocene. The alkaline oxidative environment hinders the hydrolysis and prevents the migration of chemical elements in ionic form. As a result, the removal of chemical elements from primary silicate minerals to soil solutions is not a determining process for vertical geochemical migration. The degree of weathering of present soils is mostly inherited from the parent materials of the Quaternary. Conditions for acid hydrolysis occur only in the upper horizons during increased biochemical activity and lower pH values. However, soil processes (carbonatization, salinization, illitization, and loessivage) make the behaviour of alkali (Na2O, K2O) and alkalineearth (MgO, CaO, Sr) metals more complex, involving them in recycling in the upper soil horizons, and hinder the quantitative characterization of weathering of silicate minerals. Therefore, the use of CIA geochemical indicator as a quantitative measure of chemical weathering for semiarid soils formed in the Holocene becomes problematic. This study will improve the understanding of the geochemical processes that took place in modern soils in semi-arid regions and clarify the possibility of using geochemical weathering ratios in saline sediments.

AB  - With the continued development of 5G mobile communications technology, the implementation of high-power communication systems has become a key indicator of developed nations. Communication modules are also trending toward wide bandwidth and high-capacity Multi-Input and Multi-Output systems. As the signal transmission speed and resolution continue with the increasing trend, the power used to operate these communications systems increase, causing extreme heat generation by transmit/receive modules (T/R module). In conditions where computation load increases in micro design systems, chips must operate in environments that are narrow, sealed, and have no convection, which can drastically increase the thermal load within a system. If no proper cooling system is utilized, the system fails or operates at impacted performance due to excessive temperatures. To solve the aforementioned problem, this study aimed to optimize the design of the cooling system in the T/R modules of communications systems by integrating heat pipes, cooling fans, cooling fins, and cooling chips within a limited space. We also proposed four types of cold plates based on the different directional clamp-in configuration methods of heat pipes within copper panels and utilized the finite element method to simulate and analyze the heat dissipation performance. The simulation results reveal that cold plates of types I and II can achieve a better heat dissipation performance. Finally, types I and II cold plates were selected for production and experimental verification. The results show that heat dissipation performances were similar to simulation results. The results also confirmed that type II cold plate has a better temperature uniformity and heat transfer efficiency. Thus, the cooling mechanism depicted in this study is viable in practical applications. The proposed mechanisms can also provide a reference for heat dissipation design patterns in different electronic module settings.

AB  - Management of urban trees is key to sustaining and increasing essential ecosystem services, and most management decisions are made based on urban tree inventories. Vitality is one of the key parameters when conducting tree inventories. However, consensus on how vitality should be assessed is lacking, and there is limited understanding of how visual vitality assessments are affected by aspects of different professional background, growing sites and tree age. In a Delphi study with 19 participants completing the whole study, we asked urban foresters and ecologists to assess the vitality of 21 trees in urban and rural settings and to rate how important 40 different parameters were for their assessment of each tree's vitality. The data obtained were analysed using Cronbach's alpha, unconstrained ordination, hierarchal clustering and indicator values. In testing for differences, mixed general linear models and constrained ordination were used. Professionals participating in the study showed good overall agreement in ranking trees as more or less vital, but with large differences in what was considered a fully vital tree. When performing vitality assessments, the parameters used differed between old and young trees, and between urban and rural sites. There was also a systematic difference between urban foresters and ecologists in performing tree vitality assessments, with ecologists consistently rating tree vitality higher and using fewer parameters. Parameters used for assessing vitality comprised aspects relating to sign of decay, external damage, loss/death of biomass, growth performance and site conditions. Vitality should thus be regarded as a complex parameter that needs calibration-based assessment approaches and the person performing the assessment should always be included as an additional variable. Overall, this study clearly showed the need to establish consensus on how tree vitality should be assessed and rated.

AB  - The use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) as a replacement in new concrete has gained popularity worldwide as a method of reducing natural aggregate consumption. Many engineers, owners, and agencies are reticent to use RCA due to a lack of understanding on how the material will impact overall concrete properties. This lack of acceptance has been hindered by the difficulty of doing large-scale studies because of the time and cost of casting different concrete mixtures. Many individual studies have been completed but little work has been done to analyze that work to make broad conclusions on RCA concrete mechanical properties. This paper presents the development and analysis of a database of mechanical properties of concrete containing coarse RCA generated from 115 peer-reviewed journal articles. A sensitivity study of RCA systems was conducted through a full-factorial analysis to explore how the mixture design proportions influence the RCA concrete hardened properties. On average, the compressive strengths of concrete systems with 20% or less RCA replacement were 2% lower than that of the natural aggregate systems. Increased levels of RCA replacements decreased the average concrete compressive strengths with the highest average strength loss, in which a 10% reduction compared to natural aggregate systems is observed at 100% RCA replacement level. Results indicate that, in general, adequate concrete strengths for a variety of applications can be achieved at all replacement ratios of coarse RCA. Impacts of mixture design properties on particular mechanical properties are presented along with bivariate contour plots that can be used by concrete mixture designers to better estimate RCA concrete properties. This work supports an increased adoption of RCA by providing broad conclusions supported by statistical analysis that show typical performance of RCA concrete across a variety of design inputs.

AB  - Alpine mountain lake biota are adapted to harsh conditions making them particularly vulnerable to global change. However, as each mountain lake has a different limnology, there are supposed to be differential re-sponses and degrees of resilience to climate change. In this study, 23 lakes in the Bavarian-Tyrolian Alps dif-fering in altitude, size and geology were examined for their diatom community response to climate warming. Subfossil data were related to 210Pb and 137Cs-dated sediment cores. Correspondence and regression analyses revealed five different assemblage developments depending on lake depth, altitude and origin. Planktic species, especially Cyclotella, dominated deeper and lower-altitude mountain lakes earlier and stronger. This depends on the stability and temperature of the epilimnion which in turn determines the tipping point. Instead, shallow lakes exhibit higher species reorganizations of diatom assemblages. Mountain lakes of lower altitudes or affected by water level fluctuations (WLF) establish complex substrata and Achnanthidium accompanied by epiphytic species or Denticula tenuis in WLF-lakes replace dominating Staurosira. Conversely, alpine shallow lakes lack directional shifts and Staurosira dominate, but approach the tipping point of macrophyte establishment. In a deep doline lake, Diploneis species replace Nitzschia denticula with negligible planktic proportions. In mountain lakes with direct anthropogenic influence, enhanced nutrient supply disguises diatom response to global warming. These findings revealed deep mountain lakes with low nutrient levels to be more resilient to climate change than shallow lakes with a higher trophic status as the onset of the response to rising temperatures is earlier and thus smoother. In conclusion, subfossil diatom analyses can provide a powerful tool for climate change assessment and other anthropogenic impacts on mountain lakes.

AB  - The present paper deals with identification, delineation and ecological assessment of micro-habitats in Gangtok municipal area of Sikkim Himalaya. Long continued urbanization and tourism activities have been responsible for fragmentation and deterioration of the original woodlands of this mountainous area. Ecological surveys have been carried out along quadrats and transect to evaluate each of the habitat types in terms of species diversity and species richness. Results show that the Marglef's Index, has received highest value (4.03) for the woodlands of Ranipol locality, located at the lower part of the study area, where more than 19 plant species have been enumerated. The lowest (1.89) value of the index has been obtained in case of Lower M.G. road woodland habitat located as the middle slope of the spur over which the Gangtok urban area extends. Closely similar results have been obtained from computation of Menhinick's Index, value of which ranges between 0.02 and 0.09. Highest species dominance (Simpson's index value = 0.90) and species diversity (Shannon's index value = 0.83) have been found in case of Tadong woodland area while the lowest value of 0.47 for both the indices has been obtained for M.G. road. In Gangtok Municipal area the most dominant species is Dhupi (Cryptomeria japonica) particularly abundant in the upper part of the area namely in Burtok and Chandmari. In the middle part, namely in Deorali and Lower M.G. Marg the dominant species is Chilouni (Schima wallichii) and in the lower part i.e. in Ranipol and Tadong the dominant species is Utis (Alnus nepalensis). This study suggests that the distribution of species and species richness of different micro-habitat are largely regulated by altitude, climatic condition and topographic factors.

AB  - One problem that convoys the industrial revolution is the worsening problem of wastewater containing dyes of the effluents from the growing number of dye-producing industries. This study exploited the use of spent coffee grounds (SCG) as a precursor in making activated carbon to treat water contaminated with aniline yellow dye (AYD). The activated carbon, chemically modified using potassium hydroxide, was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The optimization of the operating parameters in AYD removal was done using Design Expert 7.0 software through the central composite design of response surface methodology to attain the maximum removal efficiency. The result showed that SCG activated carbon has mesopore and micropore structures with honeycomb particle shapes. Several functional groups were identified on the surface, a good indicator as a potential adsorbent. Optimum conditions were found, which are 35 ppm initial AYD concentration, 0.6 g adsorbent dose, and 2.5 h contact time; and achieved a removal of AYD at 88.72 +/- 1.88% with an adsorption capacity of 2.58 mg/g. The adsorption took place heterogeneously in multilayer as revealed in the isotherm analysis with Freundlich as most fitted having R-1 value of 0.9868. The adsorption mechanism is dependent on the physical amount of dye adsorbate or its concentration factor as revealed in kinetic studies with pseudo-first order as the most fitted model having R-2 value of 0.9832. The overall result demonstrated that the activated carbon from SCG is a good material in removing the dye in the contaminated water with huge implications for the future of treating dye-contaminated water from industries.

AB  - The article introduces the problems of managing the risks of stimulating gas influx at the final stage of gas field development. The extraction of hydrocarbons, including gas, is carried out from numerous fields throughout the Russian Federation. The deposits differ in their properties and characteristics, which influence the indicators of the efficiency of extraction of hydrocarbon reserves, and are also distinguished by the extent of reserves depletion. In modern conditions of economic development at the macro- and micro levels, it is becoming increasingly important to extract gas reserves at the final stage of gas field development. This article is aimed at identifying the main risks and methods of their managing at the final stage of gas field development. The main problems at the final stage of gas field development are outlined. Risks in the gas field development with hard-to-recover gas reserves are highlighted and characterized. Actions to reduce the risks when carrying out mining works at the final stage of gas field development are presented. It is shown that the application of risk management methods at the final stage of gas field development includes, first of all, forecasting, as well as the introduction of a system of measures to reduce, prevent situations leading to damage and losses; herewith, risk management has to be implemented in stages. The effect of measures to manage risk reduction in the development of gas fields and the operation of field facilities will be shown through a reduction in the likelihood of risk. Nevertheless, it is currently not possible to completely eliminate the occurrence of risky cases, since this requires large investments (material, human, economic) to obtain additional information and conduct analytical and scientific research. This is also affected by the fact that it is fundamentally impossible to reliably predict the future state of the gas field and the environment.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the relationship between form and function of two Loricariidae species (Hypostomus punctatus and Parotocinclus maculicauda) from a Neotropical coastal stream. We performed morphological-dietary analysis and discussed their coexistence strategies, as well. We hypothesized that both species use similar food resources according to their morphology but differences in habitat use facilitate their coexistence. In order to test this hypothesis, morphology, diet and habitat use were analyzed for both species. Trophic variance and the Pianka Niche Overlap index were calculated to explore the differences in trophic niche. Correlations between species abundance and water flow were applied to test habitat use. Principal Component Analysis and one Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance were applied to test differences between morphology and diet of both species. Morphological-dietary relationships were tested with Mantel test correlations. Total abundance of H. punctatus was higher in the stream channel with higher water flow. The dominant food items were sediment and organic matter for both species, and high trophic niche overlap was revealed. Additionally, morphology did not explain feeding habits for both species. Morphological characteristics were significantly different, especially for intestine length, relative area of the dorsal fin, ventral flattening and mouth attributes. The study site was rich in sand sediment, mud, and clay that are not considered good substrates to the establishment and growing of periphyton, which is an important trophic resource to Loricariidae species. Here, low consumption of periphyton can provide a possible explanation for the feeding similarity and the weak morphological-dietary relationships for both species. Thus, the environmental conditions can be more important for diet composition when compared to the similar and specialized morphology of loricariids.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is altering the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they are frequently disturbed by intensified management practices. This also threatens belowground organisms that are responsible for providing crucial ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and plant disease suppression. Amongst these organisms, earthworms are of particular importance as they can modulate the effects of climate change on soil organisms by modifying the biotic and abiotic soil conditions. However, they are also known to decline under intensified management, justifying their use as key biotic indicators of intensified agriculture. Yet, our knowledge of the responses of belowground species to the interacting effects of warming and land-use intensification (simulated by earthworm reduction in the experimental setup) remains limited. Here, we tested the interactive effects of soil warming and reduced earthworm densities on soil protists, nematodes, meso- and macrofauna, and their diversity in a common barley system in the Hohenheim Climate Change Experiment. We found that belowground species richness was lowest at elevated temperature and reduced earthworm densities, indicating that earthworms can buffer warming effects on belowground biodiversity. Furthermore, warming increased the densities of plant feeding nematodes, and herbivorous macrofauna benefitted from reduced earthworm densities. Our results indicate that warming and reduced earthworm densities may simultaneously modify the functioning and service provisioning of soils via shifts in diversity and density of soil biota that would likely lead to simplified below ground food webs. These findings thus highlight the importance of maintaining greater densities of ecosystem engineers like earthworms that may help buffering the detrimental effects of climate warming in agricultural systems.

AB  - Pseudotachylyte veins are solidified frictional melt generated by localized highstrain-rate deformation, and they are commonly considered to be reliable geological indicators of seismic slip. While originally thought to occur primarily in the upper crust, field studies suggest pseudotachylyte can also form far below the frictional-viscous transition. This implies a more complex interplay between brittle and crystal-plastic deformation in crustal-scale fault systems. We report a new example of deep pseudotachylyte from the Paleoproterozoic granulite-facies strikeslip Cora Lake shear zone in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Multiple generations of pseudotachylyte have been variably overprinted by plastic deformation and growth of high-grade metamorphic mineral assemblages (including garnet, orthopyroxene, and/or clinopyroxene). Undeformed pseudotachylyte generation surfaces locally display sinistral offsets, and deformed pseudotachylyte shows unambiguous shear sense indicators compatible with left-lateral Cora Lake shear zone kinematics. The vein networks are commonly proximal to and inherit kinematically compatible semibrittle shear fractures. Thermobarometry and modeling of mineral stability fields for the overprinted pseudotachylyte suggest vein generation between 0.7 and 0.8 GPa and 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C (corresponding to depths from 24 to 28 km). Combined with the kinematic compatibility and the well-constrained regional exhumation history, this suggests that the Cora Lake pseudotachylyte formed contemporaneously with the waning stages of deformation in the shear zone and constitutes one of the deepest examples of fault-related pseudotachylyte yet reported in North America. Evidence exists for several possible formation mechanisms, including in situ generation via ductile shear heating-induced plastic instabilities, as well as from interaction with earthquakes nucleating in the overlying brittle fault system. All of these possible mechanisms ultimately suggest a more rheologically complex environment than might typically be expected for these lower-crustal pressure and temperature conditions.

AB  - Safe structures are the backbone of human coping capacity towards healthy living that can contribute significantly in reducing risk during hazards. However, due to various natural and anthropogenic activities, about 12.6% of land areas (excluding snow-covered area) in India are prone to landslide posing threat to life and property. Moreover, many structures in the hilly terrain of India are non-engineered which results in high vulnerability of buildings. Therefore, assessment of physical vulnerability is a fundamental step in reducing landslide risk. The study aims to present a methodology to assess vulnerability of the buildings using indicator-based approach at site-specific scale. Several studies to assess vulnerability of buildings due to landslides have been carried out by researchers from European countries. But these methodologies cannot be implemented successfully in India because of different geological and climatic condition. The different components of the discussed methodology for physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to landslides such as landslide intensity (a function of landslide velocity and volume) and resistance of buildings (a function of structural and non-structural features) are worked out and suggested by different researchers. However, putting them together, to present as a framework (specifically in Indian scenario) is the novelty of the present work. Further, consideration of the concept of proximity of buildings to landslides' in the process of site-specific vulnerability assessment is newly proposed. To address this issue, fifteen potential indicators contributing to vulnerability of buildings have been identified and a systematic form for documentation of data during field survey has also been prepared (keeping in view the construction bye-laws and techniques followed in India). The methodology discussed is further successfully implemented in ward number 10 of Gopeshwar Township (Chamoli District), Uttarakhand, India.

AB  - Economic efficiency at agricultural companies greatly depends on availability of production means, including fixed and circulating assets, their structure and application efficiency. Specialization has a significant impact on the structure of production means. Problems of optimization of the structure of production means are studied by scientists from near abroad, but their research are of fragmented character and mostly do not take into account specialization of agricultural producers. In this regard, the relevance of research conducted is conditioned by the need to determine the perfect structure of fixed and circulating assets in the context of specialization profile, which will serve as a guide for agricultural companies, especially when scheduling investment activities. The paper dwells on the following main areas of specialization: dairy and beef cattle; grain production with dairy cattle breeding; grain production with dairy and beef cattle breeding; dairy cattle breeding. The effect of the natural material and age structure of fixed assets, as well as the structure of circulating assets depending on the functional role for the economic and financial indicators of agricultural companies in the context of specialization is analyzed. The effect of qualitative indicators of agricultural production on the structure of production was studied, partial dependencies between the studied indicators were identified, and the perfect structure of fixed and circulating assets was determined according to specialization. Investment options in fixed assets of inefficiently functioning agricultural companies were proposed to bring their structure to the optimal level. In terms of specialization profile, models were constructed reflecting the effect of factor indicators (cost of production means elements) on the efficient one (revenue from agricultural products sales). Regression analysis allowed to determine the nature of the effect of factor indicators on the efficient one, as well as to identify reserves for increasing production and financial indicators. These developments can be used for scheduling production and investment activities of agricultural companies.

AB  - In today's global digital world, smart sustainable development, value and wealth creation are among the most important goals of society. Industry performance entails the incorporation of the objectives of smart sustainable development, namely social and territorial cohesion, economic efficiency, innovation, digital and environmental performance, into a company's operational practices. Companies that compete globally are increasingly required to commit to and report on the overall smart sustainability performances of operational initiatives. The current indicator frameworks that are available to measure overall business sustainability do not effectively address all aspects of sustainability at an operational level, especially in developing countries such as Romania, Belarus or Macedonia. For the sake of achieving these goals and objectives, the corporation, investor and government need some instruments in order to measure the potential value of each investment opportunity. It is clear that these instruments are not capable of predicting the exact future, they just provide some piece of information and advice that help the investor and government in the decisions he makes. Among these criteria, the most common types are Return on Investment (ROI), economic and sustainable value added (EVA and SVA). These criteria follow the performance assessment with regard to the changes in the sustainable value and alongside maximizing the long-term shareholder and society returns. In this paper, one of the most important criteria; i.e. EVA, is investigated from several viewpoints. First, it is demonstrated the attempt to calculate EVA at the industry level using aggregate indicators according to the common business methodology. For this, we generally assume that economic value is created by investment in excess return compared to its cost. We adopted EVA indicator to Belarusian general economic conditions and specifics of available aggregate sector data by adjusting return on investment and cost of capital.

AB  - The impact of climate variability on the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of different land cover types and the reaction of NPP to drought conditions are still unclear, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This research utilizes public-domain data for the period 2000 through 2013 to analyze these aspects for several land cover types in Sudan and Ethiopia, as examples of data-scarce countries. Spatio-temporal variation in NPP, water use efficiency (WUE) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) for several land covers were correlated with variations in precipitation, temperature and drought at different time scales, i.e. 1, 3, 6 and 12 months using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) datasets. WUE and CUE were estimated as the ratios of NPP to actual evapotranspiration and NPP to Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), respectively. Results of this study revealed that NPP, WUE and CUE of the different land cover types in Ethiopia have higher magnitudes than their counterparts in Sudan. Moreover, they exhibit higher sensitivity to drought and variation in precipitation. Whereas savannah represents the most sensitive land cover to drought, croplands and permanent wetlands are the least sensitive ones. The inter-annual variation in NPP, WUE and CUE in Ethiopia is likely to be driven by a drought of time scale of three months. No statistically significant correlation was found for Sudan between the inter-annual variations in these indicators with drought at any of the time scales considered in the study. Our findings are useful from the view point of both food security for a growing population and mitigation to climate change as discussed in the present study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Chrysanthemum is one kind of ornamental plant well-known and widely used in the world. However, its quality and production were severely affected by low temperature conditions in winter and early spring periods. Therefore, we used the RNA-Seq platform to perform a de novo transcriptome assembly to analyze chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum) transcription response to low temperature.
   Results: Using Illumina sequencing technology, a total of 86,444,237 high-quality clean reads and 93,837 unigenes were generated from four libraries: T01, controls; T02, 4 degrees C cold acclimation (CA) for 24 h; T03, - 4 degrees C freezing treatments for 4 h with prior CA; and T04, - 4 degrees C freezing treatments for 4 h without prior CA. In total, 7583 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of 36,462 annotated unigenes were identified. We performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, and excavated a group of important cold-responsive genes related to low temperature sensing and signal transduction, membrane lipid stability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and osmoregulation. These genes encode many key proteins in plant biological processes, such as protein kinases, transcription factors, fatty acid desaturase, lipid-transfer proteins, antifreeze proteins, antioxidase and soluble sugars synthetases. We also verified expression levels of 10 DEGs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, we performed the determination of physiological indicators of chrysanthemum treated at low temperature, and the results were basically consistent with molecular sequencing results.
   Conclusion: In summary, our study presents a genome-wide transcript profile of Dendranthema grandiflorum var. jinba and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of D. grandiflorum in response to low temperature. These data contributes to our deeper relevant researches on cold tolerance and further exploring new candidate genes for chilling-tolerance and freezing-tolerance chrysanthemum molecular breeding.

AB  - Pasting is one of the most important properties of wheat starch determining the flour quality and functionality. Twenty three New Plant Type (NPT) wheat derivatives along with three checks (PBW 343, HD 2329, and Raj 3765) have been studied in multi-location trials to assess the variation and environment induced fluctuations for their starch pasting properties. Although all flour pasting characteristics varied, Breakdown Viscosity (BV) and Setback Viscosity (SV) exhibited greater variability across environments. Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis indicated significant interactions between Genotypes and Environments Interaction (GEI) in starch pasting properties. Genotypes accounted largest proportion (39.78%) of the Sum of squares (SQ) for peak viscosity (PV) followed by environments (33.30%) and GEI (33.30%). Trough Viscosity (TV), GEI accounted for the largest proportion (40.44%) of the SQ followed by environments (31.76%) and genotypes (27.80%). Genotypes accounted for the largest proportion (44.0%) of the SQ for (BV) followed by environments (33.30%) and GEI (21.59%). With respect to FV, environments accounted for the largest proportion (43.07%) of the SQ followed by GEI (30.84%) and genotypes (26.09%). Environments accounted for the largest proportion (52.48%) of the SQ followed by genotypes (23.89%) and GEI (23.65%) for SV. The interactions between genotype and locations differed greatly; however, some genotypes apparently found to be specifically adaptable to growth location. Correlation among starch pasting characteristics revealed that significant positive correlations were found between PV and BV, FV and TV, as well as SV and FV in all the individual environments tested that can be utilized in selection and simultaneous improvement in for starch quality improvement.

AB  - The ubiquitous airborne fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is inhaled by humans every day. In the lung, it is able to quickly adapt to the humid environment and, if not removed within a time frame of 4-8 h, the pathogen may cause damage by germination and invasive growth. Applying a to-scale agent-based model of human alveoli to simulate early A. fumigatus infection under physiological conditions, we recently demonstrated that alveolar macrophages require chemotactic cues to accomplish the task of pathogen detection within the aforementioned time frame. The objective of this study is to specify our general prediction on the as yet unidentified chemokine by a quantitative analysis of its expected properties, such as the diffusion coefficient and the rates of secretion and degradation. To this end, the rule-based implementation of chemokine diffusion in the initial agent-based model is revised by numerically solving the spatio-temporal reaction-diffusion equation in the complex structure of the alveolus. In this hybrid agent-based model, alveolar macrophages are represented as migrating agents that are coupled to the interactive layer of diffusing molecule concentrations by the kinetics of chemokine receptor binding, internalization and re-expression. Performing simulations for more than a million virtual infection scenarios, we find that the ratio of secretion rate to the diffusion coefficient is the main indicator for the success of pathogen detection. Moreover, a subdivision of the parameter space into regimes of successful and unsuccessful parameter combination by this ratio is specific for values of the migration speed and the directional persistence time of alveolar macrophages, but depends only weakly on chemokine degradation rates.

AB  - Monitoring universal health coverage (UHC) focuses on information on health intervention coverage and financial protection. This paper addresses monitoring intervention coverage, related to the full spectrum of UHC, including health promotion and disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliation. A comprehensive core set of indicators most relevant to the country situation should be monitored on a regular basis as part of health progress and systems performance assessment for all countries. UHC monitoring should be embedded in a broad results framework for the country health system, but focus on indicators related to the coverage of interventions that most directly reflect the results of UHC investments and strategies in each country. A set of tracer coverage indicators can be selected, divided into two groupspromotion/prevention, and treatment/careas illustrated in this paper. Disaggregation of the indicators by the main equity stratifiers is critical to monitor progress in all population groups. Targets need to be set in accordance with baselines, historical rate of progress, and measurement considerations. Critical measurement gaps also exist, especially for treatment indicators, covering issues such as mental health, injuries, chronic conditions, surgical interventions, rehabilitation, and palliation. Consequently, further research and proxy indicators need to be used in the interim. Ideally, indicators should include a quality of intervention dimension. For some interventions, use of a single indicator is feasible, such as management of hypertension; but in many areas additional indicators are needed to capture quality of service provision. The monitoring of UHC has significant implications for health information systems. Major data gaps will need to be filled. At a minimum, countries will need to administer regular household health surveys with biological and clinical data collection. Countries will also need to improve the production of reliable, comprehensive, and timely health facility data.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary

AB  - Lead pollution has increased over the past four centuries with industrialisation, urbanisation, and the use of motor vehicles. In Japan, lead concentrations in human bones of the Edo period (AD 1603-1867) from urban areas were found to be higher than those from suburban areas. Because most wild geese breed in the subarctic zone and winter in the temperate zone, it is to be expected that lead concentrations in archaeological goose bones from domestic individuals would be higher than those from wild individuals because of the difference in their life cycle. In this study, we measured and compared lead concentrations in bones of geese, other birds (duck, chicken, heron, and crow), mammals (dog, cat, pig/wild boar, and deer), and in a human tooth, all from the Kenmin-kan Atochi site, Japan (Edo period). We found that lead pollution affected not only humans but also animals and that environmental lead pollution was widespread in the town.One of the goose bones analysed, a broken and healed ulna, showed a lead concentration approximately twice as high as the other goose bones. In addition, the lead concentration in a duck bone was much higher than in those of wild birds or mammals, which suggests that the duck had lived in an urban environment for a long time. The results suggest that analysis of lead concentrations can detect potential domestic animals that were exposed to environmental lead pollution, such as in the Roman period in Europe and in the Edo period in Japan. By accumulating comparative studies, the analysis of lead concentrations in archaeological goose bones is expected to become a reliable indicator of domestic geese under conditions of environmental lead contamination.

AB  - There is no quantitative data on the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in the aquatic environment in Southeast Asian countries, particularly no information on their suitability as indicators of raw wastewater contamination on surface water and groundwater. This study provided the first quantitative information on the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in raw wastewater, surface water and groundwater in the urban catchment area in Singapore. Acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose were ubiquitous in raw wastewater samples at concentrations in the range of ng/L-mu g/L, while other sweeteners were not found or found only in a few of the raw wastewater samples. Residential and commercial effluents were demonstrated to be the two main sources of artificial sweeteners entering the municipal sewer systems. Relatively higher concentrations of the detected sweeteners were frequently found in surface waters at the sampling sites located in the residential/commercial areas. No significant difference in the concentrations of the detected sweeteners in surface water or groundwater was noted between wet and dry weather conditions (unpaired T-test, p>0.05). Relatively higher concentrations and detection frequencies of acesulfame, cyclamate and saccharin in surface water samples were observed at the potentially impacted sampling sites, while these sweeteners were absent in most of the background surface water samples. Similarly, acesulfame, cyclamate, and saccharin were found in most groundwater samples at the monitoring well (GW6), which is located close to known leaking sewer segment; whereas these were absent in the background monitoring well, which is located in the catchment with no known wastewater sources. Taken together, the results suggest that acesulfame, cyclamate, and saccharin can be used as potential indicators of raw wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater.

AB  - Severe soil and water loss has led to widespread land degradation of the Loess Plateau, China. During the past two decades, significant efforts have been made to revegetate degraded soil in the region. However, a better understanding of the ability of plants to promote soil microbial processes is important for successful revegetation. The current study was conducted at the Dunshan watershed on the Loess Plateau, with the aim of evaluating the effect of different vegetation types on the microbial properties of rhizosphere soil. Six vegetation types were evaluated: two natural grassland (Artemisia capillaries and Heteropappus altaicus), two artificial (i.e. planted by humans) grassland (Astragalus adsurgens and Panicum virgatum) and two artificial shrubland (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides) species; an area without vegetation cover was used as a control. The results indicated that the highest values of soil organic C, total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), MBN, saccharase, urease, catalase and peroxidase were recorded for H. altaicus and A. capillaries; of basal respiration (BR), the MBN: TN ratio, alkaline phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase for A. adsurgens; and of the BR: MBC ratio for P. virgatum. A rhizosphere soil microbial index (RSMI) was obtained using principal component analysis, and metabolic quotient (BR/MBC), BR, urease, water-soluble C and cellulase were found to be most important for assessing rhizosphere soil quality. All revegetated soil showed higher RSMI compared with control soil, with soil under natural grassland species (H. altaicus and A. capillaries) recording the highest value. It was concluded that plant species under arid climatic conditions have different effects on the microbial properties of rhizosphere soil owing to their different root exudates and plant debris. In addition, natural grasslands are most effective for revegetation of the Loess Plateau. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is an aggressive exotic species that has been successfully suppressed in a variety of situations using classical biological control (flea beetles; Aphthona spp.). This 9-yr study investigated patterns of vegetation responses following significant reductions in leafy spurge cover and density by flea beetles in southeastern Montana. We hypothesized that the vegetation following leafy spurge suppression would be dominated by species and plant functional groups able to persist through heavy infestations. Flea beetles were first released in 1998, and by 2006 leafy spurge foliar cover was reduced 80% to 90% compared to 1998 values on both release and nonrelease plots. Although total cover of the resident vegetation, excluding leafy spurge, increased 72% to 88%, relative cover of the functional groups (native forbs, native sedges, native grasses, and non-native species) was similar among years and between release and nonrelease plots. Mean diversity and mean species richness values did not differ among years or between release and nonrelease plots (P < 0.05), but mean diversity on both release and nonrelease plots was significantly less than noninfested plots, although richness was similar (P < 0.05). Indicator species analysis revealed that non-native Poa spp. replaced leafy spurge as the dominant species on release and nonrelease plots. Conversely, noninfested plots contained a variety of native species with high indicator values. Although total abundance of the resident vegetation in 2006 was significantly greater than 1998, plant species composition and relative cover showed little change for the duration of the study. Failure of the native vegetation to recover to a community that approached nearby noninfested conditions may be attributed to a variety of interacting scenarios, some of which may be ameliorated by treating infestations as soon as possible to avoid long-term residual effects.

AB  - The Holocene evolution of estuaries along the coast of New South Wales, southeastern Australia, has been the subject of conceptual models based primarily on amino acid racemisation- and radiocarbon-dated lithostratigraphic studies. This study examines the effectiveness of foraminiferal biostratigraphic indicators in support of the model of barrier estuary evolution. Four modern assemblage zones in the Minnamurra River estuary are clearly distinguished through cluster analysis characterising salt marsh, mangrove, pneumatophore (mangrove roots), and unvegetated tidal flat environments. This forms the basis for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of depositional environments in an 8.55 m deep radiocarbon-dated sediment core, taken 4 km upstream of the present estuary mouth. Foraminifera are relatively abundant and well preserved in the initial marine transgressive sand sheet that represents a tidal flat at the site by around 7 ka. Sub-tidal conditions then develop, implying a ria-like environment with restricted tidal access to the estuary basin before c. 5 ka. Between c. 4.6 and 0.96 m depth a shelly sand with a diverse marine foraminiferal assemblage that includes extra-estuarine taxa, indicates significant sediment infilling from marine-sourced deposition. AMS radiocarbon dating indicates rapid deposition during the interval 3.9-2.1 m (between 5274-4709 and 4535-3893 cal. yrs BP, respectively), which coincides with deposition of a sand sheet with similar characteristics in the adjacent Dunmore coastal basin. The foraminiferal assemblages in both the Minnamurra and Dunmore deposits indicate basin-wide high-energy barrier overwashing, possibly due to tsunami. Sediments between 0.96-0 m are barren of foraminifera and are interpreted as floodplain deposits. Foraminiferal evidence indicates that mangrove and salt marsh environments are entirely lacking from the core sequence.

AB  - The aims of this study are to identify the trend of warm days and cold nights over the Iberian Peninsula and to connect the variations with large-scale variables. The reasons for performing this analysis are the effects that extremes events have on different ecosystems. Here, we present the results on spatial and temporal variability of warm days (TX90), or those exceeding the 90th percentile of maximum temperature, and cold nights (TN10), or those falling below the 10th percentile of minimum temperature. The extreme indices were derived from daily observations at stations and gridded data over land area for the period 1950 to 2006. Significant trends of more warm days and fewer cold nights were found. The trend to fewer cold nights is within the interval of global results given by the IPCC AR4 report; however, the trend to warm days is greater than the corresponding global trend. The influence of large-scale variables on these extreme indices was examined by means of the Empirical Orthogonal Function, correlation, composite maps and multiple regression analyses. Changes in TX90 are connected with the Scandinavian teleconnection index and a preferred mode of geopotential height at 500 hPa over the North Atlantic. Changes in TN10 are connected with the East Atlantic teleconnection index and the leading mode of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability over the North Atlantic area. Based on the links between the extreme indices and the large-scale variables we derived statistical models to describe the response of TX90 and TN10 to atmospheric circulation and SST variations. The models characterized the observed variations of TX90 and TN10 reasonably well. The results of this study encourage us to analyze, in further work, how temperature extremes might change over the Iberian Peninsula under warmer climate conditions.

AB  - Certain interest in the field of reproductivity is focused on the research work about the role of the active oxygen species and in particular - their impact on the fertility of the gametes in the last 10-15 years. There are mainly surveys oil oxidative stress that showed its negative impact on the gametes. It was proved that over generating of AOS in gametes leads to pathological changes and dysfunction of spermatozoa. On the other hand in certain concentrations AOS call be biologically effective and even important. For example AOS can regulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes. They also have the role of oxygen sensors; regulate cell adhesion and the production of antibodies in leucocytes etc. It was shown that hydrogen peroxide is essential for many chemical reactions in the organism. It is part from the normal metabolism in the human body. Together with Superoxide anion hydrogen peroxide takes part in the regulation of spermatozoa capacitating and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins.
   In spermatology exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) IS used mainly for generation of extreme in vitro conditions for examining different aspects of spermatozoon viability. Notwithstanding, in the research works on the spermatozoa the degradation function of the exogenous H2O2 is predominantly highlighted, there are also other Surveys which point out Its positive effect. It was proved that the relatively low concentrations of the exogenous H2O2 have a wholesome effect oil the spermatozoa capacitating whereas the high concentrations inhibit that process. Therefore correct dosage Of exogenous H2O2 call be the basis of its positive action. Our experiments showed that as a result of per oral treatment of male mice with H2O2, tinder certain specific circumstances, the level of testosterone in the blood serum increases considerably (in times).

AB  - The objective of this study was the determination of 25 phenolic compounds in different mead samples (honeywines) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with coulometric-array detection and in case of hydroxymethylfurfural with UV detection. Our method was optimized in respect to both the separation selectivity of individual phenolic compounds and the maximum sensitivity with the electrochemical detection. The method development included the optimization of mobile phase composition, the pH value, conditions of the gradient elution and the flow rate using a window-diagram approach. The developed method was used for the determination of limits of detection and limits of quantitation for individual compounds. The linearity of calibration curves, accuracy and precision (intra- and inter-day) at three concentration levels (low, middle and high concentration range) were verified. Mead samples were diluted with the mobile phase at 1: 1 to 1:50 ratio depending on the concentration and filtered through a PTFE filter without any other sample pre-treatment. Phenolic compounds concentration was determined in 50 real samples of meads and correlated with meads composition and hydroxymethylfurfural concentration. The most frequently occurred compounds were protocatechuic acid and vanillic acid (both of them were present in 98% samples), the least occurred compounds were (+)-catechin (10% samples) and sinapic acid (12% samples). Vanillin and ethylvanillin, which are used as artificial additives for the taste improvement, were found in 60% and 42% samples, respectively. Hydroxymethylfurfural concentration, as an indicator of honey quality, was in the range from 2.47 to 158 mg/L. Our method is applicable for the determination of 25 phenolic compounds in mead, honey and related natural samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Black Sea is the largest extant anoxic water body on Earth. Its oxic-anoxic boundary is located at a depth of 100 m and is populated by a single phylotype of marine green sulfur bacteria. This organism, Chlorobium sp. strain BS-1, is extraordinarily low light adapted and can therefore serve as an indicator of deep photic zone anoxia (A. K. Manske, J. Glaeser, M. M. M. Kuypers, and J. Overmann, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 71:80498060, 2005). In the present study, two sediment cores were retrieved from the bottom of the Black Sea at depths of 2,006 and 2,162 m and were analyzed for the presence of subfossil DNA sequences of BS-1 using ancient-DNA methodology. Using optimized cultivation media, viable cells of the BS-1 phylotype were detected only at the sediment surface and not in deeper layers. In contrast, green sulfur bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified from all the sediment layers investigated, including turbidites. After separation by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing, 14 different sequence types were distinguished. The sequence of BS-1 represented only a minor fraction of the amplification products and was found in 6 of 22 and 4 of 26 samples from the 2,006- and 2,162-m stations, respectively. Besides the sequences of BS-1, three additional phylotypes of the marine clade of green sulfur bacteria were detected. However, the majority of sequences clustered with groups from freshwater habitats. Our results suggest that a considerable fraction of green sulfur bacterial chemofossils did not originate in a low-light marine chemocline environment and therefore were likely to have an allochthonous origin. Thus, analysis of subfossil DNA sequences permits a more differentiated interpretation and reconstruction of past environmental conditions if specific chemofossils of stenoec species, like Chlorobium sp. strain BS-1, are employed.

AB  - Currently, there is no economical way to produce large quantities of F, hybrid soybean seed in the USA. One of the fundamental requirements for hybrid seed production is the availability of a stable male-sterile, female-fertile system. However, the more challenging barrier is the efficient transfer of pollen from the male parent to the female parent. This could potentially be achieved through pollinator insects. Our observations suggested that seed set on male-sterile, female-fertile plants is a good indicator of insect attraction. The objective of this study was to evaluate seed set among male-sterile, female-fertile lines segregating for male-sterile, female-fertile ms6 allele by using Megachile rotundata as pollinator vector. Thirty-four pairs of near-isogenic lilies, the ms6 wI wI donor parent, and its two isogenic lilies WIwl and wIwI segregating for male-sterile (ms6) allele were used. The WI locus controls flower color and hypocotyle pigmentation. Seed set was evaluated on field-grown plants in 2001-2003 near Ames, IA. Although the observed seed set was not commercially acceptable, our results indicated significant differences in seed set among lines. This suggests that preferential attraction of pollinators occurred, and selection among male-sterile, female-fertile lines could be used to obtain female parents suitable to produce larger amounts of hybrid soybean seed. In addition, the effect of flower color on seed set was statistically significant. White-flowered lines produced more seed set compared to purple-flowered lines (WIWI). Lastly, the important effect of year suggested that the effect of environmental conditions on seed set among lilies segregating for male sterility was of paramount importance to plant-pollinator interactions. This needs to be assessed in order to establish an efficient hybrid soybean program. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new macroinvertebrate biotic index for assessing the impact of acidity on streams and rivers in England and Wales is presented, the Acid Waters Indicator Community index (AWIC). Using a 1042 sample training dataset, the AWIC index was derived by firstly using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to identify independent physical variables that best accounted for the observed macroinvertebrate communities. Secondly, partial CCA was used to factor out the confounding influence of physical variables other than mean pH. Thirdly, the ranking of taxa along the first axis of the pCCA (strongly correlated with mean pH) was the basis for assignment of index scores. Ephemeridae and Physidae were among the most acid sensitive taxa (AWIC score of 6), while Chloroperlidae and Nemouridae were the most tolerant of low pH conditions (AWIC score of 1). Within the training dataset, AWIC was strongly correlated with mean pH (r(s) = 0.814, P < 0.001). Testing on an independent dataset of 2710 samples, AWIC was also more effective at discriminating between samples of differing mean pH and gave rise to fewer Type I errors (false positives) than an existing biotic index derived by a classification approach. Our analysis suggests that at family level, macroinvertebrate communities are not characterised by a specific obligate acid-waters assemblage so that while most acidic sites primarily support families that are acid tolerant, these families are also commonly found in circum-neutral waters. The AWIC index distinguishes acid sites by the absence of any of a large number of acid sensitive families, any of which can shift the overall AWIC index towards one indicative of higher pH. The AWIC index should compliment existing family and species level acidity indices and should be of use to regulatory authorities charged with assessing the biological consequences of acidity in streams and rivers.

AB  - A pilot study was performed to examine the feasibility of UV disinfection for agricultural reuse of reclaimed water. The effluent from the bio-filter of a 16-unit apartment was used as input to the flow-through type UV disinfection system, with average suspended solid (SS) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations of 3.4 and 5.9 mg/L, respectively, and a mean level of total coliforms in the range of 1.5 x 10(4) MPN/100 mL. UV disinfection was found to be effective, in that it reduced mean. concentration of indicator microorganisms (total coliform [TC], fecal coliform [FC], and E. coli) to less than 100 MPN/100mL within 60 s exposure using 17, 25, and 40W lamps. The microorganisms often exceeded 200MPN/100mL with 17 and 25W lamps, but were completely removed with 40W lamp in one cylindrical chamber. Disinfection with two chambers in series demonstrated complete removal for all the experiments. About 30mW.s/cm(2) was thought to be adequate for the disinfection of secondary effluent to keep the suggested bacterial standards of 100 MPN FC/100mL for agricultural reuse. Water quality effect on the UV efficiency was not apparent within the experimental conditions. Statistical analysis showed that the removal rates of TC, FC, and E. coli did not significantly vary with turbidity, dissolved organic matter (DOM), or SS concentrations (p=0.05). Photo-reactivation problems after UV disinfection might be a lesser concern in agricultural reuse than for other uses, due to exposure of water to solar radiation and resulting inactivation. Overall, UV disinfection of effluent from secondary level wastewater treatment plants in Korea was thought to be an effective and feasible alternative for agricultural reuse, and thus it is strongly recommended.

AB  - Risk assessment parameters are needed to assess the contribution of phosphorus (P) losses from soil to surface water, and the effectiveness of nutrient and land management strategies for the reduction of P loss. These parameters need to take into account the large temporal and spatial variation in P transfer from individual fields arising from (a) changing but predictable factors such as land use, soil P status, P application rates, forms and ways of fertilization and spreading, (b) predictable but inherent factors such as soil type, soil dispersivity, slope and hydrological routing, and (c) unpredictable weather factors such as rainfall amount and intensity. In most situations, water transport is the driving force of P loss from agricultural land to surface water. Therefore, the hydrological pathways determine to a large extent the relevance of these different factors. Over the last decade several soil P tests have been proposed as a first step to link field conditions to risk of P loss. The major reason is that these soil P tests are also meaningful in discussions with farmers. Recently, more complex P loss risk parameters have been derived based on different approaches. However, the scope and purposes of these P loss risk parameters vary remarkably. Finally, there is a need to evaluate the usefulness of new P tests that can be used as an indicator of P loss risk, e.g. in relation to monitoring purposes. The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive will increase this need.
   In this paper, the practicable applicability of P parameters for risk assessment is discussed in relation to purpose, scale (from field, farm to catchment), effectiveness, sensibility etc. Furthermore, a conceptual framework for P indicators is presented and evaluated, based on the outcome of the presentations and the discussions in Zurich.

AB  - The study was conducted in deciduous forests of two Swedish regions, Oland and Uppland. It had two objectives: to (1) test the species pool hypothesis by examining if differences in small-scale species richness are related to differences in large-scale species richness and the size of the regional species pool, and (2) to examine the relationship between species richness and productivity and its scale-dependence.
   The first data set comprised 36 sites of moderate to high productivity. In each site, we recorded the presence of vascular plant species in nested plots ranging from 0.001 to 1000 m(2) and measured several environmental variables. Soil pH and Ellenberg site indicator scores for nitrogen were used as estimators of productivity. The second data set included 24 transects (each with 20 1-m(2) plots) on Oland in sites with low to high productivity. Species number, soil pH and relative light intensity were determined in each plot. The forest sites on Oland were more species-rich than the Uppland sites on all spatial scales, although environmental conditions were similar. Small-scale and large-scale species richness were positively correlated. The results present evidence in favour of the species pool hypothesis. In the nested-plots data set, species number was negatively correlated with pH and nitrogen indicator scores, whereas a unimodal relationship between species number and pH was found for the transect data set. These results, as well as previously published data, support the hump-shaped relationship between species richness and productivity in Swedish deciduous forests. Two explanations for the higher species richness of the sites with moderate productivity are given: first, these sites have a higher environmental heterogeneity and second, they have a larger 'habitat-specific' species pool.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages of four different types of wetlands and to evaluate their use as environmental indicators. Total abundances, community composition, and species diversity were evaluated for zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages from 24 wetlands and related to water quality variables. During August 1995, six representative sites were sampled from four types of wetlands designated as constructed, impacted, non-impacted, or temporary. The plankton assemblages of all wetlands were dominated by cosmopolitan crustacean, rotifer, and phytoplankton taxa typical of lake plankton communities. Species diversity, richness, and evenness of zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages did not differ significantly among the wetland types. Total zooplankton abundance was significantly (p < 0.01) related to chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations over the range of trophic conditions. Mean zooplankton densities and phytoplankton biovolumes were similar among the wetlands, however, the relative abundances of major zooplankton groups differed among the wetland types. Cyanophytes, primarily Oscillatoria spp., were a major component of the phytoplankton across all four wetland types, and were significantly more abundant within the constructed and temporary sites. On average, rotifers accounted for 79% of total zooplankton abundance within the constructed wetlands and were much less dominant in the non-impacted and temporary wetlands. Cladoceran, copepodite, and adult copepod concentrations were low in the constructed and impacted wetlands and increased in the non-impacted and temporary wetlands in conjunction with increased chlorophytes and cryptophytes. Our preliminary survey suggests that abiotic factors which are known to directly affect phytoplankton may indirectly affect zooplankton composition in such a way as to use zooplankton assemblages as indicators of water quality. However, further study incorporating seasonal dynamics and the influence of predators on zooplankton assemblages is needed to fully assess the use of zooplankton community composition as an environmental indicator for wetland systems.

AB  - Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid containing conjugated unsaturation. The cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic acid isomer is produced in ruminant animals as a first intermediate in the biohydrogenation of dietary linoleic acid by a linoleic acid isomerase from the rumen bacteria Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. CLA has been shown to inhibit initiation of mouse skin carcinogenesis by 7,12-dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), mouse forestomach neoplasia induced by benzo[a]pyrene and rat mammary tumorgenesis induced by DMBA. Furthermore, CLA was shown to be cytotoxic to human malignant melanoma, colorectal and breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic acid was the only CLA isomer incorporated into phospholipids of mouse forestomach and rat mammary tumors and is considered to be the biologically active factor. The mechanism whereby CLA exerts its anticarcinogenic activity is still uncertain. However, it has been found to modulate the activity of cytochrome P450 and reduce the induction of ornithine decarboxylase and protein kinase C, known tumor production indicators, and possibly inhibit protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. Some of the anti-carcinogenic properties of CLA may be due to its effective antioxidant properties. Dairy products are the richest dietary sources of CLA, depending upon pasture conditions, milk fat may contain up to 30 mg/g fat and is predominantly the biologically active cis-9, trans-11-isomer. In general, fat from meat of ruminant animals contains more CLA than fat from non-ruminants who may obtain their CLA by dietary means and some bacterial isomerism of linoleic acid. Vegetable oils and margarines only contain small amounts of CLA. CLA is present in the tissue and body fluid of humans and blood serum levels can be increased by diets rich in CLA.

AB  - The quality of water bodies has been decreasing over time. Urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) are key players to avoid that potentially toxic micropollutants reach the environment, and advanced treatment processes are being applied to address this issue. However, several variables have to be taken into account, particularly environmental sustainability. The aim of this study is to assess the life cycle impacts of combining UVC with different oxidants - hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) -, considering different concentrations (0.05, 0.20 and 0.50 mM) and UVC dosages of 42, 63 and 170 J/L, corresponding to UV contact times of 4, 7 and 18 s in a specific industrial equipment. UVC/PMS was the worst performing process (despite being able to achieve removals similar to UVC/H2O2), followed by UVC/PS. Both would only be preferred relatively to H2O2 if much lower concentrations of PMS or PS could be used to achieve the same removal of micropollutants (10 times lower was not enough). Additionally, PMS and PS production contributes more to the environmental footprint than the electricity use, unlike H2O2. Therefore even if considering lower treatment times when using sulfate-based oxidants, these will still be more impactful than using H2O2 at the studied conditions. Based on both avoided and generated impacts, H2O2 is the best option environmentally. In this case, the environmental impacts are more affected by an increase in treatment time rather than by an increase in the H2O2 concentration. It is thus best to opt for a higher concentration and the lowest treatment time possible for a significant ecotoxicity reduction. Electricity is a relevant parameter in all cases and its impact can be reduced in nearly all endpoint categories by opting for cleaner energy sources.

AB  - Conceptualisation of geo-hydrological characteristic of erosive runoff are of particular importance and has been required in recent soil erosion control. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of applying hydrological attributes to characterize surface runoff pathways in the process of hillslope soil erosion due to rainfall. Combined with sub-millimeter high-resolution laser scanning and computer digital image processing method, three hydrological indicators (i.e., sinuosity, gradient and orientation) were used to investigate the changes of the surface runoff pathways on the slope of three typical southern red soils (i.e., shale (HS), and Quaternary red clay soils (HQ1 and HQ2) under simulated rainfall conditions). The results indicated no significant changes of sinuosity with a mean value of 1.19. After the rainfall with the intensity of 1 mm/min and 2 mm/min, the orientation and gradient changed dramatically. The greatest changes appeared at the first rainfall, which showed that the biggest increase of gradient was 26.78% and it tended to be close to the original slope of the test plot, while the orientation dropped by 5.60-31.44%. Compared with HS and HQ1, the runoff pathway characteristics of HQ2 changed more consistent. The rainfall intensities had a significant impact on the correlation between indicators. The determination coefficients sorting with surface roughness were orientation > graient > sinuosity. And they were significantly linearly related to runoff under 1 mm/min rainfall intensity, while had positive correlation with sediment under 2 mm/min rainfall intensity (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there were more remarkable relationships between orientation, gradient and slope erosion under 1 mm/min rainfall intensity. This provided an innovative idea, that is applying the orientation and gradient to the simulation and prediction model of the rainfall erosion process in the sloping farmland in the southern red soil area.

AB  - Arctic and boreal ecosystems are experiencing rapid changes in temperature and precipitation regimes. Subsequent shifts in seasonality can lead to a mismatch between the timing of resource availability and species' life-history events, known as phenological or trophic mismatch. Although mismatch has been shown to negatively affect some northern animal populations, longer-term impacts across large regions remain unknown. In addition, animals may rely on climate cues during preceding seasons to time key life history events such as reproduction, but the reliability of these cues as indicators of subsequent resource availability has not been examined. We used remote sensing and gridded spatial data to evaluate the effect of climate factors on the reproductive phenology and success of a wide-ranging carnivore, the gray wolf (Canis lupus). We used global positioning system (GPS) location data from 388 wolves to estimate den initiation dates (n = 227 dens within 106 packs) and reproductive success in eight populations across northwestern North America from 2000 to 2017. Spring onset shifted 14.2 d earlier, on average, during the 18-year period, but the regional mean date of denning did not change. Preceding winter temperature was the strongest climatic predictor of denning phenology, with higher temperatures advancing the timing of denning. Winter temperature was also one the strongest and most reliable indicators of the timing of spring onset. Reproductive success was not affected by timing of denning or synchrony with spring onset, but improved during cooler summers and following relatively dry autumns. Our findings highlight a disconnect between climate factors that affect phenology and those that affect demography, suggesting that carnivores may be resilient to shifts in seasonality and yet sensitive to weather conditions affecting their prey at both local and regional scales. These insights regarding the relationship between climate and carnivore demography should improve predictions of climate warming effects on the highest trophic levels.

AB  - This study assesses the potential of triisobutane as a sustainable biojet fuel blending component to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the continually growing aviation sector. Cellulosic isobutanol, used as feedstock, was sequentially upgraded through dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation processes to produce triisobutane (2,2,4,6,6-Pentamethylheptane). The dehydration process yield is 99.1% of isobutene, and the achieved conversion of isobutene to triisobutene in the oligomerization stage is 90%. The optimal operation conditions to produce the maximum amount of triisobutene during the isobutene oligomerization are 100 degrees C, 0.20 MPa, and a space-time tau' of 5.5 g h/L. Triisobutene is converted quantitatively to triisobutane through a final hydrogenation stage. The production model was simulated using Aspen Plus (R) v.10 software. The production costs were calculated based on a biorefinery that uses 16,264 kg/h of isobutanol to obtain 10,723 kg/h of triisobutane. The predicted minimum triisobutane selling price is 1.34 (sic)/kg or 1.04 (sic)/L. The environmental assessment carried out in Simapro (R) v.9.0 software, estimated emissions of the isobutanol upgrade to triisobutane of 7 gCO(2eq)/MJ. A combined footprint of 65 gCO(2eq)/MJ is obtained considering the 58 gCO(2eq)/MJ emitted in isobutanol production, which represents a 28% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared with the conventional Jet A1 production. Physico-chemical properties of triisobutane were estimated using group contribution methods, and the results comply with the ASTM D7566 standards. The Payload vs. Range analysis confirmed the capabilities of triisobutane as a biojet fuel blend component for a given range flight.

AB  - In dry steppes, strong climatic constraints, especially highly variable precipitation, and grazing are the most important factors controlling plant life. Growth is strongly limited by water availability, while grazing may affect species presence and performance. However, there is a lack of studies on population genetics of dryland plants in general, and of those addressing grazing effects in particular. To determine the landscape-scale genetic structure of dryland species, and if grazing has an impact on that, we chose the Eurasian steppe grass Stipa glareosa for a population genetic study employing nine polymorphic Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. We assessed genetic fingerprints of 200 individuals from six populations in Mongolia, which were sampled along a large-scale precipitation and altitudinal gradient. Nested within this gradient, sub-populations were sampled along short local transects representing different grazing intensities.
   Overall, S. glareosa populations showed rather low levels of genetic diversity at a mean Bruvo distance among individuals within a given population of 0.494 (mean expected heterozygosity He = 0.053). Linear mixed model analysis implied that genetic diversity was affected by both climatic constraints and local grazing conditions. We found a moderate isolation-by-distance pattern across all populations; grazing additionally influenced the genetic structure at local scale. Analysis of Molecular Variance revealed a modest genetic differentiation between populations (9 % of variation) and among sub-populations representing different grazing levels (11 %). Moreover, we detected indicator alleles that were exclusive for populations along the precipitation gradient; other alleles were associated with certain grazing levels across all populations. Thus, our data suggest that climatic constraints affect the genetic structure of S. glareosa populations, while at local scales differences in grazing disturbance may also matter.

AB  - Drinking water distribution systems host complex microbial communities as biofilms that interact continuously with delivered water. Understanding the diversity, behavioural and functional characteristics will be a requisite for developing future monitoring strategies and protection against water-borne health risks. To improve understanding, this study investigates mobilisation and accumulation behaviour, microbial community structure and functional variations of biofilms developing on different pipe materials from within an operational network. Samples were collected from four pipes during a repeated flushing operation three months after an initial visit that used hydraulic forces to mobilise regenerating biofilms yet without impacting the upstream network. To minimise confounding factors, test sections were chosen with comparable daily hydraulic regimes, physical dimensions, and all connected straight of a common trunk main and within close proximity, hence similar water chemistry, pressure and age. Taxonomical results showed differences in colonising communities between pipe materials, with several genera, including the bacteria Pseudomonas and the fungi Cladosporium, present in every sample. Diverse bacterial communities dominated compared to more homogeneous fungal, or mycobiome, community distribution. The analysis of bacterial/fungal networks based on relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) indicated microbial communities from cast iron pipes were more stable than communities from the non-ferrous pipe materials. Novel analysis of functional traits between all samples were found to be mainly associated to mobile genetic elements that play roles in determining links between cells, including phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids. The use of functional traits can be considered for development in future surveillance methods, capable of delivering network condition information beyond that of limited conventional faecal indicator tests, that will help protect water quality and public health.

AB  - An accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) in intercropping is critical for a theoretical basis for formulating an intercropping irrigation system of fruit trees and improving the soil moisture condition of orchards in arid regions of Southern Xinjiang. Herein, observational data such as soil moisture and plant physiological indicators were measured in jujube/cotton intercropping in the Aksu region from 2015 to 2017. The evapotranspiration of single-crop jujube and cotton was estimated using the modified dual crop coefficient method. Then, based on the proportion of intercropping crops, the soil water stress coefficient was introduced to estimate the evapotranspiration of the jujube/cotton intercropping. The results show that the model has good applicability to simulate single-crop jujube and cotton, and jujube/cotton intercropping. However, compared with single cropping, the accuracy of simulated daily evapotranspiration was decreased. In addition, adjusting the cotton irrigation amount caused the simulation accuracy to further decrease. From the perspective of interspecies complementarity and competition, cotton dominated the intercropping system and had better tolerance to external environmental changes than jujube trees. Intercropping had negative effects on jujube trees in general, and very obvious positive effects on cotton. Based on the 3-year crop yield, 5-year-old jujube trees are recommended for intercropping. During this time, the yield of cotton under the effect of interspecific complementation increased by 26.47%, and the yield of intercropping jujube was similar to that of single crop. As the jujube tree age increases, the effect of increasing cotton production gradually diminishes. The jujube trees also had a significant reduction in yield due to interspecific competition. Our research supports the dual crop coefficient method as appropriate to estimate crop ETc in intercropping and may be further used to improve irrigation scheduling for jujube/cotton intercropping.

AB  - The growth of significance for innovative economic development of the Russian Federation determines necessity of deeper investigation of properties and specific features of its subsystems functioning, content and forms of their interaction, search for increasing efficiency of control systems. The transportation system is the most important strategic link of social and economic development of the country, one of the most dynamic, multiplicative and promising segments of the market, which makes 12.5 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Russian Federation. An analysis of transport activity has demonstrated a smoldering recession over the last years which is accompanied by reduction of values for the most important resulting indicators. Strategic benchmarks of developing transportation activity are objectified by the consumers' demands not only in safe, but in comfortable life medium with high environmental characteristics and aesthetic requirements. The satisfaction of such requirements is possible under condition of large-scale modernization of transportation sphere with the use of breakthrough scientific and technical solutions in all segments of human activity. All this can afford ground that it is necessary to change fundamentally an approach to investigating properties, peculiarities and factors of the transportation system development that provokes modernization of the control system for providing a balanced innovative trend and high standards of population life quality. The results of the investigations have shown that important factors of transportation system development are the following: fair competition, freedom of economic activity, development of market mechanisms, corporate culture and moral values. Study of functioning and scientific approaches to balancing innovative development of the transportation system of the Russian Federation has made it possible to create a conceptual vision and methodological basis with due account of main principles of systems theory, self-organization and synergetics and present it in brief in the given paper.

AB  - Catenated nitrogen chains (CNCs) attract considerable attention because of their structural novelty, their high energy, and their potential as precursors for all-nitrogen materials. However, pure CNCs are unstable under ambient conditions, limiting their on-site or practical applications. Chemical riveting of a CNC involves the maintenance of the structure of a CNC and placing the CNC in a special chemical structure as a moiety of an entire molecule to stabilize it. Other structures, except from the CNC, are named rivets. In this study, the molecular geometry, bond order, natural bond orbital charge, and frontier orbital among the pure CNCs (N-x), N-x(-), N-x(+), and NxHy (x = 2-11) and CNCs riveted and implemented experimentally in several former studies are systematically analyzed and compared. The lone-pair repulsion between two neighboring N atoms is one of the primary factors for the low molecular stability of the pure CNCs and their derivatives. The riveted CNCs with rings are usually more stable than those with open chains. Moreover, the standard deviation of the bond orders or the bond lengths can be employed as an indicator for molecular stability, i.e., a lower standard deviation suggests higher molecular stability. Hence, electron-donating groups, groups with electronegativity within those of H and N atoms, as well as atoms or groups with empty orbitals are proposed to trap the lone pairs of CNCs as rivets to stabilize the CNCs. This strategy is expected to facilitate the creation of stable CNC-contained compounds with high structural novelty or high energy contents.
   Graphical abstract A strategy is proposed for chemically riveting instable CNCs to transform them into more stable ones.

AB  - We evaluated changes in the concentration of cations, anions, nutrients (dissolved organic carbon, DOC; phosphorus, P; and nitrogen forms including nitrate, NO3- and total organic nitrogen, TON), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in 31 Tatra Mountain lakes in Slovakia and Poland during their recovery from acidic deposition (1992-2018). Typical effects of decreasing acidic deposition on the lakes' water composition, such as decreasing base cation concentrations, were confounded by climate change and catchment characteristics, including areal proportions of well-developed soils and scree. A climate-related increase in physical erosion provided freshly exposed unweathered granodiorite (the dominant bedrock) to chemical weathering. Dissolution of accessory calcite in the granodiorite increased the in-lake Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations and reversed the Ca2+ trends, which originally decreased in parallel with strong acid anions. These changes were most pronounced in steep, scree-rich areas, which are most sensitive to physical weathering. Fresh apatite [Ca-5(PO4)(3)(F, Cl, OH)] in the crushed granodiorite acts as a P source at soil pH's between 4 and 5 and in the presence of chelating organic acids within soils. These conditions enhance apatite solubility, which in part explains increasing P in lakes with scree-dominated catchments. Soil recovery from acidification due to decreasing acidic deposition and the neutralizing effect of weathering of erosion-derived accessory calcite were the most likely causes of elevated DOC and P export from soils. Their elevated leaching was accompanied by increasing in-lake concentrations of Chl-a and TON. The increasing TON concentrations were, as for Ca2+, most pronounced in the scree-rich catchments, and represented the most sensitive indicator of the changes in the lake water nutrient composition.

TI  - How Gulf-Stream SST-fronts influence Atlantic winter storms: Results from a downscaling experiment with HARMONIE to the role of modified latent heat fluxes and low-level baroclinicity
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS

KW  - Atlantic winter storms
KW  - Gulf Stream
KW  - SST-fronts
AB  - The strong horizontal gradients in sea surface temperature (SST) of the Atlantic Gulf Stream exert a detectable influence on extratropical cyclones propagating across the region. This is shown in a sensitivity experiment where 24 winter storms taken from ERA-Interim are simulated with HARMONIE at 10-km resolution. Each storm is simulated twice. First, using observed SST (REF). In the second simulation a smoothed SST is offered (SMTH), while lateral and upper-level boundary conditions are unmodified. Each storm pair propagates approximately along the same track, however their intensities (as measured by maximal near-surface wind speed or 850-hPa relative vorticity) differ up to +/- 25%. A 30-member ensemble created for one of the storms shows that on a single-storm level the response is systematic rather than random. To explain the broad response in storm strength, we show that the SST-adjustment modifies two environmental parameters: surface latent heat flux (LHF) and low-level baroclinicity (B). LHF influences storms by modifying diabatic heating and boundary-layer processes such as vertical mixing. The position of each storm's track relative to the SST-front is important. South of the SST-front the smoothing leads to lower SST, reduced LHF and storms with generally weaker maximum near-surface winds. North of the SST-front the increased LHF tend to enhance the winds, but the accompanying changes in baroclinicity are not necessarily favourable. Together these mechanisms explain up to 80% of the variability in the near-surface maximal wind speed change. Because the mechanisms are less effective in explaining more dynamics-oriented indicators like 850 hPa relative vorticity, we hypothesise that part of the wind-speed change is related to adjustment of the boundary-layer processes in response to the LHF and B changes.

AB  - We use the particle size of sediments in core YS01A to study the sedimentary environment of the mud deposit in the central South Yellow Sea of China during late Marine Isotope Stages 3 (MIS3; 40.5 kyr-31.3 kyr). In addition, the East Asian Monsoon and its relationship with the North Atlantic Ocean climate change are discussed based on the sensitive grain-size calculation and the spectrum analysis. The results show that during late MIS3, the muddy area in the central South Yellow Sea experienced the evolution of coastal facies, shallow marine facies, coastal facies, and continental facies, with weak hydrodynamic conditions. Compared with other climate indicators, we found that there were many century to millennium-scale climate signals documented in the muddy area sediments in the central South Yellow Sea. According to our particle size results, three strong winter monsoon events occurred at 37.6 kyr, 35.6 kyr and 32.2 kyr. The East Asian Winter Monsoon records in core YS01A are consistent with the Greenland ice core and the Hulu cave stalagmite delta O-18. The millennial and centennial scale cycles, which are 55 yr, 72 yr, 115 yr, 262yr respectively, correspond to solar activity cycles, while the 1049 yr and 2941 yr cycles correspond to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. These cycles indicate that the paleoclimate evolution of the area was controlled by the solar activities, with the high-latitude driving thermohaline circulation as the main energy conveyor belt, followed by the sea-air-land amplification of the winter monsoon variation in the central Yellow Sea in the late MIS3.

AB  - The constant release of pharmaceuticals products to aquatic environment even at low concentrations (ng L-1 to mu g L-1) could lead to unknown chronic effects to non-target organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate neurotoxic responses, inflammation, gametogenic activity and energy status on the fresh water clam C. fluminea after exposure to different concentrations of caffeine (CAF), ibuprofen (IBU), carbamazepine (CBZ), novobiocin (NOV) and tamoxifen (TMX) for 21 days under laboratory conditions. During the assay, water was spiked every two days with CAF (0; 0.1; 5; 15; 50 mu g L-1), IBU (0; 0.1; 5; 10; 50 mu g L-1), CBZ, NOV, and TMX (0.1, 1, 10, 50 mu g L-1). After the exposure period, dopamine levels (DOP), monoamine oxidase activity (MAO), arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase activity (COX), vitellogenin-like proteins (VTG), mitochondrial electron transport (MET), total lipids (TLP), and energy expenditure (MET/TLP) were determined in gonad tissues, and acetyl cholinesterase activity (AChE) was determined in digestive gland tissues. Results showed a concentration-dependence response on biomarkers tested, except for MAO. Environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals induced significant changes (p < 0.05) in the neurotoxic responses analyzed (CAF, CBZ and NOV increased DOP levels and CBZ inhibited AChE activity), inflammation (CAF induced COX), and energy status (MET and TLP increased after exposure to CBZ, NOV and TMX). Responses of clams were related to the mechanism of action (MoA) of pharmaceuticals. Biomarkers applied and the model organism C. fluminea constituted a suitable tool for environmental risk assessment of pharmaceutical in aquatic environment.

AB  - Regulation of emotions is necessary for successful attainment of short-term and long-term goals. However, overregulation may also have its costs. In anorexia nervosa (AN), forgoing food intake despite emaciation and endocrine signals that promote eating is an example of "too much" self-control. Here we investigated whether voluntary emotion regulation in AN patients comes with associated disorder-relevant costs. Thirty-five patients with acute AN and thirty-five age-matched healthy controls (HCs) performed an established emotion regulation paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging after an overnight fast. The task required reducing emotions induced by positively valenced pictures via distancing. We calculated a neural regulation score from responses recorded in a reward-related brain region of interest (ventral striatum; VS) by subtracting activation measured on "positive distance" trials from that elicited under the "positive watch" (baseline) condition. Complementing the imaging data, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to probe disorder-related rumination and affect six times/day for 2 weeks following the scanning session. The neural regulation score indicating reduced VS activation during emotion regulation was used as a predictor in hierarchical linear models with EMA measures as outcomes. No group differences in neural activity were found for the main contrasts of the task. However, regulation of VS activity was associated with increased body-related rumination and increased negative affect in AN, but not in HC. In line with this finding, correlational analysis with longitudinal BMI measurements revealed a link between greater VS regulation and poorer treatment outcome after 60 and 90 days. Together, these results identify a neural correlate of altered emotion regulation in AN, which seems to be detrimental to psychological well-being and may interfere with recovery.

AB  - In 2013 and 2015, two 8-m-thick loess sequences with palaeosols were excavated in the lower Saone River valley in two sites 20 km away. At Quincieux, the sequence developed on a low terrace of the Saone River shows a lower palaeosol complex with frost wedges, laminated silts including sparsed blocks from the Alps, a median palaeosol or brownish horizon, gray clayey loams with sandy beds, massive loess and a Holocene topsoil complex. At Lyon-Apollinaire, the sequence leaned on the southern relief surrounding the Vaise Plain shows a unique 6-m-thick palaeosol complex eroded at the top and overlaid by massive to laminated fine gray loamy sands cut off by modern constructions. Conversely to the little evidence of human presence in Quincieux, faunal remains have been found in all palaeosols. However, only the oldest palaeosol of Quincieux was partially excavated in 2014. Multi-indicator samplings have been performed to reconstruct the chronological, pedological and environmental contexts of human occupations. C-14 ages obtained at the base of gray loams in both sites yield similar ages of 18 ka. OSL and C-14 ages obtained in the median brownish horizon of Quincieux are coherent around 20 ka. Conversely, those of the lower palaeosol are more variable between 27 and 40 ka and remain to be discussed. Ages obtained at Lyon-Apollinaire are coherent and reveal that the base and the top of the palaeosol complex correlate with the lower palaeosol and median brownish horizon of Quincieux respectively. Local conditions -slope context away from the alluvial plain -could explain such a difference. The comparison of these two sequences, unique for the lower Saone River valley, with those of northern France is not straightforward.

AB  - In the last decade biomass combustion has become one of the most important elements in the fight against global warming. For the sake of climate or environment protection people cut out large stretches of forests and burn them down It is widely believed that the combustion of wood and biomass is completely safe and does not cause any danger to people and the environment. Unfortunately, this is only a half truth. In fact, with considerably lower emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from biomass combustion, significant amounts of organic micro-pollutants are emitted, among which there are more toxic compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (POD/Fs). The aim of this paper was to assess the real situation. Seven samples of biomass were investigated, i.e. rape straw, oak bark, firewood and wood pellets, shrub willow and rape cake. Pulverized hard coal samples were used for comparison. The aim of the study was to determine and compare the pollution emission factors (per unit mass of fuel) of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO) and the sum of hydrocarbons (as total organic carbon TOC) generated in the process of biomass combustion. Further, we compared the results obtained for coal as well as the effect of process operating conditions (temperature; air flow) on the emission factors. The investigations were carried out in a laboratory chamber furnace at five different temperatures (from 700 to 1100 degrees C) and at three different air flow rates providing an excess of oxygen. In many cases the determined emission indicators for biomass combustion were higher than for hard coal. (C) 2016 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An extensive, yet little explored South American area of paleoclimatic interest, is the arid-semiarid ecotone (Arid Diagonal) that separates arid Patagonia from subtropical/tropical northern South America, and lies at the intersection of the Pacific and Atlantic atmospheric circulation systems. This study focused on the Laguna Llancanelo basin, Argentina, a Ramsar site located within the Arid Diagonal, and was designed to build a modern dataset using ostracods (diversity, spatial distribution, seasonality, habitat preferences) and water chemistry. Cluster and multivariate analysis of the data indicated that salinity is the most significant variable segregating two ostracod groups. Limnocythere aff. staplini is the only species that develops abundant populations in the saline ephemeral Laguna Llancanelo during almost all seasons, and is accompanied by scarce Cypridopsis vidua in summer. The latter species is abundant in freshwater lotic sites, where Ilyocypris ramirezi, Herpetocypris helenae, and Cyprididae indet. are also found in large numbers. Darwinula stevensoni, Penthesilenula incae, Heterocypris incongruens, Chlamydotheca arcuata, Chlamydotheca sp., Herpetocypris helenae, and Potamocypris smaragdina prefer freshwater lentic conditions (springs), with C. arcuata and Chlamydotheca sp. found only in the Carapacho warm spring, which has a year-round constant temperature of similar to 20 A degrees C. Seasonal sampling was necessary because some taxa display a highly seasonal distribution. Species that were recorded have either subtropical or Patagonian affinities, although a few taxa are endemic or common to both regions. These data can serve as modern analogues for reconstructing the late Quaternary history of the area, and to investigate the extent and position of the arid/semiarid ecotone (Arid Diagonal) during past glacial/interglacial cycles.

AB  - To achieve active management of bathing areas and to reduce risk associated with the presence of fecal pollution, tests capable of rapid on-site assessment of microbiological water quality are required. A protocol for the recovery and detection of fecal pollution indicator bacteria, E. coli, using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was developed. The developed protocol involves two main steps: sample preparation and GUS activity measurement. In the sample preparation step, syringe filters were used with a dual purpose, for the recovery and pre-concentration of E. coli from the water matrix and as mu L reactors for bacteria lysis and GUS extraction. Subsequently, GUS activity was measured using a continuous fluorometric method developed previously. The optimum GUS recovery conditions for the sample preparation step were found to be 100 mL PELB (supplemented with 1 mg mL(-1) lysozyme and 20 mM DTT) at 37 degrees C for 30 min. The protocol was evaluated on environmental samples (fresh and seawater) against an establish GUS assay method (Coliplage((R))). GUS activities corresponding to samples containing as low as 26 MPN E. coli 100 mL(-1) were detected for the seawater sample and as low as 110 MPN E. coli 100 mL(-1) for the freshwater samples. By comparison with the Coliplage r method, this protocol offered an improvement in the measured GUS activities of 3.1 fold for freshwater samples and 4.1 fold for seawater samples. Furthermore, the protocol developed here, has a time-to-result of 75 min, and successfully addresses the requirement for tests capable of rapid assessment of microbiological water quality.

AB  - Mapping marine coastal habitats provides an important aid to the long-term sustainability of urban development and the conservation of marine biodiversity. Historical maps, when available, may represent effective tools to evaluate quali-quantitative changes over time and to fix reference conditions. Scientific mapping of marine habitats is relatively recent, but the existence of fishery maps could compensate, after a critical evaluation, for the lack of more rigorous historical data. Coralligenous reefs are among the most important marine coastal habitats in the Mediterranean Sea, whose conservation requires, as a first step suggested by the recent European Directives, updated and detailed cartographies. This paper compares the recent cartographies (i.e. 2006 and 2009) on coralligenous reefs distribution in Liguria (NW Mediterranean Sea) with two historical fishery maps (i.e. dating back to the second half of the last century), on a GIS platform. Application of the Reliability Index (RI) showed that both historical sources can be trusted, with some caution. Fishery maps report few quantitative data (e.g. extent in hectares of coralligenous reefs) that are in little agreement with recent cartographies, mainly due to errors in positioning. In contrast, qualitative data (i.e. presence/absence in a specific site) represent the main information found in these maps and agree much more with the recent ones. It is more than likely that many of the rocky bottoms reported only in the fishery maps may host coralligenous reefs, which are apparently unknown in the recent cartographies. Latent information provided by this kind of historical maps may thus be useful for planning new surveys to sea-truthing on sites where no recent information is available and to promote the ecological studies required for their conservation.

AB  - 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) has been developed as a selective probe for the detection and quantitative determination of hydrogen peroxide in samples containing different reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS). DPBF is a fluorescent probe which, for almost 20 years, was believed to react in a highly specific manner toward some reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen and hydroxy, alkyloxy or alkylperoxy radicals. Under the action of these individuals DPBF has been rapidly transformed to 1,2-dibenzoylbenzene (DBB). In order to check if DPBF can act as a unique indicator of the total amount of different RNOS, as well as oxidative stress caused by an overproduction of these individuals, a series of experiments was carried out, in which DPBF reacted with peroxynitrite anion, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite anion, and anions commonly present under biological conditions, namely nitrite and nitrate. In all cases, except for hydrogen peroxide, the product of the reaction is DBB. Only under the action of H2O2 9-hydroxyanthracen-10(9H)-one (oxanthrone) is formed. This product has been identified with the use of fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). A linear relationship was found between a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of DPBF and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the range of concentrations of 0.196-3.941mM. DPBF responds to hydrogen peroxide in a very specific way with the limits of detection and quantitation of 88 and 122.8 mu M, respectively. The kinetics of the reaction between DBBF and H2O2 was also studied.

AB  - The paper aims at exploring the performances of a compact Desiccant Evaporative Cooling system called "Freescoo" (Free Solar Cooling) in comparison to standard conventional technologies. The Freescoo - that aims at applications in the residential sector and in small office buildings and includes a photovoltaic thermal system - is analyzed, its monitored performance discussed and reported: under cooling conditions an Energy Efficiency Ratio of 12.8 is calculated, that reaches 50.7 if also photovoltaic generation is considered. To assess the performance of the proposed system a Life Cycle Assessment study was performed to investigate the system covering all its life, from the production, going through its use and its disposal. Results are compared to those obtainable by standard conventional systems with comparable heating and cooling power outputs to further explore the performances of the system.
   The electricity consumption of the investigated solar cooling system proves to be equal to only the 5% of the equivalent conventional system having the same thermal output during a year. The production phase of the Freescoo shows a predominant role among the other life cycle steps, reaching a 95% share on the total for some indicators, such as human toxicity.
   If the life cycle phase of a conventional system is compared with the whole life cycle of the Freescoo system, the former would report many indicators values higher by 200% in comparison to the latter.
   If use of water is considered, although the Freescoo system would require 25901 of fresh water during a year in comparison to none consumed by a conventional system, the higher water footprint of conventional systems would result in water uses higher by three times if compared to the Freescoo.

AB  - With the integrated development of the Internet, wireless sensor technology, cloud computing, and mobile Internet, there has been a lot of attention given to research about and applications of the Internet of Things. A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the important information technologies in the Internet of Things; it integrates multi-technology to detect and gather information in a network environment by mutual cooperation, using a variety of methods to process and analyze data, implement awareness, and perform tests. This paper mainly researches the localization algorithm of sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network. Firstly, a multi-granularity region partition is proposed to divide the location region. In the range-based method, the RSSI (Received Signal Strength indicator, RSSI) is used to estimate distance. The optimal RSSI value is computed by the Gaussian fitting method. Furthermore, a Voronoi diagram is characterized by the use of dividing region. Rach anchor node is regarded as the center of each region; the whole position region is divided into several regions and the sub-region of neighboring nodes is combined into triangles while the unknown node is locked in the ultimate area. Secondly, the multi-granularity regional division and Lagrange multiplier method are used to calculate the final coordinates. Because nodes are influenced by many factors in the practical application, two kinds of positioning methods are designed. When the unknown node is inside positioning unit, we use the method of vector similarity. Moreover, we use the centroid algorithm to calculate the ultimate coordinates of unknown node. When the unknown node is outside positioning unit, we establish a Lagrange equation containing the constraint condition to calculate the first coordinates. Furthermore, we use the Taylor expansion formula to correct the coordinates of the unknown node. In addition, this localization method has been validated by establishing the real environment.

AB  - A streamlined energy and emissions assessment model (SEEAM) is presented that is based on life cycle analysis (LCA) methods. The SEEAM provides geotechnical engineers with the means to quantify the embodied energy (EE) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with ground improvement projects. A companion paper (Shillaber et al. 2015) provides detailed background for sustainable development and environmental impact assessment, which are at the foundation of the SEEAM. This paper presents the boundary conditions and methodology for this model. Construction of levee LPV 111 in New Orleans, LA is used as a case history example to illustrate the use of the model. This project involved supporting an earthen embankment by deep soil mixing (DSM) elements. Results of a SEEAM analysis of the DSM supported embankment indicate that constructing the levee involved 1,174,000 GJ of EE and 147,000 t of CO2 emissions. For comparison, the SEEAM was also used to estimate the EE and CO2 emissions associated with two other LPV 111 design alternatives; one utilizing prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) to increase the rate of primary consolidation in the foundation soils, and the other a pile-supported reinforced-concrete T-wall. The results show that the PVD design has the lowest EE and CO2 emissions at 809,000 GJ and 64,000 t, respectively. The concrete T-wall has the greatest EE and CO2 emissions, at 2,755,000 GJ and 211,000 t, respectively (for the materials alone). Despite having the lowest EE, CO2 emissions and cost, the PVD design was not a viable solution because it could not meet a 20-month time constraint placed on the construction to achieve the needed flood protection. When performance criteria are met, quantitative information about environmental impacts, such as EE and CO2 emissions, is useful for making geotechnical decisions for sustainable development.

AB  - Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerberg) Morelet is a pathogenic fungus that causes severe damage in coniferous forests, causing the death of the trees, in Central and Northern Europe, North America and Japan. Biological control (i.e. the use of biologically antagonistic organisms) is being considered as an alternative and an eco-friendly method to deal with plant diseases. Among such organisms several fungal endophytes have been successfully used to reduce or inhibit the growth of pathogens. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of several fungal endophytes to reduce the G. abietina spreading on pine seedlings, with the goal of exploring the mechanisms involved in that reduction. The experiment was carried out on two-year old Pinus halepensis seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Five fungal endophytes (Trichoderma spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Aureobasidium spp., endophyte 20.1 and Leotiomycete spp.) obtained from healthy P. halepensis trees were used to evaluate their effect on six G. abietina isolates. The pathogen and the endophyte were both inoculated in every seedling. At the end of the experiment seedlings were cut and brought to the laboratory where the necrosis length and total phenol content of the plant were measured. The pathogen presence was determined by a nested PCR with specific primers of G. abietina. The presence of all endophytes significantly reduced the necrosis length caused by G. abietina in most of the cases. However, the phenolic content of the plant, which is an indicator of the activation of the plant's defence mechanisms, had not increased with the endophyte inoculation. Therefore, the reduction in the necrosis observed could be attributed to a direct effect of the endophyte on the Gremmeniella spreading. These results suggest that the use of fungal endophytes could be an effective way to protect against G. abietina infections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The South American fruit fly Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) is an important pest in many countries. The sterile insect technique is an effective method of controlling Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) in Argentina and has been proposed for use against A. fraterculus. Because this technique relies on sterile mass-reared males mating with wild females, it is essential to verify that artificial rearing does not reduce male mating competitiveness. Several morphometric characters were evaluated to detect differences between a wild population and a laboratory strain that was derived from it and reared artificially since 1997. Eight morphometric traits were analysed as indicators of body size, head shape and potential mobility: Thorax Length, Head Width, Face Width, Eye Length, Wing Length, Wing Width, Third Tibia Length and Femur Length. The results were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance, linear multiple regression and logistic multiple regression. In general, laboratory flies were larger than wild ones (possibly because the larval diet was supplied ad libitum). Laboratory males had significantly larger Head Width and Eye Length and a smaller Wing Width than wild males. Laboratory females differed from wild ones only by having narrower wings. These results could be due to environmental and genetic factors, or as a consequence of genetic drift (for the latter) during colony establishment plus gradual adaptation to laboratory conditions, where flight ability is most likely less important (resources are found easily at close distances). Also, short-distance interactions among individuals are more frequent in a colony, possibly favouring increased facial trait sizes by sexual selection. Because long-term morphological changes could represent the beginning of intraspecific differentiation, they should probably be worthy of some consideration if a large mass-rearing colony is established.

AB  - Quality improvement of acidic soil (with an initial pH of approximately 4.5) with respect to soil pH, exchangeable cations, organic matter content, and maize growth was attempted using natural (NSF) and calcined starfish (CSF). Acidic soil was amended with NSF and CSF in the range of 1 to 10 wt.% to improve soil pH, organic matter content, and exchangeable cations. Following the treatment, the soil pH was monitored for periods up to 3 months. The exchangeable cations were measured after 1 month of curing. After a curing period of 1 month, the maize growth experiment was performed with selected treated samples to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. The results show that 1 wt.% of NSF and CSF (700 and 900 A degrees C) were required to increase the soil pH to a value higher than 7. In the case of CSF (900 A degrees C), 1 wt.% was sufficient to increase the soil pH value to 9 due to the strong alkalinity in the treatment. No significant changes in soil pHs were observed after 7 days of curing and up to 3 months of curing. Upon treatment, the cation exchange capacity values significantly increased as compared to the untreated samples. The organic content of the samples increased upon NSF treatment, but it remains virtually unchanged upon CSF treatment. Maize growth was greater in the treated samples rather than the untreated samples, except for the samples treated with 1 and 3 wt.% CSF (900 A degrees C), where maize growth was limited due to strong alkalinity. This indicates that the amelioration of acidic soil using natural and calcined starfish is beneficial for plant growth as long as the application rate does not produce alkaline conditions outside the optimal pH range for maize growth.

AB  - The study presents a method to evaluate the response of forest ecosystems to increased biomass extraction based on the integrated ecosystem model ForSAFE. It evaluates the effects of residue removal, intensification of thinnings and a shorter rotation period on a forest site in Southern Sweden. The evaluation includes multiple ecosystem indicators for productivity, carbon storage, wood production, water use and water quality. Such integrated assessments can contribute to identify negative or positive impacts affecting ecosystem services provided by forests. Results show that increased biomass extraction reduces the carbon stored in the forests, but at the same time reduces the loss of nitrogen and carbon through leaching. Within one rotation, residue removal affects the carbon stock in the soil, but it does not affect forest productivity and therefore tree carbon stock. Contrarily, the intensification of thinnings and shorter rotation periods reduce carbon stored in trees. In all cases, the amount of wood available for products increases, but the additional harvest from increased thinnings and earlier clear cutting does not compensate for the loss of carbon in trees. A positive consequence of removing the decomposing material from the site is the reduced amount of nutrients lost with runoff. Both leached nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon decrease with intensification. In addition, a positive effect of increased thinnings and a shorter rotation period is a reduced evapotranspiration, i.e. reduced water use. The effect on acidification differed depending on the time frame considered and the applied management scenario, due to different dominating processes regulating acidity. To avoid acidification, management intensification should include measures to prevent loss of base cations in the soil. Overall, under the studied conditions, the risk for negative effects seems to be smaller for residue extraction than for management changes including additional tree harvest. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The uptake of trace metals in the leaves of fast-growing woody species is a crucial factor in ecological risk assessment and in the evaluation of phytoextraction potentials. In this study, we present a long-term data series of foliar Cd, Zn, Mn and Cu concentrations in poplar (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides). Leaves were collected every three weeks from 2001 until 2007 on three sites, (i) a new plantation on an alluvial soil polluted by river sediments, (ii) a new plantation on an unpolluted soil and (iii) a 10-year old plantation on a polluted dredged sediment soil. In addition, tree rings were measured on the alluvial soil in order to better assess growth over the past seven years. Foliar concentrations of Cd, Zn and Mn decreased considerably with time in the new plantation on polluted soil. Concentrations of Zn and Mn decreased in the new plantation on unpolluted soil as well. The older plantation on polluted soil did not show changes in foliar concentrations for Cd. Zn or Mn. Foliar Cu concentrations slightly increased for all sites. Within one growing season, foliar concentrations of Cd, Zn, Cu and Mn increased towards the end of the season. The tree ring data of the poplars on the alluvial soil indicated a strong decrease in growth due to declining tree condition from 2005 onwards, the same year that foliar Cd and Zn concentrations markedly decreased. Lower transpiration rates probably induced a lower uptake of dissolved trace metals. It is concluded that stand health and growth rate have a strong impact on the variation of foliar trace metal concentrations over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tree-ring data from timberlines have been widely used to reconstruct past temperature variability. High-quality reconstructions depend on successful calibrations in which tree-ring records are compared with instrumental observations of climatic factors to establish quantitative relationships between tree growth and climate. Climatic data used in the calibrations are mostly from nearby meteorological stations, located generally in the valleys near human settlements of mountainous areas, regardless of whether climatic records at low elevations are representative for the upper timberline. In order to better understand the characteristics of the alpine environment at the upper timberline of blackseed juniper (Juniperus saltuaria) in the eastern side of the Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, an automatic weather station was established. We found that the variation in the daily/5-day/10-day/monthly mean temperatures and sums of precipitation on the valley bottom (3000 m a.s.l.) as well as the daily/seasonal sums of precipitation from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) are highly correlated with the measurements at the upper timberline (4400 m a.s.l.). Thus, the variations of the valley bottom temperature and precipitation records are confident indicators of the conditions at the upper timberline on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and hence can be used for the calibration in the dendroclimatic reconstructions based on timberline tree-ring data. For 5-day mean temperature pooled by individual months, the R-2 values of the regression models>0.60 between the valley bottom and timberline in February-August and October, and <0.40 in December. For 5-day total precipitation, the R-2 values>0.60 in March-July and October-December, and <0.40 in January, February, August and September. This study represents a small step towards fixing problems regarding to dendroclimatic calibrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB  - Aim
   Data shortages mean that conservation priorities can be highly sensitive to historical patterns of exploration. Here, we investigate the potential of regionally focussed species distribution models to elucidate fine-scale patterns of richness, rarity and endemism.
   Location
   Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania and Kenya.
   Methods
   Generalized additive models and land cover data are used to estimate the distributions of 452 forest plant taxa (trees, lianas, shrubs and herbs). Presence records from a newly compiled database are regressed against environmental variables in a stepwise multimodel. Estimates of occurrence in forest patches are collated across target groups and analysed alongside inventory-based estimates of conservation priority.
   Results
   Predicted richness is higher than observed richness, with the biggest disparities in regions that have had the least research. North Pare and Nguu in particular are predicted to be more important than the inventory data suggest. Environmental conditions in parts of Nguru could support as many range-restricted and endemic taxa as Uluguru, although realized niches are subject to unknown colonization histories. Concentrations of rare plants are especially high in the Usambaras, a pattern mediated in models by moisture indices, whilst overall richness is better explained by temperature gradients. Tree data dominate the botanical inventory; we find that priorities based on other growth forms might favour the mountains in a different order.
   Main conclusions
   Distribution models can provide conservation planning with high-resolution estimates of richness in well-researched areas, and predictive estimates of conservation importance elsewhere. Spatial and taxonomic biases in the data are essential considerations, as is the spatial scale used for models. We caution that predictive estimates are most uncertain for the species of highest conservation concern, and advocate using models and targeted field assessments iteratively to refine our understanding of which areas should be prioritised for conservation.

AB  - An investigation of earthworms across a sand dune system in NW England examined species distribution and abundance with respect to soil physico-chemical conditions and management. Replicated 0.1 m(2) quadrats were examined every 50 m along 700 rm transects across areas of vegetation succession and samples were then taken every 10 m where earthworms were first encountered. A translocation of Aporrectodea longa assessed the ability of this species to live in soils with a high sand content and laboratory work examined growth, maturation and survival of this species in soils with increasing proportions of sand (0-100%). Nine earthworm species were found on the dunes, but none in yellow dunes where organic matter (OM) content was <1%. Dendrobaena octaedra and Lumbricus rubellus were located 300 m from the strand line in grey dunes with an OM content of 3.9%. Allolobophora chlorotica and Lumbricus castaneus occur-red within a wet dune slack at 340 m (OM content 11%). In areas of human disturbance (dune car park), A. longa, Aporrectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus terrestris were present, and in soil below pine trees L. castaneus and L. rubellus were present in litter. Laboratory growth of A. longa demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) increases in growth (2-2.75 g) with 25 and 50% sand compared with 0, 75 and 100% over 24 weeks and a greater rate of maturation. Initial results show earthworm colonisation to be influenced by dune successional stage. Laboratory findings suggested A. longa could exist in higher sand content areas but experimental design needs development. The translocation was unsuccessful. Future investigations could examine soil properties more closely and undertake monitoring on site throughout the year. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measurements of nitric oxide (NO) release at single cell level are fundamental to understand the diverse physiological functions of this remarkable molecule. To achieve this purpose, capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) was originally described for the sensitive determination of NO release in individual neuron and mammalian cell after 8-(3,4-diaminophenyl)-2,6-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (DAMBO-P-H) was chosen as the fluorescent probe. Various parameters affecting NO trapping in vivo and CE separation were systematically studied. Under the optimal conditions, complete and fast separation of the resulted targeted high-fluorescent triazole (DAMBO-P-H-T) was achieved in about 3 min (2.89 min), and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) values of migration time and peak area were less than 5% and 9% for intra-day and inter-day assays, respectively. The detection limit was 42 amol (at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3). The feasibility of application of the developed method was validated by successfully applied to the measurements of NO release from four single cell study models. This original application of this method in diverse samples represents a powerful tool to study the kinetics of NO release by neuronal cells during neurotransmission, as well as for the understanding of the pathobiological and therapeutic basis of this molecule for cardiovascular diseases and under oxidative stress.

AB  - Seasonal variation of water quality and phytoplankton community was studied in Foz de Almargem coastal lagoon in order to evaluate the trophic state of the wetland. This small coastal lagoon has temporary connections to the sea, when the sand barrier is naturally or artificially opened, but for most of the year is isolated receiving just the freshwater input from small rivers.
   Sampling took place in three stations along a gradient of marine influence from June 2001 to July 2002. During summer and autumn, the water in the lagoon was low, influencing positively water temperature, salinity, total solids in suspension (TSS), orthophosphates, total phosphorus (TIP) and pH. In winter and spring, there was an increase of nitrates, nitrites, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and N:P ratio with the raise of water level in the lagoon. Chlorophyll a and phaeo-pigments concentrations were positively related to the previous parameters.
   Phytoplankton density was low and switching in dominant taxa was observed along time but the community was mainly dominated by Dinophyceae and Bacillariophyceae. Chlorophyceae and Euglenophyceae were related to higher TSS and lower DIN, salinity and TP; Cyanophyceae were stimulated by the opposite conditions. The decrease of water level jointly with the raise of salinity and TP influenced positively pico-nano flagellate algae. Cryptophyceae were positively correlated with the same factors and also TSS.
   Several trophic state indexes and water quality indicators have been applied and an overall analysis pointed out to a coastal lagoon with mesotrophic characteristics. During the studied period no serious eutrophication events occurred, however there were some situations of nutrient enrichment due to human activities, such as agriculture and non-treated sewage discharges, which might have favoured the development of potentially toxic phytoplankton species, namely Prorocentrum minimum.

AB  - Soil quality indexing is a new approach in spatial and temporal evaluation of land management systems effects on soils' capacity to function. A field experiment was conducted at Caffee Doonsa (2400m.a.s.l., 08 degrees 57'N, 39 degrees 06'E) for 6 years (1998-2003) to compare the effects of land preparation methods on soil quality (SQ) and to test the use of the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in assessing SQ under the Ethiopian Central Highlands conditions. Four methods of land preparation [ broad bed and furrows (BBF), green manure (GM), ridge and furrows (RF), and reduced tillage (RT)] were arranged in a randomised complete block design with 3 replications on permanent plots (22m by 6 m). Physical, chemical, and biological SQ indicators were determined and scored, and a soil quality index (SQI) was developed using the SMAF procedures. Seven SQ indicators including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), bulk density, aggregate stability (AGG), soil organic carbon (Corg), pH, available water capacity (AWC), and available phosphorus were selected as a minimum dataset. The scored values of the indicators ranged from 0.21 for AGG and 0.97 for pH, both under BBF. Compared with RF ( control), all the alternatives ( GM, BBF, and RT) increased the scores of Corg and MBC. Moreover, BBF and GM increased the score values of AWC and AGG, respectively. Consequently, there was a non-significant increase in SQI due to the use of GM, BBF, and RT compared with the control. As a result, the land preparation methods may be preferred in a decreasing order GM=BBF=RT=RF for the management goal of crop production. The study indicated that SMAF could be a robust tool to assess the performance of land management methods on soil quality in the study area, but some modi. cations may be required to. fit to the prevailing cropping system and soil characteristics.

AB  - Uapaca kirkiana (Muell. Arg.), a highly valued indigenous fruit species, is being domesticated to increase its utilization in southern Africa. Vendors, who were also the fruit gatherers, that were selling U. kirkiana fruits at roadside markets in Dedza, Malawi, were interviewed on four occasions during the marketing season (October 2003-January 2004) and fruit samples were concurrently sampled from each vendor. Information was obtained on when and how the fruits had been harvested and handled. Timing of fruit harvest was based on experience, aided by indicators such as occurrence of first heavy rains, natural abscission, size and color changes. Harvesting by knocking down unripe fruits from trees was practiced throughout the season, but naturally abscised fruits were also gathered in December and January. Fruits harvested when mature but unripe required incubation in soil, plain and woven plastic bags or clay-pots. The incubation method changed and the duration of incubation decreased between October (3-4 days) and January (<= 2 days). Fruit samples were evaluated for damage, color and soluble solids concentration (SSC). Fruit SSC and color lightness/brightness (L*) increased from 10.1 to 16.4% (P < 0.01) and from 45.7 to 50.5 units, (P < 0.01), respectively. Higher SSC values were generally associated (R-2 = 0.68, P < 0.001) with increasing pulp color intensity. Cracking, at 48%, constituted the most common form of damage in sampled fruits. On average, fruits were saleable for only 3-4 days, this being attributed to inherent fruit characteristics combined with immaturity at harvest, and damage during harvesting and storage in hot dry conditions. Lack of appropriate harvesting and handling techniques were associated with fruit darkening, drying, rotting and other postharvest problems.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcription can be notably affected by cellular activation, differentiation, and division. We hypothesized that changes in the cell cycle could also affect HIV susceptibility to nucleoside analogues, which compete with natural nucleotides for incorporation into viral DNA and inhibit viral replication through premature termination of reverse transcription. Proliferating HeLa-derived indicator cells were arrested in the S/G(2) phase with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, or in the G(1)/S phase with aphidicolin, a polymerase alpha inhibitor. Cell cycle arrest by both agents induced a remarkable decrease in HIV susceptibility to zidovudine (AZT). This decrease was seen both with a single-cycle infectivity assay and with a viral DNA quantitation assay, indicating that the effect of cell cycle arrest was exerted at the reverse transcription stage. The increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) seen with arrested cells was strongest for AZT (23-fold) and stavudine (21-fold) but more modest for other drugs (lamivudine, 11-fold; dideoxyinosine, 7-fold; and nevirapine, 3-fold). In drug-resistant reverse transcriptase mutants, the increase in AZT IC50 (relative to that in dividing cells) was most prominent with a Q151M mutant and was comparable to the wild type in other drug-resistant mutants. Quantitation of intracellular pools of dTTP and AZT 5'-triphosphate (AZTTP) showed that etoposide treatment induced a significant increase in intracellular dTTP and consequently a decrease in AZTTP/dTTP ratios, suggesting that the decrease in viral susceptibility to AZT was caused by reduced incorporation of the analogue into nascent viral DNA. These results emphasize the importance of cellular proliferation and deoxynucleoside triphosphate metabolism in HIV susceptibility to nucleoside analogues and underscore the need to study the activities of drugs of this class with natural target cells under physiological conditions of activation and proliferation.

AB  - Hypoxia is increasing in marine and estuarine systems worldwide, primarily due to anthropogenic causes. Periodic hypoxia represents a pulse disturbance, with the potential to restructure estuarine biotic communities. We chose the shallow, epifaunal community in the lower Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, USA, to test the hypothesis that low dissolved oxygen (DO) (< 4 mg l(-1)) affects community dynamics by reducing the cover of spatial dominants, creating space both for less dominant native species and for invasive species, Settling panels were deployed at shallow depths in spring 2000 and 2001. at Gloucester Point, Virginia, and were manipulated every 2 wk from late June to mid-August. Manipulation involved exposing epifaunal communities to varying levels of DO for up to 24 h followed by redeployment in the York River. Exposure to low DO affected both species composition (presence or absence) and the abundance of the organisms present. Community dominance shifted away from barnacles as level of hypoxia increased. Barnacles were important spatial dominants which reduced species diversity when locally abundant. The cover of Hydroides dianthus, a native serpulid polychaete, doubled when exposed to periodic hypoxia. Increased H. dianthus cover may indicate whether a local region has experienced periodic, local DO depletion and thus provide an indicator of poor water-quality conditions. In 2001, the combined cover of the invasive and cryptogenic species in this community, Botryllus schlosseri (tunicate), Molgula manhattensis (tunicate), Ficopomatus enigmaticus (polychaete) and Diadumene lineata (anemone), was highest on the plates exposed to moderately low DO (2 mg l(-1) < DO < 4 mg l(-1)). All 4 of these species are now found worldwide and exhibit life histories well adapted for establishment in foreign habitats. Low DO events may enhance success of invasive species, which further stress marine and estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - Owing to the hydrodynamic and sedimentation conditions, the western shoal of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) is known to be an important sink of terrestrial substances including particle-associated pollutants from the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. In this study, we report the sedimentary record of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the 20(th) century in a sediment core from the western shoal of the PRE. The Sigma PAH concentration ranged from 59 ng g(-1) to 330 ng g(-1) in the core with two distinct peaks. An initial increase of Sigma PAH concentration was found around the 1860s. The amounts of PAHs remained relatively constant for roughly 100 years, followed by the first peak in the 1950s. Then, there was a decrease in PAH concentration and flux in the 1960s and 1970s. A sharp increase of PAH concentration was observed in the early 1980s with a maximum concentration in the 1990s. The PAH diagnostic ratios indicated that the PAHs in the sediment core were mainly of pyrolytic origin, and that atmospheric deposition and land runoff may serve as the important pathways for PAHs input to the sediment. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was used as an index of socioeconomic development in the PRD region, which was correlated positively with the changes of PAH concentration and flux in the sediment core. The rapid increase in vehicle numbers and energy consumption in the region in the last two decades may have contributed to the rapid PAH increase since the early 1980s. The results clearly elucidated the impact of regional economic development on the estuarine environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural land use in the Highlands of Chiapas intensifies the problems of soil fertility and use of fertilizers to sustain corn production. The comprehension of the factors that regulate microbial activity is of interest due to the importance that has in the maintenance of soil fertility and plant nutrition. The effect of agricultural intensification on the number of microorganisms, microbial respiration, organic C mineralization, mycorrhizal inoculum potential and biological N-2 fixation, and the relationships of those microbial activity indicators with soil fertility characteristics was analyzed in two localities of Chamula, Chiapas. Composite soil samples were collected in 52 plots that were classified in four corn cropping systems based on the land use history: long fallow, short fallow, pasture-cultivation rotation and annual continuous cultivation. Microbial respiration was 38% lower in plots with corn under annual continuous cultivation or pasture-cultivation rotation than in long or short fallow, irrespective of their condition in cultivation (corn) or fallow (tree and shrub vegetation). Organic C mineralization was 31 and 43% lower in plots with corn under annual continuous cultivation and pasture-cultivation rotation than in cultivated plots of the long or short fallow, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of corn was 3.1 times higher in grassland than in cultivated soils from long fallow. The decrease of microbial respiration was related to the decline of soil organic reserves, the increase in soil acidity and the decrease of basic cations. These results indicate the importance of the periodic addition of organic and mineral amendments that should return the soil organic reserves and basic cations to improve heterotrophic microbial activity in these acid soils with intensive agricultural use. Also, results suggest the importance of grassland to maintain mycorrhizal inoculum potential of soil.

AB  - Concentrations of dissolved Y and rare-earth elements (REE) are reported for oxic eastern Mediterranean seawater from the western Levantine Basin, and for anoxic hypersaline brine and overlying oxic seawater from the Tyro sub-basin, the latter data allowing a comparative study of Y and REE behaviours during redox-cycling. All oxic waters show shale-normalized Rare-Earths and Yttrium (REY(SN); Y inserted between Dy and Ho) patterns with HREE enrichment, negative Ce-SN anomalies, and positive anomalies of La-SN, Eu-SN, and, most pronounced, Y-SN. The anoxic brine in the Tyro sub-basin displays the highest REY concentrations and the least HREE enrichment of all samples, and positive anomalies of La-SN, Eu-SN, Gd-SN, Y-SN, and, in marked contrast to the oxic samples, Ce-SN.
   Compared to overlying oxic water, the anoxic brine shows enrichment factors that decrease from La (12.1) to Yb (2.7), with a pronounced positive deviation for Ce (51.2) and a strong negative deviation for Y (2.4, compared to 4.3 for Dy and 3.7 for Ho). The Y/Ho molar ratio decreases from 102 above to only 67 below the seawater-brine interface, due to preferential sorption of Ho with respect to Y on Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxide particles that eventually dissolve under anoxic conditions. The pronounced Y-Ho fractionation during redox-cycling of Mn and Fe is further evidence for the considerably lower marine particle reactivity of Y compared to Ho, resulting from lower stabilities of surface complexes of Y relative to those of its REE neighbours. Hence, the Y/Ho ratio appears to be a sensitive indicator of the impact of particles on the distribution of dissolved trace elements in natural waters.

TI  - PRIVATISATION OF PEOPLES OWN AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY IN THE NEW FEDERAL STATES
T2  - BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - The legal basis of Treuhandanstalt (THA) is the Trusteeship Act of 17 June 1990. Under this Act the trust authority is charged with the mandate of managing all assets transferred to it, of returning the- to the rightful owners or privatising (selling) them. THA is an independent public law institution under the supervision of the Federal government. The Trusteeship Act also provides the basis for taking into account agricultural policy aims and measures. When selling land THA must consider the maximization of returns as an important but not the only criterion. In order to make it possible for buyers with little capital to acquire land there are plans to provide a restricted group of them with grants at favourable conditions - like, for example, annuity subsidies. There is no intention to launch a special settlement programme.
   In the privatisation of land THA must comply with the statutory requirements of the Act on Real Property Sales (Grundstuckverkehrsgesetz) and the Act on Leasehold Property (Landpachtverkehrsgesetz). In its decisions on whether to close down or sell livestock units with oversized herds THA should consider agricultural policy criteria as well as regional policy aspects, the markets for livestock products and the critical state of the labour market in the new Federal states.
   If there are several offers to buy or lease agricultural enterprises or farmland THA requires the presentation of a business concept. In the case of various comparable concepts being presented it awards contracts in accordance with a given.political priority: former owner - occupiers who want to re-establish a private farm business - residents who want to start farming - legal successors of former farm cooperatives if they have an irrefutable need - bidders from West Germany and other countries.
   THA is committed to a cautious sales policy to avoid unacceptable plummeting of prices for agricultural property. When privatising farm businesses THA takes account of nature conservation requirements.

AB  - For the first time, the volatiles of three varieties of fresh and roasted Torreya yunnanensis nuts were investigated by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated that roasting had the greatest effect on the volatiles of millet capsules. Fresh nuts had many terpenes, esters, and aldehydes, while roasting led to the formation of pyrazines and furans. In subsequent work, short-term low temperature and small sample area exposed to high temperature had a large effect on the increase in some volatiles and was characterized by a green flavor, such as alpha-pinene, while ultrahigh-temperature (200 and 230 degrees C) resulted in a decrease in the total volatiles with the generation of unpleasant flavors. Finally, the combination of 170 degrees C for 40 min and slight crushing was found to be the best roasting conditions for samples by means of GC-MS and two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC/TOF-MS). Practical applications Torreya yunnanensis and its nuts have broad development prospects because of their wide use and rich nutrition. However, inappropriate processing and lack of attention to natural materials such as nuts and wood leads to their poor usage. In addition, volatile compounds make a major contribution to the nut aroma, which is an important indicator of their sensory quality. However, no one has applied roasting technology to Torreya yunnanensis nuts or studied the volatile compounds of the roasted nuts. This study revealed the changes in the composition and content of volatile compounds in Torreya yunnanensis nuts before and after roasting, and the influence of different process points, suggesting that they are key contributors to the development of the related products.

AB  - The response of carbon pools in peatlands during the last millennium is important for global carbon cycling and is a potential indicator for paleoenvironmental research. Herein, we compared the stability and accumulation of carbon pools between the Hongtu peatland (HT, east site) and the Jintao peatland (JT, west site) in the northern Great Khingan Mountains, spanning the last 700 (HT) and 1000 (JT) years. Peat humification, aromatic and carbohydrate contents, and carbon accumulation rates in these two peat cores were analyzed to better understand the environmental impacts on the stability of carbon pools in these peatlands during the last millennium. The average carbon accumulation rates and the aromatic contents in the HT (23.09 +/- 7.28 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 28.0 +/- 2.2%, respectively) and JT (23.96 +/- 6.07 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 27.8 +/- 0.6%, respectively) were similar. The higher carbohydrate contents in the HT peatland than that in the JT peatland (35.8 +/- 2.8% vs 27.8 +/- 4.4%) indicated that the stability of carbon pools in the HT peatland were weaker than those in the JT peatland. Local precipitation and fire events may be the two major factors driving the varying stability of carbon pools in these two sites. Especially, at 250-200 cal yr BP, intense fire events may have promoted herb growth and high carbohydrate content in the accumulated plant litter, which ultimately produced higher carbohydrate and lower aromatic contents in the JT peatland than nearby periods. The paleoenvironmental conditions in the studied regions reconstructed by organic matter properties also suggested that the climate forcing mechanisms in the eastern and western sides of the northern Great Khingan Mountains were different and influenced by different degrees by the East Asian monsoon and westerlies.

AB  - The lateral ( LA) and basolateral (BL) nuclei of the amygdala regulate emotional behaviors. Despite their dissimilar extrinsic connectivity, they are often combined, perhaps because their cellular composition is similar to that of the cerebral cortex, including excitatory principal cells reciprocally connected with fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). In the cortex, this microcircuitry produces gamma oscillations that support information processing and behavior. We tested whether this was similarly the case in the rat (males) LA and BL using extracellular recordings, biophysical modeling, and behavioral conditioning. During periods of environmental assessment, both nuclei exhibited gamma oscillations that stopped upon initiation of active behaviors. Yet, BL exhibited more robust spontaneous gamma oscillations than LA. The greater propensity of BL to generate gamma resulted from several microcircuit differences, especially the proportion of FSIs and their interconnections with principal cells. Furthermore, gamma in BL but not LA regulated the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission between connected neurons. Together, these results suggest fundamental differences in how LA and BL operate. Most likely, gamma in LA is externally driven whereas in BL, it can also arise spontaneously to support ruminative processing and the evaluation of complex situations.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The basolateral amygdala (BLA) participates in the production and regulation of emotional behaviors. It is thought to perform this using feedforward circuits that enhance stimuli that gain emotional significance and directs them to valence-appropriate downstream effectors. This perspective overlooks the fact that its microcircuitry is recurrent and potentially capable of generating oscillations in the gamma band (50-80 Hz), which synchronize spiking activity and modulate communication between neurons. This study found that BLA gamma supports both these processes, is associated with periods of action selection and environmental assessment irrespective of valence, and differs between BLA subnuclei in a manner consistent with their heretofore unknown microcircuit differences. Thus, it provides new mechanisms for BLA to support emotional behaviors.

AB  - The parasitic ability of Cosmocomoidea annulicornis (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) was tested on eggs of the sharpshooter Tapajosa rubromarginata (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), vector of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa that causes citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), among other plant diseases. In the present study, we evaluated biological traits of C. annulicornis such as parasitism and emergence rates, developmental time, longevity and sex ratio in laboratory conditions on leaves of Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Zea mays and Sorghum halepense. In addition, the functional response of C. annulicornis on host egg masses laid on C. aurantium leaves was studied and new distribution sites of the parasitoid in Argentina are reported. The overall parasitism of C. annulicornis was 49.20 ? 2.90%. Of those parasitized eggs, 83.30 ? 6.51% adults emerged. Parasitism of C. annulicornis was significantly lower in host eggs laid on S. halepense and developmental time was longer in C. limon compared to the other host plant species tested. In all host plant species tested, females developed faster than males. Individuals lived on average 5.94 ? 0.23 days and statistically significant differences were found between the longevity of females and males. Sex ratio of parasitoids was balanced in all host plant species tested, excepted for maize plants, in which sex ratio was female biased. Cosmocomoidea annulicornis females exhibited a type III functional response, indicating a greater searching efficiency at high host densities compared to low densities. Previous reports of field parasitism in combination with ou r results of C. annulicornis performance on eggs of T. rubromarginata are indicators of a potential biological control agent against the vector ofX . fastidiosa, though f urther studies are needed regarding its biology.

AB  - In general, water table depth risks are estimated from monitoring networks that mostly provide scarce and irregular data. When jointly analysed, environmental, agricultural and geotechnical variables, treated as stochastic spatial variables, can better describe and interpret the states of a certain system subject to estimation uncertainty. Risk assessment consists essentially in calculating the frequency (probability) with which specified criteria are exceeded or fail to be met by creating multiple stochastic realizations. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel geostatistical methodology, based on the integration into one approach of multi-source data fusion and stochastic simulation, to estimate the risk of extreme(shallow) water table depth, and illustrate a demonstrative example of application of the approach to a case study in a Cerrado conservation area in Brazil. The risk of shallow water table depth was determined by using critical thresholds for water table level and a binary transformation into an indicator variable depending on whether the conditions expressed by the threshold values are met or not. Firstly, auxiliary variables were jointly, analysed to provide a delineation of the study area into homogeneous zones. Secondly, sequential indicator simulation provided a-posteriori probabilities taking into account spatial proximity. The final maps show the most probable risk category for the whole area and spatial entropy as a measure of local uncertainty. Areas nearby watershed divisors and in the north part of the region have a high risk of shallow groundwater. Informed decision-making supported by probabilistic maps and uncertainty evaluation is essential for the success of the projects of Cerrado restoration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the degraded forests, thinning has a positive effect on the provision of ecosystem services such as timber and bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, and recreational attractiveness. center dot Context The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment highlights the importance of the ecosystem services for human well-being and for maintaining conditions for life on Earth. Silvicultural treatments can improve the provision of ecosystem services to increase local communities' well-being. center dot Aims The aim of this study is to understand the effects of two-forest restoration practices (selective thinning and thinning from below) on three ecosystem services (wood production, climate change mitigation, and recreational opportunities) in an Italian case study. center dot Methods A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed to compare the effects of three forest restoration scenarios (baseline, selective thinning, thinning from below) on ecosystem services. Wood production was estimated considering the local market prices and the wood volumes harvested, while climate change mitigation was quantified through the C-stock and C-sequestration changes in carbon pools due to the silvicultural treatments. The recreational activities were assessed through a questionnaire survey. A sample of 200 visitors was interviewed face-to-face to estimate the impact of thinning on recreational activities. center dot Results The results of the MCDA show that the selective thinning scenario is the optimal forest restoration practice to increase the recreational attractiveness and the wood production in the study area. center dot Conclusion The results concerning the effects of the silvicultural treatments on ecosystem services supply are an important tool to support decision makers.

AB  - The authors conducted a study aimed to identify the role of "Big Four" ("Big 4") audit firms in the public procurement market in Ukraine.The purpose of the article is to answer the questions: whether Ukraine is in a general trend of most countries in the concentration of audit market; what is the share of revenues of the "Big Four" audit firms in the performance of audit services in the public procurement system in Ukraine. First of all, in order to get answers to these questions, the authors conducted a study of the main trends in the development of the "Big Four" companies in Ukraine. It was found that the characteristic competitive environment in the market of audit services, the impact on competitiveness of pricing policy and regulatory requirements, relating to the acquisition of audit services by public sector entities through a public procurement system "ProZorro".
   An element of price regulation and compliance with the transparent conditions of the competitive environment is the participation of audit firms in the public procurement system. As a result of processing data on procurement of audit services for the period 2008-2019, the authors calculated key indicators that characterize the concentration of the audit market. Based on the data on the amount of remuneration for various types of audit services using the public procurement system "ProZorro", aspects of pricing policy and the role of the companies of the "Big Four" in the market were established. The values indexes indicate that the companies of the "Big 4" do not have a complete monopoly in the segment of procurement of audit services, having certain dominant positions in some years, and the indexes indicate a trend towards effective competition in the audit services market in Ukraine.

AB  - The fine sediment distribution in the seabed is an important indicator for the ecological functioning of shallow coastal seas. In this paper, we investigate the processes and conditions that determine the fine sediment distribution in the Dutch coastal zone surficial seabed, while also assessing the response of the system to human interventions. An extensive sediment dataset, collected in the Dutch coastal zone from 2006 to 2014, is presented. These data are used to map the distribution of fines in the seabed of the DCZ at unique spatiotemporal scales. For the entire Dutch coastal zone, the distribution of fines generally agrees well with previous studies. The recent extension of the Port of Rotterdam, the Maasvlakte 2 reclamation, was found to locally change the distribution of fines. In the sand mining pit and directly south of the reclamation, fines percentages in the seabed increased by more than 10%. We developed a conceptual framework to analyse the distribution of fines and how it is affected by human interventions. Three components are distinguished within this framework: (1) sources of fines; (2) transport pathways; and (3) accumulation potential. These components are determined both qualitatively and quantitatively, based on high-resolution bathymetric and hydrodynamic model data. The distinction between the three components makes it possible to unravel the contributions of different human interventions to the changes in the fines distribution. In the case of Maasvlakte 2, the local increase of fines percentage in the seabed could thus be attributed to a temporary additional source of fines and enhanced accumulation potential. The high spatiotemporal resolution of the new sediment dataset proved crucial to enable development and testing of the framework to evaluate the impact of (large) engineering works on the spatial distribution of fines.

AB  - Identifying physical properties of geothermal features such as surface temperature and roughness is crucial for geothermal assessment, hydrology, and environmental studies. Surface temperature and roughness-related rock properties strongly influence the thermal infrared and back-scattering intensities, respectively, of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This study aimed to identify geothermal steam spots based on the surface temperature and roughness of altered surfaces, mud pools, and hot springs in tropical conditions. The thermal emissivity separation method was adopted to calculate kinetic temperature using the thermal infrared (TIR) of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data as well as ground temperature data. Surface temperatures calculated by the thermal emissivity separation method were corrected using measured ground temperatures to eliminate the effects of atmospheric absorption, thermal inertia of materials, and/or diurnal temperature in the images. In addition, the linear fitting method was applied to obtain the final surface roughness model based on the calculated determination coefficient (R-2) between the initial surface roughness model derived by Sentinel-1A SAR and field data. The highestR(2)between surface roughness values from Sentinel-1A SAR and field data were selected to calculate spatially the surface roughness of the Wayang Windu Geothermal Field, West Java, Indonesia. The satellite imagery and field measurements showed that surface temperature and roughness features correlate with each other, and high and low thermal features correlate with high and low surface roughness values, respectively. Accordingly, we integrated the TIR and SAR data to propose the thermal resistivity index (TRI) as an indicator of the hydrothermal fluid paths to the surface. Low TRI was encountered at geothermal features and intersections of subsurface faults, which indicated weak zones that radiate heat from the subsurface to the surface.

AB  - Blueschist is a regional metamorphic rock formed under high-pressure (HP) low-temperature (LT) conditions. It is formed in the subduction zone environment with low geothermal gradients (4-14 degrees C km(-1)), and is characterized by the presence of HP/LT index minerals like glaucophane, lawsonite, aragonite, jadeite, and deerite. In general, blueschist-facies rocks are stable in subduction zones at depths of 30-60 km, and transform to eclogite-facies rocks at greater depths. The preservation of blueschists requires a fast exhumation rate. Based on protolith and tectonic setting, blueschists can be grouped into Type-A and Type-B, but some metasomatic blueschists also occur. Blueschist belts distribute mainly as bands along the margins of orogenic belts, and their occurrences within cratons are very limited. Precambrian blueschists, of which the oldest ones are about 800-700 Ma in age, are rare; most of the exposed blueschist terranes are of post-Paleozoic metamorphic age. As diagnostic evidence of ancient subduction zones, blueschist plays an important role in understanding plate tectonics. Blueschist-eclogite transition at cold subduction zones involves dehydration reactions and fluid release, which are of great importance in facilitating slab-mantle wedge water and element recycling, generating arc magmatism, and triggering intermediate-depth earthquakes in the subducting slab. MetamorphicP-Tpaths of blueschists and associated rocks provide key information on constraining the onset of the subduction initiation and subsequent geodynamic evolution. As a cold geothermal indicator, the emergence of blueschist offers robust evidence for the start of modern plate tectonics on the Earth. Blueschist-facies metamorphism still represents an important research direction in metamorphic geology, which requires further investigations on determining the beginning of plate tectonics, constraining phase-transition processes, and constructing a global blueschist database.

AB  - Potential health risks associated with water used to irrigate fresh produce are increasingly recognized worldwide, leading to the implementation of water quality standards as part of many food safety programs. These standards are generally based on the presence of the fecal indicator bacterium (FIB), generic Escherichia coli; however, the persistence and potential growth of this species in the environment suggests current standards may not accurately predict health risks associated with irrigation water. In this context, we evaluated enterococci as an alternate FIB for assessing agricultural water quality under baseflow conditions, which typically coincide with peak demands for supplemental irrigation in the study area. We compared culture-based concentrations of Enterococcus to E. coli over two growing seasons at four different irrigation canals in Alberta, Canada, that historically exceed the E. coli irrigation guideline on a frequent basis. We also examined enterococci species distributions among irrigation water, animal feces, and human sewage. Escherichia coli and enterococci were significantly correlated at three of the four canals, although on average, more guideline exceedances and higher mean concentrations of enterococci were reported. Specific differences in FIB dynamics were observed between canals. Most notably, enterococci concentrations were significantly higher than E. coli at one canal, while E. coli concentrations were significantly higher than enterococci at a different canal. Enterococci species distributions were markedly different between irrigation water and animal feces. Enterococci species reportedly associated with plants predominated in irrigation water, whereas these species were absent or present in very low proportions in human sewage and animal feces. Results of this study suggest the limitations of using enterococci for measuring microbial quality of irrigation water are similar to E. coli, in that risk analyses with respect to food safety may be confounded by the presence of environment-associated species and/or strains.

AB  - In recent decades open areas, created by natural disturbance or human activity, have been lost from many woodlands. Consequently, species that rely on the unique abiotic conditions provided by these open areas, including species characteristic of ancient woodland, have become of conservation concern. In woodlands managed for driven pheasant shooting linear open spaces (rides) are maintained. However, previous research has shown that game management can have negative effects on woodland communities, particularly within the area of pheasant release pens. It may be that rides in game woods do not support the same species as open areas in other woods. We assessed the effect of game management on the structure and management of rides, on the ground flora and shrub communities, and on butterfly abundance of these rides. Rides in game woods were wider and more open. Although disturbance by vehicles was higher in game woods, overall habitat disturbance was higher in control woods. These differences in physical attributes, combined with the direct effects of pheasants (including soil nutrient input), explained the differences observed in the ground vegetation of rides in game woods. For example, there were more fast-growing ruderal species and less bare ground in game woods. Although the richness of shrub species was also affected by game management, the direction of the effect depended on region. Overall, game management did not have a consistently negative effect on species of conservation concern, with the abundance of butterflies and richness of ancient woodland indicator species unaffected by game management. We suggest that the effect of game management on ride communities is benign and that factors other than those directly examined in this study (such as deer browsing) also need to be considered by woodland managers.

AB  - The present study was performed on Shorea robusta Gaertn., Acacia auriculiformis Benth., Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Azadirachta indica A. Juss in two tropical forests [including one (Barjora), situated adjacent to heavy pollution sources and the other, as control, Ballavpur Wildlife Sanctuary (BWLS)] of West Bengal, India, to measure the heavy metals accumulation capacity in their leaves and their levels of tolerance in a polluted environment. Site wise and seasonal variations in air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and anticipated performance index (API) were assessed in the aforesaid four plants. Highest APTI value was observed in S. robusta (34.62 +/- 1.47) at polluted site during winter. S. robusta anticipated as an excellent performer on the basis of API score in all the three seasons in BWLS. The metal accumulation index (MAI) values ranged from 3.06 to 7.68 and 9.48-9.82; 2.65-4.96 and 4.29-6.08; 3.35-8.14 and 5.04-11.65; 3.59-4.64 and 5.21-7.98 at BWLS and Barjora forest for S. robusta, A. auriculiformis, E. globulus and A. indica respectively. Two-way ANOVA test showed a site and season wise significant difference in the biochemical and physiological parameters between the two forests. The results indicated that air pollution played an important role, which affected the biochemical and physiological parameters of plants in tropical forest located at a polluted site. The species with highest MAI and APTI value could be used in sound green space management for reducing the levels of atmospheric pollution. Higher levels of ascorbic acid content, at polluted site as compared to control site, were an indication of stress condition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The practice of intensive herbicide use in the sugarcane industry has a high risk of compromising the quality of the water and the organisms that live there due to losses through runoff, leaching and other processes. In this work, the dynamics of four herbicides present in three different mixtures were evaluated through their incorporation and elimination in the muscle tissue of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The highest mean values of bioconcentration factors were 1.730 for ametryn, 0.891 for tebuthiuron, 0.322 for hexazinone and 4.783 for diuron. Diuron presented the highest risk regarding the consumption of tilapia fillets by the population. However, considering that the fish would reach maximum levels of diuron when exposed to extremely high concentrations, an individual weighing 70 kg would need to ingest approximately 1.5 kg of this food product to surpass the acceptable daily intake of 0.007 mg kg(-1) body weight. It was concluded that the risk of injury to the population consuming tilapia fillets from fish exposed to herbicides in water arising from sugarcane activities is very low.
   According to the risk estimation performed in this work, which is substantiated by the assumptions of the World Health Organization and the International Life Sciences Institute, there is a low risk of injury to the population consuming tilapia fillets from fish exposed to water containing herbicides in concentrations arising from sugarcane activities. However, as the risk was estimated from laboratory conditions, caution should be taken where herbicide applications are carried out with high frequency near water bodies, as the consumption of fish from these areas is quite common.

AB  - Cortisol, the end product of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis, has been traditionally measured in blood as indicator of stress in fish, however, the degree of invasiveness inherent to blood collection is not always possible or desirable. Instead, cortisol measurement in skin mucus is far less invasive, but as blood, this method potentially provides only a brief window of information of the HPI axis activity. The newly described method of cortisol measurement from scales may serve as a long-term, integrated measure of the HPI axis activity in fish. While skin mucus and scales cortisol measurement present practical and conceptual advantages, there are still several unclear issues related to their biological relevance that need deeper study. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate whether skin mucus and scales cortisol levels can be reliably used as stress indicators by subjecting fish to prolonged, continuous stressful conditions. The present study demonstrates that the measurement of cortisol in skin mucus reflect circulating cortisol concentrations when fish are responding to stress with an intense activation of the HPI axis. Results also revealed that cortisol content in scales strongly correlates to circulating cortisol levels in chronically stressed fish. Besides, we provide further support that scales cortisol assessment offer a retrospective measure of the past stress experience in fish. While this study provides a good basis for future research applying the methods presented, our results open the question of whether these matrices have additional sources of cortisol other than blood, and the route of incorporation or diffusion. Further knowledge about the general robustness and stability of scales cortisol in fish subjected to prolonged stress would largely help strengthen the interpretation of hormone fluctuations in this matrix.

AB  - In this work, an Inherently Safer Design Tool (i-SDT) is presented for early stage process synthesis to characterize and track the risk associated with different life-cycle phases of industrial processes. It also helps to develop characteristic equations for different safety parameters (i.e., flammability, explosiveness, toxicity, etc.) under various operating conditions. This property-based inherent safety quantification metric is a tailor made semi-quantitative safety analysis tool which provides safety assessment in a continuous manner to overcome the subjective nature of the existing available safety metrics. The core of this design and safety assessment tool is probabilistic risk quantification using accident and incident investigation (with over 600 incidents and within 27 years of time span), a property integration model and an exponential curve fitting method. The proposed safety metric has the flexibility to operate by identifying the major accident-prone units/sections of a process, as well as the major safety and operating parameters. The final output of this i-SDT tool is a cluster safety parameter score (C-SP) which provides insights regarding the investigated unit/section or process for carrying out inherent safer design using a very limited amount of process information. The developed i-SDT tool was applied to compare different technologies of Ammonia processes in order to assess the safer option in terms of risks associated with the accident-prone unit/section and to highlight the areas of safety improvement in any existing process using the inherent safer design principles. In the future, this metric can can be embedded into a techno-economic framework to perform the cost and safety analysis simultaneously using available materials, design and accident information.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (A beta) solution injections into an aqueous mobile phase moving through narrow bore stainless-steel capillary tubing results in adsorption of at least 99% A beta within the tubing or injection valve. However, if flow is stopped for a period of 5-10 minutes, then started, wall desorption yields A beta-containing molecules in the new effluent. The amount of desorbed A beta-containing effluent depends on flow rate, period of flow cessation, and number of successive A beta injections into the same tube without cleaning between injections. Unexpected multiple chromatographic peaks in these experiments seem to imply "separation" of released, previously adsorbed A beta-containing products in the empty capillary tubing. These preliminary experiments raise questions about possible errors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) spinal tap analyses, which use stainless-steel needles of approximately the same inner diameter and encounter similar flow rates as those in our capillary experiments. Microliter syringes and HPLC connectors also contain stainless-steel tubing that have similar inner diameter dimensions and similar flow rates. The capillary system involved in these experiments has previously been proposed as a model system for studying the effects of shear on A beta within the brain because it offers a research environment that provides highly restrictive flow through very small dimension channels. A suggestion is made for the use of this system in exploratory anti-amyloid drug studies in which both the drug and A beta are injected in the same solution so that both drug and A beta are subjected to the same shear environment. Reduction in adsorbed A beta is suggested as an indicator of effective anti-A beta drugs.

AB  - This study investigated vegetation and soil properties in a beaver-created freshwater wetland located on the Coastal Plain of Virginia near Washington, DC. We focused on the associations among floristic quality, soil physicochemistry, denitrification, and hydrologic conditions of the wetland to understand links between the effects of beaver engineering and ecosystem function. The floristic quality assessment index (FQI) and denitrification are two important indicators often used to examine overall habitat quality and ecosystem functioning of a wetland. Samples were collected from ten plots (10 m x 10 m each) in August 2014. Vegetation attributes included total percent cover, species richness (S), diversity, FQI, and prevalence index (PI). Soil attributes included organic matter (OM), total carbon, total nitrogen, gravimetric moisture (GM), pH, bulk density (D (b)), and denitrification potential (DP). FQI was greater in the higher of the two standing water level categories, where D (b) was lower, and was negatively associated with D (b) but no other soil nutrient properties. DP was positively associated with soil nutrients, OM, and GM, but not with measured vegetation attributes nor standing water levels. We found higher soil GM, lower plant community PI, and lower plot S in this study compared to our previous study, with no changes to other vegetation or soil attributes, indicating enduring beaver activity and a resilient plant community. The outcome of the study includes regression models that best explain the association between structural and functional attributes of the ecosystem, which can be applicable to the study of other beaver-created wetlands. The study also provides partial evidence for the notion that low-lying areas dug out by beaver positively impact the FQI of wetlands.

AB  - Much research has been carried out on modelling soil erosion rates under different climatic and land use conditions. Although some studies have addressed the issue of reduced crop productivity due to soil erosion, few have focused on the economic loss in terms of agricultural production and gross domestic product (GDP). In this study, soil erosion modellers and economists come together to carry out an economic evaluation of soil erosion in the European Union (EU). The study combines biophysical and macroeconomic models to estimate the cost of agricultural productivity loss due to soil erosion by water in the EU. The soil erosion rates, derived from the RUSLE2015 model, are used to estimate the loss in crop productivity (physical change in the production of plants) and to model their impact on the agricultural sector per country. A computable general equilibrium model is then used to estimate the impact of crop productivity change on agricultural production and GDP. The 12 million hectares of agricultural areas in the EU that suffer from severe erosion are estimated to lose around 0.43% of their crop productivity annually. The annual cost of this loss in agricultural productivity is estimated at around Euro1.25 billion. The computable general equilibrium model estimates the cost in the agricultural sector to be close to Euro300 million and the loss in GDP to be about Euro155 million. Italy emerges as the country that suffers the highest economic impact, whereas the agricultural sector in most Northern and Central European countries is only marginally affected by soil erosion losses.

AB  - Land-use change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition have negatively affected heathlands with severe consequences for biodiversity. One possible way to counteract these negative impacts can be habitat restoration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of montane heathland restoration on former spruce forests using vascular plants as indicators. We compared the three following land-use types (i) grazed montane heathlands, (ii) grazed restoration sites on former spruce forests where seed transfer has been applied, and (iii) ungrazed clear-cuts of spruce forests.
   Four to five years after restoration each land-use type was according to an indicator species analysis characterised by different indicator species. Despite the short time period since the implementation of the restoration measures and many similarities in plant species assemblages between restoration and clear-cut sites, Calluna vulgaris had vigorously established on restoration sites with a mean cover of nearly 20%, whereas it was largely absent at clear-cut sites. In addition, there was a clear trend that plant assemblages of restoration and clear-cut sites become more clearly separated. The cover of non target species significantly increased at clear-cut sites and the cover of C. vulgaris remained extremely low.
   The conducted restoration measures are able to initiate the establishment of typical montane heath land vegetation on former spruce forests. However, restoration of the complete plant assemblage would require additional sod transplantation as both Vaccinium myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea mainly depend on vegetative regeneration. Furthermore, topsoil removal of the most nutrient-rich parts would be necessary to counteract the encroachment of Cytisus scoparius. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Air pollution is the single largest environmental risk today and is increasing in developing countries. In addition, exposure to air pollution is correlated to poor socioeconomic conditions owing to political processes and cultural and historic occupation of land. Ports have several structures that are potential emitters of pollutants such as large ship engines, diesel trucks, and trains. Owing to the considerable costs of implementing direct monitoring networks, alternatives like biomonitoring are an interesting approach to evaluate the environmental status of a particular area using living organisms or their parts such as bark, even though the use of bark as a biomonitor has several problems such as difficulties in determining the exposure period and its correlation with human exposure. Therefore, the use of a complementary mathematical logic is necessary. This study describes a methodological approach to evaluate the environmental risk from air pollution integrating data on environmental pollutants from tree bark using Fuzzy logic, based in the port city of Paranagua in the state of Parana in Brazil, and validated using income indicators. The results indicate that the risk distribution patterns have an inverse relationship with the income indicator, i.e., higher risk levels indicate lower income levels and vice versa. It was concluded that the system was able to identify the distribution of risk and that there is a context of environmental injustice in the region, where the environmental risk related to air pollution is inversely proportional to income levels. This type of information provides a decision making tool for environmental risk analysis from air pollution and can be used in the definition of public policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Inadequate knowledge of baseline conditions challenges ability for monitoring programs to detect pollution in rivers, especially where there are natural sources of contaminants. Here, we use paleolimnological data from a flood-prone lake ("SD2", informal name) in the Slave River Delta (SRD, Canada), similar to 500 km downstream of the Alberta oil sands development and the bitumen-rich McMurray Formation to identify baseline concentrations and proportions of "river-transported bitumen-associated indicator polycyclic aromatic compounds" (indicator PACs; Hall et al. 2012) and processes responsible for their deposition. Results show that indicator PACs are deposited in SD2 by Slave "river floodwaters in concentrations that are 45 % lower than those in sediments of BPAD31compounds", a lake upstream in the Athabasca Delta that receives Athabasca River floodwaters. Lower concentrations at SD2 are likely a consequence of sediment retention upstream as well as dilution by sediment influx from the Peace River. In addition, relations with organic matter content reveal that flood events dilute concentrations of indicator PACs in SD2 because the lake receives high-energy floods and the lake sediments are predominantly inorganic. This contrasts with PAD31 where floodwaters increase indicator PAC concentrations in the lake sediments, and concentrations are diluted during low flood influence intervals due to increased deposition of lacustrine organic matter. Results also show no significant differences in concentrations and proportions of indicator PACs between pre-(1967) and post-(1980s and 1990s) oil sands development high flood influence intervals (t = 1.188, P = 0.279, d. f. = 6.136), signifying that they are delivered to the SRD by natural processes. Although we cannot assess potential changes in indicator PACs during the past decade, baseline concentrations and proportions can be used to enhance ongoing monitoring efforts.

AB  - The goal of this study was to gain an understanding of intra-and inter-specific variation in calcification rate, lipid content, symbiont density, and chlorophyll a of corals in the Florida Reef Tract to improve our insight of in-situ variation and resilience capacity in coral physiology. The Florida Keys are an excellent place to assess this question regarding resilience because coral cover has declined dramatically since the late 1970s, yet has remained relatively high on some inshore patch reefs. Coral lipid content has been shown to be an accurate predictor of resilience under stress, however much of the current lipid data in the literature comes from laboratory-based studies, and previous in-situ lipid work has been highly variable. The calcification rates of three species were monitored over a seven-month period at three sites and lipid content was quantified at two seasonal time points at each of the three sites. Montastraea cavernosa had the highest mean calcification rate (4.7 mg cm(-2) day-1) and lowest mean lipid content (1.6 mg cm(-2)) across sites and seasons. In contrast, Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides had lower mean calcification rates (2.8 mg cm(-2) day(-1) and 2.4 mg cm(-2) day-1, respectively) and higher mean lipid contents (3.5 mg cm(-2) and 2.3 mg cm(-2), respectively) across sites and seasons. Given the recent Endangered Species Act (ESA) listing of O. faveolata and the relative persistence of M. cavernosa and P. astreoides on a population-scale, this study suggests that the hypothesis that coral lipids are good indicators of resilience may be speciesspecific, or more complex and interrelated with other environmental factors than previously understood. Additionally, coral lipid storage under benign thermal conditions may differ from lipid storage before, during, and after thermal stress events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method provides for a comprehensive and transparent basis for performing sustainability assessments. Development of a relevant MCDA-method requires consideration of a number of key issues, e.g. (a) definition of assessment boundaries, (b) definition of performance scales, both temporal and spatial, (c) selection of relevant criteria (indicators) that facilitate a comprehensive sustainability assessment while avoiding double-counting of effects, and (d) handling of uncertainties. Adding to the complexity is the typically wide variety of inputs, including quantifications based on existing data, expert judgements, and opinions expressed in interviews. The SCORE (Sustainable Choice Of REmediation) MCDA-method was developed to provide a transparent assessment of the sustainability of possible remediation alternatives for contaminated sites relative to a reference alternative, considering key criteria in the economic, environmental, and social sustainability domains. The criteria were identified based on literature studies, interviews and focus-group meetings. SCORE combines a linear additive model to rank the alternatives with a non-compensatory approach to identify alternatives regarded as non-sustainable. The key strengths of the SCORE method are as follows: a framework that at its core is designed to be flexible and transparent; the possibility to integrate both quantitative and qualitative estimations on criteria; its ability, unlike other sustainability assessment tools used in industry and academia, to allow for the alteration of boundary conditions where necessary; the inclusion of a full uncertainty analysis of the results, using Monte Carlo simulation; and a structure that allows preferences and opinions of involved stakeholders to be openly integrated into the analysis. A major insight from practical application of SCORE is that its most important contribution may be that it initiates a process where criteria otherwise likely ignored are addressed and openly discussed between stakeholders.

AB  - AimIn this study we identified large-scale variation in tree species composition across tropical African forests and determined the underlying environmental and historical factors.
   LocationTropical forests from Senegal to Mozambique.
   MethodsDistribution data were gathered for 1175 tree species in 455 sample sites scattered across tropical Africa, including all types of tropical forests (wet, moist, dry, and lowland to moderate elevation montane forests). The value of elevation and 19 climatic variables extracted from the BIOCLIM data set were assigned to each sample site. We determined the variation in species composition using correspondence analysis and identified the environmental correlates. We defined floristic clusters according to species composition and identified the characteristic species using indicator analysis.
   ResultsWe identified a major floristic discontinuity located at the Albertine rift that separated the dry, moist and wet forests of West and Central Africa (the entire Guineo-Congolian Region) from the upland and coastal forests of East Africa. Except for the Albertine Rift, we found no evidence to support the other proposed floristic discontinuities (Dahomey Gap etc.). We detected two main environmental gradients across tropical African forests. The rainfall gradient was strongly correlated with the variation in tree species composition in West and Central Africa. The elevation/temperature gradient highlighted the major floristic differences within East Africa and between East Africa and the Guineo-Congolian Region, the latter being most probably due to the geological disruption and associated climatic history of the East African uplift.
   Main conclusionsWe found floristic evidence for three main biogeographical regions across the tropical African forests, and described six floristic clusters with particular environmental conditions within these regions: Coastal and Upland for East Africa, Dry and Wet-Moist for West Africa, and Moist and Wet for Central Africa.

AB  - In the context of climate change characterized by rising temperature and more extreme precipitation regimes, drought is one of the most relevant natural disasters. This paper presents maps of global drought frequency, duration, and severity for the periods 1951-1970, 1971-1990, and 1991-2010, to give an overview of the respective drought hot spots. Drought frequency is defined as the number of drought events occurred, drought duration as the number of months in drought conditions, and drought severity as the sum of the integral area below zero of each event. Because drought is mainly driven by rainfall deficits, we chose the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as the base indicator to derive drought-related quantities. SPI-12 has been calculated on a monthly basis using a Gamma distribution fitted to a 60-year baseline period (1951-2010). Global grids (0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees) of the Full Data Reanalysis Version 6.0 dataset provided by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) have been used as precipitation data input. The regions most exposed to prolonged and severe droughts during 1951-1970 were the Central United States, the Argentinian Pampas, Russia, and Central Australia; during 1971-1990 they were Southern Chile, the Sahel, and Siberia; during 1991-2010 they were the Amazon Forest, the Congo River Basin, Mongolia, North Eastern China, and Borneo. A linear trend analysis between 1951 and 2010 shows a small global increase in each drought component, but drought frequency decreased in the Northern Hemisphere. The increase in drought frequency, duration, and severity is found to be significant in Africa, Eastern Asia, Mediterranean region, and Southern Australia, while the Americas and Russia show a decrease in each drought component.

AB  - Portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) technology can be implemented in soil geochemical analysis for faster and more efficient testing of trace metals in soils. The level of soil phosphorus (P) is one of the major indicators of human activities related to food distribution, preparation, and waste disposal. Unfortunately, the low x-ray energy level of P and other light elements requires extensive sample preparation that may preclude pXRF as a field laboratory tool for P measurement. The high silicon content of soil causes serious interference in P analysis, yielding data of little value in midden prospection or activity area analysis. The Mehlich II or the Olsen bicarbonate extraction of soil samples can be conducted in a field laboratory providing excellent quality data. For pXRF analysis of soil samples in the field laboratory, it is recommended that soils are air-dry, and aggregates crushed, sieved (<2 mm), and mixed for better accuracy and reproducibility. Gridded soil samples from the central plaza of Telchaquillo, a contemporary village in Yucatan, were analyzed by the Mehlich II method for P and by pXRF and DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) chelate extraction for trace metal concentrations. Areas of high P concentration were associated with an eatery and with two butchering posts. High DTPA extractable iron, copper, zinc, and manganese concentrations near the butchering posts were likely associated with the remnants of blood from butchered animals. The distributions and locations of elevated Fe concentrations were different for DTPA extractable Fe and pXRF total Fe and can be attributed to the different forms and solubility of crystalline iron in soil.

AB  - Urbanization almost inevitably results in changes to stream morphology. Understanding the mechanisms for such impacts is a prerequisite to minimizing stream degradation and achieving restoration goals. However, investigations of urban-induced changes to stream morphology typically use indicators of watershed urbanization that may not adequately represent degrading mechanisms and commonly focus on geomorphic attributes such as channel dimensions that may be of little significance to the ecological goals for restoration. We address these shortcomings by testing if a measure characterizing urban stormwater drainage system connections to streams (effective imperviousness, El) is a better predictor of change to ecologically relevant geomorphic attributes than a more general measure of urban density (total imperviousness, TI). We test this for 17 sites in independent watersheds across a gradient of urbanization. We found that El was a better predictor of all geomorphic variables tested than was TI. Bank instability was positively correlated with El, while width/depth (a measure of channel incision), bedload sediment depth, and frequency of bars, benches, and large wood were negatively correlated. Large changes in all geomorphic variables were detected at very low levels of El (<2-3%). Excess urban stormwater runoff, as represented by El, drives geomorphic change in urban streams, highlighting the dominant role of the stormwater drainage system in efficiently transferring stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces to the stream, as found for ecological indicators. It is likely that geomorphic condition of streams in urbanizing watersheds, particularly those attributes of ecological relevance, can only be maintained if excess urban stormwater flows are kept out of streams through retention and harvesting. The extent to which El can be reduced within urban and urbanizing watersheds, through techniques such as distributed stormwater harvesting and infiltration, and the components of the hydrologic regime to be addressed, requires further investigation.

AB  - Much of the remaining native rangelands in Canada are topographically complex. The flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in rangelands of hummocky terrain has not been adequately studied, leaving a gap in the national GHG sources and sinks budget. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of topography and mowing on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux and to correlate these fluxes to abiotic and biotic factors. GHG flux was studied on six landform elements, including north-facing concave and, south-facing concave and convex, upland and depressions, in the Northern Mixedgrass Prairie of Canada over 2 years with mowing being imposed in early spring. GHG fluxes showed strong temporal variations, ranging from 3.0 to 40.4 kg CO2-C ha(-1) d(-1), 0.1 to 2.6 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1), and -0.25 to -0.01 g CH4-C ha(-1) d(-1). GHG fluxes responded to changes in soil water and soil temperature across the landscape. The largest production of CO2 was recorded in depression mainly due to its more favourable soil water conditions. Mowing enhanced CO2 flux more than CH4 and N2O fluxes. Dominant plant species varied among the six landform elements, but using plant community type as the direct indicator for GHG emissions in grasslands may not always be reliable when precipitation is low. The net emissions of GHGs from Saskatchewan rangeland was relatively low, but the potential to increase emissions through changes in land management could be high. Our results suggest that in the Mixedgrass Prairie, best management practices for maintaining grassland health such as moderate grazing may also reduce GHG emissions.

AB  - European eel (Anguilla anguilla) recruitment is declining dramatically since the 1980s. Causes for this decline are explained by a combination of environmental changes basically affecting oceanic larval stages and a variety of anthropogenic impacts during the continental phase. Today, evidence is growing that poor silver eel quality has a major impact on reproductive success, implying that habitat quality plays a key role in stock decline. Since eels are frequently moving through a variety of different habitats during their life cycle, a better understanding of the implications of individual diadromous behaviour and habitat choice on spawner quality are crucial for management considerations for a stock recovery. The present study tested whether individual migratory behaviour and habitat choice of European eels affect spawner quality. Therefore, the migratory behaviour of 287 European eels from marine, brackish and freshwater stations in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and from Northern German inland. waters was examined by otolith strontium/calcium analysis. All individuals were classified either as freshwater residents, coastal residents, downstream shifters, upstream shifters or interhabitat shifters. As indicators for eel quality, muscle fat content, infection with the introduced swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides crassus and body length at onset of spawning migration were assessed. Results indicate that individuals that exclusively inhabited freshwaters had significantly lower muscle fat contents and were more seriously infected with A. crassus than eels that never entered freshwaters. Since high fat contents are considered as prerequisites for a successful transoceanic spawning migration and high A. crassus loads have a negative impact on condition, this study outlines the importance of brackish waters as eel habitats in temperate latitudes. Furthermore, it questions the net benefit of stocking programs for the European eel population, since they include the translocation of eels from coastal waters into freshwaters.

AB  - An overview of a simulation referred to as the "Last Millennium" (LM) simulation of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), is presented. The CCSM4 LM simulation reproduces many large-scale climate patterns suggested by historical and proxy-data records, with Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) surface temperatures cooling to the early 1800s Common Era by similar to 0.5 degrees C (NH) and similar to 0.3 degrees C (SH), followed by warming to the present. High latitudes of both hemispheres show polar amplification of the cooling from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) associated with sea ice increases. The LM simulation does not reproduce La Nina-like cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean during the MCA relative to the LIA, as has been suggested by proxy reconstructions. Still, dry medieval conditions over the southwestern and central United States are simulated in agreement with proxy indicators for these regions. Strong global cooling is associated with large volcanic eruptions, with indications of multidecadal colder climate in response to larger eruptions. The CCSM4's response to large volcanic eruptions captures some reconstructed patterns of temperature changes over Europe and North America, but not those of precipitation in the Asian monsoon region. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) has higher variance at centennial periods in the LM simulation compared to the 1850 nontransient run, suggesting a long-term Atlantic Ocean response to natural forcings. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability modes show little or no change. CCSM4 does not simulate a persistent positive NAO or a prolonged period of negative PDO during the MCA, as suggested by some proxy reconstructions.

AB  - An early warning system can be an effective measure to reduce the damage caused by landslides by facilitating the timely evacuation of residents from a landslide-prone area. Early detection of landslide triggering across a broad range of natural terrain types can be accomplished by monitoring rainfall and the physical property changes of soils in real time or near-real time. This study involved the installation of a real-time monitoring system to observe physical property changes in soils in a valley during rainfall events. This monitoring included the measurement of volumetric water content, which was compared with the results of laboratory flume tests to identify landslide indicators in the soils. The response of volumetric water content to rainfall events is more immediate than that of pore-water pressure, and volumetric water content retains its maximum value for some time before slope failure. Therefore, an alternative method for landslide monitoring can be based on the observation of volumetric water content and its changes over time at shallow soil depths. Although no landslide occurred, the field monitoring results showed a directly proportional relationship between the effective cumulative rainfall and the gradient of volumetric water content per unit time (t/t (max)). This preliminary study thus related slope failure to the volumetric water content gradient as a function of rainfall. Laboratory results showed that a high amount of rainfall and a high gradient of volumetric water content could induce slope failure. Based on these results, it is possible to suggest a threshold value of the volumetric water content gradient demarcating the conditions for slope stability and slope failure. This threshold can thus serve as the basis of an early warning system for landslides considering both rainfall and soil properties.

AB  - In this work, the degradation of anionic and non-ionic surfactants in agricultural soil amended with sewage sludge is reported. The compounds analysed were: linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) with a 10-13 carbon alkylic chain, and nonylphenolic compounds (NPE), including nonylphenol (NP) and nonylphenol ethoxylates with one and two ethoxy groups (NP1EO and NP2EO). The degradation studies were carried out under winter (12.7 degrees C) and summer (22.4 degrees C) conditions in Andalusia region. The concentration of LAS was reduced to 2% of the initial concentration 100 day after sludge-application to the soil. The half-life time measured for LAS homologues were ranged between 4 and 14 days at 12.7 degrees C and between 4 and 7 days at 22.4 degrees C.
   With regard to NPE compounds, after 8 and 4 days from the beginning of the experiment at 12.7 and 22.4 degrees C, respectively, their concentration levels were increased to 6.5 and 13.5 mg/kg dm (dry matter) as consequence of the degradation of nonylphenol polyethoxylates. These concentration levels were reduced to 5% after 63 and 70 days for 12.7 degrees C and 22.4 degrees C, respectively. The half-life times measured for NPEs were from 8 to 16 days at 12.7 degrees C and from 8 to 18 days at 22.4 degrees C.
   Environmental risk assessment revealed that for LAS homologues no environment risk could be expected after 7 and 8 days of sludge application to the soil for 22.4 and 12.7 degrees C, respectively; however, potential toxic effects could be observed for the nonylphenolic compounds during the first 56 days after sludge application to the soil.

AB  - The salinity of water and soil decreases the growth and yield of agricultural products. Salinity affects many physiological and morphological processes of plant by influencing soil solution osmotic potential and ion absorption and accumulation of minerals. To evaluate the effect of salinity on some physiological and morphological characteristics of the medicinal plant of Echium amoenum, an experiment was carried out with completely random design in four replications. In this study, the effect of different levels of salinity, including control (non-saline water), 3, 6, 9 and 12 dS m(-1) from natural saline water was examined on root length, leaf area, dry weight of roots and shoots, also on the amount of absorption of salts Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+ and the ratio of Na+/K+ and Ca2+/Na+ in root and shoot of plants and proline and total soluble sugars of leaf in the vegetative growth stage in the greenhouses. Results indicated that the application of saline water reduces significantly all morphological traits under study. Also, as the salinity increased, the density of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and the ratio of Na+/K+ and Ca2+/Na+ in root and shoot of E. amoenum declined. In contrast, by increasing salinity, Na+ and Cl- concentration in roots and shoots significantly increased. As the salinity increased, proline concentration and leaf total soluble sugars also increased significantly compared with the control. The results showed that the accumulation of proline and soluble sugars are good indicators of salinity tolerance. Results also suggest that the plant resists against salinity through osmotic adjustment and ion absorption and sharing within its cells. This process is essential for the survival of plants in saline conditions.

AB  - Subsistence rain fed agriculture underpins rural livelihoods in the Sub Saharan Africa. The overdependence on rainfall suggests the need for more reliable climate and weather forecasts to guide farm level decision making. Traditionally, African farmers have used indigenous knowledge (IK) to understand weather and climate patterns and make decisions about crops and farming practices. However, increased rainfall variability in recent years associated with climate change has reduced their confidence in indigenous knowledge, hence reducing their adaptive capacity and increasing their vulnerability to climate change. To address this problem, researchers are advocating the integration of indigenous knowledge into scientific climate forecasts at the local level, where it can be used to enhance the resilience of communities vulnerable to climate change. A study was therefore conducted to establish commonly used IK indicators in weather and climate forecasting and people's perceptions of climate change and variability in Nessa Village, Southern Malawi. We further compared the people's perceptions on climate change and variability with empirical evidence from a nearby weather station during 1971-2003 and the major constraints that the people face to fully utilise conventional weather and climate forecasts. Our results show various forms of traditional indicators that have been used to predict weather and climate for generations. These include certain patterns and behaviour of flora and fauna as well as environmental conditions. We further established that the peoples documentation of major climatic events over the years in the area agreed with the empirical evidence from the temperature and rainfall data. Overall, rainfall in the area has reduced since 1971 with increasing temperatures. The people were however of the view that current scientific weather and climate predictions in Malawi were not that useful at village level because they do not incorporate IK. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We studied the effect of salinity on some life-cycle parameters in the collembolan Folsomia candida, the enchytraeid Enchytraeus doerjesi, and two earthworm species, Eisenia fetida and Aporrectodea caliginosa, using natural saline soil from Robertson, Western Cape, South Africa. Specimens of the four species were exposed to soils along a gradient of salinity with electrical conductivity (EC) ranging from 0.08 to 1.62 dS m(-1), under controlled laboratory conditions for 28 days. The results showed that although survival of E. doerjesi and F candida was not significantly affected in this salinity range, juvenile production was significantly affected at 1.03 dS m(-1) and higher. For E. doerjesi, absolute cessation of reproduction occurred at 1.31 dS m(-1) white for F candida, it occurred at a higher EC of 1.62 dS m(-1). For E. fetida and A. caliginosa, survival was significantly affected at and above 0.92 and 1.31 dS m(-1), respectively, white total mortality occurred at 1.31 and 1.62 dS m(-1), respectively. Both earthworm species only produced cocoons in control soils. Growth of A. caliginosa was significantly affected at a tower EC (0.52 dS m(-1)) than that which affected the growth of E. fetida (1.03 dS m(-1)). Thus, the sensitivity of these soil organisms to saline stress, based on survivat and reproduction data increased in the order: F candida <E. doerjesi <A. caliginosa <E. fetida. Further investigation and of more taxa, may support the findings of this study that suggest that earthworms could be useful. as indicators of saline disturbance than other taxa.

AB  - A method of rehabilitating coal mine soils was studied under the conditions of a semi-arid climate, lack of topsoil but availability of farm by-products in NE Spain. The objectives of the research were to assess a new method in order to achieve a suitable substrate for the establishment of native vegetation, to evaluate environmental impacts associated with the reclamation process, and to determine the time necessary to integrate the treated area into the surrounding environment. Eight plots (10 x 35 m(2)) were established in September 1997. Substrate combinations of two types of mine spoil (coal dust and coarse-sized material), two levels of pig slurry (39 and 94 Mg ha(-1)dry-wt), and cereal straw (0 and 15 Mg ha(-1)) were applied. Monitoring of select physical and chemical soil properties and vegetation characteristics was performed from 1997 until 2005. The bulk density and the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured did not limit plant development and water availability. Initial substrate salinity (1.37 S m(-1)) decreased with time and in the long term did not limit plant colonization to salinity-adapted species. Initial nitrate concentration was 298 mg kg(-1), but was reduced significantly to acceptable values in 3 years (55 mg kg(-1)) and the measured pH (7.6) was maintained at the level of initial spoil values. Vegetation cover reached up to 90%. In the treated area, spontaneous vegetation cover (15 to 70%) colonized the nonsown areas widely. In the medium term, vegetation cover tended to be higher in plots with a thicker layer of coal dust material and the higher slurry rate. Soil rehabilitation and environmental reintegration, taking into account soil and vegetation indicators, was possible in the studied area with low cost inputs using residual materials from mining activities and animal husbandry by-products.

AB  - A principal contributor to soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, agricultural activities have a major influence on the environmental quality of a watershed. Impact of agricultural activities on the quality of water resources can be minimized by implementing suitable agriculture land-use types. Currently, land uses are designed (location, type, and operational schedule) based on field study results, and do not involve a science-based approach to ensure their efficiency under particular regional, climatic, geological, and economical conditions. At present, there is a real need for new methodologies that can optimize the selection, design, and operation of agricultural land uses at the watershed scale by taking into account environmental, technical, and economical considerations, based on realistic simulations of watershed response. In this respect, the present study proposes a new approach, which integrates computational modeling of watershed processes, fluvial processes in the drainage network, and modern heuristic optimization techniques to design cost effective land-use plans. The watershed model AnnAGNPS and the channel network model CCHE1D are linked together to simulate the sediment and pollutant transport processes. Based on the computational results, a multi-objective function is set up to minimize soil losses, nutrient yields, and total associated costs, while the production profits from agriculture are maximized. The selected iterative optimization algorithm uses adaptive Tabu Search heuristic to flip (switching from one alternative to another) land-change variables. USDA's Goodwin Creek experimental watershed, located in Northern Mississippi, is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. The results show that the optimized land-use design with BMPs using an integrated approach at the watershed level can provide efficient and cost-effective conservation of the environmental quality by taking into account both productivity and profitability.

AB  - Drawing on research from the interfirm relationship, marketing channels, operations management, and network theory literature and on the basis of qualitative depth interviews, the authors identify a new phenomenon they call "supply chain contagion." Supply chain contagion is the propagation of interfirm behaviors from one dyadic relationship to an adjacent dyadic relationship within the supply chain. Contagion can occur inadvertently and with or without the knowledge of the affected parties. Using institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model that predicts the conditions under which contagion is likely to occur. Although contagion may take the form of any number of interfirm behaviors, operationally, the authors focus on whether the downstream influence strategies that manufacturers use with their dealers are imitated by these same dealers with end customers. They conduct conclusive research using a sample of 151 vertically linked manufacturer-dealer-customer supply chain triads and explain a large variance (R-2 =.30) in the use of downstream influence strategies in terms of supply chain contagion. Given extensive prior empirical support for alternative antecedents to influence strategy usage, the explanatory power of supply chain contagion is impressive and suggests that how intermediaries treat end customers is explained, to a large degree, as the intermediaries simply imitating how their suppliers treated them. In addition to the identification of a new theoretical concept, the study provides empirical support for the effects of both macro- and microinstitutional factors on interfirm behavior. Specific factors that are positively related to the level of manifest contagion are environmental uncertainty and the perceived similarity and frequency of contact between boundary personnel; dependence asymmetry has a negative effect on manifest contagion. Managers and boundary-spanning personnel who are aware of supply chain contagion effects should be better able to influence strategically the behavior of channel. partners and may be better inoculated against their own unintended imitation of other organizations within their supply chain.

AB  - One of the most serious problems caused by eutrophication of shallow lakes is the disappearance of submerged macrophytes and the switch to a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. The reduction of external nutrient loads often does not result in a change back to the macrophyte-dominated state because stabilising mechanisms that cause resilience may delay a response. Additional internal lake restoration measures may therefore be needed to decrease the concentration of total phosphorus and increase water clarity. The re-establishment of submerged macrophytes required for a long-term stability of clear water conditions, however, may still fail, or mass developments of tall-growing species may cause nuisance for recreational use. Both cases are often not taken into account when restoration measures are planned in Germany, and existing schemes to reduce eutrophication consider the topic inadequately. Here we develop a step-by-step guideline to assess the chances of submerged macrophyte re-establishment in shallow lakes. We reviewed and rated the existing literature and case studies with special regard on (1) the impact of different internal lake restoration methods on the development of submerged macrophytes, (2) methods for the assessment of natural re-establishment, (3) requirements and methods for artificial support of submerged macrophyte development and (4) management options of macrophyte species diversity and abundance in Germany. This guideline is intended to help lake managers aiming to restore shallow lakes in Germany to critically asses and predict the potential development of submerged vegetation, taking into account the complex factors and interrelations that determine their occurrence. abundance and diversity.

AB  - Cross-compliance means to make the reception of public support payments contingent upon compliance with environmental and other requirements. After having introduced first options for cross-compliance in the "Agenda 2000", the EU prescribes more than ever the framework for definition and control of standards with the planned compulsory introduction of cross-compliance, based on the reforms of June 2003. The requirements include compliance with certain directives and regulations concerning environment, animal welfare and public, animal and plant health and with standards for soil conservation, maintenance of land and protection of landscape features and permanent pasture. Compliance with the relevant mandatory standards is reinforced by more systematic controls and reductions of premia, these sanctions not only depending on the severity of a breach but as well on the height of the direct payments. Farms are affected by possible sanctions on the basis of cross-compliance to a different extent. As to be able to target relevant environmental problems, risk-analysis for selection of farms to be controlled is inevitable. Sanctions have to take into account to a great extent the actual environmental impacts, especially if indirect indicators are used for control.
   Standards that go beyond legislation might compete with requirements for agri-environmental measures, which can be an incentive to define low standards, thus not using the regulatory opportunities of cross-compliance. Further on, cross-compliance still doesn't ensure sufficient protection of permanent pasture. The higher control rates of 5% in connection with the control of "good farming practice" as a condition for support payments can create problems of acceptance of voluntary measures as the affected farms run a higher risk of being sanctioned through cross-compliance, as well. Besides rising control frequency and sanctions, the use of co-operative elements, such as technical assistance and audits, for the implementation of environmental standards should be promoted.

AB  - The cycle of events and natural processes that affect the geotechnical properties of clay sediments in a depositional basin (the 'Geotechnical Cycle') includes: deposition, consolidation/compaction, diagenesis, tectonic disturbance, weathering and erosion. Some of these processes can occur in parallel; their combined effects control the mechanical behaviour of clay sediments. Processes involved in the Geotechnical Cycle are reviewed, using case studies chosen where possible from the London Basin; examples from other depositional basins emphasize the many common elements that control the behaviour of clay sediments.
   A simple soil behaviour model (based on the 'sensitivity framework') is described that combines the consolidation (geological compaction) and strength behaviour of natural clays, both during loading (deposition) and unloading (erosion). This model enables the mechanical consequences of soil structure (including the effects of diagenesis) to be quantified. Its merits are that it describes real soils, thus aiding ground characterization, and also allows an assessment of such factors as sample disturbance, while providing a realistic and straightforward geotechnical framework.
   The effects of tectonic events on the geotechnical behaviour of clays are reviewed in the particular context of flexural slip, and its influence on stability problems.
   Uplift, then erosion, results in basin sediments becoming overconsolidated; the history of the London Basin is used to emphasize both what is known and, in particular what is not known, of these phases of basin history. Following erosion, weathering processes further modify the mechanical properties of clays. The most obvious indicator of weathering is oxidation, with its associated colour changes. The depth of oxidation in the London Clay Formation is reviewed, and shown to relate to topographic position and former groundwater conditions. Finally, the sensitivity framework is used to examine the effects of weathering on the mechanical behaviour of clay, particularly the reduction of yield stress in one-dimensional compression.

AB  - Abalone have been exploited commercially at La Natividad Island Baja California since about 1956. The fishery for Haliolis sorenseni collapsed after about 7 years, and those for Haliotis corrugata and Haliotis fulgens in 1984. Subsequently, the fishery recovered somewhat before the recent decline in 1994 to 1997. Egg-per-recruit (EPR) analyses for the two major species were carried out with information on growth rate, fishing mortality rate, and size at sexual maturity and other data obtained mostly during the 1990s. Egg production conserved before the 1984 collapse was probably somewhat low for H. corrugata at similar to 30-40% of the maximum possible in unfished conditions, and certainly low for H. fulgens at similar to 20%. After the collapse with better control of the fishery, the egg production improved slightly for H. corrugata to similar to 30-50%, and for H. fulgens to similar to 25-40%, but from 1995 has declined again as fishing mortality increased. The periodic El Ninos cause elevated sea temperatures and loss of Macrocystis in the region. The total abalone catch from 1965 to 1996 was correlated with mean sea surface temperature anomalies with a lag of 8 years, which is the average period from larval settlement until recruitment into the fishery. This implies that sea temperature anomalies have a positive effect on recruitment. On the other hand, there is also slight evidence of recruitment failure during severe El Ninos. Although environmental variables and recruitment overfishing can each cause reductions in catch, the presence of both makes a decline practically inevitable. Quota managed fisheries must take into account environmental effects on recruitment if they wish to avert declines.

AB  - The concept of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) enables a novel approach to crop protection, and particular pathogenesis-related proteins, i.e. an acidic chitinase, have been classified as markers of the SAR response. Basic class I (VCHIT1b) and a class III (VCH3) chitinase cDNAs were cloned from cultured Vitis vinifera L. cv Pinot Noir cells and used to probe the induction response of grapevine cells to salicylic acid or yeast elicitor. Furthermore, the cells were treated with the commercial SAR activators 2,6-dichloroiso-nicotinic acid or benzo(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester. Elicitor or salicylic acid induced both VCHIT1b and VCH3 transcript abundances, whereas 2,6-dichloroiso-nicotinic acid or benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester enhanced exclusively the expression of VCH3. To assess the systemic sensation of chitinase expression, single leaves of Vitis vinifera L. cv Pinot Noir or Vitis rupestris plants were inoculated with Plasmopara viticola spore suspensions, and the VCH3 and VCHIT1b mRNA amounts in the infected versus the adjacent, healthy leaf were monitored. Two VCH3 mRNA maxima were observed 2 and 6 d postinoculation in the infected, susceptible V. vinifera tissue, whereas in the healthy leaf the transcript increased from low levels d 2 postinoculation to prominent levels d 6 to 8 postinoculation. The level of VCH3 mRNA increased also over 4 d in the inoculated, resistant V. rupestris tissue. However, necrotic spots rapidly limited the infection, and the VCH3 transcript was undetectable in the upper-stage, healthy leaf. The expression of VCHIT1b remained negligible under either experimental condition. Overall, the results suggest that the selective expression of VCH3 might be a reliable indicator of the SAR response in V. vinifera L.

AB  - In nature, plants are constantly challenged by an array of drought episodes, which critically affect the distribution of the plants. The drought episodes might occur recurrently, so the plants endure drought by adjusting and shifting their metabolisms. The impacts of subjecting plants to drought stress have been widely investigated, but reports on how reiterated drought stress affects the plants are limited. The present study was designed to investigate the response of lavender, a reputed medicinal and aromatic plant, against single drought, recovery and reiterated drought stress at greenhouse conditions. In this regard, the experimental design was based on three cycles of 11 days of drought by withholding water, followed by subsequent periods of 6 days of recovery, and then double-stressed and single-stressed periods. As expected, the present findings revealed that single stress decreased the fresh and dry weights of the leaf, stem and root. Reiterated drought stress caused critical reductions in the fresh weight of the leaf, stem and root, while the dry weight of stem and root were not significantly affected. Of the estimated traits, only the dry weight of leaf increased with reiterated drought stress. The mineral status of the leaves was adversely affected with single stress, but the effects of recovery and reiterated stress were not in accordance with the improvement in water contents of the leaf and soil. Regarding essential oil compounds, eucalyptol, camphor and endo-borneol were predominant. Single and reiterated drought stress increased camphor percentage, while recovery and full irrigation decreased the percentage. Endo-borneol was decreased under single stress, but reiterated stress increased the percentage of the compound. Considering the phenolic acids, stressed and non-stressed groups were well discriminated and hence, phenolic acids might be useful as good indicators of the stress response in lavender.

AB  - Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on dried coffee husk (cascara) from Coffea arabica L. as a novel food (NF) pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283. The NF comprises the skin (exocarp), pulp (mesocarp), mucilage (pectin), parchment (endocarp) and a portion of the silver skin of the coffee fruit, and consists mainly of digestible carbohydrates, dietary fibre and water. The Panel considers that there are no safety concerns regarding the stability of the NF if the NF complies with the proposed specification limits during its entire shelf-life. The NF as such will not be consumed, instead, beverages produced with the infusion of the NF in water will be available to consumers. Considering an 100% extraction of caffeine from the NF to the beverage, the specification limit set for caffeine and the proposed use levels, the maximum concentration of caffeine in infusions produced using the NF could be up to 600 mg/L of drink, a concentration comparable to those in coffee beverages. The Panel notes that consumption of beverages produced using the NF will add significantly to the total dietary intake of caffeine of the general population. The consumption of beverages containing caffeine is not recommended for children, pregnant or breast-feeding women if the caffeine content exceeds 150 mg/L. Taking into account the nature of the NF, the history of use of the NF as food and the proposed uses and use levels, the Panel considers that no toxicological studies are required on the NF. The risk of allergic reactions to the NF is considered low. The Panel concludes that the NF, dried husk of the fruit of Coffea arabica L., is safe under the proposed conditions of use.

AB  - While interactions between groundwater and lake-water influence water chemistry, water balance, aquatic organisms, biochemical cycles and contamination levels, they remain a poorly studied component of lake hydrology. Identifying the controls of groundwater and lake-water interactions at the landscape level and classifying lakes into categories based on their degree of interaction with the groundwater can provide insights into a lake's sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental stressors. Such information can also provide baseline conditions for comparison to future changes that are important for water management and conservation. To this end, water chemistry and water isotopic composition were investigated in a set of 50 boreal lakes located at different elevations in an esker system near Timmins, Ontario. Analyses focused on stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen and specific conductance as indicators of the position of a lake with respect to the influence of groundwater. Both isotopic composition and specific conductance distinguished higher-elevation groundwater-recharge lakes from lower-elevation groundwater-discharge lakes. Groundwater-recharge lakes were high-elevation lakes characterized by enriched isotopic values and low values of specific conductance. In contrast, groundwater-discharge lakes were isotopically depleted and had higher values of specific conductance and occurred at lower elevations. An intermediate group of lakes was also defined (termed seepage lakes) and had intermediate isotopic and water-chemistry characteristics compared to recharge and discharge lakes. Differences in water geochemistry between field campaigns revealed that upland groundwater-recharge lakes showed evidence of evaporative drawdown, indicating sensitivity to short-term changes in climate, whereas the lower-elevation groundwater-discharge lakes showed little variation between seasonal samples and consequently would likely be affected only by hydroclimatological changes of greater duration and magnitude.

AB  - A trend towards energy diversification creates the expansion of small energy facilities that involve the production of solid fuel generator gas, rather than its direct combustion. The economic indicators of such facilities significantly depend on the efficiency of the generator gas purification. A promising sorbent for the purification of the generator gas is dolomite. When working as a sorbent, dolomite particles usually form a layer, through which the generator gas that is heating them is filtered. The objective of the study is to determine kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of dolomite, depending on the size of the sample. It was achieved using the thermogravimetric study of the thermal decomposition of single dolomite particles under static conditions at various temperatures. The most significant scientific result was that a dependence of the kinetic parameters of the gross reaction on the size of the initial particle is revealed, and a regression equation was proposed for its quantitative assessment. In addition, since the heat treatment process of the material was fairly long lasting, and the sizes of the particles allowed them to be referred to thermally thin bodies, it was inferred that the effect of a grain size on the reaction kinetics should be explained through the description of the evacuation process of gaseous reaction products from the material. The significance of the results of the study lies in the fact that a particle size must be considered as a factor that affects the progress of the technological process, which increases the reliability of the calculation of sorption-catalytic systems based on the use of dolomite.

AB  - Lakes are important organic carbon (OC) traps in the global carbon cycle. Recent studies have shown that the rate of OC burial in lacustrine sediments is influenced by factors such as climate change, land-use change, and eutrophication. In this study, we use multiproxy methods to reveal the mechanisms of lacustrine sediment OC burial in an alpine lake (Cuopu Lake), in southwest China. Combined with the dating from Pb-210(ex) and n-alkanes distribution analysis using the Positive Matrix Factorization model, the sedimentary history was divided into five stages: religious activity (the 1840s-1880s), earthquake (the 1880s-1910s), garrison (the 1910s-1960s), transition (the 1960s-1990s), and ecotourism (the 1990s-2010s). During the earthquake stage, OC burial was dominated by terrestrial solids (>40%) and co-precipitated algae (>30%), with a rapid deposition rate (N4mma-1) and lowOC concentration (<4 mg g(-1)). During the other stages, when the level of disturbance was relatively low, a change in nutrient conditions either promoted or inhibited plant growth, which influenced the type of buried OC. The contribution of OC derived from combustion sources varied from stage to stage. Severe anthropogenic disturbances have led to a significant increase in nutritional levels in the lake water, leading to an increase in the OC burial rate. Climate change, which leads to changes in temperature and rainfall, did not significantly influence OC burial, whereas nitrogen deposition (and associated ecological changes) was a significant determinant. When the general mechanism is dominant, the total nitrogen to inorganic phosphorus ratio is an effective indicator of OC burial due to its selective promotion of different plant types. In conclusion, our results suggest that lacustrine sediment OC burial is closely linked to physical and anthropogenic factors in Cuopu Lake, as well as similar montane lakes.

AB  - Fossil pollen records are well-established indicators of past vegetation changes. The prevalence of pollen across environmental settings including lakes, wetlands, and marine sediments, has made palynology one of the most ubiquitous and valuable tools for studying past environmental and climatic change globally for decades. A complementary research focus has been the development of statistical techniques to derive quantitative estimates of climatic conditions from pollen assemblages. This paper reviews the most commonly used statistical techniques and their rationale and seeks to provide a resource to facilitate their inclusion in more palaeoclimatic research. To this end, we first address the fundamental aspects of fossil pollen data that should be considered when undertaking pollen-based climate reconstructions. We then introduce the range of techniques currently available, the history of their development, and the situations in which they can be best employed. We review the literature on how to define robust calibration datasets, produce high-quality reconstructions, and evaluate climate reconstructions, and suggest methods and products that could be developed to facilitate accessibility and global usability. To continue to foster the development and inclusion of pollen climate reconstruction methods, we promote the development of reporting standards. When established, such standards should 1) enable broader application of climate reconstruction techniques, especially in regions where such methods are currently underused, and 2) enable the evaluation and reproduction of individual reconstructions, structuring them for the evolving open-science era, and optimising the use of fossil pollen data as a vital means for the study of past environmental and climatic variability. We also strongly encourage developers and users of palaeoclimate reconstruction methodologies to make associated programming code publicly available, which will further help disseminate these techniques to interested communities.

AB  - Arsenic (As) can be present naturally in groundwater from peanut fields, constituting a serious problem, as roots can accumulate and mobilize the metalloid to their edible parts. Understanding the redox changes in the legume exposed to As may help to detect potential risks to human health and recognize tolerance mechanisms. Thirty-days old peanut plants inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. strains (SEMIA6144 or C-145) were exposed to a realistic arsenate concentration, in order to unravel the redox response and characterize the oxidative stress indexes. Thus, root anatomy, reactive oxygen species detection by fluorescence microscopy and, ROS histochemical staining along with the NADPH oxidase activity were analyzed. Besides, photosynthetic pigments and damage to lipids and proteins were determined as oxidative stress indicators. Results showed that at 3 mu M As-V, the cross-section areas of peanut roots were augmented; NADPH oxidase activity was significantly increased and O(2)(center dot)and H2O2 accumulated in leaves and roots. Likewise, an increase in the lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls was also observed throughout the plant regardless the inoculated strain, while chlorophylls and carotenes were increased only in those inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. C-145. Interestingly, the oxidative burst, mainly induced by the NADPH oxidase activity, and the consequent oxidative stress was straindependent and organ-differential. Additionally, As modifies the root anatomy, acting as a possibly first defense mechanism against the metalloid entry. All these findings allowed us to conclude that the redox response of peanut is conditioned by the rhizobial strain, which contributes to the importance of effectively formulating bioinoculants for this crop.

AB  - Introduction Soybean is one of the most important crops in the world, an important source of isoflavones, and used to treat various chronic diseases. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), associated with multivariate experiments and green solvents, is increasingly used to develop comprehensive elution methods for quality control of plants and derivatives.
   Objective The work aims to establish a HPLC fingerprinting method for soybean seeds employing Green Chemistry Principles, a sustainable solvent with low toxicity, and a comprehensive experimental design that reduces the number of experiments.
   Materials and Methods The fingerprinting method was optimised through Design of Experiments by evaluating seven chromatographic variables: initial percentage of ethanol (X1), final percentage of ethanol (X2), temperature (X3), percentage of acetic acid in water (X4), flow rate (X5), run time (X6), and stationary phase (X7). The dependent variable was the number of peaks (n).
   Results An initial factorial design for screening purposes indicated that the most significant quantitative parameters to separate soybean metabolites were X1 and X3. The conditions were optimised by a Doehlert design, to obtain a HPLC-PAD (photodiode array detector) fingerprinting of the polar extract of soybean seeds with the markers identified by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The optimum fingerprinting method was determined as 5-55% of ethanol in 30 min, at 35 degrees C, and flow rate of 1 mL/min, by employing a phenyl-hexyl column (150 mm x 4.6 mm).
   Conclusion The developed green method enabled markers of soybean to be separated and identified and could be an eco-friendlier alternative for soybean quality control that covered seven Green Analytical Chemistry Principles.

AB  - Polysaccharide is the main active component ofDendrobium huoshanense, and it is also an important indicator to evaluate its quality. In this study, the polysaccharides and invertase components in the stems and leaves ofD. huoshanensewere studied to provide a theoretical basis for the full exploitation and utilization of its resources. Taking theD. huoshanensegrown in the wild, indoors and outdoors as a test material and choosing stems and roots ofD. huoshanensefor 1 year, 2 years and 3 years of growth, the polysaccharide content of different samples was determined, and the relative expression activity of sucrose metabolism-related genes in different samples was detected by qRT-PCR. Western blot was used to detect the changes of sucrose metabolism-related proteins in different samples. The results showed that the content of polysaccharide in the wildD. huoshanensewas the highest, the indoor growth was the second, the growth in the outdoor was the lowest, and the content of polysaccharide in the stem was significantly higher than that in the root. The expression ofD. huoshanenseneutral/alkaline invertase (DhNI),D. huoshanensesucrose synthase (DHSS) andD. huoshanensesucrose phosphate synthase (DHSPS) was the highest in wildD. huoshanense, followed by indoor growth, and the expression in stem was much higher than in root. Western blot results also indicated that DhNI, DHSS and DHSPS protein expression was highest in wild, followed by indoors. The stem is much higher than the root and is grown for 2 years in the same growing environment for more than 1 year and 3 years. The above results show that the nutritional value ofD. huoshanenseis related to the decomposition of sucrose and the accumulation of polysaccharides in plants. The experimental results provide a theoretical basis for better exploitation and utilization ofD. huoshanenseresources.

AB  - Objective: The authors examined the associations between work engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions among family medicine residency (FMR) managers.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 511 FMR manager members of the Association of Family Medicine Administration using purposive sampling. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, Job Satisfaction Survey, and Boshoff and Allen's 3-item scale were used to assess work engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions respectively. Descriptive statistics, Chi-Square tests, Pearson's correlations, 2-way contingency table analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to analyze the data.
   Results: The response rate was 70.6% (389/551). Work engagement was positively correlated with job satisfaction (r([387])=.513, p<.001) and negatively correlated with turnover intentions (r([368])=.580, p<.001). Turnover intention was negatively correlated with job satisfaction (r([387])=-.690, p<.001). Positive assessment of nature of work (t([364])=15.06, p<.001), fringe benefits (t[364]=6.89, p<.001), communication (t([364])=2.27, p<.05), and promotion (t([364])=2.48, p<.05) predicted work engagement. Work engagement (t([364])=-4.31, p<.001), pay (t([364])=-3.71, p<.001), supervision (t([364])=-3.51, P<.01), contingent rewards (t([364])=-2.39, p<.05), nature of work ( t([364])=-2.16, p<.05), and communication (t([364])=-2.15, p<.05) predicted turnover intentions.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate associations between work engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. When medical residency managers are emotionally and cognitively engaged at work, they tend to remain in the organization, validating and rewarding organizations that foster employee engagement. Further studies are needed to establish a causal relationship between work engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions and to investigate other potential factors that could contribute to enriching the job satisfaction of this crucial group of professionals.

AB  - It is widely agreed that competition is an important factor that regulates plant populations and shapes communities in agricultural landscapes. Many studies have suggested that crop and grassland competition can be used for cost-effective sustainable weed control. However, effective weed management requires a precise knowledge of the effects of agronomic practices and there is a lack of quantitative indicators to compare and predict the success of weed control by competition. Here, we studied weed abundance dynamics over a 12-year period in crop-grassland rotations (rotation treatments consisted of maize, wheat and barley crops, alternating with temporary grassland maintained for three or six years in the rotation and fertilised with similar to 30 or similar to 230 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of nitrogen). In addition to classical statistical analysis of the different rotation treatments, we modelled weed abundance as a function of the crop and grassland competition, expressed here by biomasses harvested in the preceding years. We show that weed abundance decreases over the years in grassland and subsequent crops only if the grassland receives sufficient nitrogen fertiliser. Our model had a greater explanatory power than the rotation treatments. This model estimates a critical biomass level above which weeds are suppressed in subsequent years, and below which they tend to thrive. This critical biomass level was 24.3 and 4.7 tonnes ha(-1) of dry matter for crops and grassland, respectively, highlighting the greater competitiveness of grasslands than of crops. Several clear differences between weed functional groups emerged. This new modelling approach directly links the interannual dynamics of weed populations to current and previous biomass production levels. This approach facilitates the development of environment-friendly weed management strategies and paves the way for comparisons of the competitiveness against weeds of crops and grassland under various pedoclimatic conditions and agronomic practices.

AB  - Post-fire recovery trajectories in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of the southwestern United States are increasingly shifting away from pre-burn vegetation communities. This study investigated whether phenological metrics derived from a multi-decade remotely sensed imagery time-series could differentiate among grass, evergreen shrub, deciduous, or conifer-dominated replacement pathways. We focused on 10 fires that burned ponderosa pine forests in Arizona and New Mexico, USA before the year 2000. A total of 29 sites with discernable post-fire recovery signals were selected within high-severity burn areas. At each site, we used Google Earth Engine to derive time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) signals from Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager data from 1984 to 2017. We aggregated values to 8- and 16-day intervals, fit Savitzky-Golay filters to each sequence, and extracted annual phenology metrics of amplitude, base value, peak value, and timing of peak value in the TIMESAT analysis package. Results showed that relative to post-fire conditions, pre-burn ponderosa pine forests exhibit significantly lower mean NDVI amplitude (0.14 vs. 0.21), higher mean base NDVI (0.47 vs. 0.22), higher mean peak NDVI (0.60 vs. 0.43), and later mean peak NDVI (day of year 277 vs. 237). Vegetation succession pathways exhibit distinct phenometric characteristics as early as year 5 (amplitude) and as late as year 20 (timing of peak NDVI). This study confirms the feasibility of leveraging phenology metrics derived from long-term imagery time-series to identify and monitor ecological outcomes. This information may be of benefit to land resource managers who seek indicators of future landscape compositions to inform management strategies.

AB  - Background: Diarrhea is a condition where individuals experience defecation as much as 3 or more per day with a soft consistency. Diarrhea in children is one of the environmentally-based diseases, and Manado is one of the cities faced with this environmental lead diarrhea problems. The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of socioeconomic factors on the occurrence of diarrhea among under-five children in the coastal area of Manado city. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted in August 2017. The numbers of respondents were a total of 120 mothers or caregivers with children under five who suffered from diarrhea in the coastal area of Manado. The respondent candidates were selected from the community health center's records of the diarrhea program and further selected by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The characteristics of mothers and family income were used as indicators of socioeconomic factors. All of the respondents were questioned about the occurrence of their child's diarrhea that they had experienced in the previous 6 months. A structured and well-designed questionnaire was used to obtain data, which were related to sociodemographic, economic, and diarrhea. Generalized structured component analysis in GeSCA software was applied for data analysis. Results: The findings of this study showed significant influence from socioeconomic factors on diarrhea incidence in under-five children (critical ratio = 2.74). In other words, as socioeconomic factors improve, the incidence of diarrhea decreases (B = -0.246). The characteristics of the mother are the indicator of the highest influence ( loading value = 0.846). Conclusions: This study identified that the socioeconomic factors are influencing the diarrhea incidence among children under five in the coastal area of Manado city. Thus, to minimize a childhood diarrheal disease, socioeconomic factors are considered when promoting health and community empowerment among the coastal communities of Manado city.

AB  - Aims Indicators that can provide information during the early stages of restoration are very useful for predicting restoration outcomes. We posed the following questions: Can savanna restoration outcomes be affected by the initial functional-group composition? Are there functional groups that, when established early, can prevent colonization by invasive grasses, trigger a successful restoration trajectory, and be used as early indicators of restoration success? Location Brazilian savanna (cerrado) in Central Brazil (14 degrees 07 ' 2.54 '' S, 47 degrees 38 ' 30.36 '' W). Methods We established 110 plots spanning a naturally occurring range of species composition in savanna areas that had been restored through direct seeding. We looked for different initial compositions of the following functional groups: perennial grasses, annual grasses, short-lived shrubs, and invasive grasses. We measured vegetation cover over two years and evaluated the effects of the initial functional composition on the successional trajectory of the plots. Results The initial dominant functional group determined the assembly trajectory. Short-lived and fast-growing species were replaced by perennial species, indicating a fast species turnover. Invasive grass cover remained stable over time, demonstrating that once they establish and dominate an area, an alternative stable state is achieved. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of introducing a mixture of functional groups when restoring savannas in severely disturbed areas. Fast-growing and short-lived species are important for quickly covering the ground, creating the conditions for the establishment of perennial grasses that naturally dominate the herbaceous layer of savannas. Trees are also characteristic of the savanna structure and must be introduced. Our results indicate that invasive grasses must be eliminated and/or constantly controlled before native species are introduced.

AB  - Part 1 of this paper has discussed the uncertainties arising from gaps in knowledge or limited understanding of the processes involved in different natural hazard areas. Such deficits may include uncertainties about frequencies, process representations, parameters, present and future boundary conditions, consequences and impacts, and the meaning of observations in evaluating simulation models. These are the epistemic uncertainties that can be difficult to constrain, especially in terms of event or scenario probabilities, even as elicited probabilities rationalized on the basis of expert judgements. This paper reviews the issues raised by trying to quantify the effects of epistemic uncertainties. Such scientific uncertainties might have significant influence on decisions made, say, for risk management, so it is important to examine the sensitivity of such decisions to different feasible sets of assumptions, to communicate the meaning of associated uncertainty estimates, and to provide an audit trail for the analysis. A conceptual framework for good practice in dealing with epistemic uncertainties is outlined and the implications of applying the principles to natural hazard assessments are discussed. Six stages are recognized, with recommendations at each stage as follows: (1) framing the analysis, preferably with input from potential users; (2) evaluating the available data for epistemic uncertainties, especially when they might lead to inconsistencies; (3) eliciting information on sources of uncertainty from experts; (4) defining a workflow that will give reliable and accurate results; (5) assessing robustness to uncertainty, including the impact on any decisions that are dependent on the analysis; and (6) communicating the findings and meaning of the analysis to potential users, stakeholders, and decision makers. Visualizations are helpful in conveying the nature of the uncertainty outputs, while recognizing that the deeper epistemic uncertainties might not be readily amenable to visualizations.

AB  - We propose a framework based on evolutionary principles and the theory of enactive cognition ("being by doing"), that addresses the foundation of key results and central questions of soundscape research. We hypothesize that the two main descriptors (measures of how people perceive the acoustic environment) of soundscape appraisal ('pleasantness' and 'eventfulness'), reflect evolutionarily old motivational and affective systems that promote survival through preferences for certain environments and avoidance of others. Survival is aimed at ending or avoiding existential threats and protecting viability in a deficient environment. On the other hand, flourishing occurs whenever survival is not an immediate concern and aims to improve the agent's viability and by co-creating ever better conditions for existence. As such, survival is experienced as unpleasant, and deals with immediate problems to be ended or avoided, while flourishing is enjoyable, and therefore to be aimed for and maintained. Therefore, the simplest, safety-relevant meaning attributable to soundscapes (audible safety) should be key to understanding soundscape appraisal. To strengthen this, we show that the auditory nervous system is intimately connected to the parts of our brains associated with arousal and emotions. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates that 'complexity' and 'affordance content' of the perceived environment are important underlying soundscape indicators (measures used to predict the value of a soundscape descriptor). Consideration of these indicators allows the same soundscape to be viewed from a second perspective; one driven more by meaning attribution characteristics than merely emotional appraisal. The synthesis of both perspectives of the same person-environment interaction thus consolidates the affective, informational, and even the activity related perspectives on soundscape appraisal. Furthermore, we hypothesize that our current habitats are not well matched to our, evolutionarily old, auditory warning systems, and that we consequently have difficulty establishing audible safety. This leads to more negative and aroused moods and emotions, with stress-related symptoms as a result.

AB  - The pattern of resource allocation to reproduction vs. vegetative growth is a core component of a plant's life-history strategy. Plants can modify their biomass allocation patterns to adapt to contrasting environments. Meristems can have alternative fates to commit to vegetative growth, reproduction, or remaining inactive (dormant or senescent/dead). However, knowledge about whether meristem fates can interpret adaptive changes in biomass allocation remains largely unknown. We measured aboveground plant biomass (a proxy of plant size) and meristem number of a dominant shrub Artemisia ordosica in three populations occupying different habitats in the Mu Us Desert of northern China. Size-dependent biomass allocation and meristem allocation among habitats were compared. The size-dependent biomass allocation and meristem allocation of A. ordosica strongly varied across habitats. There were significant positive linear relationships between meristem allocation and biomass allocation in all habitats, indicating that meristem allocation is an indicator of the estimated resource allocation to reproductive and vegetative organs in this species. Plasticity in meristem allocation was more likely caused by larger individuals having less active meristems due to environmental stress. Vegetative meristems (VM) were likely more vulnerable to environmental limitation than reproductive ones, resulting in the ratio of resource investment between vegetative and reproductive functions exhibiting plasticity in different habitats. A. ordosica invested a higher fraction of its resource to reproduction in the adverse habitat, while more resource to vegetative growth in the favorable habitat. A. ordosica adopts different resource allocation patterns to adapt to contrasting habitat conditions through altering its meristem fates. Our results suggest that the arid-adapted shrub A. ordosica deactivates more VM than reproductive ones to hedge against environmental stress, representing an important adaptive strategy. This information contributes to understand the life-history strategies of long-lived plants under stressful environments.

AB  - This study tests the association between opal phytoliths in dental calculus on modern, historic, and prehistoric specimens of Loxodonta africana (African savanna elephant) with their local and regional vegetation. The modern samples were obtained from dental remains from deceased animals at the Addo Elephant National Park (Eastern Cape Province) and the Pilanesberg National Park & Game Reserve (Northwest Province) in the Republic of South Africa. The historic and prehistoric specimens, presumed to be free-roaming elephants, were sampled from museum collections in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape Provinces. In addition to comparing phytolith assemblages in dental calculus with those of the main vegetation associations, this study assesses the phytolith assemblage differences between free-roaming and park elephants.
   The results show that: (1) the phytolith assemblages in dental calculus of park elephants show little variation among individual specimens and close resemblance to phytolith assemblages of soils inside their areas of confinement; (2) the free-roaming specimens have a much higher diversity of phytolith morphotypes than those in parks and reserves, exhibiting sometimes typical signatures of more than one biome; (3) free-roaming Cape elephants from fynbos areas have significant amounts of Restionaceae phytoliths, which suggests that grazing on restios in grass-poor fynbos types was important; (4) short saddles, typical of Chloridoideae grasses, are always the most abundant short-cell morphotypes in dental samples, even in areas where other grass subfamilies dominate, and (5) with some limitations, the study of phytoliths in herbivore dental calculus has a high, largely unexplored, potential in paleoecology and conservation ecology.

AB  - In the present study, Xenopus laevis embryos were exposed to a range of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentrations (0, 0.5, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 mg/L) for 96 h in laboratorial conditions to establish toxicity along with possible gene expression changes. Mortality and deformities were monitored daily and head-tail length was measured at the end of the assay as an indicator of growth. At 24 and 96 h post exposure (hpe), the mRNA expression levels of the genetic markers involved in general stress responses (hsp70, hsp47, crh-a and ucn1), oxidative stress (cat.2 and sod), lipid metabolism (ppard) and apoptosis (tp53 and box) were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Malformations were significantly higher in the embryos exposed to the highest PFOS concentration (41.8% to 56.4%) compared to controls (5.5%) at 48, 72 and 96 hpe. Growth inhibition was observed in the embryos exposed to PFOS concentrations >= 48 mg/L. At 24 hpe, a statistically significant up-regulation of genes hsp70, hsp47, ppard, tp53 and bax in relation to controls was found. Similar responses were found for genes hsp70, hsp47, crh-a, ucn1, sod and ppard at 96 hpe. Alterations in the mRNA expression levels indicated both a stress response to PFOS exposure during X. laevis embryo development, and alterations in the regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and differentiation. These molecular alterations were detected at an earlier exposure time or at lower concentrations than those producing developmental toxicity. Therefore, these sensitive warning signals could be used together with other biomarkers to supplement alternative methods (i.e. the frog embryo test) for developmental toxicity safety evaluations, and as tools in amphibian risk assessments for PFOS and its potential substitutes.

AB  - Estimates of the distribution, migration, and accumulation of trace elements using mosses as bioindicators have successfully been used in biomonitoring studies since at least the 1970s. Chemical analysis of moss samples is also an important tool for assessing concentrations of elements in analyzed material at a given time. To achieve satisfactory accuracy in environmental studies, the best sampling approach must be used. Methods for the estimation of uncertainty derived from analytical procedures are well recognized, but the errors generated as a result of sampling are very often overlooked. Sampling uncertainty can be managed by a judicious selection of the sampling method, the amount of samples collected, and by following appropriate type of sampling protocols. The sampling protocol generally contains information about location of sampling sites, time of sampling (e.g., season), the species collected, type of sample (single, sub-sample), and monitored parameters (e.g., climate, analyzed substances). Information about seasonal variability; topographic, climatic, edaphic, and hydrologic conditions (type and amount of precipitation, rosewind); age; and part of plant that was collected is often ignored. There is no precise information on how these factors affect the sampling step and overall uncertainty over what procedures must be followed to reduce errors derived from plant sampling. This information is necessary when long-range and comparative studies are conducted. In this paper, we review how individual factors, such as (i) type of sampling strategy, (ii) representative sampling, (iii) seasonal variability, and (iv) which part of the plant is collected, may influence the concentration of trace elements in moss tissues and the level of uncertainty associated with sampling. In addition, we also discuss plant sample preparation techniques and how this may cause an uncontrolled element loss.

AB  - Burnout is a state of emotional exhaustion, feelings of reduced personal accomplishment, and withdrawal from work thought to occur as a consequence of prolonged occupational stress. The condition is not included in the diagnostic classifications, but is considered likely to develop into depressive disorder in some cases. We examined the prospective association between burnout and antidepressant treatment, as an indicator of clinically significant mental disorder. We further investigated potential effect-modifiers of the association, to identify factors that may prevent this progression of burnout. We used questionnaire data from a three-wave study of Danish human service workers conducted during 1999-2005, linked with national register data on purchases of antidepressants (ATC: NO6A). We included 4788 observations from 2936 individuals (81% women) and analysed data by Aalens additive hazards modeling, examining the risk of entering antidepressant treatment in relation to the level of work-related burnout measured by the Copenhagen Burnout inventory. As effect-modifiers we examined both sociodemographic factors and a range of psychosocial work environment factors. The level of burnout predicted antidepressant treatment. This association was modified by sex (p < 0.01). In men, high vs. intermediate burnout was associated with a 5% increased risk of antidepressant treatment per year of follow-up. This risk difference was 1% for women. Due to the sex specific patterns, we restricted effect modification analyses to women. We found no effect-modification by the examined work environment factors, though a sensitivity analysis indicated a possible stronger association in women of lower occupational position. In conclusion, burnout predicted antidepressant treatment, with a stronger association in men than women. We found no evidence of effect-modification by any of the examined psychosocial work environment factors. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Questions: How does the floristic composition of plant species of meadows and mesic pastures vary along a broad geographical gradient in the NW Balkans? How does the current phytosociological classification of the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea vegetation differ among the NW Balkan countries?
   Location: NW Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia).
   Methods: 3635 releves originally assigned to the class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea were classified with a beta flexible method, and the crispness of classification was checked. DCA ordination with Pignatti indicator values and climate data were applied to show the influence of site conditions on species composition.
   Results: The classification was best interpreted at the level of 13 clusters, but could also be interpreted at the level of three groups of clusters. The first division was according to geography and climate: the first and third groups were concentrated in the NW part, while the second was restricted to the eastern part of the study area. The most important variable was site moisture, followed by nutrients and altitude, which corresponded with a west-east direction. The first group was very diverse and included communities on the wettest and most nutrient-rich sites (Potentillion anserinae, Cynosurion cristati, Calthion palustris, Molinion caeruleae, Molinio-Hordeion). The second group comprised mesophilous continental grasslands (Trifolio-Ranunculion pedati, Trifolion pallidi, Trifolion resupinati), while the third group consisted of grasslands from regions with abundant precipitation (Arrhenatherion elatioris, Deschampsion cespitosae, Pancicion serbicae, Triseto flavescentis-Polygonion bistortae).
   Conclusions: Our analysis can be used to unify different phytosociological classifications in different countries, also showing the transitional forms of well-known Central European vegetation types that have a different floristic composition and ecology in the Balkans. This knowledge will enable classification of the same vegetation types in neighbouring Balkan countries that are less studied.

AB  - This research examined the application of the maximum quantum efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and relative electron transport rate versus irradiance curves (rETR) as a rapid, sensitive assessment of Lake Erie phytoplankton nutrient status. I evaluated the potential benefits of the variable fluorescence parameters by comparing these parameters with chemical and physiological nutrient status assays. I tested the hypothesis that F (v)/F (m) and rETR curves could diagnose nutrient status in natural lake phytoplankton and be capable of discriminating which inorganic nutrient is limited temporally and spatially. F (v)/F (m) was on average highest in the more eutrophic west basin (WB) and lowest in the more oligotrophic central basin (CB). According to the chemical and physiological indicators, P deficiency was most severe in the CB during summer stratification and N deficiency was strongest in the WB during isothermal conditions. Like F (v)/F (m), rETR at light saturation (rETR(max)) and the initial slope of the rETR versus irradiance curve (alpha) decreased as the severity of N and P deficiency increased. Amendment with N or P stimulated increased F (v)/F (m), rETR(max), and alpha in N- and P-limited samples, respectively, and abolished the photoinhibition apparent in rETR curves of nutrient-limited samples. These results supported the view that the N and P deficiency assays, and corresponding variations of variable fluorescence parameters, were valid indicators of widely variable N and P deficiency in the phytoplankton, and could be used to provide a promising tool in determining phytoplankton nutrient status. Contrary to my hopes, it did not appear that rETR-irradiance curves could discriminate between N and P deficiency. Identification of the most limiting nutrient still demanded additional information beyond the variable fluorescence measurements.

AB  - The Middle Jurassic Khatatba Formation in the northern Western Desert of Egypt was evaluated in terms of organic matter abundance, type and thermal maturity, as well as for some organic petrographic characteristics. Depositional environments were interpreted based on organic geochemical (Rock-Eval pyrolysis, extract analysis, and biomarker distributions) and organic petrological methods. Organic carbon contents range between 1.0 and 32.5 wt. %. The Khatatba shale and coaly shale samples have hydrogen index values in the range of 63 to 261 mg hydrocarbon (HC)/g total organic carbon, with mixed types 2-3 and 3 kerogens. Mean vitrinite reflectance (R-o) between 0.77 and 1.07% is in reasonably good agreement with pyrolysis T-max (temperature at maximum of S-2 peak) data (438-459 degrees C). Organic-rich sediments of the Middle Jurassic Khatatba Formation have very good source rock generative potential and have obtained thermal maturity levels equivalent to the oil window. The main generation products are gas with very limited liquid HCs (oil or condensate). Seven shale and coaly shale samples from Khatatba Formation were characterized using gas chromatography (GC) and GC mass spectrometry techniques. The Khatatba samples are characterized by the predominance of C-14-C-24 alkanes, a pristane/phytane ratio of less than 2, abundant C-27 regular steranes, and the presence of tricyclic terpanes. These are consistent with the suboxic marine-environment conditions for the Khatatba source rock. Biomarker parameters for these samples generally indicate a mixture of land- as well as marine-derived organic-matter input. The maturity indicators based on C-32 22S/(22S + 22R) homohopane and C-29 20S/(20S + 20R) and beta beta/(beta beta + alpha alpha) sterane ratios reveal that the Khatatba samples are thermally mature and have reached the peak oil-window maturity supporting the R-o data.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary fibre content and weaning age oil Clostridium perfringens proliferation in the caecum and fattening mortality in growing rabbits farmed in a facility having Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy. The experiment consisted in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two weaning ages (28 days vs. 42 days) and two levels of dietary neutral detergent fibre assayed with a heat stable amylase and expressed exclusive of residual ash (aNDFom; 330g/kg vs. 425g/kg). Controls were made during two consecutive experimental periods that differed in hygienic environmental conditions by modifying the intensity of cleaning and disinfection in the farm previous to the trial. An interaction (P<0.001) was detected among the independent variables studied on Cl. perfringens enumeration in the caecal contents, as minimal values for this trait were obtained in non-medicated animals reared in a clean environment, and especially when they were weaned at a later age and fed the diet with the lower fibre content. The treatments studied also led to a variation in fattening mortality(from 4.7% to 34.0%), which was highly and positively-correlated (P<0.001) to the average Cl. perfringens caecal counts in each combination of treatments. The results of the current study indicate that high Counts of Cl. perfringens in the caecum can be used as an indicator of Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy, and suggest that strategies designed to control its proliferation in the caecum might help to limit fattening mortality in rabbit fed diets not-medicated with antibiotics.

AB  - A principal goal of protected-area networks is to maintain viable populations of as many species as possible, particularly those that are vulnerable to environmental change outside reserves. Ideally, one wants to be able to protect all biodiversity when selecting priority areas for conservation.
   Using the area-prioritization algorithm ZONATION, we identified the locations where UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species of mammals, birds, herptiles, butterflies and plants occur in concentrated populations with high connectivity. Both these features are likely to be correlated with population persistence. The analyses were successful in maintaining a high proportion of the connectivity of narrow-range species, and large total amounts of the connectivity of wider-range species over 10% of the land surface of Great Britain.
   Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP - high priority) species of one taxonomic group were not particularly good surrogates (indicators) for BAP species of other taxonomic groups. Hence, maintaining population concentrations of one taxonomic group did not guarantee doing likewise for other taxa.
   Species with narrow geographic ranges were most effective at predicting conservation success for other species, probably because they represent the range of environmental conditions required by other species.
   Synthesis and applications. This study identifies landscape-scale priority areas for conservation of priority species from several taxonomic groups, using the Zonation software. 'Indicator groups' were only partially successful as predictors of priority areas for other taxonomic groups, and therefore, the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation should include information from all taxonomic groups available. Larger areas should be protected to account for species not included in the analyses. Conservation solutions based on data for many different species, and particularly those species with narrowly defined ranges, appear to be most effective at protecting other rare taxa.

AB  - Seriously escalating global anthelmintic resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants has spawned a variety of alternatives to anthelmintics for worm management, based on the need for sustainable Integrated Parasite Management (sIPM).
   Pivotal to the sIPM approach is the concept of refugia, the proportion of a given parasite population that escapes exposure to control measures. By balancing drug applications with the maintenance of refugia, the accumulation of anthelmintic resistance alleles in worm populations can be considerably delayed, while still providing good levels of control. The over-dispersed nature of parasitic infections provides an opportunity to achieve this balance, by targeting treatments to the members of a flock or herd that are least tolerant to nematode infection. However, implementation of this strategy has only recently become feasible, with the development of the FAMACHA (c) system for clinical evaluation of anaemia due to haemonchosis. Subsequently, the use of milk yields has proven an effective indicator in dairy goats infected predominantly with nematodes other than Haemonchus contortus. In addition, short-term weight changes and perhaps also body condition scoring may provide indices of parasitism, permitting the rapid identification of animals likely to benefit from treatment.
   However, sIPM and refugia-based approaches are more complex than whole-flock treatments in conventional programs, and adoption by farmers is most likely where the theoretical basis is understood. As close communication with informed advisors is generally limited, there is a danger that sIPM will remain a theoretical concept without alternative modes of communication. The development of computer-based decision support programs, which use epidemiological, seasonal and clinical information to provide recommendations for specific situations, should be accorded high priority in the future development of worm management systems.

AB  - In this work we present a critical study of the nucleic acid layer immobilized at glassy carbon electrodes. Different studies were performed in order to assess the nature of the interaction between DNA and the electrode surface. The adsorption and electrooxidation of DNA demonstrated to be highly dependent on the surface and nature of the glassy carbon electrode. The DNA layer immobilized at a freshly polished glassy carbon electrode was very stable even after applying highly negative potentials. The electron transfer of potassium ferricyanide, catechol and dopamine at glassy carbon surfaces modified with thin ( obtained by adsorption under controlled potential conditions) and thick ( obtained by casting the glassy carbon surface with highly concentrated DNA solutions) DNA layers was slower than that at the bare glassy carbon electrode, although this effect was dependent on the thickness of the layer and was not charge selective. Raman experiments showed an important decrease of the vibrational modes assigned to the nucleobases residues, suggesting a strong interaction of these residues with the electrode surface. The hybridization of oligo(dG)(21) and oligo(dC)(21) was evaluated from the guanine oxidation signal and the reduction of the redox indicator Co(phen)(3)(3+). In both cases the chronopotentiometric response indicated that the compromise of the bases in the interaction of DNA with the electrode surface is too strong, preventing further hybridization. In summary, glassy carbon is a useful electrode material to detect DNA in a direct and very sensitive way, but not to be used for the preparation of biorecognition layers by direct adsorption of the probe sequence on the electrode surface for detecting the hybridization event.

AB  - US agriculture is facing low commodity prices,to farmers because of foreign competition, environmental concerns, and weather fluctuations such as droughts. Producers need to quickly evaluate the marketplace and select appropriate management systems for their farms and ranches. The Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) decision support system was developed to assist farmers and ranchers with key strategic management decisions, but requires additional testing before general adoption by the agricultural community. This paper evaluated GPFARM simulation of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) yields and soil residual nitrates under irrigated and partially irrigated conditions, fertilized and non-fertilized applications, and high and low planting densities. Validation results for a 3-year field study indicated the model could simulate corn yields and soil residual NO3-N without bias at the P < 0.05 level with R-2 values for predicted versus observed corn yields and soil residual NO3-N of 0.830 and 0.383, respectively. Mean extended modeling error (EME), a measure of modeling error extending outside the error range of the validation measurements was 168 and 25.2 kg/ha for corn grain yields and soil residual NO3-N, respectively. The EME results further showed that the scatter around the simulated versus observed 1:1 lines for soil residual NO3-N versus corn yields was 53.5 and 19.9% of the mean sum of the absolute residuals, respectively, suggesting higher modeling error with the residual NO3-N. The EME method also effectively separated modeling error from error that could be accounted for by uncertainty in the experimental validation data set. Agricultural producers, consultants, and action agencies should consider these validation results and potential errors when using the model to predict corn yields and related soil NO3-N estimates in strategic management planning and environmental assessment studies.

AB  - Natural populations of alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) have declined recently due to the effects of commercial and sport fisheries. Aquaculture represents a short-term alternative to restore natural populations, and a first step to accomplish culture of this species is the study of early life stages. Therefore, multidisciplinary research was used to describe the major morpho-physiological changes taking place during this period. The studies serve as a basis for the introduction of artificial diets for culture. A morphological study distinguished different nutritional stages, as well as external indicators of starvation. A histological approach showed the digestive tract to be completely formed 5 days after hatching (DAH), at the beginning of exogenous feeding. Throughout larval development, intestinal maturation was followed and a nutritional indicator based on the mid-gut cell height was validated. The occurrence of pepsin-like proteolytic activity was detected from five DAH, while trypsin, chimiotrypsin and aminopeptidase-like activities gradually increased from two to nine DAH. The incidence of cannibalism in culture conditions was controlled by exposure to anti-thyroid compounds ( thiourea - TU) to retard snout growth. This treatment did not effect growth and allowed juveniles to feed on live prey but prevented the consumption of gar larvae of the same size. Larvae exposed to 3,3', 5-triiodo-1-thyronine (T3) had faster development, a potentially advantageous characteristic for the repopulation of their natural habitat. Finally, artificial feeds were well accepted and resulted in growth rates similar to those of gar larvae that were fed natural prey. This has allowed the development of a feeding strategy that effectively reduced cannibalism and led to the production of 30 cm juveniles in four months.

AB  - Biomass is widely used for the production of renewable energy, which calls for an economic evaluation of its generation. The aim of the present work was to review the literature concerning the economic evaluation of the production of perennial crop biomass for energy use. Statistical analysis of the bibliographic data was carried out, as well as an assessment of methods and values of economic indicators of the production of perennial crops for bioenergy. Most of the papers selected for the review were published in the years 2015-2019, which was probably stimulated by the growing interest in sustainable development, particularly after 2015, when the United Nations declared 17 sustainable development goals. The earliest articles concerned the economic analysis of plantations of short rotation coppice; the subsequent ones included the analysis of feedstock production in terms of the net present value and policy. The latest references also investigated transport and sustainability issues. The crops most commonly selected for production cost analysis were willow, poplar, and Miscanthus. The cost of production of willow and poplar were similar, 503 EUR ha(-1) year(-1) and 557 EUR ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, while the cost of Miscanthus production was significantly higher, 909 EUR ha(-1) year(-1) on average. By analogy, the distribution of revenue was similar for willow and poplar, at 236 EUR ha(-1) year(-1) and 181 EUR ha(-1) year(-1); Miscanthus production reached the value of 404 EUR ha(-1) year(-1). The economic conditions of perennial crop production differed in terms of geography; four areas were identified: Canada, the USA, southern Europe, and central and northern Europe.

AB  - The recycling and recovery of organic matter and nutrients from sewage sludge for application in agricultural soils is gaining interest, while the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in this matrix may have a great impact on the environment and human health. The aim of this review paper is to outline recent research on the occurrence of PhACs and their metabolites in sewage treatment lines. A total of 32 classes of therapeutic groups including 180 PhACs and 45 metabolites have been included. In a first part, a summary of the analytical methods with a critical overview of the extraction and determination techniques, quality control issues and methodological challenges for their determination is included. Subsequently, the study gives a snapshot of the concentration levels and distribution patterns found in primary, secondary, digested (aerobically and anaerobically), dehydrated and composted sludge. Data have been systematically summarized and categorized according to matrix type, treatment processes available for PhAC degradation in sludge, and geographical areas. Our literature review showed that antimicrobials, antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants and antidiabetics were the most abundant PhACs found in sludge matrices.Overall, attenuation of PhACs concentrations occurs during sludge stabilization, in particular during anaerobic digestion and composting. PhAC sorption onto sludge is strongly affected by the physicochemical properties, the sludge matrix and the operating and environmental conditions. Lastly, the paper discusses the impact of PhACs on sludge-amended agricultural land. The potential ecotoxicological risk associated with the presence of PhACs in amended soil is medium-low for most PhACs. The most critical compounds found in sludge-amended soil are ciprofloxacin, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, and triclocarban and triclosan. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationship between leaf area index (LAI), ultraviolet radiation (UV) and temperature measured at 1.5 meters (T degrees 1.5) and at ground level (T degrees s) was studied, in three urban forest areas of Talca City, Chile. Circular plots with different tree projection coverage areas were defined for the registration of the T degrees and UV data. Measurements between 13 and 14 hours were performed and distributed for each year season, while the LAI was obtained with a single record per season; the selection zones and measurement points were done by a non-probabilistic method. The results showed that LAI, as a factor, had a statistical significance effect for UV, T degrees(1.5) and T degrees s, with 0.0081; 0.0058 and 0.0334 respectively (P <0.05), demonstrating that LAI is related as indicator of the mitigating function of urban forest, regardless of season of the year. The correlations were positive, although weak, as they failed to robustly explain their relationship with the measured variables; and LAI did not fully explain the variability that it has with T degrees s and T degrees(1.5) (r = 0.47 and r = 0.48 respectively), the same for UV (r = 0.38). In the context studied, it was not possible to determine that the LAI is an index that explains the variability presented, obtaining R-2 of 22.15%, 23.28% and 14.47% for T degrees s, T degrees(1,5) and UV, respectively, so the tree species and the characteristics associated with the plots, would explain the high dispersion of the results. The presence of trees favors the condition of T degrees and UV in the city pedestrian displacements.

AB  - Urbanization and subsequent expansion of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) capacity has the potential to alter stream metabolic regimes, but the magnitude of this change remains unknown. Indeed, our understanding of downstream WWTP effects on stream metabolism is spatially and temporally limited, and monitoring designs with upstream-downstream comparison sites are rare. Despite this, and despite observed spatiotemporal variability in stream metabolic regimes, regulators typically use snapshot monitoring to assess ecosystem function in receiving streams, potentially leading to biased conclusions about stream health. To address these important practical issues, we assessed the spatiotemporal variability in stream metabolism at nine sites upstream and downstream of four WWTPs in a suburban stream. We used one year (2017-2018) of high-frequency dissolved oxygen (DO) data to model daily gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We found that GPP was 1.7-4.0 times higher and ER was 1.2-7.2 times higher downstream of the WWTPs, especially in spring when light was not limited by canopy shading. Critically, we observed that these effects were spatially limited to the kilometer or so just downstream of the plant. These effects were also temporally limited, and metabolic rates upstream of WWTPs were not different from sites downstream of the plant after leaf-out at some sites. Across sites, regardless of their relation to WWTPs, GPP was positively correlated with potential incident light suggesting that light is the dominant control on GPP in this system. Temporal windowing of DO to proposed regulatory monitoring lengths revealed that the violation frequency of water quality criteria depended on both the monitoring interval and start date. We conclude that spatiotemporal variability in metabolism and DO are crucial considerations when developing monitoring programs to assess ecosystem function, and that evidence of WWTP effects may only arise during high light conditions and at limited scales.

AB  - Objective Since China launched its nationwide systemic healthcare reform in 2009, policies such as the elimination of drug markups and the reform of medical insurance payments have forced some hospitals into a crisis threatening their survival. Both public and private hospitals have been building and strengthening their capacity to achieve sustainable development. However, the existing research has not provided a comprehensive evaluation tool required to support this effort. Therefore, this study develops an organisational capability evaluation index system to help public and private hospitals assess their current conditions. Design The Delphi method was used to construct a hospital organisational capability evaluation index system in conjunction with the boundary value method and an analytic hierarchical process. Then, a questionnaire survey was administered in 55 hospitals (32 non-profit and 23 for-profit hospitals), and Cronbach's alpha and a factor analysis were used to verify the index system's reliability and validity. Setting and participants A literature review and semistructured interviews with 23 hospital managers and scholars clarified the definition of hospital organisational capability and formed an indicator pool. Additionally, 20 hospital directors were selected from public and private hospitals to participate in two rounds of the Delphi consultation. Results The Delphi consultation resulted in an index system including 12 primary and 40 secondary indicators demonstrated to be reliable and valid. The three indicators with the largest weights were 'regulation capability' (0.251), 'decision-making capability' (0.121) and 'executive capability' (0.105). Conclusion This study constructed an index system based on theoretical and practical considerations, and is expected to be applied to quantitatively evaluate the organisational capability of both public and private hospitals in China, and support their adaptation to external environmental changes.

AB  - Diagnostics are vital in healthcare services because of their ability to reveal disease occurrence and evaluate therapeutic performance. Recent advances in nanoprobes have revolutionized the diagnostics field. These nanoprobes typically contain one or more signal channels; thereby, they are able to quantify chemical signals or locate spatial indicators upon signal collection. It is noteworthy that multichannel nanoprobes have more merits than conventional single-channel ones, which has recently attracted significant interest. A benefit of this approach is that multiple signals will generate more information in one single test, which avoids omitting details and reduces the risk of false results. Additionally, multiple signals give more instrumentation options to operators, which allows diagnostics in broad clinical conditions. As a result, multichannel nanoprobes are ideal tools to increase diagnostic performance. Due to the specific 4f electrons, lanthanide ions have simultaneous and extraordinary electric, optical, and magnetic capacities. Therefore, lanthanide-doped nanomaterials are advanced candidates for fabricating multichannel nanoprobes and hence are favorable for biological and medical studies.
   In this Account, we highlight recent progress in designing multichannel lanthanide-doped nanoprobes to improve biomolecule detection and diagnostic performance with a particular focus on our own work. First, we present a brief overview on the type of signals that are available for constructing multichannel nanoprobes. The principles and merits of each signal are highlighted. Then, we summarize the general strategies of integrating multiple types of signals into one nanoprobe. Using this strategy, we have fabricated a series of multichannel lanthanide-doped nanoprobes and have explored their potential to improve diagnostic precision from different aspects. Finally, we propose an outlook on future development and possible issues of next-generation lanthanidedoped nanoprobes with multiple signal channels. We hope this timely account can update our understanding of multifunctional nanoprobes in medicine and provide some helpful references for the state-of-art diagnostic protocols with outstanding performance.

AB  - Background Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) have been identified as promising seeding cells in tissue engineering and clinical applications of regenerative medicine due to their advantages of simple acquisition procedure and the capability to come from a young tissue donor over the other MSCs sources. In clinical applications, large scale production is required and optimal cryopreservation and culture conditions are essential to autologous and allogeneic transplantation in the future. However, the influence of cryopreserved post-thaw and long-term culture on hUC-MSCs remains unknown, especially in terms of specific protein expression. Therefore, biological characteristics and proteomic profiles of hUC-MSCs after cryopreserving and long-term culturing were investigated. Methods Firstly, hUC-MSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord tissues and identified through morphology, surface markers and tri-lineage differentiation potential at passage 3, and then the biological characteristics and proteomic profiles were detected and compared after cryopreserving and long-term culturing at passage 4 and continuously cultured to passage 10 with detection occurring here as well. The proteomic profiles were tested by using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling technique and differential protein were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Results The results showed no significant differences in phenotypes including morphology, surface marker and tri-lineage differentiation potential but have obvious changes in translation level, which is involved in metabolism, cell cycle and other pathways. Conclusion This suggests that protein expression may be used as an indicator of hUC-MSCs security testing before applying in clinical settings, and it is also expected to provide the foundation or standardization guide of hUC-MSCs applications in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals and Personal care products (PPCPs) are frequently released into several marine matrices, representing significant environmental and ecotoxicological risks. Among the widest spread PPCPs in aquatic systems is Salicylic acid (SA), with known negative effects on marine and freshwater species. Nevertheless, the toxicity resulting from these emerging pollutants, including SA. together with climate change has still received little attention up to date. Among climate change related factors salinity is one that most affects aquatic organisms. To better understand the combined impacts of SA and salinity, the present study evaluated the biochemical alterations induced in Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels exposed to SA and different salinity levels, acting individually and in combination. The effects observed clearly highlighted that cellular damages were mainly observed at higher salinity (35), with no additive or synergistic effects derived from the combined presence of SA. Higher antioxidant capacity of mussels in the presence of SA may prevent increased LPO levels in comparison to uncontaminated mussels. Nevertheless, in the presence of SA mussels revealed loss of redox balance, regardless of the salinity level. Furthermore, mussels exposed to SA at control salinity showed increased metabolic capacity which decreased when exposed to salinities 25 and 35. These findings may indicate the protective capacity of mussels towards higher stressful conditions, with lower energy reserves expenditure when in the presence of SA and salinities out of their optimal range. Although limited cellular damages were observed, changes on mussel's redox balance, antioxidant mechanisms and metabolism derived from the combined exposure to SA and salinity changes may compromise mussel's growth and reproduction. Overall, the present study highlights the need to investigate the impacts induced by pollutants under present and future climate change scenarios, to- wards a more realistic environmental risk assessment.

AB  - In this study, multivariate statistical analyses were performed to develop water and sediment quality indexes, allowing us (i) to select with reliability the most appropriate chemical variables for the evaluation of river quality susceptibility; (ii) to weight the influence of each variable based on monitored data; (iii) to consider possible synergism or antagonism derived from the combined effect of several pollutants; and (iv) to express the quality as a deviation from selected site-specific reference conditions. For the establishment of these threshold/maximum values, combining two biological indicators related to denitrifying bacteria in sediments turned out to be applicable to ensure compliance with the European water quality standard.
   The joint implementation of water and sediment quality indexes assisted us in the rapid detection of the deleterious effect of different anthropogenic contamination sources, as well as the influence of hydrological regime seasonality on river quality. In addition, metal-dependent water quality appeared to be coupled to sediment dynamics, since they were preferentially adsorbed onto sediments during low flow seasons, whereas there was potential for metal mobilization to water during sediment resuspension in high flow seasons. Therefore, an annual determination of sediment quality index was also recommended as suitable tool for prospective monitoring water quality, identifying those sites which could deserve special attention during certain periods, and planning future strategies for river quality improvement. However, two limitations were found: (1) sediment was not appropriate for water physicochemical quality early monitoring due to organic matter and nutrient continuous transformation; and (2) a multimetric index did not provide a concise and definitive quality information, thus a new tool for combining with quality index was proposed for specifically evaluate the water and sediment quality by identifying pollutant/s of concern at each location.

AB  - BACKGROUND The newly developed sugarcorn is conceived for dual-purpose use as a potential biofuel feedstock and a high-energy silage crop. Its agronomic traits are, however, not fully appraised under the umbrella of nitrogen (N) management and with canopy reflectance indicator. A 3-year field study was conducted to examine the responses of silage biomass, stalk sugar concentration, sugar and juice yields to various N applications; and determine the quantitative relationships between canopy reflectance, expressed as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and stalk sucrose or other sugar measures in a dual-purpose sugarcorn (cv. 'CO384xC103'), in comparison with a commercial leafy silage-specific hybrid (cv. 'Pride A5892G3 EDF'). RESULTS The moderate N rate, 125 kg ha(-1), produced similar stalk sucrose, silage and grain yields, compared to the high rate (250 kg N ha(-1)), regardless of application methods. The NDVI signatures measured at the V8-V10 stage exhibited significant (P < 0.01) and exponential relationships with stalk sucrose concentrations, sucrose and juice yields at the R3 stage, and with silage yield at approximately 65% whole-plant moisture, the optimum silage-harvest window. CONCLUSION The results indicate that the moderate N rate, 125 kg ha(-1), which is recommended for conventional grain corn production in the region, was likely close to the economic optimum N rate for leafy silage-specific and sugarcorn. Canopy reflectance, measured at the early growth stages, can be used as a potential indicator of sugar and silage production, and this quantitative relationship necessitates further evaluation with more genotypes and under wide environmental conditions.

AB  - The comprehensive optimization of building energy design is fundamental to promote sustainability but it is an arduous issue that involves a huge domain of variables and objectives. The proposed investigation addresses this issue through a novel comprehensive framework - Harlequin - that performs a multi-phase and multi-objective design optimization. Three phases are carried out to optimize design variables related to the whole building-plants system, considering different energy, comfort, economic and environmental performance indicators. Phase 1 implements a genetic algorithm to achieve the Pareto optimization of envelope, geometry and space conditioning set points. Phase 2 performs a smart exhaustive sampling of design scenarios to find optimal energy systems. Phase 3 provides the most sustainable, the cost-optimal and the lowest investment (but energy-efficient) design solutions. Among these, the stakeholders can choose the best solution according to their wills and needs. Harlequin uses EnergyPlus (only in phase 1) and MATLAB (R) and it is so-called because building geometry and envelope are optimized for each exposure, thereby providing "Harlequin buildings". The novelty and scientific significance consist in ensuring a reliable design optimization by investigating a domain of variables and objectives, as comprehensive as never before. As a case study, Harlequin is applied to design a typical Italian office in Milan. Compared to a reference design, significant reductions of primary energy consumption (PEC), global cost (GC) and CO2-eq emissions can be achieved, depending on the chosen solution. The maximum reductions are 43.9 kWh(p)/m(2) a for PEC, 63.9 (sic)/m(2) for GC (discount rate of 3%) and 12.3 kg/m(2) a for CO2-eq.

AB  - Most crop plants are exposed to intermittent drought periods. To cope with these continuous changes, plants need strategies to prevent themselves from exhaustive adjustment maneuvers. Drought stress recovery has been shown to be an active process, possibly involved in a drought memory effect allowing plants to better cope with recurrent aridity. An integrated understanding of the molecular processes of enhanced drought tolerance is required to tailor key networks for improved crop protection. During summer, prolonged periods of drought are the major reason for economic yield losses of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) in Europe. A drought stress and recovery time course experiment was carried out under controlled environmental conditions. In order to find regulatory key mechanisms enabling plants to rapidly react to periodic stress events, beets were either subjected to 11 days of progressive drought, or were drought stressed for 9 days followed by gradual rewatering for 14 days. Based on physiological measurements of leaf water relations and changes in different stress indicators, plants experienced a switch from moderate to severe water stress between day 9 and 11 of drought. The leaf proteome was analyzed, revealing induced protein pre-adjustment (prior to severe stress) and putative stress endurance processes. Three key protein targets, regulatory relevant during drought stress and with lingering levels of abundance upon rewatering were further exploited through their transcript performance. These three targets consist of a jasmonate induced, a salt-stress enhanced and a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein. The data demonstrate delayed protein responses to stress compared to their transcripts and indicate that the lingering mechanism is post-transcriptionally regulated. A set of lingering proteins is discussed with respect to a possible involvement in drought stress acclimation and memory effects.

AB  - Salinity has been proposed to increase the mobility and availability of heavy metals, with a potentially significant consequence for greater metal toxicity. However, the interactive effect of salinity and metal pollution on soil microbial properties and functions is still unknown. This investigation was performed to examine the response of several soil microbial properties and processes to the combined salinity and cadmium (Cd) toxicity in a clay loam soil amended with plant residue. The NaCl salt (0, 32.5 and 78.3 mM NaCl kg(-1) soil), Cd (0 and 30 mg kg(-1) soil) and alfalfa residue (0 and 1%) were added to the soil and the mixtures were incubated for 90 days under standard laboratory conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C and 70% of water holding capacity). Similar treatments without residue addition were also included in the experimental arrangement. Salinity increased soil Cd availability and toxicity, and subsequently decreased soil microbial respiration rate, microbial biomass and enzyme activity. The negative effect of increasing salinity on soil microbial and biochemical properties was stronger in Cd-polluted than unpolluted soils and at high than low salinity levels. The declines in soil microbial attributes and enzyme activity were linearly related to the concentration of soil available Cd. Nevertheless, the negative effect of salinity was reduced with addition of alfalfa residue in Cd-polluted soils. The interactive effect of Cd and NaCl was synergistic in residue-unamended soils, but antagonistic in residue-amended soils. It is concluded that (i) the multiple stresses induced by salinity and Cd pollution may synergistically affect soil microbial processes and attributes and (ii) application of organic residues has a high potential for lowering the synergistic effect of salinity in Cd-polluted environments and improving the important microbial indicators of soil quality.

AB  - It is accepted knowledge that, for a given equivalent sound pressure level, sounds produced by planes are worse received from local communities than other sources related to transportation. Very little is known on the reasons for this special status, including any interactions that non-acoustical factors may have in listener assessments. Here we focus on one of such factors, the multisensory aspect of aircraft events. We propose a method to assess the visual impact of perceived aircraft height and size, beyond the objective increase in sound pressure level for a plane flying lower than another. We utilize a soundscape approach, based on acoustical indicators (dBs, L-A,(max), background sound pressure level) and social surveys: a combination of postal questionnaires (related to long-term exposure) and field interviews (related to the contextual perception), complementing well-established questions with others designed to capture new multisensory relationships. For the first time, we report how the perceived visual height of airplanes can be established using a combination of visual size, airplane size, reading distance, and airplane distance. Visual and acoustic assessments are complemented and contextualized by additional questions probing the subjective, objective, and descriptive assessments made by observers as well as how changes in airplane height over time may have influenced these perceptions. The flexibility of the proposed method allows a comparison of how participant reporting can vary across live viewing and memory recall conditions, allowing an examination of listeners' acoustic memory and expectations. The compresence of different assessment methods allows a comparison between the "objective" and the "perceptual" sphere and helps underscore the multisensory nature of observers' perceptual and emotive evaluations. In this study, we discuss pro and cons of our method, as assessed during a community survey conducted in the summer 2017 around Gatwick airport, and compare the different assessments of the community perception.

AB  - Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for bone health and may influence the risks of respiratory illness, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and chronic diseases of adulthood. Because many countries have a relatively low supply of foods rich in vitamin D and inadequate exposure to natural ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight, an important proportion of the global population is at risk of vitamin D deficiency. There is general agreement that the minimum serum/plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25(OH)D) that protects against vitamin D deficiency-related bone disease is approximately 30 nmol/L; therefore, this threshold is suitable to define vitamin D deficiency in population surveys. However, efforts to assess the vitamin D status of populations in low- and middle-income countries have been hampered by limited availability of population-representative 25(OH)D data, particularly among population subgroups most vulnerable to the skeletal and potential extraskeletal consequences of low vitamin D status, namely exclusively breastfed infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly. In the absence of 25(OH)D data, identification of communities that would benefit from public health interventions to improve vitamin D status may require proxy indicators of the population risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as the prevalence of rickets or metrics of usual UVB exposure. If a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is identified (>20% prevalence of 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L) or the risk for vitamin D deficiency is determined to be high based on proxy indicators (e.g., prevalence of rickets >1%), food fortification and/or targeted vitamin D supplementation policies can be implemented to reduce the burden of vitamin D deficiency-related conditions in vulnerable populations.

AB  - Tangra Yumco, a large saline lake located in the central-southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, lies in a hydrologically closed basin and is part of a cascade lake system including Tangqung Co, Tangra Yumco and Xuru Co. The extension and position of this lake system makes it valuable for reconstructing palaeoclimatic variations through the lake history and to compare both with the adjacent lake systems. We reconstructed Late Quaternary lake level changes based on data from two lacustrine sediment cores. A micropalaeontological analysis focusing on Ostracoda was carried out combined with dating (C-14, Pb-210, Cs-137), sedimentology and stable isotope data from bulk sediment. Ostracod analysis involves the quantitative documentation of associations. An ostracod-based transfer function for specific conductivity was applied to assess and refine lake level changes and to compare the results with other lake level reconstructions from the Tibetan Plateau for evaluating inter-regional climatic patterns. Seven ostracod species were detected, with Leucocytherella sinensis dominating the associations followed by Leucocythere? dorsotuberosa, Limnocythere inopinata and Tonnacypris gyirongensis. Fabaeformiscandona gyirongensis, Candona candida and Candona xizangensis were found in only a few samples and at low percentages. The synthesis of ostracod-based environmental reconstruction and chronology for samples from Tangra Yumco reveals the evolution of the lake system during the past 17ka. A low lake level around 17calkaBP is followed by a recovering until the reaching of a high stand around 8-9calkaBP. Subsequently, between 7.7 and 2.5calkaBP, it remained relatively stable with a subsequent short-living lowstand-highstand cycle at around 2ka. Thereafter, the ostracod-based conductivity transfer function shows an increase of conductivity corresponding to a lake level rising phase at around 0.4ka. The recorded changes are indicators of past climatic conditions and refine the palaeoclimatic models in this area. Copyright (C) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Assessing water status and optimizing irrigation is of utmost importance in most winegrowing countries, as the grapevine vegetative growth, yield, and grape quality can be impaired under certain water stress situations. Conventional plant-based methods for water status monitoring are either destructive or time and labor demanding, therefore unsuited to detect the spatial variation of moisten content within a vineyard plot. In this context, this work aims at the development and comprehensive validation of a novel, non-destructive methodology to assess the vineyard water status distribution using on-the-go, contactless, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Likewise, plant water status prediction models were built and intensely validated using the stem water potential (Psi(s)) as gold standard. Predictive models were developed making use of a vast number of measurements, acquired on 15 dates with diverse environmental conditions, at two different spatial scales, on both sides of vertical shoot positioned canopies, over two consecutive seasons. Different cross-validation strategies were also tested and compared. Predictive models built from east-acquired spectra yielded the best performance indicators in both seasons, with determination coefficient of prediction (R-P(2)) ranging from 0.68 to 0.85, and sensitivity (expressed as prediction root mean square error) between 0.131 and 0.190 MPa, regardless the spatial scale. These predictive models were implemented to map the spatial variability of the vineyard water status at two different dates, and provided useful, practical information to help delineating specific irrigation schedules. The performance and the large amount of data that this on-the-go spectral solution provides, facilitates the exploitation of this non-destructive technology to monitor and map the vineyard water status variability with high spatial and temporal resolution, in the context of precision and sustainable viticulture.

AB  - One way to study ecological implications induced by hydropeaking represents the coupling of hydrodynamic models with habitat suitability models, in which hydrodynamic parameters are typically used to describe the physical habitat of indicator species. This article discusses the differences in habitat suitability assessment between 2D and 3D CFD modelling as input for the habitat simulation tool CASiMiR. In the first part of the article, the accuracy of the hydraulic model is evaluated by comparing the model results with laboratory (model of a laboratory channel with erodible bed) and field measurements (Valsura River, Bolzano, Italy). In the second part, the habitat suitability for the Valsura River case study (affected by hydropeaking), is analyzed comparing different approaches for the reconstruction of the velocity field (depth-averaged velocities from 2D modelling, bottom velocity field reconstruction with log-law approach from 2D modelling and bottom velocity field from 3D modelling). The results show that the habitat suitability index (HSI) using 2D or 3D hydrodynamic models can be significantly different. These differences can be ascribed to a higher capability to depict the features of the flow field with highly variable and heterogeneous boundary conditions and to the possibility to simulate the near bed hydrodynamic parameters, which are relevant for certain target species. In particular, the HSI-values using 3D hydraulics lead to larger areas of highly suitable habitats compared to 2D simulations. Moreover, considering the entire flow range of hydropeaking events, the habitat simulations with bottom flow velocities from 3D modelling provide suitable habitats over the entire flow range representing the availability of stable suitable habitats, while the habitat availability of 2D modelled flow velocity is continuously decreasing with increasing flow rates.

AB  - Fertilization by aged sperm can result in adverse fitness consequences for both males and females. Sperm storage during male sexual rest could provide an environment for post-meiotic sperm senescence causing a deterioration in the quality of stored sperm, possibly impacting on both sperm performance (e.g. swimming ability) and DNA quality. Here, we compared the proportion of sperm with fragmented DNA, an indicator of structural damage of DNA within the sperm cell, among males that had been sexually rested for approximately 2months, to that of males that had mated recently. We found no evidence of intra-epididymal sperm DNA damage or any impairment in sperm performance, and consequently no evidence of post-meiotic sperm senescence. Our results suggest that male house mice are likely to possess mechanisms that function to ensure that their sperm reserves remain stocked with young', viable sperm during periods of sexual inactivity. We also discuss the possibility that our experimental design leads to no difference in the age of sperm among males from the two mating treatments. Post-meiotic sperm senescence is especially relevant under sperm competition. Thus, we sourced mice from populations that differed in their levels of post-copulatory sexual selection, enabling us to gain insight into how selection for higher sperm production influences the rate of sperm ageing and levels of DNA fragmentation. We found that males from the population that produced the highest number of sperm also had the smallest proportion of DNA-fragmented sperm and discuss this outcome in relation to selection acting upon males to ensure that they produce ejaculates with high-quality sperm that are successful in achieving fertilizations under competitive conditions.

AB  - To obtain long term accurate high resolution precipitation for the Heihe River Basin (HRB), Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations were performed using two different initial boundary conditions, with nine microphysical processes for different analysis parameterization schemes. High spatial-temporal precipitation was simulated from 2000 to 2013 and a suitable set of initial, boundary, and micro parameters for the HRB was evaluated from the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research project and Chinese Meteorological Administration data at hourly, daily, monthly, and annual time scales using various statistical indicators. It was found that annual precipitation has gradually increased over the HRB since 2000. Precipitation mostly occurs in summer and is higher in monsoon-influenced areas. High elevations experience winter snowfall. Precipitation is higher in the eastern upstream area than in the western upstream, area; however, the converse occurs in winter. Precipitation gradually increases with elevation from 1000 m to 4000 m, and the maximum precipitation occurs at the height of 3500-4000 m, then the precipitation slowly decreases with elevation from 4000 m to the top over the Qilian Mountains. Precipitation is scare and has a high temporal variation in the downstream area. Results are systematically validated using the in situ observations in this region and it was found that precipitation simulated by the WRF model using suitable physical configuration agrees well with the observation over the HRB at hourly, daily, monthly and yearly scales, as well as at spatial pattern. We also conclude that the dynamic downscaling using the WRF model is capable of producing high-resolution and reliable precipitation over complex mountainous areas and extremely arid environments. The downscaled data can meet the requirement of river basin scale hydrological modeling and water balance analysis.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - The Donana area in Southwestern Spain has the largest concentration of strawberry producers in Europe. The annual yield, close to 300,000t, is mainly devoted to the international markets (more than 90%). Due to the high water demand of strawberries and to the environmental concerns of the destination countries, the maximization of water use efficiency is critical for the strawberry sector.
   Aiming at the efficient water use in the strawberry production, a comprehensive drip irrigation system has been designed, according to precision irrigation principles. The system has been developed based on a three stages methodology. First, the irrigation process carried out by farmers has been assessed to identify inefficiencies in the irrigation system and management. Their performances have been evaluated using indicators such as the Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Strawberry Irrigation Water Applied (SWA) and Strawberry Water Footprint Applied (SWFA). The second phase is focused in an accurate irrigation scheduling based in precise crop water requirements estimation and the optimum irrigation pulse design. Finally, the irrigation system has been designed with the prevailing wisdom of meets the needs of the crop in a timely manner and as efficiently and as spatially uniformly as possible. The most appropriate drip irrigation emitters for the particular conditions of the strawberry production in the study area have been selected. The rest of the on-farm irrigation technologies required to control the system have been integrated, including soil water sensors, smart water meters, programmers, electrovalves and weather station. This precision irrigation system has been installed in a commercial strawberry farm during the irrigation season 2013-2014.
   Also, an application for PC, mobiles and tablets has been developed to provide farmers practical information (e.g. irrigation times) for optimal irrigation scheduling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study is aimed at evaluating whether a gene expression assay with the microbial eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae could be used as a suitable warning tool for the rapid preliminary screening of potential toxic effects on organisms due to scenarios of soil and water contamination with pyrimethanil. The assay consisted of measuring changes in the expression of the selected pyrimethanil-responsive genes ARG3 and ARG5,6 in a standardized yeast population. Evaluation was held by assessing the toxicity of surface runoff, a major route of pesticide exposure in aquatic systems due to non-point-source pollution, which was simulated with a pyrimethanil formulation at a semifield scale mimicking worst-case scenarios of soil contamination (e.g. accident or improper disposal). Yeast cells 2-h exposure to the runoff samples led to a significant 2-fold increase in the expression of both indicator genes. These results were compared with those from assays with organisms relevant for the aquatic and soil compartments, namely the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (reproduction), the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna (survival and reproduction), the benthic midge Chironomus riparius (growth), and the soil invertebrates Folsomia candida and Enchytraeus crypticus (survival and reproduction). Under the experimental conditions used to simulate accidental discharges into soil, runoff waters were highly toxic to the standard test organisms, except for C elegans. Overall, results point out the usefulness of the yeast assay to provide a rapid preview of the toxicity level in preliminary screenings of environmental samples in situations of inadvertent high pesticide contamination. Advantages and limitations of this novel method are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To maximize survival, animals should adjust their behaviour flexibly in response to indicators of predation risk. Predation risk is affected by a range of ecological, social and individual variables, which can fluctuate over different timescales. In general, current risk levels are known to influence the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates are engaged in other activities. However, there has been little consideration of whether decisions made at different stages of a sentinel bout are affected in the same way by perceived predation risk and whether the same level of behavioural plasticity is exhibited when making these different decisions. Here we used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment to investigate the behavioural choices of dwarf mongoose sentinels at three different stages of a bout (before, start, during). Individuals were more likely to begin a bout, and did so sooner, following alarm calls, which are immediate, direct indicators of elevated risk. Sentinels selected an initial height from which to guard depending on factors that tended to vary in the medium term (hours), choosing higher positions in denser habitat and less windy conditions. In contrast, decisions about bout duration were made in relation to short-term (seconds/minutes) changes in information, with sentinels guarding for longer when an alarm call was given during a bout, and terminating bouts sooner when groupmates moved out of sight. Our results demonstrate that sentinel decisions are influenced by both direct and indirect indicators of likely predation risk and that sentinel behaviour is adjusted flexibly with regard to information presented on various timescales, highlighting the complexity of decision-making processes.

AB  - Experimental parameters that influence the resolution of H-1-NMR phenol OH signals are critically evaluated with emphasis on the effects of pH, temperature and nature of the solvents. Extremely sharp peaks (Delta V-1/2 <= 2 Hz) can be obtained under optimized experimental conditions which allow the application of H-1-C-13 HMBC-NMR experiments to reveal long range coupling constants of hydroxyl protons and, thus, to provide unequivocal assignment of the OH signals even in cases of complex polyphenol natural products. Intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds have a very significant effect on H-1 OH chemical shifts which cover a region from 4.5 up to 19 ppm. Solvent effects on -OH proton chemical shifts, temperature coefficients (Delta delta/Delta T), OH diffusion coefficients, and (n)J(C-13, (OH)-H-1) coupling constants are evaluated as indicators of hydrogen bonding and solvation state of phenol -OH groups. Accurate H-1 chemical shifts of the OH groups can be calculated using a combination of DFT and discrete solute-solvent hydrogen bond interaction at relatively inexpensive levels of theory, namely, DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G (2d,p). Excellent correlations between experimental H-1 chemical shifts and those calculated at the ab initio level can provide a method of primary interest in order to obtain structural and conformational description of solute-solvent interactions at a molecular level. The use of the high resolution phenol hydroxyl group H-1-NMR spectral region provides a general method for the analysis of complex plant extracts without the need for the isolation of the individual components.

AB  - Background: Fluctuating asymmetry is a contentious indicator of stress in populations of animals and plants. Nevertheless, it is a measure of developmental noise, typically obtained by measuring asymmetry across an individual organism's left-right axis of symmetry. These individual, signed asymmetries are symmetrically distributed around a mean of zero. Fluctuating asymmetry, however, has rarely been studied in microorganisms, and never in fungi.
   Objective and Methods: We examined colony growth and random phenotypic variation of five soil microfungal species isolated from the opposing slopes of "Evolution Canyon," Mount Carmel, Israel. This canyon provides an opportunity to study diverse taxa inhabiting a single microsite, under different kinds and intensities of abiotic and biotic stress. The south-facing "African" slope of "Evolution Canyon" is xeric, warm, and tropical. It is only 200 m, on average, from the north-facing "European" slope, which is mesic, cool, and temperate. Five fungal species inhabiting both the south-facing "African" slope, and the north-facing "European" slope of the canyon were grown under controlled laboratory conditions, where we measured the fluctuating radial asymmetry and sizes of their colonies.
   Results: Different species displayed different amounts of radial asymmetry (and colony size). Moreover, there were highly significant slope by species interactions for size, and marginally significant ones for fluctuating asymmetry. There were no universal differences (i.e., across all species) in radial asymmetry and colony size between strains from "African" and "European" slopes, but colonies of Clonostachys rosea from the "African" slope were more asymmetric than those from the "European" slope.
   Conclusions and Significance: Our study suggests that fluctuating radial asymmetry has potential as an indicator of random phenotypic variation and stress in soil microfungi. Interaction of slope and species for both growth rate and asymmetry of microfungi in a common environment is evidence of genetic differences between the "African" and "European" slopes of "Evolution Canyon."

AB  - Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a promising technology for converting the low-grade energy to electricity. This paper presents an investigation on the parameter optimization and performance comparison of the fluids in subcritical ORC and transcritical power cycle in low-temperature (i.e. 80-100 degrees C) binary geothermal power system. The optimization procedure was conducted with a simulation program written in Matlab using five indicators: thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, recovery efficiency, heat exchanger area per unit power output (APR) and the levelized energy cost (LEC). With the given heat source and heat sink conditions, performances of the working fluids were evaluated and compared under their optimized internal operation parameters. The optimum cycle design and the corresponding operation parameters were provided simultaneously. The results indicate that the choice of working fluid varies the objective function and the value of the optimized operation parameters are not all the same for different indicators. R123 in subcritical ORC system yields the highest thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of 11.1% and 54.1%, respectively. Although the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of R125 in transcritical cycle is 46.4% and 20% lower than that of R123 in subcritical ORC, it provides 20.7% larger recovery efficiency. And the LEC value is relatively low. Moreover, 22032L petroleum is saved and 74,019 kg CO2 is reduced per year when the LEC value is used as the objective function. In conclusion, R125 in transcritical power cycle shows excellent economic and environmental performance and can maximize utilization of the geothermal. It is preferable for the low-temperature geothermal ORC system. R41 also exhibits favorable performance except for its flammability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abandoned landfills and dumps, where untreated waste materials were deposited in the past, are a main anthropogenic source of relevant gaseous emissions. The determination of stability is a crucial target in the context of landfill risk assessment. FTIR spectroscopy and simultaneous thermal analysis in association with multivariate statistical methods were applied to landfill materials in order to get information on the kind of waste and its reactivity. The spectral and thermal patterns are fingerprints of the material. Industrial waste and the material from a 5-year-old reactor landfill were distinguished from the defined classes of mechanically-biologically treated ("MBT'') waste and 30 to 40-year-old stable landfills containing municipal solid waste and construction waste ("LF'') by a classification model based on soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). Degradation experiments were carried out with the fresh material originating from one MBT plant that was subjected to aerobic and anaerobic conditions in lab-scale reactors. These samples were compared to samples of one reactor landfill and to the landfill fraction from the MBT plant to demonstrate the efficiency of the biological pretreatment before final disposal. Prediction models that are based on spectral or thermal characteristics and the corresponding reference analyses were calculated by means of a partial least squares regression (PLS-R). The developed models of the biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were based on spectral data, the models of the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were based on thermal data (heat flow profiles and mass spectra of combustion gases). Preliminary results are discussed. The enthalpy of the materials decreases with progressing mineralization, whereas the enthalpy of the remaining organic matter increases. The ratio of the enthalpies was used as an indicator of stability. Selected samples comprising old landfills, a recent reactor landfill, MBT landfills and MBT materials were classified according to the calculated ratios.

AB  - Herbicide use intensification implies in the need to determine the potential of these substances to reach groundwater. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of different irrigation depths on the leaching potential of four herbicides commonly used in preemergence cotton weed control, in samples of two soils from Campo Novo do Parecis-MT (RQ-sandy texture) and Tangara da Serra-MT (LV-clay texture). Thus, a bioassay technique in soil columns was adopted, in which water depths of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mm were simulated after application of alachlor (RQ 2.40; LV 3.36 kg ha(-1)), oxyfluorfen (RQ 0.48; LV 0.72 kg ha(-1)), prometryne (RQ 0.75; LV 1.50 kg ha(-1)) and S-metolachlor (RQ 1.20; LV 1.44 kg ha(-1)). For soil samples with sandy texture (RQ), water depths of 80 and 100 mm led to leaching down to layers of 10-15 cm for alachlor and 15-20 cm for S-metolachlor. Regardless of the irrigation depth applied in the RQ samples, oxyfluorfen did not exceed the depth of 5-10 cm and prometryne could be detected at the depth of 10-15 cm only at water depth of 100 mm. In columns filled with clay soil (LV), oxyfluorfen did not move beneath the surface layer, even under the highest water depths and prometryne reached the depth of 5-10 cm under 80 and 100 mm. The herbicides alachlor and S-metolachlor reached 10-15 cm depth under water depths of 80 and 100 mm in the LV. A more intense downward movement of the herbicide molecules was found in sandy soil samples (RQ) than in clay texture soil samples (LV).

AB  - Foraminiferal living assemblages from a brackish tidal marsh were studied across three sampling transects, under Spring and Autumn conditions. Foraminiferal analysis was also extended to the dead assemblages of Spring samples. Altimetric control of each sampling point was acquired through the connection to the national datum by GPS differential positioning combined with a regional geoid model. The influence of the geochemical characteristics on the assemblages including chemical composition of the estuarine and marsh surface sediments, in addition to salinity, pH and calcite saturation of estuarine and marsh interstitial waters was evaluated.
   A high affinity was found between Spring and Autumn living assemblages, probably related to the low number of representative species. The affinity also found between living and dead assemblage was seen as a consequence of low pH and calcite undersaturation that prevent the accumulation effect of several generations of foraminifera.
   Salinity appears as a clear constraint to the foraminiferal assemblages composition that is enhanced by calcite undersaturation in brackish marshes interstitial waters and sediments. Generally abundant marsh species like Trochammina inflata, Jadammina macrescens and the calcareous foraminifera are limited to an episodic presence.
   Foraminiferal assemblages distribution across brackish tidal marsh can be assumed as an elevation proxy. The high marsh IB sub-zone is dominated by Haplophragmoides sp. and Haplophragmoides manilaensis. Low marsh zone II is characterised by the dominance of Miliammina fusca but can be subdivided in an IIA upper part, where is followed by Pseudothurammina limnetis, and in a IIB lower part defined by a subsidiary presence of Psammosphaera sp.
   Haplophragmoides manilaensis dominance between 1.55 m and 1.67 m, at living as well as dead assemblages, suggests this species as a potential sea-level indicator for the brackish tidal marshes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Single-component modelling of pig farm odour with statistical methods and neural networks
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING

KW  - SWINE OPERATIONS
AB  - Pork farm odour has become an increasingly important problem for the pork industry because non-farming rural residents object to the odours coming from pig facilities and insist that it disrupts enjoyment of their properties. The pork industry has thus faced strong opposition to farm expansion or the creation of new pork farms. Reducing pork farm odour requires an understanding of what causes the odour and the ability to measure the odour. The pork industry and researchers have attempted to model pork farm odour using single-component odour indicators, such as ammonia and hydrogen sulphide, with statistical models. Singlecomponent analysis refers to only one odour indicator being used to predict odour levels. In this paper, a neural network approach to the pork farm odour using single-component analysis with the consideration of other relevant factors, such as measurement location is proposed. Neural network models and statistical models for pork farm odour have been developed and compared for single-component models to determine which method produces superior results. In general, the use of neural networks to model the pork farm odour yields more accurate and precise odour intensity predictions than the statistical models. The measurement location for the pork farm odour was considered in several model comparisons. The neural network models significantly outperformed the statistical models in this comparison because the statistical models are not able to consider the measurement location. This indicates that measurement location is a relevant factor for modelling pork farm odour. This also demonstrates that factors other than odour components should be considered during modelling. It is hypothesised that a multiple-component (odour components) and multiplefactor (environmental conditions and other human expert knowledge) analysis approach to the modelling of pork farm odour using neural networks and other intelligent systems techniques will yield increased accuracy for odour prediction and a thorough understanding of this significant problem.

AB  - The present study investigated to what extent there is a link between root tissue structure and ecological strategies of plant species; such a link is known for leaf tissue structure. We investigated experimentally root tissue mass density, root diameter and several characteristics of root anatomy in the axile roots of 19 perennial grass species from different habitats al td related these parameters to the ecological behaviour of the species. Root characteristics were assessed ill new roots produced by mature plants grown under standardized conditions. The ecological behaviour was characterizcd in terms of relative growth rate (RGR), plant height at maturity and ecological indicator values for nutrients, light and. tolerance to mowing according to Ellenberg. We found a striking dichotomy between root anatomical characteristics associated with interspecific variation ill RGR and those associated with variation in plant height. RGR correlated with anatomical characteristics that contribute to root robustness, whereas plant height correlated with characteristics associated with axile root hydraulic conductance. RGR correlated negatively with tissue mass density (TMDr) in roots. Interspecific variation in TMDr was explained bg the proportion of style in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the axile root and the proportion of cell wall in the CSA of the stele. For a given root diameter, slow growing species had smaller, albeit more numerous, xylem vessels, indicating a higher resistance to cavitation and protection against embolisms. Plant height correlated positively with root CSA, total xylem CSA and mean xylem vessel CSA, indicating a need for a high transport capacity in roots of species that attain a large size at maturity. TMDr correlated positively with growth matter content in leaves. The results emphasize the dose relationship between tissue structure and growth characteristics at the whole-plant level.

AB  - Light adaptation in insect photoreceptors is caused by an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. To better understand this process, we measured the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in vivo as a function of adapting light intensity in the white-eyed blowfly mutant chalky. We developed a technique to measure the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration under conditions as natural as possible. The calcium indicator dyes Oregon Green 1, 2, or 5N (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were iontophoretically injected via an intracellular electrode into a photoreceptor cell in the intact eye; the same electrode was also used to measure the membrane potential. The blue-induced green fluorescence of these dyes could be monitored by making use of the optics of the facet lens and the rhabdomere waveguide. The use of the different Ca2+-sensitive dyes that possess different affinities for Ca2+ allowed the quantitative determination of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the steady state. Determining the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration as a function of the adapting light intensity shows that the Ca2+ concentration is regulated in a graded fashion over the whole dynamic range where a photoreceptor cell can respond to light. When a photoreceptor is adapted to bright light, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration reaches stable values higher than 10 mu M. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the logarithm of the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is linear with the logarithm of the light intensity. From the estimated values of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, we conclude that the Ca2+-buffering capacity is limited. The percentage of the Ca2+ influx that is buffered gradually decreases with increasing Ca2+ concentrations; at cytosolic Ca2+ concentration levels above 10 mu M, buffering becomes minimal.

AB  - Recently, ergosterol analysis has been used to quantify viable fungal biomass in resynthesized ectomycorrhizae. An objective of our study was to quantify ergosterol in a range of ectomycorrhizal isolates under differing growth conditions. In addition, we tested the applicability of the method on field-collected roots of ectomycorrhizal and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal plants. Quantification of sitosterol as a biomass indicator of plant roots was also undertaken. Ergosterol was not detected in roots of uninoculated Betula populifolia seedlings, and sitosterol was not detected in an ectomycorrhizal fungal isolate but was present in birch roots. Ergosterol was produced in all isolates examined, which represented the major orders of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The range of values obtained, from 3 to nearly 18 mug ergosterol mg-1 dry mass, agrees well with reported values for other mycorrhizal and decomposer fungi. Hyphal ergosterol was the same during growth on phytic acid and KH2PO4. Reduction of growth temperature from 25-degrees-C to 15-degrees-C had little effect on ergosterol content of cultures harvested at similar growth stages. Ergosterol and sitosterol were detected in field-collected ectomycorrhizae of B. populifolia and Pinus sylvestris and VA mycorrhizae of Acer rubrum and Plantago major. Both ergosterol content and ergosterol to sitosterol ratios were significantly lower in VA mycorrhizae than ectomycorrhizae. Calculations of viable fungal biomass associated with field-collected roots were in agreement with those reported by others using the method on resynthesized ectomycorrhizae. Estimates of total mass could be obtained for field-collected B. populifolia roots by a simultaneously using ergosterol to estimate fungal biomass and sitosterol to estimate root mass. Some potential applications and limitations of sterol quantification in studies of mycorrhizal physiology and ecology are discussed.

AB  - Overshooting tops (OTs) are a well-known indicator of updrafts capable of transporting air from the troposphere to the stratosphere and generating hazardous weather conditions. Satellites and radars have long been used to identify OTs, but the results have not been entirely consistent due to differences in sensor and measurement characteristics. OT detection approaches based on satellite infrared (IR) imagery have often been validated using human-expert OT identifications, but such datasets are time-consuming to compile over broad geographic regions. Despite radar limitations to detect the true physical cloud top, OTs identified within multi-radar composites can serve as a stable reference for comprehensive satellite OT analysis and detection validation. This study analyzes a large OT data set compiled from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-13/16 geostationary IR data and gridded volumetric Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) reflectivity to better understand radar and IR observations of OTs, quantify agreement between satellite and radar OT detections, and demonstrate how an increased spatial sampling from GOES-13 to GOES-16 impacts OT appearance and detection performance. For nearly time-matched scenes and moderate OT probability, the GOES-13 detection rate (similar to 60%) is similar to 15% lower than GOES-16 (similar to 75%), which is mostly attributed to coarser spatial resolution. NEXRAD column-maximum reflectivity and tropopause-relative echo-top height as a function of GOES OT probability were quite consistent between the two satellites however, indicating that efforts to account for differing resolution were largely successful. GOES false detections are unavoidable because outflow from nearby or recently decayed OTs can be substantially colder than the tropopause and look like an OT to an automated algorithm.

AB  - This paper presents the paleocurrent evolution of the Persian Gulf deep water (PGDW) during the last 5000 years using faunal (foraminiferal assemblage) and non-faunal (magnetic susceptibility, sediment grain size, number of coarse relict particles and physicochemical characteristics) indicators from a 133 cm long core retrieved from the Strait of Hormoz (SH). Our results suggest that the precession-related insolation change and solar variability induced long-term and short-term sea surface temperature (SST) rise and fall resulted in variation of PGDW outflow strength. Two periods of decreasing SST (5000-4300 and 2000-1450 cal yr BP), accompanied by wetter conditions in the Middle East, are related to the reduction of the PGDW current velocity. A combination of high sedimentation rate (0.72 mm yr-1, due to high terrigenous input) with a relatively low bottom flow energy cause the settling of finer sediments providing a favourable environment for the expansion of benthic foraminifera (dominated by infaunal taxa). On the contrary, the PGDW current velocity strengthens in the periods of SST increase (4300-2000 and 1450 cal yr BP to present) with decreasing sedimentation rate (0.15-0.34 mm yr-1, due to low river discharge). During both periods of high-velocity bottom currents, the benthic foraminifera accumulation rate decreases. However, as the PGDW brings a relatively high amount of dissolved oxygen (3.25 mg/l in summer and 4.79 mg/l in winter) and phytodetritus particles, compared to the surrounding water, some particular foraminifera (especially robust suspension feeder epifaunal taxa) evolved. SST increase, intensified by anthropically caused global warming, may lead to PGDW intensification in the future.

AB  - Transfer factors of radium 226(Ra-226), lead 210(Pb-210), polonium 210(Po-210), uranium 238(U-238) and thorium 234(Th-234) from five different agricultural soils in Syria to coriander, parsley and mint were investigated in a pot culture experiment. Geometric means of transfer factors (TF)were(226)Ra (0.13),Pb-210(0.03), Po-210 (0.02) and U-238 (1.76) were within worldwide values, while TF values for Th-234 (1.35) were higher than those recorded globally. The available transfer factor (ATF) values ranged between 0.03 and 1.45, 0.33 and 3.2, 0.10 and 3.36, 1.30 and 16.2 and 1.0 and 6.95 for(226)Ra,Pb-210,Po-210, U-238 and Th-234, respectively. However, it is worth mentioning that the data from pot experiments may not represent field conditions. Liquid/solid partition coefficients (K-d)of Ra-226, U, Pb-210 and Po-210 for55 soils representing the dominant types of soils in Syria were also determined. Geometric means of Kd values ranged from 280 to1200, 750 to1600, 350to 4800 and 100-120 L kg(-1) for Ra-226, U-238, Pb-210 and Po-210, respectively at pH = 4.0, and from 200 to 6700, 670 to 2400, 150 to 2100 and 100 to 160Lkg(-1)at pH = 5.5, and from 370 to 790, 130 to 550, 60 to 330 and370 to 920Lk(-1)at pH = 7.0. The effects of soil mineral content, CEC, ECE, pH and soluble ions on the Kd values were investigated. In general, there were logarithmic relationships between the activity concentrations in soil and the Kd values (R-2 ranged from 0.59 to 1.00 at pH 4.0). There were no relationships between the K-d values and soil pH.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs), such as dinoflagellate blooms, have adverse effects on coastal water environments, causing seafood contamination and aquaculture economic losses. Based on historical HAB records data (1983-2017) and phytoplankton data (1982-2008), field investigation and laboratory experiments on frequently bloomed dinoflagellate species, we analyzed the possible mechanisms of high frequency dinoflagellate blooms in Daya Bay, South China Sea. The HAB records data show that the proportion of dinoflagellate blooms increased from 15% before 1994 to 77.27% after 2011. The bloom occurred mostly in summer (57.58%) in Yaling Bay (76.92%). The species inducing dinoflagellate blooms tended to be singular over time, with high proportion of Scrippsiella trochoidea (42.86%-88.88%). Laboratory experiment and field investigation of S. trochoidea bloom showed that this species grew rapidly at 30 degrees C and 32.1 degrees C (r=0.47, P<0.05), respectively. Results indicate that temperature rise in Yaling Bay was affected by nearby nuclear plant effluent, which favored the S. trochoidea bloom. Coincidently, nearly 70% of S. trochoidea blooms occurred in about 7 days after local spring tide and strong wind (wind velocity >7 m/s), which disturbed the resting cysts in the sediment and bring them into surface layer. Taking into account of environmental parameters, algae source, and atmospheric conditions, the probable mechanism of S. trochoidea bloom could be explained. The cysts were resuspended by the spring tide or strong wind, germinated at the bottom layer, reproduced rapidly at higher temperature, and then aggregated in the inner bay (Yaling Bay), resulting the frequent S. trochoidea bloom. Considering the influences of global warming and human activities, it should be taken more attention that dinoflagellate blooms might increase along the coastal waters.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity is an essential driver of the stability, structure, and function of wetland ecosystems. Small-scale hydrological connectivity restricts large-scale hydrological cycle processes. This study aimed to investigate the response of soil and root properties to hydrological connectivity at the soil profile scale. Tamarix chinensis, which is a typical plant of the Yellow River Delta wetland, was sampled for analysis. We investigated soil and root properties in the three study plots where T. chinensis distributed and compared them at different soil depths and under different hydrological connectivity conditions. We found that the soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic matter (SOM), and soil total nitrogen (STN) were significantly higher in shallow soil (0-10 cm deep), and that root architecture parameters such as root length and width at soil depth of 0-10 cm were also significantly higher than at other soil depths. Both the soil nutrients and root architecture parameters were significantly influenced by hydrological connectivity. Specifically, SOC, SOM, and STN were significantly higher in regions of high hydrological connectivity than in regions of low hydrological connectivity. Additionally, root length, root surface area, root projected area, and root volume were markedly higher in regions of high hydrological connectivity. Furthermore, root length and width had significant positive correlations with both SOC and SOM in regions of high hydrological connectivity. Taken together, these results indicate that higher hydrological connectivity promotes soil nutrients and root architecture at the soil profile scale. In the process of wetland protection and restoration, we should not only pay attention to hydrological connectivity at a watershed scale, but also to improving hydrological connectivity at smaller scales so as to restore soil nutrients and promote plant growth.

AB  - The objective was to describe the daily dynamics of temperature (Tar) and relative humidity (RH) in protected environments with different polyolefin shading screens in transition region of Cerrado-Amazonia of Mato Grosso; in addition, the uses regressions of estimation of Tar and RH in shaded environments based on the same variables measured in full sun were evaluated. Micrometeorological assessments were performed in suspended modules forest nurseries, aligned to the East-West direction, between June 2017 and April 2019, under black screens with increasing levels of shading (35, 50, 65 and 80%) and colored / spectral (thermo-reflector, red, blue and green, all with 50% shading). The data of the micrometeorological monitoring were grouped according to the regional water stations (dry, dry-rainy, rainy and rainy-dry), with separation of the database for ten years. 70 and 30% of the data were used to generation and validation the regressions, in each data group, respectively. In the Statistical performance evaluation of the regressions were used the statistical indicators: coefficient of determination (R-2), the mean error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Willmott's index of adjustment (d). There was similar dynamic of Tar and UR between the condition of full sun and the black and colored polyolefin screens throughout the day and year; however, with a significant increase in the mean values of Tar and UR in these protected environments. The R-2 values were satisfactory, showing that more than 60% of the dependent variable (Tar in the shading screens) is related to the independent variable (Tar in full sun). The d ranged from 0.96 to 0.99, indicating that the adjusted regressions of Tar and UR present satisfactory performance for all regional water stations in shaded environments.

AB  - Smartphones are affordable devices nowadays, capable of embedding a large variety of sensors such as magnetometers or orientation sensors, but also the hardware needed to connect them to most wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks. Therefore, they are handy devices able to perform received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements for a wide variety of applications such as cellular coverage maps, indoor localization, or proximity tracking. However, to the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of such measurements has never been rigorously assessed. The goals of this article are to assess the accuracy of the RSSI measurements made with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone in a variety of conditions and how possible inaccuracies can be corrected. We primarily focus on the long-term evolution (LTE) RSSI, but we also extend our results to the Bluetooth RSSI. In this article, we build a controlled experimental setup based on commodity hardware and on open-source software. We evaluate the granularity and limitations of the Android application programming interface (API) that returns the RSSI. We explore how reliable the measurements in a controlled environment with a mono-polarized antenna are. We show that the orientation of the smartphone, the position or orientation of the source, and the transmission power have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measurements. We introduce several correction techniques based on radiation matrix manipulations and on machine learning in order to improve measurement accuracy to less than 5-dBm RMSE, when compared to a professional equipment. We also explore the reliability of measurements made in an outdoor realistic environment. We show that although transmission diversity available in LTE base stations significantly improves the measured RSSI regardless of the smartphone orientation, the Bluetooth RSSI remains largely sensitive to the smartphone orientation.

AB  - Trehalose is the major blood sugar in insects; it not only serves as an energy source but also plays important roles in physiological responses to adverse conditions. However, only a few studies have explored the effects of heavy metal exposure stress on trehalose metabolism in insects. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of cadmium stress on changes in trehalose metabolism in Aedes albopictus. Three concentrations of cadmium (0.005, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/L) were selected for evaluation of long-term stress in Ae. albopictus (from eggs to adults); Ae. albopictus in double-distilled water was used as the control group. The trehalose and glucose contents, trehalase activity, and trehalose metabolism-related gene expression were determined. The effects of long-term cadmium exposure on growth, development, and reproduction were also assessed. Trehalose contents were increased, whereas glucose contents and trehalase activity were decreased in Ae. albopictus following long-term exposure to low concentrations of cadmium compared with those in untreated individuals. Moreover, the expression of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase was upregulated, and that of trehalase was downregulated, indicating that Ae. albopictus may enhance trehalose synthesis to resist cadmium stress. Cadmium exposure also caused Ae. albopictus individuals to become smaller with a longer developmental duration, whereas both reproduction and hatching rates of the offspring were decreased compared with those in the control group. Our findings demonstrated that cadmium exposure affected the morphology, physiology, and biochemistry of Ae. albopictus. These findings also confirmed the role of trehalose in the response of Ae. albopictus to cadmium stress, providing insights into the effects of heavy metal stress on trehalose metabolism in an insect model.

AB  - The 1.1 Ga Midcontinent Rift (MCR) is a thick volcanic-sedimentary succession that forms a curvilinear belt through central North America and crops out along its northern apex around Lake Superior. Sedimentary units of the MCR have been long interpreted as fluvial-lacustrine and invited a number of studies on the early evolution of life in non-marine habitats. One of the key units is the siliciclastic Nonesuch Formation, thought to record deposition in a large lake. However, recent sedimentological observations indicate the presence of marine incursions. To further test this interpretation, we analysed trace element abundances in a broad suite of samples from multiple drill cores through the Nonesuch Formation. We aimed to differentiate geochemical influences of sediment provenance from post-depositional hydrothermal overprint and thereby identify authigenic enrichments in fluid-mobile elements that are indicators of primary environmental conditions. Our results reveal discrete enrichments in Mo and U in organic- and sulphide-rich horizons, which are most parsimoniously interpreted as marine signatures. This conclusion is supported by Sr/Ba ratios, which suggest mixing between freshwater and saltwater, and by rare cm-thick gypsum in the upper Copper Harbor Formation immediately below the Nonesuch rocks. The gypsum displays delta S-34 values of +25.9 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, consistent with input of marine sulphate at least during parts of the basin's history. Collectively, our geochemical data support the sedimentological interpretation that this portion of the MCR archives a marine-influenced estuarine system. Although this conclusion rules out that microbial life documented from the MCR was living in exclusively freshwater habitats, the Nonesuch Fm and associated rocks still hold important clues about organisms that were capable of withstanding salinity gradients and bridging the gap between the marine and non-marine environments of the mid-Proterozoic.

KW  - Underground tunnel
AB  - Purpose
   To solve the problem that the traditional received signal strength indicator real-time location method does not test the attenuation characteristics of the electromagnetic wave transmission in the location area, which cannot guarantee the accuracy of the location, resulting in a large location error.
   Design/methodology/approach
   At present, the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithm can be roughly divided into the following two categories (Zhouzhou and Fubao, 2014; Lagunas et al., 2016): one is the greedy iterative algorithm proposed for combinatorial optimization problems, which includes matching pursuit algorithm (MP), positive cross matching tracking algorithm (OMP), greedy matching tracking algorithm, segmented orthogonal matching tracking algorithm (StOMP) and so on. The second kind is the convex optimization algorithm, which also called the optimization approximation method. The common method is the basic tracking algorithm, which uses the norm instead of the norm to solve the optimization problem. In this paper, based on the piecewise orthogonal MP algorithm, the improved StOMP reconstruction algorithm is obtained.
   Findings
   In this paper, the MP algorithm (OMP), the StOMP and the improved StOMP algorithm are used as simulation reconstruction algorithms to achieve the comparison of location performance. It can be seen that the estimated position of the target is very close to the original position of the target. It is concluded that the CS grid-based target stepwise location method in underground tunnel can accurately locate the target in such specific region.
   Originality/value
   In this paper, the offline fingerprint database in offline phase of location method is established and the measurement of the electromagnetic noise distribution in different localization areas is considered. Furthermore, the offline phase shares the work of the location process, which greatly reduces the algorithm complexity of the online phase location process and the power consumption of the reference node, meanwhile is easy to implement under the same conditions, as well as conforms to the location environment.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and their corresponding attributes, required to successfully manage asset management sustainably in a built environment context. Improving the sustainability of existing housing stock is a major challenge facing the UK social housing sector. There is a lack of support to navigate the growing and often incongruent information relating to sustainable development and how to operationalise it. The problem is twofold; first, the current (single criterion) condition-based approach to maintenance planning constrains asset managers and does not fully address the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainability. Second, the toolkits available for assessing the sustainability of housing are often generic and are time consuming and expensive to implement. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports the findings of a participatory research project with a leading London-based housing association, using a series of landlord and tenant workshops to derive a set of attributes associated with KPIs to fully reflect the local requirements of the landlord and their interpretation of the sustainability agenda. Five KPIs are considered to be measurable, directly affected by maintenance work and independent of each other were identified by this landlord (comfort, running costs, adaptability, maintenance costs and community). Findings The resulting outputs, in a policy context, will provide a clear route map to social housing landlords of how to improve the sustainability of their housing stock with the additional benefits of addressing fuel poverty and carbon emission targets, whilst at the same time, help create and maintain housing in which people want to live. Originality/value The proposed approach is flexible enough to incorporate the individual requirements of landlords and be able to adapt to changes in government policy (local and central) in a timely, robust, transparent and inclusive format.

AB  - Active rock glaciers represent the best visual expression of mountain permafrost that can be mapped and monitored directly using remotely sensed data. Active rock glaciers are bodies that consist of a perennially frozen ice/rock mixture and express a distinct flow-like morphology indicating downslope permafrost creep movement. Annual rates of motion have ranged from a few millimeters to several meters per year, varying within the annual cycle, from year to year, as well as at the decennial time scale. During the last decade, in situ observations in the European Alps have shown that active rock glaciers are responding almost synchronously to inter-annual and decennial changes in ground temperature, suggesting that the relative changes of their kinematics are a general indicator of the evolution of mountain permafrost conditions. Here, we used satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) to monitor the rate of motion of various active rock glaciers in the Swiss Alps, Qeqertarsuaq (Western Greenland), and the semiarid Andes of South America. Velocity time series computed with Sentinel-1 SAR images, regularly acquired since 2014, every six days over Europe and Greenland and every 12 days over the Andes, show annual fluctuations, with higher velocities at the end of the summer. A JERS-1 image pair of 1996 and stacks of very high-resolution SAR images from TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed from 2008 to 2017 were analyzed using InSAR and offset tracking over the Western Swiss Alps in order to extend the main observation period of our study. A quantitative assessment of the accuracy of InSAR and offset tracking was performed by comparison with in situ methods. Our results for the three different study regions demonstrate that Sentinel-1 InSAR can complement worldwide in situ measurements of active rock glacier kinematics.

AB  - PM2.5 separator directly affects the accuracy of PM2.5 sampling. The specification testing and evaluation for PM2.5 separator is particularly important, especially under China's wide variation of terrain and climate. In this study, first a static test apparatus based on polydisperse aerosol was established and calibrated to evaluate the performance of the PM2.5 separators. A uniform mixing chamber was developed to make particles mix completely. The aerosol concentration relative standard deviations of three test points at the same horizontal chamber position were less than 0.57%, and the particle size distribution obeyed logarithmic normal distribution with an R-2 of 0.996. The flow rate deviation between the measurement and the set point flow rate agreed to within +/- 1.0% in the range of -40 to 50 degrees C. Secondly, the separation, flow and loading characteristics of three cyclone separators (VSCC-A, SCC-A and SCC112) were evaluated using this system. The results showed that the 50% cutoff sizes (D-50) of the three cyclones were 2.48, 2.47 and 2.44 mu m when worked at the manufacturer's recommended flow rates, respectively. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) of the capture efficiency of VSCC-A was 1.23, showed a slightly sharper than SCC-A (GSD = 1.27), while the SCC112 did not meet the relevant indicator (GSD = 1.2 +/- 0.1) with a GSD = 1.44. The flow rate and loading test had a great effect on D-50, while the GSD remained almost the same as before. In addition, the maintenance frequency under different air pollution conditions of the cyclones was summarized according to the loading test.

AB  - The impacts of climate change on alpine summit floras have been widely investigated. However, only few studies included alpine grasslands and generally concluded that snowbeds, with a long snow cover duration and a short growing season, and windy ridges, with a short snow cover duration and strong winter frosts, are the most sensitive alpine grasslands. However, these habitats were mostly investigated in different regions, where local factors (e.g. nitrogen deposition, grazing) can co-vary with climate changes, potentially obscuring differences between habitats. Here, we focused on the Zermatt region (Swiss Alps) to investigate the impacts of climate change on snowbeds and windy ridges. Forty-three exhaustive historical plant inventories on windy ridges (acidophilic or basophilic) and 31 inventories in snowbeds (typical or wet) were repeated in quasi-permanent plots after approximately 23 years. Historical and recent records were compared with the Simpson index, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, a PCA, ecological indicator values and the frequency and cover changes of species. There was a general increase in alpha-diversity and a decrease in beta-diversity (homogenisation). Most of the new species in the plots were generalists from surrounding grasslands. The plant composition tended to be more thermophilous on acidophilic windy ridges and in typical snowbeds. The flora of acidophilic windy ridges became more similar to that of basophilic windy ridges and more eutrophic. We interpreted this as possibly arising from fertilisation by the aeolian dust deposition coming from the expanding glacial moraine in the valley. In snowbeds, the species indicated increasingly drier conditions, especially in wet snowbeds. Warming climate induces lower snowfall and earlier snowmelt, leading to a shorter snow cover duration. Hence, wet snowbeds are certainly among the most threatened plant communities by climate change in the Alps.

AB  - BackgroundMonitoring and providing early warning are essential operations in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. However, there are still several challenges for identifying the early warning indicators and their thresholds. One particular challenge is that proposed strategies are only valid under certain conditions. Another is the feasibility and universality of the detailed threshold values obtained from different AD systems. In this article, we report a novel strategy for identifying early warning indicators and defining threshold values via a combined experimental and simulation approach.ResultsThe AD of corn stalk (CS) was conducted using mesophilic, completely stirred anaerobic reactors. Two overload modes (organic and hydraulic) and overload types (sudden and gradual) were applied in order to identify early warning indicators of the process and determine their threshold values. To verify the selection of experimental indicators, a combined experimental and simulation approach was adopted, using a modified anaerobic bioconversion mathematical model (BioModel). Results revealed that the model simulations agreed well with the experimental data. Furthermore, the ratio of intermediate alkalinity to bicarbonate alkalinity (IA/BA) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were selected as the most potent early warning indicators, with warning times of 7days and 5-8days, respectively. In addition, IA, BA, and VFA/BA were identified as potential auxiliary indicators for diagnosing imbalances in the AD system. The relative variations for indicators based on that of steady state were observed instead of the absolute threshold values, which make the early warning more feasible and universal.ConclusionThe strategy of a combined approach presented that the model is promising tool for selecting and monitoring early warning indicators in various corn stalk AD scenarios. This study may offer insight into industrial application of early warning in AD system with mathematical model.

AB  - One of the major targets in industry is minimisation of downtime and cost, and maximisation of availability and safety, with maintenance considered a key aspect in achieving this objective. The concept of Condition Based Maintenance and Prognostics and Health Management (CBM/PHM), which is founded on the principles of diagnostics, and prognostics, is a step towards this direction as it offers a proactive means for scheduling maintenance. Reciprocating compressors are vital components in oil and gas industry, though their maintenance cost is known to be relatively high. Compressor valves are the weakest part, being the most frequent failing component, accounting for almost half maintenance cost. To date, there has been limited information on estimating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of reciprocating compressor in the open literature. This paper compares the prognostic performance of several methods (multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, Self-Organising Map (SOM), K-Nearest Neighbours Regression (KNNR)), in relation to their accuracy and precision, using actual valve failure data captured from an operating industrial compressor. The SOM technique is employed for the first time as a standalone tool for RUL estimation. Furthermore, two variations on estimating RUL based on SOM and KNNR respectively are proposed. Finally, an ensemble method by combining , the output of all aforementioned algorithms is proposed and tested. Principal components analysis and statistical process control were implemented to create T-2 and Q metrics, which were proposed to be used as health indicators reflecting degradation processes and were employed for direct RUL estimation for the first time. It was shown that even when RUL is relatively short due to instantaneous nature of failure mode, it is feasible to perform good RUL estimates using the proposed techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A full congener-specific determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was conducted for street dusts in some areas in northern Vietnam. Total 209 PCB concentrations (median and range) of 14 (2.2-120), 11 (6.6-32), and 0.25 (0.10-0.97) ng g(-1) were measured in the street dusts from an industrial park, an urban area, and a rural commune, respectively, suggesting environmental loads of PCBs related to industrialization and urbanization in northern Vietnam. PCB patterns of street dusts from the industrial park were dominated by lightly chlorinated homologs (tri- and tetra-CBs), while more highly chlorinated homologs (penta- and hexa-CBs) were the major contributors to total PCBs in the urban samples, indicating different emission sources. Linear correlations of log-transformed sum of 7 indicator congeners with total PCBs and sum of dioxin-like PCBs were observed. PCB-11, an inadvertently produced congener of pigment manufacturing processes, was detected in all the samples with more elevated proportions in the urban and rural areas than industrial park. Our results have revealed complex emission sources of PCBs in the study areas, including both historical (e.g., the past usage of imported PCB-containing oils and old electric equipment) and current sources such as releases from industrial activities and increasing use of new consumer products. Occupationally exposed persons (e.g., street sweepers, street vendors, and traffic policemen) and children in the urban and industrial areas were estimated to receive much higher doses of dust-bound PCBs than general population, suggesting the need for appropriate protection conditions.

AB  - This study deals with the late Holocene evolution of the coastal swampy Livadi plain, which is located on the northern part of the Gulf of Argostoli (Cephalonia Island). Cephalonia Island is located at the northwest edge of the Hellenic Arc in a tectonically and seismically highly active area. For the purposes of the study, a detailed DEM, produced by topographic sheets (at the scale of 1:5000), was utilized for geomorphological mapping together with extensive fieldwork. In addition, four shallow boreholes, varying in depth from 3 to 5 m, were drilled using a portable vibratory corer. The stratigraphy has been described in detail and four samples (peat - plant material, foraminifera assemblages and shell material) were collected for radiocarbon dating. Additionally, sedimentological and micro/macrofaunal identifications of forty-five sediment samples from the various stratigraphic units were performed to reconstruct the palaeoenvironments of deposition. The results suggest that cores L1 and L2, which are located close to the present day shoreline, are marine/coastal dominated while cores L3 and L4 have a shallowing-upward sedimentary sequence since the lower units correspond to a marine environment of shore-face conditions, which progressively becomes a backshore brackish environment that gradually changes upwards to a terrestrial environment. The dated sea-level indicators (samples of peats, foraminifera and shells) from 5000-4000 BP are too high compared to local relative sea-level curves, indicating local coseismic uplift(s) of around 1 m before 1200 BP and after 4800 BP. This uplift idea is supported by recent (ca. 0.2 m) uplift observed clearly along the beach face at Livadi caused by the recent Cephalonia earthquake in 2014.

AB  - BackgroundThe ecosystem services provided by forests are essential for societal well-being. Production forests are increasingly expected to provide a range of ecosystem services in addition to wood biomass, as well as the biodiversity upon which many of these services depend. Production forests can be managed using different methods that affect the habitat provided and the biodiversity supported. Clearcutting (CC) is a widely used forest management system that has been criticised due to its negative effects on biodiversity. Alternative less intensive forest management systems have been developed with the hope of producing comparable levels of biomass with fewer negative impacts on forest biodiversity. One of these alternatives is continuous cover forestry (CCF); a management system that always maintains tree cover in an uneven-aged production forest stand. Many studies have been conducted which contrast the effects of CCF and CC on biodiversity with varying results. The aim of the review is to explore how CCF system compares to CC in terms of outcomes for terrestrial forest biodiversity.MethodsDue to the diverse vocabulary used to describe CCF, a systematic search for terms was carried out and a comprehensive search string will be used to maximise the likelihood of finding all relevant papers. We will gather, summarise and synthesise primary field studies, both peer-reviewed and grey literature, from temperate and boreal forest comparing biodiversity in CCF and CC stands. Species richness and abundance of plants, animals and fungi will be used to conduct a meta-analysis. Other biodiversity indicators and indices will be used for a narrative synthesis. As the effects of forest management depend on local conditions, we place a special emphasis on exploring the influence of various effect modifiers.

AB  - The Natura 2000 network, which is one of the largest networks of protected areas in the world, is the core pillar in the European Union's biodiversity conservation policy. To achieve the national enforcement of Natura 2000 and to overcome implementation problems, effective policy measures are needed, and participation among different stakeholders is required. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the process of formulation of the Natura 2000 Management Program (2015-2020) in Slovenia based on a set of criteria and indicators for the evaluation of a participatory process, and to present the differences between the stakeholders' evaluations according to their role in the implementation process. For that purpose, stakeholders were divided into two groupsstakeholders from project partner's institution, and others. The research was done in two steps: First, in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 representatives of the key stakeholders' institutions or organizations that were involved in the formulation of the Natura 2000 Management Program were carried out; in the second, a survey with 266 stakeholders involved in the formulation and decision-making process was conducted. Overall, the results show that the participatory process was well organized, independent and fair; however, not all of the requisite conditions for successful participation were fulfilled, as was shown with the sub-criteria of transparency. The only difference between the groups exists in the evaluations of the sub-criteria transparency of the process. The group of stakeholders from the project's partner institutions were more satisfied with the transparency of the process, as the average value was 3.36, compared to the others where the average value of satisfaction was 2.80. This indicates the need for an improved, novel, and innovative approach that leads to multi-level governance.

AB  - Microbiological safety of reclaimed water is one of the most important issues in managing potential health risks related to wastewater recycling. Presence and removal of human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), human torque teno virus (HTtV) and somatic coliphage family Microviridae in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in sub-tropical Brisbane, Australia was investigated. All three WWTPs employ activated sludge process with added on Bardenpho process for nutrient removal. HPyV, HAdV, HTtV and Microviridae were consistently detected in the influent (10(5) to 10(6) Genomic copies (GC) L-1) and secondary treated effluent (10(2) to 10(3)GC L-1). The results of this study suggest that, under appropriate conditions, WWTPs with activated sludge process in sub-tropical climate could be an effective treatment barrier with > 3 log(10) removal of enteric virus. The geometric mean of pooled data for each virus from all sites showed the highest removal for HPyV (3.65 log(10)) and lowest for HAdV (2.79 log(10)) which was statistically significant (p = 0.00001). Whereas, the removal rate of HTtV and Microviridae was identical (2.81 log(10)). A poor correlation between the presence of enteric virus in influent or effluent with routinely monitored physicochemical parameters suggests limited use of physicochemical parameters as predictors of enteric virus presence. High prevalence of HAdV in influent and effluent combined with comparatively low removal suggest that it could be used as a model microorganism for determining enteric virus removal efficacy. Additional tertiary treatment may be required prior to effluent reuse for non-potable purposes or discharge into the recreational waters to prevent exposure of people to health hazards.

AB  - Soil water-stable aggregate (WSA) stability is one of the most important indicators of soil health, because it influences chemical, biological and other physical properties. At the same time, WSA formation, stabilization and degradation are also some of the most complex processes that occur in the soil, making them difficult to fully understand. In particular, there is a lack of research on WSA stability in the Baltic region. To gain a better understanding how aggregation occurs in Estonian pedo-climatic conditions, this study was conducted in 20142015 in a sandy loam Stagnic Luvisol (LV-st) (WRB, 2014). Potato and barley plots were analysed in a three-year crop rotation (potato -> spring wheat -> barley) with straw removal. The nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments were 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) N, both without and with 40 Mg ha(-1) fermented cattle farmyard manure (FYM) application prior to potato planting in the previous autumn. WSA stability was determined by Eijkelkamp's wet sieving apparatus from air-dried soil samples of less than 2 mm in diameter. The study revealed a negative correlation (r = -0.16) between increased N rates and WSA stability, regardless of FYM applications. Although soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased with additional N fertilization rates, the reduction in soil acidity (pH(KCl)) levels caused by N fertilization, most likely repealed the positive SOC content effect on WSA stability. In general, compared with sole N fertilization, FYM application had a positive effect on WSA stability. However, even though WSA stability did not always increase with FYM applications, it still had a positive effect on bulk density, SOC content and soil acidity levels. Further research is needed in Estonia due to the complexities involved in the soil aggregation process.

AB  - Background: Prehospital intravenous access provides the opportunity to sample blood from an emergency patient at the earliest possible moment in the course of acute illness and in a state prior to therapeutic interventions. Our study investigates the pre-analytical stability of biomarkers in prehospital emergency medicine and will answer the question whether an approach of blood sampling out in the field will deliver valid laboratory results.
   Methods: We prepared pairs of blood samples from healthy volunteers and volunteering patients post cardio-thoracic surgery. While one sample set was analysed immediately, the other one was subjected to a worse-than-reality treatment of 60 min time-lapse and standardized mechanical forces outside of the hospital through actual ambulance transport. We investigated 21 parameters comprising blood cells, coagulation tests, electrolytes, markers of haemolysis and markers of cardiac ischemia. Bland-Altman analysis was used to investigate differences between test groups. Differences between test groups were set against the official margins of test accuracy as given by the German Requirements for Quality Assurance of Medical Laboratory Examinations.
   Results: Agreement between immediate analysis and our prehospital treatment is high as demonstrated by Bland-Altman plotting. Mechanical stress and time delay do not produce a systematic bias but only random inaccuracy. The limits of agreement for the tested parameters are generally within clinically acceptable ranges of variation and within the official margins as set by the German Requirements for Quality Assurance of Medical Laboratory Examinations.
   Discussion: We subjected blood samples to a standardized treatment marking a worse-than-reality scenario of prehospital time delay and transport. Biomarkers including indicators of myocardial ischemia showed high pre-analytical stability.
   Conclusion: We conclude the validity of blood samples from a prehospital environment.

AB  - The purpose. The purpose of the study is a generalization of international experience with regard to marketing efficiency control and development of qualitative and quantitative methods to be implemented in the estimation of marketing activity of TNCs. Methodology. The survey is based on research, conducted for 60 companies in the spring of 2015 (32% of which were Ukrainian and 68% - offices and affiliates of international companies), namely Bayer, Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co, Mondelez, Mars, Mintel, Cargill, and many others. The practical results of monitoring the effectiveness of annual plans of named companies done by authors through implementing original author' methodology based on presenting key performance indicators (KPI). Results. The theoretical approaches to the estimation of marketing efficiency are analysed. The conditions, under which the organization is working by analysing external environment and internal company's potential, are determined. It is substantiated by the authors that direct development of marketing plans should be based on marketing objectives, developed as a result of the situational analysis. It is proved that monitoring the effectiveness of annual plans may be done by implementing key performance indicators that enable to develop quantitative evaluation system of the organization's strategy, based on control of its goals. The results of the research allowed authors to distinguish two major groups of effectiveness indicators for TNCs, which are financial and marketing indicators. In this standpoint, financial indicators are divided into costs: productivity and profitability indicators and to the marketing effectiveness indicators belong market indexes, competitiveness indexes, and client's indicators. Practical implications. The proposed methodology can be implemented for the qualitative and quantitative estimation of marketing effectiveness not only in TNCs but in small and medium business companies as well. Value/originality. The authors proved that marketing effectiveness indicators provide a weighty addition to traditional indicators of financial stability estimation of TNCs.

AB  - A macrofloral assemblage dominated by elements of the Euramerican dryland biome is described from the Brazil Formation in Clay County, Indiana (Illinois Basin). Fossils were recovered from a thin heterolithic unit between a shallow-marine bed and the paleosol beneath the Minshall Coal, a Middle Pennsylvanian succession deposited near the Atokan-Desmoinesian and Bolsovian-Asturian boundaries. Sedimentological indicators imply accumulation under a seasonal climate, including interbedded siltstone and sandstone deposited during flashfloods, intraclasts eroded from local sources, and charcoal produced by wildfires. The macrofloral assemblage is consistent with a dryland setting, being dominated by large, coriaceous gymnosperm leaves with mesic to xeric traits, including Cordaites spp. indet., Lesleya sp. indet., and Taeniopteris sp. cf. T. multinervia. Sphenopsids and ferns typical of the wetland biome are rare. In contrast, the microfloral assemblage is dominated by fern spores, with lesser lycopsid spores and cordaitalean pollen. The succession indicates that the dryland biome predominated during late regression, prior to the onset of perhumid conditions that resulted in peat accumulation at late lowstand. However, the abundance of palynomorphs from wetland vegetation implies gradual fragmentation of the prevailing dryland flora and replacement by the wetland biome in the transition to glacial maximum. The taphonomic and paleobiogeographic context confirms that floras adapted to seasonal moisture deficit periodically dispersed into tropical lowlands, rather than being transported from extrabasinal' or upland' environments. The precocious occurrence of Taeniopteris, more typical of Late Pennsylvanian and Permian floras, may be the earliest record of the fossil-genus, and exemplifies the association of derived plant taxa with dryland habitats. The predominance of broad-leaved gymnosperms with mesic to xeric characters suggests that dryland communities contained more slow-growing and long-lived plants than contemporaneous wetland floras.

AB  - Background: As in most European countries, mental health care has shifted from large hospitals to smaller community based settings in Portugal. Our study objectives were to determine: a) the characteristics of users of mental health residential facilities in Portugal; b) the quality of care provided comparing community and hospital units; and c) to investigate associations between quality of care, service and service users' characteristics and experiences of care.
   Methods: All longer term mental health units in Portugal providing on-site staffed support for at least 12 h per day were assessed with the Quality Indicator for Rehabilitative Care (QuIRC), a standardised tool completed by the unit manager. The QuIRC rates seven domains of care (Living Environment, Therapeutic Environment, Treatments and Interventions, Self/Management and Autonomy, Recovery Based Practice, Social Inclusion, and Human Rights). A random sample of service users were interviewed using standardised measures of autonomy, experiences of care and quality of life.
   Results: Most (60 %) of the 42 units were in Lisbon and surrounding districts with 50 % based in the community and 50 % in hospital settings. They had a mean of 11.5 beds. Service users (n = 278) were mainly men (66.2 %), with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (72.7 %), and a mean age of 49.4 years. Community units scored higher than hospital units on the Living Environment, Treatments and Interventions, and Self-Management and Autonomy domains of the QuIRC. Increased service user age was negatively associated with all but one domain. All QuIRC domains were positively associated with service users' autonomy and experiences of care.
   Conclusions: Investing in better quality, community based mental health facilities is associated with better outcomes for service users who require longer term support.

AB  - Since anthropogenic activities have become concentrated along rivers, river regulations have strongly reduced the lateral connectivity by separating rivers from their floodplains. Consequently riparian habitat heterogeneity and the related species diversity are degrading, especially in highly modified prealpine rivers. Riverbank revitalisation measures aim at mitigating this degradation and river restoration projects have become widespread. Nonetheless, little knowledge exists about their specific outcome, as standardised monitoring programs are missing. The aim of this study is to systematically compare vegetation change in response to three contrasting measures of bank diversification, i.e. embankment removal, sand input or gravel addition. Moreover, the influence of these measures on adjacent vegetation is studied. Conclusions were drawn on the basis of three common goals of restoration projects: (i) improvement of vegetation structure, (ii) increase of species diversity, and (iii) characteristic species composition. The field work was done along River Inn northeast of Munich. Vegetation structure, species identity and cover as well as selected habitat variables were recorded in a stratified randomised sampling design; variation between measures was analysed using uni- and multivariate statistics. We detected great differences in the effect of the three measures two years after implementation. Embankment removal initiated highly dynamic habitats where plant establishment was difficult. The input of sand led to a rather homogenous species composition, at least partly because the habitats were productive and therefore most likely will develop to tall reed stands or riparian forests. After gravel addition the restored sites remained relatively open, while riparian pioneer species could colonise. Vegetation structure and composition of adjacent reed stands were positively affected. The results indicate how restoration outcomes can vary depending on the specific measures chosen. This confirms the need for careful consideration of the pursued goals and site-specific conditions prior to implementation as well as long-term monitoring after implementation.

AB  - Soil salinity and alkalinity are important abiotic components that frequently have critical effects on crop growth, productivity and quality. Developing soybean cultivars with high salt tolerance is recognized as an efficient way to maintain sustainable soybean production in a salt stress environment. However, the genetic mechanism of the tolerance must first be elucidated. In this study, 257 soybean cultivars with 135 SSR markers were used to perform epistatic association mapping for salt tolerance. Tolerance was evaluated by assessing the main root length (RL), the fresh and dry weights of roots (FWR and DWR), the biomass of seedlings (BS) and the length of hypocotyls (LH) of healthy seedlings after treatments with control, 100 mM NaCl or 10 mM Na2CO3 solutions for approximately one week under greenhouse conditions. A total of 83 QTL-by-environment (QE) interactions for salt tolerance index were detected: 24 for LR, 12 for FWR, 11 for DWR, 15 for LH and 21 for BS, as well as one epistatic QTL for FWR. Furthermore, 86 QE interactions for alkaline tolerance index were found: 17 for LR, 16 for FWR, 17 for DWR, 18 for LH and 18 for BS. A total of 77 QE interactions for the original trait indicator were detected: 17 for LR, 14 for FWR, 4 for DWR, 21 for LH and 21 for BS, as well as 3 epistatic QTL for BS. Small-effect QTL were frequently observed. Several soybean genes with homology to Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean salt tolerance genes were found in close proximity to the above QTL. Using the novel alleles of the QTL detected above, some elite parental combinations were designed, although these QTL need to be further confirmed. The above results provide a valuable foundation for fine mapping, cloning and molecular breeding by design for soybean alkaline and salt tolerance.

AB  - Heavy natural disturbance in large protected areas of former commercial forests increasingly evokes European parliaments to call for management intervention because a loss of habitats and species is feared. In contrast, natural early successional habitats have recently been recognised as important for conservation. Current knowledge in this field mostly results from studies dealing only with selected taxa. Here we analyse the success of species across 24 lineages of three kingdoms in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) after 15 years of a European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) outbreak that led to rapid canopy opening. Using indicator species analysis, we found 257 species with a significant preference for open forests and 149 species with a preference for closed forests, but only 82 species with a preference for the stand conditions transitional between open and closed forests. The large number of species with a preference for open forests across lineages supports the role of this bark beetle as a keystone species for a broad array of species. The slowdown of the outbreak after 15 years in the core zone of the national park resulted in less than half of the area being affected, due to variability in stand ages and tree species mixtures. Our case study is representative of the tree species composition and size of many large protected montane areas in Central European countries and illustrates that (1) natural disturbances increase biodiversity in formerly managed forests and (2) a montane protected area spanning 10,000 ha of low range mountains is likely sufficient to allow natural disturbances without a biased loss of closed-forest species.

AB  - Background: Statins are widely used drugs for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Though relatively safe, some individuals taking statins experience rhabdymyolysis, muscle pain, and cramping, a condition termed statin-induced myopathy (SIM). To determine if mutations in the skeletal muscle calcium (Ca2+) release channel, ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), enhance the sensitivity to SIM we tested the effects of simvastatin, the statin that produces the highest incidence of SIM in humans, in mice with a mutation (Y524S, 'YS') in RyR1. This mutation is associated with malignant hyperthermia in humans. Exposure of mice with the YS mutation to mild elevations in environmental temperature produces a life-threatening hypermetabolic response (HMR) that is characterized by increased oxygen consumption (VO2), sustained muscle contractures, rhabdymyolysis, and elevated core body temperature.
   Methods: We assessed the ability of simvastatin to induce a hypermetabolic response in the YS mice using indirect calorimetry and to alter Ca2+ release via RyR1 in isolated flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers from WT and YS mice using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators. We also tested the ability of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) to protect against the simvastatin effects.
   Results: An acute dose of simvastatin triggers a hypermetabolic response in YS mice. In isolated YS muscle fibers, simvastatin triggers an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels by increasing Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). With higher simvastatin doses, a similar cytosolic Ca2+ increase occurs in wild type (WT) muscle fibers. Pre-treatment of YS and WT mice with AICAR prevents the response to simvastatin.
   Conclusions: A mutation in RyR1 associated with malignant hyperthermia increases susceptibility to an adverse response to simvastatin due to enhanced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that RyR1 mutations may underlie enhanced susceptibility to statin-induced myopathies. Our data suggest that AICAR may be useful for treating statin myopathies.

AB  - A 380-cm-long sediment core was acquired from the deep water area of Pumoyum Co, southern Tibet. Twenty-five plant residue samples were selected, and organic carbon stable isotopes were obtained using the AMS C-14 chronological method. The C-14 age and carbon reservoir effect were calibrated with surface sedimentation rate measurements using Pb-210 dating. Results showed that the core sediment deposited over 19 cal ka BP. Based on a multi-proxy analysis of TOC and IC contents, grain size and pollen assemblage data, the palaeoclimatic evolution of Pumoyum Co was reconstructed since the last glacial. Pumoyum Co was a shallow lake prior to 16.2 cal ka BP; although the glacier around the lake began to melt due to increasing temperatures, climate was still cold and dry. In the interval of 16.2-11.8 cal ka BP, the sedimentary environment fluctuated drastically and frequently. Two cold-events occurred at 14.2 and 11.8 cal ka BP, and these may correspond to the Older Dryas and the Younger Dryas events, respectively. After 11.8 cal ka BP, Pumoyun Co developed into the deep lake as it is now. The lake water temperature was relatively lower at that time because of influx of cold water from glacial meltwater entering the lake. As a result, the multi-proxy indicators showed no sign of warm conditions. Comparisons between the sedimentary record of Pumoyum Co with that of other lakes of the same age in southern Tibet indicate a warmer climate following the last deglaciation influenced the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. These results imply that the southwest Asian monsoon gradually became stronger since the deglaciation during its expansion to the inner plateau. The glacial-supplied water of the lake responded sensitively to cold-events. The entire southern Tibet region was dominantly influenced climatically by the southwest Asian monsoon during the Holocene.

AB  - Background: Relatively little is known about the degree of inter-specific variability in visual scanning strategies in species with laterally placed eyes (e. g., birds). This is relevant because many species detect prey while perching; therefore, head movement behavior may be an indicator of prey detection rate, a central parameter in foraging models. We studied head movement strategies in three diurnal raptors belonging to the Accipitridae and Falconidae families.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used behavioral recording of individuals under field and captive conditions to calculate the rate of two types of head movements and the interval between consecutive head movements. Cooper's Hawks had the highest rate of regular head movements, which can facilitate tracking prey items in the visually cluttered environment they inhabit (e. g., forested habitats). On the other hand, Red-tailed Hawks showed long intervals between consecutive head movements, which is consistent with prey searching in less visually obstructed environments (e. g., open habitats) and with detecting prey movement from a distance with their central foveae. Finally, American Kestrels have the highest rates of translational head movements (vertical or frontal displacements of the head keeping the bill in the same direction), which have been associated with depth perception through motion parallax. Higher translational head movement rates may be a strategy to compensate for the reduced degree of eye movement of this species.
   Conclusions: Cooper's Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and American Kestrels use both regular and translational head movements, but to different extents. We conclude that these diurnal raptors have species-specific strategies to gather visual information while perching. These strategies may optimize prey search and detection with different visual systems in habitat types with different degrees of visual obstruction.

AB  - Long-term monitoring is important for ensuring effective conservation of raptor populations. Raptors also can serve as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem condition. Therefore, effective monitoring of raptor populations yields the added benefit of helping to evaluate the status of ecosystems. Spring counts of migrating raptors at concentration points may contribute to these goals, particularly by providing insight into the vital demographic rates underlying population trends. Although much is known about the monitoring value of autumn migration counts in North America, little research has addressed the value of spring counts. We compared counts at seven spring watchsites to those at seven autumn watchsites matched by region (Southwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast) to assess the value of spring counts for population monitoring. Our analyses suggested that population indexes derived from spring migration counts provided estimates of population change that differed overall from autumn migration counts in the same region. The concordance of spring and autumn trends was higher in the Southwest anti Northeast than in the Great Lakes region, suggesting greater variation in the seasonal representation of populations in the latter region. The average precision of spring trend estimates was better than for autumn estimates in the same region in two of three regions, anti the estimated rates of change often were lower in spring. Spring counts enhanced the ability to estimate population trends for species that are less common in autumn counts, including the Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus) and Red-shouldered Hawk (B. linealus). To realize fully the value of spring counts, we recommend the establishment of additional spring watchsites in areas that concentrate migrants in autumn, but do so to a lesser extent in spring, as well as additional research to define the populations sampled by autumn and spring counts.

AB  - The Rodalquilar mineral deposits (SE Spain) were formed in Miocene time in relation to caldera volcanic episodes and dome emplacement phenomena. Two types of ore deposits are recognized: (1) the El Cinto epithermal, Au-As high sulphidation vein and breccia type; and (2) peripheral low sulphidation epithermal Pb-Zn-Cu-(Au) veins. The first metallurgical plants for gold extraction were set up in the 1920s and used amalgamation. Cyanide leaching began in the 1930s and the operations lasted until the mid 1960s. The latter left a huge pile of similar to 900,000-1,250,000 m(3) of abandoned As-rich tailings adjacent to the town of Rodalquilar. A frustrated initiative to reactivate the El Cinto mines took place in the late 1980s and left a heap leaching pile of similar to 20,000 m(3). Adverse mineralogical and structural conditions favoured metal and metalloid dispersion from the ore bodies into soils and sediments, whereas mining and metallurgical operations considerably aggravated contamination. We present geochemical data for soils, tailings and wild plant species. Compared to world and local baselines, both the tailings and soils of Rodalquilar are highly enriched in As (mean concentrations of 950 and 180 mu g g(-1), respectively). Regarding plants, only the concentrations of As, Bi and Sb in Asparagus horridus, Launaea arborescens, Salsola genistoides, and Stipa tenacissima are above the local baselines. Bioaccumulation factors in these species are generally lower in the tailings, which may be related to an exclusion strategy for metal tolerance. The statistical analysis of geochemical data from soils and plants allows recognition of two well-differentiated clusters of elements (As-Bi-Sb-Se-Sn-Te and Cd-Cu-Hg-Pb-Zn), which ultimately reflect the strong chemical influence of both El Cinto and peripheral deposits mineral assemblages.

AB  - Explaining the factors that determine the distribution of mating success among males is essential to our understanding of sexual selection. Classic theory has focused on how competition among males and female choice for traits of the male or his territory drive sexual selection. Recent theory has also shown that female mate choice copying can alter the strength and direction of selection on male traits. Yet, we know very little about the prevalence and importance of nonindependent female choice in wild populations. In a species with male territoriality and paternal care (the ocellated wrasse, Symphodus ocellatus), I first show that females express nonindependent mate choice, responding both to the recent mating success of the male and to the presence of other spawning females rather than to variation in male courtship or defence of the nest. Females were significantly more likely to spawn with the same male when another spawning female was present than when they were alone at the nest, providing some of the first direct evidence of female mate choice copying under natural conditions in the wild. I further show that a short-term experimental increase in a territorial male's mating success attracts more females in the future and increases male paternal care. These observed patterns of female choice and male care are consistent with female choice for the direct benefits of male care where the best indicator trait of male parental effort is the mating behaviour of other females rather than male courtship behaviour or physical traits.

AB  - Trichlorfon (TCF) is a widely used pesticide, which according to some epidemiological and experimental data, is suspected of being aneugenic in human and mouse cells. In particular, in vitro studies in mouse oocytes showed the induction of aneuploidy and polyploidy at the first meiotic division and of severe morphological alterations of the second meiotic spindle. We have tested the hypothesis that an acute treatment of mice with TCF might similarly affect chromosome segregation in maturing oocytes. Superovulated MF-1 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 400 mg/kg TCF or orally administered with 600 mg/kg TCF either at the time of or 4 h after human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) injection. Oocytes were harvested 17 h after HCG and metaphase II chromosomes were cytogenetically analyzed. No significant increase of aneuploid or polyploid cells was detected at any treatment condition. A significant (p < 0.001) decrease of metaphases showing premature chromatid separation or premature anaphase II in all TCF-treated groups with respect to controls suggested that TCF treatment may have delayed the first meiotic division. To evaluate possible effects of the pesticide upon the second meiotic division, a group of females orally treated with 600 mg/kg TCF at resumption of meiosis was mated with untreated males and zygotes were collected for cytogenetic analysis. No evidence of aneuploidy induction was obtained, but the frequency of polyploid zygotes was increased fivefold over the control level (p < 0.01). Such polyploid embryos might have arisen from fertilization of oocytes that were either meiotically delayed and still in metaphase I at fertilization or progressed through anaphase II without cytokinesis. These findings show that in vivo studies on aneuploidy induction in oocytes may yield results different from those obtained by in vitro experiments and that both kinds of data may be necessary for risk assessment of environmentally relevant exposures.

AB  - A variety of changes are occurring in the ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, but information about the mechanisms of change has been relatively limited, due in part to the region's remoteness and subarctic conditions. Any number of ecosystem components or indicators could be used to exemplify this dilemma, but here we point to the salmon shark (Lamna ditropis, Lamnidae) as an example of a species that can potentially mediate considerable ecosystem change due to its high trophic level, but for which some basic information is lacking despite attracting some interesting research and widespread rumours and anecdotal evidence of increased abundance. Increases in the abundance of sharks such as salmon sharks in this region during the 1990s, if true, may help explain other observed changes such as declines in ocean survival rates of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp., Salmonidae) in the region and declines in some wild salmon stocks. Mechanisms that could cause salmon shark increases in Alaskan coastal waters include: (i) increases in sea temperature since the 1970s allowing distributional shifts of this species and changes in the abundance or distribution of their prey; (ii) the 1992 banning of high seas drift gillnets; and (iii) indirect fisheries effects such as competitive release of salmon sharks in the North Pacific transition region and towards the more southern geographic extent of their annual migration as the result of fishery-related reductions in blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) and other pelagic predators. The relative plausibility of these alternative explanations can be evaluated using combinations of existing ecosystem models and empirical research and monitoring programmes including local and indigenous observations.

AB  - Municipal wastewater has been applied as a fertilizer to coniferous forest in northern Sweden with the additional aims to purify the wastewater and reduce the treatment costs. This practice has the potential to introduce pathogenic microorganisms from the applied wastewater or sludge to the environment, with a subsequent risk of transmission to exposed humans or animals. Seasonality and climatological conditions, in particular low temperature, humidity and low sun intensity will furthermore affect the persistence of pathogens in the forest in northern Scandinavia and may therefore enhance the survival and thereby the exposure risk. The survival of two pathogens (Salmonella senftenberg and Campylobacter coli) and four fecal indicator organisms; bacteria strains (E. coli and E. fecalis) and bacteriophages (S. typhimurium phage 28 B and phi x174), used here as viral models, was evaluated in microcosms (60 Litre terrariums) with two vegetation regimes (characterized as moss and lichen) at selected temperatures (+3 degrees C to +27 degrees C) and artificial light exposure (light and dark). Salmonella persisted in high numbers after 35 days in the vegetation, indicating a potential risk for further transmission. Neither the vegetation regime nor temperature or light exposure as independent factors governed the reduction of the indicator bacteria and the bacteriophages. The persistence of the indicator organisms was generally best supported in the moss vegetation at low temperature in the dark, where the time for a 90% reduction (T-90) was in the range from 8 days (E. coli) to 31 days (Salmonella phage). The die-off characteristics found in this study provide baseline values for further validations in the field and verify that the purification and reuse of municipal wastewater in coniferous forest could potentially be responsible for transmission of fecal pathogens to humans and animals.

AB  - Surface sediment samples for analysis of modern foraminiferal assemblages were collected from 32 sites on the western and northern Iceland shelf during cruise B997 of the Icelandic ship Bjarni Saemundsson. The purpose of the study is to provide a basis for interpreting the variations in foraminiferal content in late glacial through Holocene sediments from cores at the same sites. Cluster analysis and principal components analysis of the benthic foraminiferal data and associated modern environmental parameters including hydrography, water depth, and sediment characteristics show that large progressive changes in the foraminiferal assemblages coincide with changes in the dominant oceanic surface currents and water masses around Iceland. The western areas of the shelf are overlain by relatively warm and saline Atlantic Water of the Irminger Current. The western shelf fauna is dominated by Cassidulina laevigata and other boreal species, whereas the planktic fauna is dominated by dextrally coiling Neogloboquadrina pachyderma. In Djupall, off the Northwest Peninsula, and in the shallow nearshore sites on the northern shelf, the boreal elements of the fauna diminish and arctic species become more important. However, the dominant species in these areas are Cibicides lobatulus and Astrononion gallowayi, attesting to winnowing of the shallow shelf areas by currents. In Isafjardardjup, the large fjord indenting the Northwest Peninsula, Cassidulina reniforme and Elphidium excavatum dominate the fauna as a result of cooler waters and more variable salinity conditions. A very large faunal shift is registered in the deep basins of the northern shelf. This faunal shift coincides with large changes in salinity and temperature stratification of the water column, reflecting the presence of the East Iceland Current. The fauna in the deep basins on the northern shelf are dominated by C. neoteretis, an indicator of modified Atlantic Water, and infaunal species that reflect organic fluxes to the seabed: Nonionellina labradorica and Melonis barleeanus, and the arctic species Islandiella norcrossi and I. helenae.

TI  - Environmental challenges to operational isation of South African rainfall enhancement
T2  - WATER SA
LA  - English
CP  - Biennial Conference of the Water-Institute-of-South-Africa
AB  - Most of the atmospheric moisture in systems moving across South Africa leaves the sub-continent as the weather systems move out over the ocean, only a tenth of it falls on the landmass as rain. An increase in the efficiency of the atmospheric moisture delivery system by means of rainfall enhancement is therefore an attractive concept. Rainfall enhancement functions by either providing additional Cloud Condensation Nuclei or Ice forming Nuclei that will beneficially influence the precipitation formation process, improving the efficiency of moisture to rainfall conversion.
   Systematic South African research into rainfall enhancement started in the 1970s. The South African Rainfall Enhancement Programme (SAREP), initiated in the late 1990s, is the most recent in a series of studies and was the first semi-operational rainfall enhancement project to occur in South Africa as a response to drought conditions. In a recent study (DWAF, 2004) to finalise SAREP and provide guidance on operationalising rainfall enhancement, it was recommended that environmental impact assessment must be undertaken before this technology is implemented further.
   Rainfall enhancement falls specifically within the jurisdiction of the National Water Act (NWA) and the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA). A licence to undertake rainfall enhancement activities is required from the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry after an appropriate environmental impact assessment has been undertaken to inform his decision. This paper proposes an approach to fulfil the legal requirements for operationalising future rainfall enhancement.
   The interaction between the science of rainfall enhancement and the ability of scientific disciplines to determine relevant environmental impacts, to appropriately inform the decision-making process, is specifically highlighted. The data requirements identified by scientists during the study varies in duration and resource needs and does not differentiate between ongoing scientific research and the requisite information required for informed decision making. This paper contemplates an approach which provides for holistic and co-ordinated investigation of South African rainfall enhancement into the future.

AB  - This article reviews previously reported data on the performance, environmental fate, and environmental modeling of Sea-Nine(TM) 211 antifoulant(2) (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one). Since organotins are an industry standard, the environmental fate and environmental modeling results of tributyltin (TBT) are compared to those of the Sea-Nine antifoulant for reference. Laboratory and field tests results have shown Sea-Nine antifoulant to be highly effective. Five years of commercial use has confirmed this. Sea-Nine antifoulant and TBT were compared in an environmental risk assessment to predict their effects on the environment. Sea-Nine antifoulant was degraded rapidly in the environment by microorganisms. Its half-life in aerobic and anaerobic microcosm studies was less than 1 h. TBT degraded slowly under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with half-lives ranging from 6 to 9 months. The degradation products of Sea-Nine antifoulant were ring-opened compounds with greatly reduced toxicity. TBT degraded to dibutyltin species, which were still toxic and persistent in the environment. Bioaccumulation studies in fish showed essentially no bioaccumulation of the Sea-Nine biocide. The bioaccumulation of TBT was significant, with bioconcentration factors as high as 10 000. The Sea-Nine antifoulant showed no chronic or reproductive toxicity to marine species, while TBT showed a wide range of effects on growth, development, and reproduction at levels as low as 2 parts per trillion (ppt). Computer modeling using the Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS) predicted maximum concentrations of Sea-Nine biocide of up to 10 ppt, far below the maximum acceptable environmental concentration (MAEC) of 630 ppt. The maximum predicted concentrations of TBT were as high as 345 ppt, far above the UK Environmental Standard in seawater of 2 ppt. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - What, if any, is the pattern of change of the late Holocene sea-level curve? If a common pattern exists, can it be better discerned in the non-glaciated, tectonically stable regions of the Southern Hemisphere? And is sea level data more reliable from one type of marine sample than another? To begin an investigation of these questions, we present a review of regressing time-elevation plots from the low to mid latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere based upon the differential between modern and past levels of various fixed biological indicators (mainly calcareous tubeworms and corals) stranded up to similar to 2 m above present relative sea levels. The sample sets come from our work in southeast Australia and comparable work from north-east Australia, the Pacific Islands and Brazil. We show that, using evidence obtained from fixed intertidal tubeworm species, there is no statistical exclusivity between the smooth and oscillating polynomials, but corals are more problematic. In situ tubeworm species with their reduced error bars in comparison to corals fulfil the condition of providing more robust results for statistical analysis. Regression curves based on these species point to cross-regional similarities in the pattern of sea-level movement of the last 6000 years across the lower latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. These statistical exercises, while not able to yield definitive conclusions, can highlight statistically equally Likely alternative patterns of sea-level movement which can then be tested by field evidence. They can also give useful indications of the quality of sea-level data obtained from different biological sources, as in the difficulties in the use of corals compared to common intertidal tubeworm species.

AB  - 1. A recently developed method of measuring cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering in intact red cells was applied to re-evaluate the intracellular Ca2+ binding properties of the Ca2+ chelators benz2 and BAPTA. Incorporation of the free chelators was accomplished by incubating the cells with the acetoxymethyl ester forms (benz2 AM or BAPTA AM). The divalent cation ionophore A23187 was used to induce equilibrium distribution of Ca2+ between cells and medium. Ca-45(2+) was added stepwise to cell suspensions in the presence and absence of external BAPTA. To induce full Ca2+ equilibration, the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump was inhibited either by depleting the cells of ATP or by adding vanadate to the cell suspension.
   2. The properties of the incorporated chelators were assessed from the difference in cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering between chelator-free and chelator-loaded cells, over a wide range of intracellular ionized calcium concentrations ([Ca2+](i)), from nanomolar to millimolar.
   3. Under the experimental conditions applied, incorporation of benz2 and BAPTA into the red cells increased their Ca2+ buffering capacity by 300-600 mu mol (340 g Hb)(-1). The intracellular apparent Ca2+ dissociation constants (K-Di) were about 500 nM for benz2 and 800 nM for BAPTA, values much higher than those reported for standard salt solutions (K-D) of about 40 and 130 nhl, respectively. These results suggest that, contrary to earlier observations, the intracellular red cell environment may cause large shifts in the apparent Ca2+ binding behaviour of incorporated chelators.
   4. The possibility that the observed K-D shifts are due to reversible binding of the chelators to haemoglobin is considered, and the implications of the present results for early estimates of physiological [Ca2+](i) levels is discussed.

AB  - Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic lagoons of barrier reefs provide great potential as sedimentary archives focusing on paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes as well as on event deposition. Sediment sources include lagoonal carbonate production, the marginal reef and the volcanic hinterland. Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic continent attached coastal lagoons have been intensively studied, however, their isolated oceanic counterparts have been widely disregarded. Here, we present a new model of Holocene sediment dynamics in the barrier-reef lagoon of Bora Bora based on sedimentological, paleontological, geochronological and geochemical data. The lagoonal succession started with a Pleistocene soil representing the Lowstand Systems Tract. As the rising Holocene sea inundated the carbonate platform, peat accumulated locally similar to 10,650-9400 years BP. Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation started ca. 8700-5500 years BP and represents the Transgressive Systems Tract. During that time, sediments were characterized by relatively coarse grain size and contained high amounts of terrestrial material from the volcanic hinterland as well as carbonate sediments mainly produced within the lagoon. Siliciclastic content decreases throughout the Holocene. After the rising sea had reached its modern level, sand aprons formed between reef crest and lagoon creating transport pathways for reef-derived material leading to carbonate-dominated sedimentation ca. 6000-3009 years BP during the Highstand Systems Tract. However, mainly fine material was transported and accumulated in the lagoon while coarser grains were retained on the prograding sand apron. From ca. 4500-500 years BP, significant variations in grain-size, total organic carbon as indicator for primary productivity, Ca and Cl element intensities as qualitative indicators for carbonate availability and lagoonal salinity are seen. Such patterns could indicate event (re-)deposition and correlate with contemporaneous event deposits found in the lagoon of nearby Tahaa, which are supposed to be induced by elevated cyclone activity. Correspondingly, enhanced erosion and run-off from the volcanic hinterland as well as lower lagoonal salinity would be associated with intense rainfall during repeated cyclone landfall. Increased amounts of coarse-grained sediment from marginal reef areas would be transported into the lagoon. However, Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios as proxies for terrigenous sediment delivery have incessantly declined since the mid-Holocene. Also, benthic foraminiferal faunas do not validate reef-to-lagoon transport of sediment. Alternatively, the apparent onset of higher hydrodynamic energy conditions can be explained by more permanent southeast trade winds and higher-than-present sea level, which are supposed for the mid-late Holocene in the south Pacific. Sustained winds would have flushed higher amounts of open ocean water into the lagoon enhancing primary productivity and the amount of pelagic organisms within the lagoon while lowering lagoonal salinity. We propose the shift towards coarser-grained sedimentation patterns during the mid-late Holocene to reflect sediment-load shedding of sand aprons due to oversteepening of slopes at sand apron/lagoon edges during times of stronger trades and higher-than-present sea level of the Highstand Systems Tract, which led to redeposition of sediment even within the lagoon center. Modern conditions including a sea-level fall to modern level were reached ca.
   1000 years BP, and lagoonal infill has been determined to a large part by fine-grained carbonate-dominated sediments produced within the lagoon and derived from the marignal reef. Infill of lagoonal accommodation space via sand aprons is estimated to be up to six times higher than infill by lagoonal background sedimentation and emphasizes the importance of the progradation of sand aprons. Contrary to the commonly supposed assumption that coarse grained sediment layers within fine-grained lagoonal successions represent overwash events induced by storms or periods of higher storm activity, we postulate a new model of long-term lagoonal sediment dynamics including sea level, climatic change and geomorphological variation of the barrier reef lagoon.

AB  - This study evaluated the performance of a passive multi-unit field-pilot operating for 16 months to treat acid mine drainage (AMD) from a coal mine in Colombia Andean Paramo. The multi-unit field-pilot involved a combination of a pre-treatment unit (550 L) filled with dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS), and six passive biochemical reactors (PBRs; 220 L) under two configurations: open (PBRs-A) and closed (PBRs-B) to the atmosphere. The AMD quality was 1200 +/- 91 mg L-1 Fe, 38.0 +/- 1.3 mg L-1 Mn, 8.5 +/- 1.6 mg L-1 Zn, and 3200 +/- 183.8 mg L-1 SO42-, at pH 2.8. The input and output effluents were monitored to establish AMD remediation. Physicochemical stability of the post-treatment solids, including metals (Fe2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+) and sulfates for environmental contamination from reactive mixture post-treatment, was also assessed.
   The passive multi-unit field-pilot achieved a total removal of 74% SO42-, 63% Fe2+, and 48% Mn2+ with the line of PBRs-A, and 91% SO42-, 80% Fe2+, and 66% Mn2+ with the line of PBRs-B, as well as 99% removal for Zn2+ without significant differences (p < 0.05) between the two lines. The study of the physicochemical stability of the post-treatment solids showed they can produce acidic leachates that could release large quantities of Fe and Mn, if they are disposed in oxidizing conditions; contact with water or any other leaching solutions must be avoided. Therefore, these post-treatment solids cannot be disposed of in a municipal landfill. The differences in configuration between PBRs, open or closed to the atmosphere, induced changes in the performance of the passive multi-unit field-pilot during AMD remediation.

AB  - Genomic selection (GS) has the potential to improve the selection gain for complex traits in crop breeding programs from resource-poor countries. The GS model performance in multi-environment (ME) trials was assessed for 141 advanced breeding lines under four field environments via cross-predictions. We compared prediction accuracy (PA) of two GS models with or without accounting for the environmental variation on four quantitative traits of significant importance, i.e., grain yield (GRYLD), thousand-grain weight, days to heading, and days to maturity, under North and Central Indian conditions. For each trait, we generated PA using the following two different ME cross-validation (CV) schemes representing actual breeding scenarios: (1) predicting untested lines in tested environments through the ME model (ME_CV1) and (2) predicting tested lines in untested environments through the ME model (ME_CV2). The ME predictions were compared with the baseline single-environment (SE) GS model (SE_CV1) representing a breeding scenario, where relationships and interactions are not leveraged across environments. Our results suggested that the ME models provide a clear advantage over SE models in terms of robust trait predictions. Both ME models provided 2-3 times higher prediction accuracies for all four traits across the four tested environments, highlighting the importance of accounting environmental variance in GS models. While the improvement in PA from SE to ME models was significant, the CV1 and CV2 schemes did not show any clear differences within ME, indicating the ME model was able to predict the untested environments and lines equally well. Overall, our results provide an important insight into the impact of environmental variation on GS in smaller breeding programs where these programs can potentially increase the rate of genetic gain by leveraging the ME wheat breeding trials.</p>

AB  - - Vegetation and climate changes in southern Brazil are described based on the palynological analysis from marine core SIS 188, collected on the continental slope, which records the interval between 47.8 and 7.4 cal ka BP. The pollen record indicates that the grasslands dominated the landscape in southern Brazil throughout the studied period. During the last glacial period, the forests were reduced. Between 32.8 and 20.2 cal ka BP, there is an increase in grassland and reduction of arboreal palynomorphs, coinciding with colder and drier climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). From 30 to 25.2 cal ka BP, an increase in the sedimentation rate and concentration of most pollen indicators is observed. This change could be related to low sea level, which exposed the continental shelf to eolian erosion and fluvial inputs that transported sediments and palynomorphs to the ocean. A significant decrease in sedimentation rate is recorded between 19.5 and 12.6 cal ka BP, probably related to sea-level rise during deglaciation. During deglaciation and beginning of the Holocene, the increase in arboreal pollen indicates the expansion of forests, reflecting warmer and wetter climate. Heinrich event 1 is marked by a peak in the percentages of the arboreal vegetation at 15.9 cal ka BP. Around 8.5 cal ka BP, there seems to be another interval of higher moisture, indicated by the composition of the palynological association, formed by pteridophytes Blechnum, Huperzia, Polypodiaceae, Pteridaceae and Cyatheaceae. These results show that the palynological record from the SIS188 marine core is sensitive to global climatic changes and can provide a reliable paleovegetational reconstruction for the continental environment.

AB  - The extensive anthropogenic activities and their potential impacts on lakes during the Anthropocene could be recorded in the sediments. In this study, the composition of biomarkers (i.e., n-alkanes and n-fatty acids), total organic carbon (TOC), and particle size in 210Pb-dated sediment cores from West Dongting Lake were investigated to trace the historical trend of anthropogenic inputs and their environmental significance. The TOC content was in the range of 3.15-27.32 mg g-1. The n-alkanes and n-fatty acids were distributed from C11-C33 and C12:0-C34:0, respectively. The short- and long-chain biomarkers accounted for a significant proportion of the total. Aquatic plants and algae living in West Dongting Lake were the main source (short-chain) followed by leaf waxes derived from terrestrial C3 plants (long-chain), as demonstrated by their concentrations. The variations of the key indicators i.e., the carbon preference index (CPI), aquatic plant n-alkane proxy (Paq), vascular plant n-alkane proxy (Pwax), and the ratio of unit short- to long-chain n-alkanes (L/H) also indicated that the aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions were mainly composed of short- and long-chain biomarkers. The sedimentary biomarkers had a significant temporal heterogeneity, which was controlled by different factors and sedimentary processes. Fine particles (<16 mu m) were the dominant particle size (66.91%-78.52%) in the sediment. Both values of the dry/ wet climate proxy (Kd) and average particle size were consistent over time. The dominance of terrestrial C3 plantderived long-chain molecules gradually changed, with algae-derived short-chain molecules then becoming dominant. The hot and drought climate conditions and enhanced agricultural inputs from 1855 to 2019 in the watershed resulted in a decrease of terrestrial C3 plants and rapid growth of algae in the lake water.

AB  - Biochar, a form of porous pyrogenic carbon, has been shown to influence soil physicochemical properties and increase crop yield. However, it is unclear whether biochar application at different rates will improve crop performance in a clay soil under drought conditions through increasing plant water uptake. Here, we examined performance of soybean after amendment with biochar (pyrolysed at similar to 400 degrees C for 5 h) at four application rates (0, 25, 50 and 100 t ha(-1)) and grown under three moisture regimes (40%, 60% and 80% of field capacity). The instantaneous plant water content was determined periodically by recording relative water content, water retention capacity, and water uptake capacity in leaves while the cumulative water stress and water use efficiency (WUE) were determined from aboveground delta C-13 signatures and amount of water applied, respectively. The yield and yield attributes were also recorded. Results showed that across all drought treatments, biochar application significantly enhanced crop growth rate and increased total biomass production with a doubling in yield in the 100 t ha(-1) biochar application. However, the seed yield did not increase with biochar application. Although biochar application improved WUE (biomass produced per unit of water applied), it most likely did not improve plant water uptake, since none of the measured plant water status indicators were affected by biochar. Instead, the enhanced biomass production may have been caused by an improvement in plant nutrition. Possibly, biochar application increased N acquisition through biological nitrogen fixation as there was a significant relationship between nitrogen (N) concentration in aboveground biomass and total biomass production. Moreover, application of biochar increased soil available potassium (K), and enhanced K uptake may have increased stress tolerance in soybean. Therefore, our findings show that biochar could improve plant performance in a clay soil by improving nutrient supply rather than by increasing water uptake.

AB  - The environmental threats of soil subsistence in Jeddah city have been assessed using cross-hole seismic testing. These threats affect the state of health of roads, buildings, near-surface foundations ensuring a reliable and economic infrastructure design, as unanticipated site conditions can cause significant traffic problems, soil subsidence, and structural collapse. Cross-hole seismic testing is of utmost importance in determining velocity profiles of Pand S-waves for environmental hazard assessment. These velocity profiles are required to calculate the geotechnical parameters of soil nearby important structures. A cross hole seismic survey was conducted at boreholes close to Jeddah desalination plant. A sledge hammer horizontally striking a wooden plate was used to generate S-waves polarized in the crossline and inline directions. A vertical hammer hitting a metal plate to generate the P-wave then the first break arrival times were inverted for the P and S-wave velocity structure estimation. The equipment and procedures comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 4428/D 4428M-91 standard test method for cross-hole seismic testing. The estimated velocities were utilized to calculate the elastic moduli, geotechnical parameters and density variations within the mapped area. These parameters agree with the lithological variations of nearsurface sediments from borehole logs. Finally, the study area illustrated soft, fractured, and poorly graded sediments, which, in turn, require special treatment from engineering point of view before establishing the important facilities in the area. These results are highly recommended and have to be considered to mitigate the environmental hazards in Jeddah city. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The United States of America is the major importer of the guar gum in the world, which is mainly grown in deserts of India and Pakistan. There is need to increase guar production in non-traditional areas to ensure steady supply and reduce market volatility. Expanding guar acreage into cooler regions of the southern High Plains or in similar agroclimatic regions of the world is an attractive option. Therefore, a study was conducted in incubators to assess genetic variations among currently available guar cultivars for germination and early growth under cooler temperature ranges. Six temperatures (13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28 degrees C) and six guar cultivars (Kinman, Lewis, Matador, Monument, Santa Cruz and Judd 69) were used. Guar cultivars exhibited significant variations for germination percentage, mean germination time and seed vigor index under lower temperatures, which narrowed as the temperature increased closer to optimum. Mean seed germination percentage of cultivars reached maximum at 22 degrees C. However, speed of germination and seed vigor indices, which are indicators of quick and uniform establishment of guar in the field, continued to increase till 28 degrees C. Kinman, which was the most promising guar cultivar under cooler temperature, reached maximum germination percent at 16 degrees C and had the lowest germination time and highest seed vigor index among cultivars below 16 degrees C. In contrast, Matador reached maximum germination at 26 degrees C. Germination and early seedling traits indicate that it is better to plant guar in warm soils and if needed to plant in cooler conditions, cultivars like Kinman should be used.

AB  - Breast cancer accounts for almost one in four cancer diagnoses in women. Studies in breast cancer patients have identified several molecular markers, indicators of aggressiveness, which help toward more individual therapeutic approaches. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is associated with increased metastatic potential and worst survival rates. Specifically, abnormal EGFR activation leads to altered matrix metalloproteinases' (MMPs) expression and, hence, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in induced migration and invasion. The use of matrix substrates for cell culture gives the opportunity to mimic the natural growth conditions of the cells and their microenvironment, as well as cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of EGFR inhibition, estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) and different matrix substrates [type I collagen and fibronectin (FN)] on the functional properties, expression of MMPs and cell morphology of ER beta-positive TNBC cells and shER beta ones. Our results highlight EGFR as a crucial regulator of the expression and activity levels of MMPs, while ER beta emerges as a mediator of MMP7 and MT1-MMP expression. In addition, the EGFR/ER beta axis impacts the adhesion and invasion potential of breast cancer cells on collagen type I. Images obtained by scanning electron microscope (SEM) from cultures on the different matrix substrates revealed novel observations regarding various structures of breast cancer cells (filopodia, extravesicles, tunneling nanotubes, etc.). Moreover, the significant contribution of EGFR and ER beta in the morphological characteristics of these cells is also demonstrated, hence highlighting the possibility of dual pharmacological targeting.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are abundant marine protists which play an important role in the transfer of energy in the form of organic matter and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Due to their aquatic lifestyle, factors such as water temperature, salinity and pH are key drivers controlling biomass turnover through foraminifera. In this study the influence of salinity on the feeding activity of foraminifera was tested. Two species, Ammonia tepida and Haynesina germanica, were collected from a mudflat in northern Germany (Friedrichskoog) and cultured in the laboratory at 20 degrees C and a light-dark cycle of 16:08 h. A lyophilized algal powder from Dunaliella tertiolecta, which was isotopically enriched with C-13 and N-15, was used as a food source. The feeding experiments were carried out at salinity levels of 11, 24 and 37 practical salinity units (PSU) and were terminated after 1, 5 and 14 d. The quantification of isotope incorporation was carried out by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Ammonia tepida exhibited a 10-fold higher food uptake compared to H. germanica. Furthermore, in A. tepida the food uptake increased with increasing salinity but not in H. germanica. Over time (from 1-5 to 14 d) food C retention increased relative to food N in A. tepida while the opposite was observed for H. germanica. This shows that if the salinity in the German Wadden Sea increases, A. tepida is predicted to exhibit a higher C and N uptake and turnover than H. germanica, with accompanying changes in C and N cycling through the foraminiferal community. The results of this study show how complex and differently food C and N processing of foraminiferal species respond to time and to environmental conditions such as salinity.

AB  - Lime kiln dust (LKD) is a fine particulate material by-product produced during the lime burning processes. Current reuse options are chiefly focused on reuse in the cement industry which are limited by the inherent porosity of this by-product. Due to the presence of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and other elements which can serve as micronutrients to the plants, LKD has the potential to be used as a replacement for conventional liming materials for both soil pH(KCl) increase and plant supplement with secondary major- (Ca and Mg) and micronutrients (Mn, Cu, Zn and Ni). The work described here outlines the investigation of physicochemical properties of pelletized LKD materials and their effect on soil pH(KCl), available Ca and Mg content in the soil as well as straw and grain yields of spring barley. LKD were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive analysis, while detailed chemical analysis of both pelletized LKD and soil was performed using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Pellet size and major element composition were used as chief indicators for the liming capacity of LKD. It was shown that low acidic soil (pH(KCl) 5.4) can be conditioned using fine (0.1-2 mm) pelletized LKD due to the high release rates while coarse pellets (5-8 mm) did not significantly increase available Ca and Mg content in soil and did not reach optimum pH(KCl) range even after 48 weeks. The highest application rate of LKD at 4 t/ha increased spring barley grain yield compared to control but the increase was not statistically significant. Thus, pelletized lime kiln dust could be a potential alternative to natural limestone or dolomite minerals as liming material for acid soils with the pellet size determining the liming kinetics.

AB  - Background and objectives:Variceal bleeding is a serious complication caused by portal hypertension, frequently encountered among cirrhotic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the aspect of the collateral, porto-systemic circulation, as detected by CT are associated with the presence variceal hemorrhage (VH).Materials and Methods:81 cirrhotic patients who underwent a contrast-enhanced CT examination were retrospectively included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: Cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage during the hospital admission concomitant, with the CT examination (n= 33) and group 2-cirrhotic patients, without any variceal hemorrhage in their medical history (n= 48). The diameter of the left gastric vein, the presence or absence and dimensions of oesophageal and gastric varices, paraumbilical veins and splenorenal shunts were the indicators assessed on CT.Results:The univariate analysis showed a significant association between the presence of upper GI bleeding and the diameters of paraoesophageal veins, paragastric veins and left gastric vein respectively, all of these CT parameters being higher in patients with variceal bleeding. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the diameter of the left gastric vein was independently associated with the presence of variceal hemorrhage (OR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.17-2.19),p= 0.003). We found an optimal cut-off value of 3 mm for the diameter of the left gastric vein useful to discriminate among patients with variceal hemorrhage from the ones without it, with a good diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.78, Se = 97%, Sp = 45.8%, PPV = 55.2%, NPV = 95.7%).Conclusions:Our observations point out that an objective CT quantification of porto-systemic circulation can be correlated with the presence of variceal hemorrhage and the diameter of the left gastric vein can be a reliable parameter associated with this condition.

AB  - Reproductive plasticity, the ability of the plant to maintain the ratio between available resources and grain yield should be a useful trait to maintain the coupling between yield and resource availability under low-density management strategies adopted in drought-prone areas. Prolificacy could be an indicator of hybrid reproductive plasticity. The objective of this study was to assess the reproductive plasticity of modern prolific and non-prolific hybrids and its effect on grain yield and yield components in a drought-prone environment. Current hybrids of contrasting prolificacy were tested in shallow soil under different plant densities (2 to 6 pl m(-2)). Crops explored low productivity environments (average 5930 kg ha(-1)) and yield response to plant density was different between prolificacy groups. At 4 pl m(-2) yield was similar between prolific and non-prolific hybrid groups. Prolificacy determined an increase in reproductive plasticity that significantly reduced the yield response to plant density. When plant density was reduced to 2 pl m(-2) yield was maintained for the prolific hybrids while it was reduced more than 25% for the non-prolific ones. The reproductive plasticity of prolific hybrids was associated with an increased capacity of adjusting kernel number to available resources per plant. On the other hand, the increased reproductive plasticity of prolific hybrids did not present detectable yield penalties when plants were grown under stressful conditions (6 pl m(-2)). The lack of response to plant density of prolific hybrids could be interpreted as a reduction in the yield penalty of low-density management strategies. The reduction in plant density increases the ability of the crop to tolerate drought stress and therefore should increases yield stability in drought-prone areas.

AB  - The thermal comfort level of Chinese residents in the hot-summer and cold-winter zone is increasing with economic development in recent years. More district heating and cooling systems were installed in these areas. Supported by the government, ground source heat pump (GSHP) is used as a common environmentally friendly district heating and cooling system in many residential communities. However, the evaluation of the real performance of GSHP is limited, especially limited understanding of the common issue of thermal imbalance of GSHP systems over several years-the mismatch between heat extraction from and rejection to the ground. Performance of GSHP systems can deteriorate over years if the thermal imbalance is significant and not addressed. For GSHP in the hot-summer and cold-winter climate zone, there are few thermal imbalance studies based on real field data and modeling. To address this gap, this paper proposes an integrated simulation model to evaluate thermal imbalance of GSHP systems considering key influencing factors including occupant behavior and heat pump performance. A case study was conducted to simulate and analyze the actual operation of GSHP in Chinese residential buildings. The indoor comfort temperature setting and flexibility of residents' control on indoor terminal air-conditioning units determine the actual heating and cooling demand in residential buildings, which resulted in differences in thermal imbalance for GSHP systems. It was found that GSHP systems with radiant floor only for heating lead to the most severe thermal imbalance, while GSHP systems with fan coil units or radiant ceiling for cooling and/or heating achieved much better thermal balance. The proposed thermal imbalance ratio is an important indicator that can be used to evaluate thermal imbalance of GSHP systems and thus inform their design and operation for energy efficiency.

AB  - Beaches are of public access in most countries. This condition generates many societal benefits, which can be a challenge for managers. In Brazil, beaches are public spaces, with free access to all who wish to enjoy environmental services. Until recently, very limited choice of management autonomy was given to the local beach managers, which contrasted with the returned amount of responsibilities in keeping this public asset. Therefore, a new management option was put to local administrators by Federal Law 13.240/2015. The municipality can now take part in an agreement with the Federal Heritage Secretary, the national institution ultimately in charge of beach management. This agreement grants more power to local managers of urban beaches. In order to fulfil this agreement, they must observe and develop a set of measures that contribute to safer, equal and more sustainable use of the space. In a period of nearly three years, 61 Brazilian costal municipalities (out of 295 candidates) have been granted the agreement. In order to monitor and evaluate its compliance, a set of indicators were developed and are being applied. The evolution of these indicators scores is the most important tool to monitor the effectiveness of the agreement at diverse spatial and temporal scales, since the start of the decision process. Monitoring is then being carried out through on line and in situ data generation and treatment. The success of this co-management tool will depend on the application of well-established adaptive management techniques, as well as effective communication among stakeholders. Signing the agreement is not compulsory, but the majority of municipal managers are expected to do so, in face of potential outcomes. Due to the extent of the Brazilian coastline, and number of stakeholders potentially involved, this is believed to be one of the largest coastal management proposals in the world.

AB  - The Provision of Green Open Spaces (GOS) as a playground for children as well as introducing environmental awareness is a concern in various regions. GOS is a facility from the local government to fulfil children's rights in terms of growing and developing in a healthy and safe environment, especially for Brebes, which has declared themselves to be a Child-Friendly Region. Nevertheless, currently, Brebes only has 12 GOSs, which is around 15 per cent of its total area. It hampered by the contradictions between the standard requirements for GOS development and the alteration of land functions due to urbanisation in addition to the lack of community involvement in spatial planning between 2012 and 2017. The purpose of this study is to examine the optimisation of GOS in Brebes Regency from the perspective of enviromnental communication towards the positioning of Brebes as a child-friendly city; this research is a qualitative descriptive study using ethnographic methods and an environmental communication approach. The qualitative data obtained through in-depth interviews, observations and the documentation of eight informants. The findings show that GOS Brebes currently functions as a media for child development. There are some obstacles in terms of optimising the spaces in Brebes because there are some behaviours that are not child-friendly and/or environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the GOS conditions in Brebes generally fulfil the principles of Child-Friendly Spaces (CFS) as the indicators of the optimal performance of GOS. In addition, communication, resources, disposition and bureaucratic structure are important factors in terms of optimising child-friendly GOS in Brebes. Finally, cooperation between the government and the community members to create an ideal child-friendly GOS should be supported by clear regulations and policies, as well as communicated through the media appropriately and sustainably.

AB  - Fluctuations in food availability and shifts in temperature are typical environmental changes experienced by animals. These environmental shifts sometimes portend more severe changes; e.g., chilly north winds precede the onset of winter. Such telltale signs may be indicators for animals to prepare for such a shift. Here we show that HEK293A cells, cultured under starvation conditions, can "memorize" a short exposure to cold temperature (15 degrees C), which was evidenced by their higher survival rate compared to cells continuously grown at 37 degrees C. We refer to this phenomenon as "cold adaptation". The cold-exposed cells retained high ATP levels, and addition of etomoxir, a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, abrogated the enhanced cell survival. In our standard protocol, cold adaptation required linoleic acid (LA) supplementation along with the activity of Delta-6-desaturase (D6D), a key enzyme in LA metabolism. Moreover, supplementation with the LA metabolite arachidonic acid (AA), which is a high-affinity agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAROL), was able to underpin the cold adaptation, even in the presence of a D6D inhibitor. Cold exposure with added LA or AA prompted a surge in PPAR alpha levels, followed by the induction of D6D expression; addition of a PPAR alpha antagonist or a D6D inhibitor abrogated both their expression, and reduced cell survival to control levels. We also found that the brief cold exposure transiently prevents PPAR alpha degradation by inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome system, and starvation contributes to the enhancement of PPAR alpha activity by inhibiting mTORC1. Our results reveal an innate adaptive positive-feedback mechanism with a PPAROL-D6D-AA axis that is triggered by a brief cold exposure in cells. "Cold adaptation" could have evolved to increase strength and resilience against imminent extreme cold temperatures.

AB  - The growth of organic agriculture (OA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) raises the question of how far OA can improve the livelihoods of the many smallholder farmers that have to cope with numerous complex biophysical and socioeconomic challenges. Evidence on the impacts of OA in SSA, particularly on soil fertility and biodiversity, still is scarce and inconclusive. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate and compare soil fertility, decomposition and biodiversity between 20 organic and conventional farms in two counties (Kajiado and Murang'a) in Kenya. Soil sampled at 0-20 cm depth was analysed for physical and chemical properties. The decomposition of crop residues over 3 months was studied using litterbags while pitfall trapping and the derived diversity indices provided insights into arthropod abundance and diversity. Differences in soil properties, mass loss through decomposition, and arthropod abundance were analysed with linear mixed models. Findings show no statistically significant differences in soil fertility, decomposition and abundance of arthropods between organic and non-organic farms. However, species richness and diversity of arthropods on organic farms was significantly higher than on non-organic farms. Overall, farms in Kajiado had higher soil fertility and arthropod diversity than those in Murang'a, while farms in Murang'a had a higher arthropod abundance. It is argued that similar agricultural practices used in organic and non-organic farming systems, irrespective of county and biophysical conditions, strongly influenced soil fertility and biodiversity. Our results demonstrate that OA has the potential to increase arthropod biodiversity, but its ability to sustain the health of soils depends on numerous factors that are likely to undermine OA efforts in this region.

AB  - Successful operation of hotels and their development depends on satisfying customer needs. The Internet has brought significant changes in everyday life. It creates new opportunities and challenges in a world that is constantly changing but also for companies that operate in it. The Internet has also significantly changed the operating environment of the hotel industry. The objective of this article is to determine the link between online customer reviews expressing the quality of hotels and the willingness of customers to recommend the accommodation, based on the research conducted within the Visegrad Group. In view of the existing research gap on factors affecting customer satisfaction in accommodation facilities, the article helps to broaden the theoretical basis of the issue and helps hotel and accommodation establishments to establish marketing strategies that will lead to a better understanding of indicators affecting their customers' satisfaction. Research is based on customer reviews of hotel services published by Expedia.com, which focus on rating hotels in the Visegrad countries. Within the selected hotel ratings, we used automatic data collection for monitored variables (ratings). 345175 ratings have been analysed for 1500 hotels. The focus was on the percentage of guests recommending hotels in relation to selected variables. Data collection took place in the first half of 2017. The outputs of our research point to the fact that in the Visegrad Group countries there is a significant impact of specific variables expressing the quality of the hotel on the percentage of customers recommending the accommodation. Hotels that have a marketing philosophy primarily or secondarily built for achieving a good reputation should not neglect activities that have a positive effect on Room cleanliness, Service and staff, Room comfort or Hotel condition as they reflect the increasing value of the recommendation in the theoretical but especially practical, and thus a steadily increasing competitive advantage.

AB  - With the rapid growth of installed capacity of photovoltaic power systems, status monitoring and fault diagnosis of PV arrays becomes increasingly important for improving the energy conversion and maintenance efficiency. In recent years, many machine learning algorithms were successfully applied to automatically build fault diagnosis models using the fault data samples. However, most of them suffer overfitting problem and the generalization performance is still limited. In this paper, the random forest (RF) ensemble learning algorithm is explored for the detection and diagnosis of PV arrays early faults (including line-line faults, degradation, open circuit, and partial shading), which combines multiple learning algorithms to achieve a superior diagnostic performance. The proposed RF based fault diagnosis model only takes the real-time operating voltage and string currents of the PV arrays as the fault features, which is irrelevant to the environment conditions. In addition, a grid-search method is used to optimize the parameters of the RF model by minimizing the out-of-bag error estimation, so as to improve the fault diagnosis model. In order to obtain sufficient fault data samples, comprehensive fault experiments are conducted on both a Simulink based simulated PV system and a laboratory PV system. The simulation and experimental results both demonstrate that the optimized RF based fault diagnosis model can achieve a high overall detection and diagnosis performance. Moreover, the comparison results indicate that the generalization performance of the proposed RF based model is better than the one of the decision tree based model. Therefore, the proposed optimal RF based method is an effective and efficient alternative to detect and classify the faults of PV arrays. Furthermore, the proposed RF based fault diagnosis model is successfully integrated into a Matlab based real-time monitoring system prototype developed for the laboratory PV system, which validates the practicability as well.

AB  - Salinization of freshwaters threatens aquatic ecosystems globally via effects that include reductions in benthic macroinvertebrate diversity. Enhanced understanding of salinity effects in freshwater ecosystems could aid mitigation efforts. Salinization effects on benthic macroinvertebrate community structure were quantified in a 4.5-year study of 25 headwater streams spanning a gradient of salinity in the central Appalachian mountains of USA. Community structure as sampled was strongly seasonal, justifying treatment of Spring and Fall data separately. Stream communities became increasingly different from reference condition as salinity increased, with stronger relationships between biota and salinity in Spring than in Fall. Intra-seasonal variation in community structure was also revealed across sampling dates. Genera of the order Ephemeroptera appeared as most sensitive to salinity, as indicated by rapid declines in richness and relative abundance as salinity increased. Plecoptera and Trichoptera richness and relative abundance metrics appeared as less sensitive to salinity, and some Plecoptera genera exhibited increased relative abundance at elevated salinity. Other community metrics were weakly associated with salinity and exhibited greater variability than Ephemeroptera metrics, suggesting that Ephemeroptera richness and relative abundance are sensitive indicators with which to gauge onset of salinity effects. Declines in richness and relative abundance of non-Baetidae Ephemeroptera were associated strongly with increasing salinity, with effects observed at specific conductance levels as low as 200 mu S/cm in Spring based on seasonal discrete conductivity sampling. Chronic salinization has persistent effects on community structure over multiple years, but those effects are not uniform among taxa or consistent across seasons. Our findings suggest that effective detection of the onset of community change in salinized streams is best accomplished using Spring data and focusing on community metrics that incorporate salt-sensitive Ephemeroptera taxa.

AB  - The results of an experimental study of calcium ion adsorption processes carried out on various mineral sorbents of natural origin are presented. The sorption properties of the selected objects were studied and the possibility of their use as combined anti-icing materials was evaluated. In the work were investigated technological indicators of the quality of sorbents - the pH of the zero-charge point, the sorption capacity of sorbents and the optimum pH interval to determine the sorption activity of mineral raw materials on calcium ion. Analysis of the adsorption isotherms of calcium ions by the mineral sorbents studied makes it possible to note that the adsorption equilibrium on the clay is established more rapidly than on the opal of the marl type and marl. At the same time, the maximum absorption capacity of clay and marl has close values, which is related to the structure of the sorbent surface and the mineral composition of the materials. Opal of the marl type has a more developed surface, which is illustrated by a much higher absorption capacity and is confirmed by the values of the specific surface area. The obtained experimental data were processed using Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. When describing the adsorption equilibrium of calcium ions on mineral sorbents, the Freyndlich isotherm is a more rigorous model, which indicates the presence of a large number of active centers and their exponential distribution on the surface of sorbents. The quantitative characteristics of the adsorption capacity of sorbents, found by adsorption models, made it possible to identify the optimum conditions of processes, establish a relationship between the values of the sorption of calcium ions by their structure and the porosity of the materials. It has been established that opal of marl type is the most effective carrier for producing anti-icing materials.

AB  - Improvement of cultivar resistance is the key strategy to control the host-specialized pathogen Verticillium longisporum in oilseed rape (OSR). A special feature of this pathogen is its systemic, non-homogenous and delayed colonization of the plant xylem resulting in an extended symptomless period of latency. As a result, severity of infection in the field is difficult to score as it becomes apparent only at crop maturity stages when it may be confused with natural senescence. Assessment of Verticillium disease severity in OSR by visual scoring of microsclerotia on harvested stubbles unsatisfactorily reflects genotypic resistance as it is strongly affected by the ripening stage of the plant. To overcome these limitations, we developed a qPCR method, which unambiguously differentiates levels of quantitative resistance to V. longisporum in OSR genotypes under field conditions. The specificity and sensitivity of two primer pairs targeting ITS or tubulin loci in the V. longisporum genome were tested. While tubulin primers showed a high specificity to V. longisporum isolates, ITS primers exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity in detecting fungal DNA in stem tissue (limit of quantification =0.56 fg DNA) of field-grown pre-symptomatic plants. The best discrimination of resistant and susceptible OSR cultivars based on fungal DNA analysis in stem tissue was achieved at growth stage 80, at the transition of fungal vascular growth in viable plants to saprotrophic colonization of senescent stem tissues. Field screening data obtained with qPCR at growth stage 80 confirmed results from greenhouse testing thus corroborating the relevance and reliability of seedling assays for determining cultivar responses to V. longisporum in the field, as a useful tool for breeders in first selection of elite OSR genotypes with improved resistance to Verticillium.

AB  - The uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) content with depth in a sediment core collected in the continental shelf off the mouth of the Santiago River in the Mexican Pacific was studied to evaluate the contamination effects of the effluent of the Santiago-Lerma River as it moves into the sea. The large mass of terrestrial detritus delivered by the river influences the physicochemical and geochemical processes in the seafloor. Abnormal concentrations of U and Pu in sediments were examined as indicative of the effects of anoxic conditions. One of the indicators of pollution of seawater is the bacterial activity of the shallow seabed layer; and among the prevailing bacteria, the magnetotactic ones induce the formation of euhedral and framboidal shapes (pyrite). These pyrite entities are by-products of anoxic environments loaded with decomposing detrital material and are very abundant in the surface layers of the sediment core analyzed. The pyrite formation is the result of a biochemical reaction between iron and organic sulphur reduced by bacteria, and the pyrite entities precipitate to the seafloor. In the same upper zone of the profile, U-238 is readily immobilized, while U-234 is oxidized and dissolved in seawater by the effect of hot atom chemistry. This may cause the activity ratio (AR) U-234/U-238 disequilibrium (near 0.41). Furthermore, in the shallow layer of the sediment core, an abnormally high concentration of Pu239+240 was detected. In this upper layer, the activity concentrations found were 3.19 Bq kg(-1) for U-238, 1.32 kg(-1) for U-234 and 2.78 Bq kg(-1) for (239+240) Pu. In the lower fractions of the sediment core, normal values of AR (234)u/U-238 (approximate to 1) were found, with traces of Pu239+240. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The landscape of Kachchh is a unique example of active intraplate region in the world. Various structural features such as domes, faults, folds and associated intrusive suggest early tertiary tectonic history, while youthful topography like youthful nature of the fault scarps and gorges suggests Quaternary tectonic history. Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) is a 170-km-long E-W-oriented south-dipping reverse fault situated in pericratonic Mesozoic rift basin in western India. The KMF is a neotectonically active fault substantiated by distinct tectonic geomorphology and seismotectonic history. As Kachchh region experiences an arid climate, it lacks vegetation and provides favorable conditions for assessing the morphology of mountain fronts and gradient of channels using remote sensing to evaluate the relative tectonic activity. We employed the means of quantitative geomorphic analysis extracted from a DEM to access the spatial variation in tectonic activity. The assessment of geomorphic indicators of active tectonics was carried out using tectono-geomorphic parameters such as stream length-gradient index (SL index), mountain front sinuosity (S (mf)) and valley floor width-height ratio (V (f)). These parameters were combined to generate the relative index of active tectonics (RIAT) which was further divided into four classes as per degree of tectonic activity. The RIAT classes show segmented nature of KMF, with four segments having decrease in degree of tectonic activity from east toward west. The central and the eastern segments of KMF fall in class 1 and class 2 of RIAT, indicating a relatively higher degree of recent tectonic activity undergone by them. The results of geomorphic analysis are consistent with the landforms present, geological setup and seismicity in the study area. The study would be helpful in accessing the regional seismic hazard from KMF for the entire western India.

AB  - Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) are biomarkers providing taxonomically and environmentally diagnostic information. BHPs may help to unravel the composition of bacterial communities residing in recent as well as ancient permafrost soils and sediments and also provide information on associated environmental conditions. However, detailed data on their distribution in the heterogeneous Arctic environment are scarce. The distribution and structural diversity of BHPs were studied in the annually thawing (active) layer of three different sites in the polygonal tundra of the Lena Delta in the Siberian Arctic. Variations between permafrost structures and soil horizons caused by differences in the physical and chemical soil properties were observed. C and N content is significantly correlated with the BHP composition so that the highest BHP concentrations and greatest structural diversity occur in the upper most organic soilhorizons, which consist mainly of fresh or little degraded plant material. Furthermore, statistical analyses reveal that higher abundances of adenosylhopane-type soil marker BHPs are linked to higher soil pH values. Small scale environmental controls on BHP distributions are reflected by amine-functionalised BHPs from methanotrophic bacteria only occurring in the water-saturated, oxygen-depleted polygon centres and by soil marker BHPs, which are significantly more abundant in the well aerated polygon rims than in the centres. In contrast, C-2 methylated BHPs, putative indicators of plant-bacterial interactions, are present in all soil horizons and permafrost structures and their relative distribution is not systematically linked to soil properties. Overall, lipid-based results agree with published 16S rRNA based community structure assessments highlighting the usefulness of BHPs to represent bacterial populations in recent and ancient permafrost soils.

AB  - We evaluated the trophic status of several contrasting wadeable streams with the Nutrient Biotic Index for phosphorus (NBI-P) and the NBI for nitrate (NBI-N) in comparison to trophic status as determined based solely on measured nutrient chemistry. The macroinvertebrate assemblage (NBI-P) and phosphorus assessments agreed well in the designation of the trophic status in three of the four streams. However, total nitrogen (TN)-based predictions of trophic status did not agree well with the biologically derived NBI for nitrate. Although improvements to the NBI-N based on nitrate tolerance scores could be made, a TN-derived trophic status, especially in agriculturally impacted watersheds where nitrate concentrations may be relatively low in comparison to TN, may be preferable. In general, the P short-term and long-term nutrient-derived trophic status provided a similar stream trophic classification. However, this was not always the case. While a short-term average is appropriate for the conditions preceding a macroinvertebrate sample, it may not necessarily be an accurate indicator of a stream's long-term chemistry or trophic state. The widely different results between the short- and long-term TP and TN concentrations suggest that streams with inherently variable nonpoint source agricultural runoff might need a wider time frame to evaluate nutrient concentrations. Although the NBI represents an integrated response to both autochthonous and allochthonous inputs of carbon, invertebrate responses to toxics, as well as nutrients, and the short period of time the NBI may represent, may not adequately reflect impact and nutrient load to downstream systems.

AB  - Faecal contamination of estuarine and coastal waters can pose a risk to human health, particularly in areas used for shellfish production or recreation. Routine microbiological water quality testing highlights areas of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) contamination within the water column, but fails to consider the abundance of FIB in sediments, which under certain hydrodynamic conditions can become resuspended. Sediments can enhance the survival of FIB in estuarine environments, but the influence of sediment composition on the ecology and abundance of FIB is poorly understood. To determine the relationship between sediment composition (grain size and organic matter) and the abundance of pathogen indicator bacteria (PIB), sediments were collected from four transverse transects of the Conwy estuary, UK. The abundance of culturable Escherichia coli, total coliforms, enterococci, Campylobacter, Salmonella and Vibrio spp. in sediments was determined in relation to sediment grain size, organic matter content, salinity, depth and temperature. Sediments that contained higher proportions of silt and/or clay and associated organic matter content showed significant positive correlations with the abundance of PIB. Furthermore, the abundance of each bacterial group was positively correlated with the presence of all other groups enumerated. Campylobacter spp. were not isolated from estuarine sediments. Comparisons of the number of culturable E. coli, total coliforms and Vibrio spp. in sediments and the water column revealed that their abundance was 281, 433 and 58-fold greater in sediments (colony forming units (CFU)/100 g) when compared with the water column (CFU/100 ml), respectively. These data provide important insights into sediment compositions that promote the abundance of PIB in estuarine environments, with important implications for the modelling and prediction of public health risk based on sediment resuspension and transport.

AB  - The integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) has been recognized as one of the leading methods of power generation with near zero CO2 emissions from fossil fuels via carbon capture and storage. A suite of emerging IGCC technologies provide the promise of both high efficiency and reduced capital costs. Many of these operate at elevated temperature and hence a number of inorganic elements (i.e. elements other than C, H, O, N and S) may be present in the syngas at later stages of processing than is typical of conventional processing arrangements. Experimental results are presented for inorganic element distribution in slag and fly ash from seven entrained-flow slagging gasification plants. Data for the Siemens, Louisiana Gasification Technology Inc. (LGTI), Wabash River, ELCOGAS and Shell gasification systems were taken from literature. Data for the CanmetENERGY and Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) systems are presented for the first time. Mass balances and enrichment factors are calculated. All values are available in supplementary data tables. Challenges in data interpretation and general trends are highlighted. Mass balance closures for low volatility elements are within the range of 80-120% for the PWR, LGTI and Shell systems. Closures for the CanmetENERGY, Wabash River and ELCOGAS systems are further from 100%. Accumulation, unaccounted streams, measurement inaccuracy and sampling imperfections can cause poor mass balance closures. Comparison of enrichment factors for slag and fly ash demonstrate that many elements have similar fates in gasification systems as they do in combustion systems, although several elements are less volatile in gasification systems. Partitioning can vary for a given element when comparing different gasification systems and different operating conditions. The assessments of several elements which are of environmental or technological concern are provided as examples. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Terraces and floodplains are important indicators of near-channel sediment dynamics, serving as potential sediment sources and sinks. Increasing availability of high resolution topography data over large areas calls for development of semi-automated techniques for identification and measurement of these features. In this study we introduce a novel tool that accommodates user-defined parameters including, a local-relief threshold selected by a variable-size moving window, minimum area threshold, and maximum distance from the channel to identify and map discrete terrace and floodplain surfaces. Each of the parameters can easily be calibrated for a given watershed or reach. Subsequently, the tool automatically measures planform area, absolute elevation, and height relative to the local river channel for each terrace polygon. We validate the tool in two locations where terrace maps were previously developed via manual digitization from lidar and extensive field mapping campaigns. The tool is also tested on six different types of rivers to provide examples of starting selection parameters, and to test effectiveness of the tool across a wide range of landscapes. Generally, the tool provides a high quality draft map of terrace and floodplain surfaces across the wide range of environmental conditions for which it has been tested. We find that the tool functions best in catchments where the terraces are spatially extensive, with distinct differences between the terrace and floodplain. The most challenging environments for semi-automated terrace and floodplain mapping include steep catchments with dense riparian vegetation, and very small terraces (~10 m(2) in areal extent). We then apply the tool to map terraces and floodplains in the Root River watershed, southeastern Minnesota and generate exceedance plots for terrace heights. These plots provide a first pass analysis to indicate the tributaries and reaches of the river where terraces constitute a significant source of sediment. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The impact of animal manure application on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes is of interest for both agronomic and environmental purposes. There is a specific need to quantify SOC change for use in national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories. We quantified the response of SOC stocks to manure application from a large worldwide pool of individual studies and determined the impact of explanatory factors such as climate, soil properties, land use and manure characteristics. Our study is based on a meta-analysis of 42 research articles totaling 49 sites and 130 observations in the world. A dominant effect of cumulative manure-C input on SOC response was observed as this factor explained at least 53% of the variability in SOC stock differences compared to mineral fertilized or unfertilized reference treatments. However, the effects of other determining factors were not evident from our data set. From the linear regression relating cumulative C inputs and SOC stock difference, a global manure-C retention coefficient of 12%+/- 4 (95% Confidence Interval, CI) could be estimated for an average study duration of 18years. Following an approach comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we estimated a relative SOC change factor of 1.26 +/- 0.14 (95% CI) which was also related to cumulative manure-C input. Our results offer some scope for the refinement of manure retention coefficients used in crop management guidelines and for the improvement of SOC change factors for national GHG inventories by taking into account manure-C input. Finally, this study emphasizes the need to further document the long-term impact of manure characteristics such as animal species, especially pig and poultry, and manure management systems, in particular liquid vs. solid storage.

AB  - Human activities, such as land use change, cause severe land degradation in many ecosystems around the globe with potential impacts on soil processes. Restoration practices aim at reverting such impacts and reconstituting the biotic composition and functioning of an ecosystem to its initial condition. The aim of this study was to monitor soil microbial properties in degraded lands in Northeast Brazil and to compare those with land under restoration. Soil samplings were conducted in 2009, 2010 and 2011 in two different seasons (wet and dry season) at sites differing in degradation status: native vegetation (NAT), moderately degraded land (MDL), highly degraded land (HDL), and land under restoration for four years (RES). Soil microbial properties showed pronounced fluctuations between seasons with higher levels of functioning in the wet than in the dry season. Soil microbial biomass and enzymes had significantly higher values under native vegetation than in degraded land, while restored land mostly corresponded to native vegetation. Soil microbial biomass, respiratory quotient and enzyme activities were more strongly affected by land degradation than soil chemical properties. Soil microbial properties varied more between seasons and years in highly degraded land than under native vegetation suggesting a buffering effect of the native vegetation on soil microbial processes. However, land degradation effects on soil microbial properties were significant in both seasons. Moreover, our results indicate that the land restoration practice applied here shifted soil microbial community composition as indicated by soil microbial stoichiometry. Our results indicate that land degradation strongly deteriorates soil microbial properties and their stability in time, but that land restoration practices likely are successful in promoting the recovery of some soil microbial functions, even after only four years. However, shifts in soil microbial community composition in restored lands may have significant feedback effects on element cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Widespread outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) forests of North America have produced stands with significant levels of recent tree mortality. The needle foliage from recently attacked trees typically turns red within one to two years of attack indicating successful colonization by the beetle and tree death. Attempts to model crown fire potential in these stands have assumed that the moisture content of dead foliage responds similarly to changes in air temperature and relative humidity as other fine, dead surface fuels. However, this assumption has not been verified. In this exploratory study we sampled the moisture content of dead foliage on an hourly basis through two different diurnal cycles during the fire season and compared the results to measurements of 10-h fuel moisture indicator sticks and predictions made from models used to estimate dead fuel moisture in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The observed degree of variation in dead foliar moisture content was small (6.9-14.5%) with a mean value of similar to 10%. All existing models performed poorly, but measurements of 10-h fuel moisture and a modified version of an existing model where timelags were extended to similar to 20-h had the best fit to the data. The results from our study suggest that the dead foliage on attacked trees does not respond similarly to changing environmental conditions as other fine, dead surface fuels as has been assumed. This in turn has important implications for wildland fire suppression operations, including firefighter safety, and in modeling fire behavior, and solicits the need for further research.

AB  - Predatory naticid gastropods typically attack other infaunal molluscs by drilling holes that record their activities in the shells of their prey. Other modes of naticid predation, which need not leave complete boreholes, have been noted in the literature and may complicate interpretation of the record of naticid predation in fossil and modern assemblages. Smothering is an alternative form of predation that has never been defined clearly with respect to naticid gastropods. Feeding occurs in the absence of a completed drillhole; in most cases suffocation is implied, but reported deaths may be linked to an array of mechanisms (e.g. direct feeding, anaesthetizing mucus). We examine the pervasiveness of alternative modes of predation employed by naticids reported in the literature and offer recommendations regarding the terminology used in referring to such mechanisms. Because it is unclear if predatory behaviours such as suffocation are common in natural settings or are mostly artefacts of laboratory conditions such as insufficient substrate, we examined experimentally the influence of different sediment depths on drilling vs suffocation of Mercenaria mercenaria prey by Neverita duplicata. More than 99 (n 404) of the clams recorded as consumed in our experiments were drilled, regardless of sediment depth, with 1 (n 3) noted as cases of potential suffocation. Our results indicate that shallower sediment depths do not affect drilling in this species. Analysis of previous studies indicates that prey health and other laboratory effects are likely responsible for many instances of suffocation reported in the literature. Thus concerns regarding use of drillholes as an indicator of predation by naticids in modern and fossil deposits should be alleviated. Future work on other alternative modes of predation by naticids, in both laboratory and field experiments, should focus on validating reported occurrences of such predation and identifying different mechanisms that may be involved.

AB  - Soil properties that influence the capacity for infiltration and moisture retention are important determinants of rangeland productivity. Monitoring effects of grazing on dynamic soil properties can assist managers with stocking rate decisions, particularly if monitoring takes into account environmental variability associated with inherent soil morphological properties. On a Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie in northeast Oregon, we applied three cattle stocking rates (0.52, 1.04, and 1.56 animal unit months . ha(-1)) and an ungrazed control in a randomized complete block design for two 42-d grazing seasons and measured the change in four dynamic soil properties: soil penetration resistance, soil aggregate stability, bare ground, and herbaceous litter cover. To address apparent environmental heterogeneity within experimental units, we also utilized a categorical soil factor (termed Edaphic Habitat Types or EHT), determined by characterizing soil depth, texture, and rock fragment content at sample sites. Stocking rate did not affect extent of bare ground or soil aggregate stability. Stocking rate had a significant effect on penetration resistance, which was greatest at the high stocking rate (1.6 J . cm(-1) +/- 0.1 SE) and lowest in the control (1.1 J . cm(-1) +/- 0.1 SE). For litter cover, the effects of stocking rate and EHT interacted. In two rocky EHTs, litter cover was highest in the controls (60% +/- 6 SE; 50% +/- 3 SE) and ranged from 27% +/- 3 SE to 33% +/- 6 SE in the stocking rate treatments. Measures of penetration resistance, aggregate stability, and bare ground were different across EHTs regardless of stocking rate, but did not interact with stocking rate. Our study demonstrates that response of dynamic soil properties to stocking rates should be considered as a useful and accessible approach for monitoring effects of livestock management decisions on rangeland conditions.

AB  - A study was performed in Del Rey Lagoon, City of Los Angeles, to determine if the lagoon was as a source or sink for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB: total coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci) and to screen for the presence of other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The lagoon receives tidal flows from the adjacent Ballona Estuary whose water usually is contaminated with FIB originating from the highly urbanized Ballona Creek Watershed. During 16 sampling events from February 2008 through March 2009, replicate water samples (n = 3) were collected 1 h prior to the high tide and 1 h prior to the following low tide. FIB concentrations were measured by the defined substrate method (IDEXX, Westbrook, Me) followed by culturing of bacterial isolates sampled from positive IDEXX Quanti-Tray wells and were identified using the Vitek 2 Compact (bioM,rieux, Durham, NC). Mean concentrations of FIB often differed by an order of magnitude from flood to ebb flow conditions. The lagoon tended to act as a sink for total coliforms based on the ratio of mean flood to ebb densities (R (F/E)) > 1.0 during 56 % of the sampling events and during ebb flows, as a source for E. coli and enterococci (R (F/E) < 1.69 % of events). Approximately 54 species were identified from 277 isolates cultured from the IDEXX Quanti-Trays. Of these, 54 % were species known to include pathogenic strains that can be naturally occurring, introduced in runoff, or originated from other sources. Diversity and cluster analyses indicated a dynamic assemblage that changes in species composition with day-to-day fluctuations as well as tidal action. The concept of monitoring the lagoon and estuary as a sentinel habitat for pathogenic assemblages is discussed.

AB  - Many technological alternatives for wastewater treatment are available, ranging from advanced technologies to conventional treatment options. It is difficult to select the most appropriate technology from among a set of available alternatives to treat wastewater at a particular location. Many factors, such as capital costs, operation and maintenance costs and land requirement, are involved in the decision-making process. Sustainability criteria must also be incorporated into the decision-making process such that appropriate technologies are selected for developing economies such as that of India. A scenario-based multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) methodology has been developed and applied to the selection of wastewater treatment alternative. The four most commonly used wastewater treatment technologies for treatment of municipal wastewater in India are ranked for various scenarios. Six scenarios are developed that capture the regional and local societal priorities of urban, suburban and rural areas and translate them into the mathematical algorithm of the MADM methodology. The articulated scenarios depict the most commonly encountered decision-making situations in addressing technology selection for wastewater treatment in India. A widely used compensatory MADM technique, TOPSIS, has been selected to rank the alternatives. Seven criteria with twelve indicators are formulated to evaluate the alternatives. Different weight matrices are used for each scenario, depending on the priorities of the scenario. This study shows that it is difficult to select the most appropriate wastewater treatment alternative under the "no scenario" condition (equal weights given to each attribute), and the decision-making methodology presented in this paper effectively identifies the most appropriate wastewater treatment alternative for each of the scenarios.

AB  - Background: Mitochondrial activity inhibits proliferation and is required for differentiation of myoblasts. Myoblast proliferation is also inhibited by the similar to 20% oxygen level used in standard tissue culture. We hypothesize that mitochondrial activity would be greater at hyperoxia (20% O-2) relative to more physiological oxygen (5% O-2).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Murine primary myoblasts from isolated myofibres and conditionally immortalized H-2K myoblasts were cultured at 5% and 20% oxygen. Proliferation, assayed by cell counts, EdU labeling, and CFSE dilution, was slower at 20% oxygen. Expression of MyoD in primary myoblasts was delayed at 20% oxygen, but myogenicity, as measured by fusion index, was slightly higher. FACS-based measurement of mitochondrial activity indicators and luminometric measurement of ATP levels revealed that mitochondria exhibited greater membrane potential and higher levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) at 20% oxygen with concomitant elevation of intracellular ATP. Mitochondrial mass was unaffected. Low concentrations of CCCP, a respiratory chain uncoupler, and Oligomycin A, an ATP synthase inhibitor, each increased the rate of myoblast proliferation. ROS were investigated as a potential mechanism of mitochondrial retrograde signaling, but scavenging of ROS levels by N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or alpha-Phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) did not rescue the suppressed rate of cell division in hyperoxic conditions, suggesting other pathways. Primary myoblasts from older mice showed a slower proliferation than those from younger adult mice at 20% oxygen but no difference at 5% oxygen.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results implicate mitochondrial regulation as a mechanistic explanation for myoblast response to oxygen tension. The rescue of proliferation rate in myoblasts of aged mice by 5% oxygen suggests a major artefactual component to age-related decline of satellite cell proliferation in standard tissue culture at 20% oxygen. It lends weight to the idea that these age-related changes result at least in part from environmental factors rather than characteristics intrinsic to the satellite cell.

AB  - Biological markets principles offer testable hypotheses to explain variation in grooming exchange patterns among nonhuman primates. They predict that when within-group contest competition (WGC) is high and dominance hierarchies steep, grooming interchange with other "commodity" behaviors (such as agonistic support) should prevail. In contrast, when WGC is low and gradients shallow, market theory predicts that grooming reciprocity should prevail. We tested these predictions in a wild, provisioned Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana) group across six time periods during which the group had been subjected to varying degrees of range restriction. Data on female-female aggression, grooming, and support were collected using all-occurrences and focal animal sampling techniques, and analyzed using ANCOVA methods and correlation analyses. We found that hierarchical steepness varied significantly across periods, but did not correlate with two indirect indicators of WGC (group size and range restriction) in predicted directions. Contrary to expectations, we found a negative correlation between steepness and group size, perhaps because the responses of group members to external risks (i.e. prolonged and unavoidable exposure to humans) may have overshadowed the effects of WGC. As predicted, grooming reciprocity was significant in each period and negatively correlated with steepness, even after we controlled group size, kinship, rank differences, and proximity. In contrast, there was no evidence for grooming interchange with agonistic support or for a positive relationship between interchange and steepness. We hypothesize that stressful conditions and/or the presence of stable hierarchies during each period may have led to a greater market demand for grooming than support. We suggest that future studies testing these predictions consider more direct measures of WGC and commodities in addition to support, such as feeding tolerance and access to infants. Am. J.

AB  - Plankton diversity and physico-chemical parameters are an important criterion for evaluating the suitability of water for irrigation and drinking purposes. In this study we tried to assess the zoo plankton species richness, diversity and evenness and to predict the state of three perennial ponds according to physico-chemical parameters. A total of 47 taxa we're recorded: 24 rotifers, 9 copepods, 8 cladocerans, 4 ostracods and 2 protozoans. More number of zoo plankton species were recorded in Chinnapperkovil pond (47 species) followed by Nallanchettipatti (39 species) and Kaclabamkulam pond (24 species). Among the rotifers, Branchionus sp. is abundant. Diaphanosoma sp. predominant among the cladocerans. Among copepods, numerical superiority was found in the case of Mesocyclopes sp. Cypris sp. repeated abundance among ostracoda. Present study revealed that zooplankton species richness (R1 and R2) was comparatively higher (R1: 4.39; R2: 2.13)in Chinnapperkovil pond. The species diversity was higher in the Chinnapperkovil pond (H-1: 2.53; N1: 15.05; N2: 15.75) as compared to other ponds. The water samples were analyzed for temperature, pH, electrical conductivity alkalinity salinity phosphate, hardness, dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen demand. Higher value of physico-chemical parameters and zooplankton diversity were recorded in Chinnapperkovil pond as compared to other ponds. The zooplankton population shows positive significant correlation with physico-chemical parameters like, temperature, alkalinity phosphate, hardness and biological oxygen demand, whereas negatively correlated with rainfall and salinity The study revealed that the presence of certain species like, Monostyla sp., Keratella sp., Lapadella sp., Leydigia sp., Moinodaphnia sp., Diaptomus sp., Diaphanosoma sp., Mesocyclopes sp., Cypris sp. and Brachionus sp. is considered to be biological indicator for eutrophication.

AB  - In order to assess the current state of net community production (NCP) in the southeastern Bering Sea, we measured the spatio-temporal distribution and controls on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations in spring and summer of 2008 across six shelf domains defined by differing biogeochemical characteristics. DIC concentrations were tightly coupled to salinity in spring and ranged from similar to 1900 mu moles kg(-1) over the inner shelf to similar to 2400 mu moles kg(-1) in the deeper waters of the Bering Sea. In summer, DIC concentrations were lower due to dilution from sea ice melt, terrestrial inputs, and primary production. Concentrations were found to be as low similar to 1800 mu moles kg(-1) over the inner shelf. We found that DIC concentrations were drawn down 30-150 mu moles kg(-1) in the upper 30 m of the water column due to primary production and calcium carbonate formation between the spring and summer occupations. Using the seasonal drawdown of DIC, estimated rates of NCP on the inner, middle, and outer shelf averaged 28 +/- 9 mmoles C m(-2) d(-1). However, higher rates of NCP (40-47 mmoles C m(-2) d(-1)) were observed in the 'Green Belt' where the greatest confluence of nutrient-rich basin water and iron-rich shelf water occurs. We estimated that in 2008, total NCP across the shelf was on the order of similar to 96 Tg C yr(-1). Due to the paucity of consistent, comparable productivity data, it is impossible at this time to quantify whether the system is becoming more or less productive. However, as changing climate continues to modify the character of the Bering Sea, we have shown that NCP can be an important indicator of how the ecosystem is functioning.

AB  - As part of a comprehensive ecological risk assessment on a broad range of species, the potential for adverse effects in birds was evaluated at a chromate ore processing residue disposal site, Study Area 7, located at the confluence of the Lower Hackensack River, Passaic River, and Upper Newark Bay. Although detection of elevated concentrations of total chromium in sediment prompted the study, it was also necessary to consider potential risks related to other chemicals present in elevated concentrations due to widespread anthropogenic activities in Upper Newark Bay and its watershed. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' TrophicTrace (R) software was used to predict exposure to avian receptors using measured concentrations of chemicals in sediment, measured concentrations of chemicals in benthic invertebrates, and measured site physicochemical parameters. The TrophicTrace (R) model was improved as part of the Study Area 7 ecological risk assessment to account for (1) incidental ingestion of sediment by dabbling and diving birds, (2) area use factors for spatial overlap of wide-ranging fish species and piscivorous birds, (3) spatially-explicit utilization of the site by birds with a variety of foraging strategies, and (4) temporal patterns of site utilization by migratory species. The ecological risk assessment demonstrated that chromium in sediment does riot pose unacceptable hazards to avian receptors. Potentially unacceptable hazards were indicated for several organic chemicals (i.e., pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins/furans), with hazard quotients highest for Upper Newark Bay reference conditions, reflecting potential widespread chemical impacts to the estuary. The modifications to TrophicTrace (R) conducted for this assessment may be prudent and applicable for improving the accuracy and realism of other assessments involving avian receptors exposed to chemicals via contaminated sediment and transfer through the food web.

AB  - Although species with large area requirements are sometimes used as umbrella species, their general utility as conservation tools is uncertain. We surveyed the species diversity of birds, butterflies, carabids, and forest-floor plants in forest sites across an area (1600 km(2)) in which we delineated large breeding home ranges of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). We tested whether protection of the home ranges could serve as an effective umbrella to protect sympatric species of the four taxa. We also used an empirical habitat model of occupancy of home range to examine mechanisms by which the Northern Goshawk acts as an umbrella species. Among species richness, abundance, and species composition of the four taxa, only abundance and species composition, of birds differed between sites located inside and outside home ranges, which was due to greater abundance of bird species that were prey of Northern Goshawks inside the home ranges. Thus, although home range indicated areas with high abundance of certain birdprey species, it was not effective as an indicator of the species diversity of all four taxa. We also did not find any difference in species richness, abundance, and species composition between sites predicted as occupied and unoccupied using the habitat model. In contrast, when we selected sites on the basis of each habitat variable in the model, habitat variables that selected sites either in agricultural or forested landscapes encompassed sites with high species richness or particular species composition. This result suggests that the low performance of the Northern Goshawk as an umbrella species is due to this species' preference for habitat in both agricultural and forested landscapes. Species that can adjust to changes in habitat conditions may not act as effective umbrella species despite having large home ranges.

AB  - The present study addresses the issue of outdoor thermal comfort in a hot and dry climate in relation to urban geometry. This experimental work, conducted in an old desert city, aims to provide some quantitative knowledge on the effectiveness of traditional design forms in ensuring a comfortable thermal environment outdoors under extreme summer conditions. The study focused on the role of the geometry of urban canyons. Air temperature, air humidity and wind speed were measured during summer 2003 in various urban streets in the old Saharan city of Beni-Isguen, Algeria (32.40 degrees N). The short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes received by a human body from the 3D surroundings were also measured in order to allow an accurate calculation of the heat gained by a pedestrian. Bio-meteorological methodology was used and thermal comfort was expressed by means of the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) index. The results show that the heat stress in a hot-dry climate is very high in unobstructed locations in contrast to sheltered urban sites. The vertical street profile is of prime importance in the resulting thermal sensation. Building materials were also found to play a decisive role. Deep streets together with high thermal capacity materials mitigate the heat stress in the daytime. The high and heavy walls provide more shading and more heat storage, leading to lower surfaces temperatures. Hence, a human body absorbs less short-wave radiation owing to reduced direct exposure, and also less radiant heat from the surrounding environment is absorbed by the body. In contrast, air temperature and air humidity show little dependence on the urban geometry. Therefore, these factors are less relevant indicators for outdoor thermal comfort in the summertime.

AB  - Newsprint samples collected from 12-16 ft (top layer (TNP)), 20-24 ft (middle layer (MNP)), and 32-36 ft (bottom layer (BNP)) below the surface of the Norman Landfill (NLF)were characterized by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, cross-polarization, magic-angle spinning C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS C-13 NMR) spectroscopy, and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The extent of NLF newsprint degradation was evaluated by comparing the chemical composition of NLF newsprint to that of fresh newsprint (FNP) and newsprint degraded in the laboratory under methanogenic conditions (DNP). The O-alkyl/alkyl, cellulose/lignin, and lignin/resin acid ratios showed that BNP was the most degraded, and that all three NLF newsprint samples were more degraded than DNP. C-13 NMR and TMAH thermochemolysis data demonstrated selective enrichment of lignin over cellulose, and TMAH thermochemolysis further exhibited selective enrichment of resin acids over lignin. In addition, the crystallinity of cellulose in NLF newsprint samples was significantly lower relative to that of FNP and DNP as shown by C-13 NMR spectra. The yield of lignin monomers from TMAH thermochemolysis suggested that hydroxyl groups were removed from the propyl side chain of lignin during the anaerobic decomposition of newsprint in the NLF Moreover, the vanillyl acid/aldehyde ratio, which successfully describes aerobic lignin degradation, was not a good indicator of the anaerobic degradation of lignin on the basis of the TMAH data. The toluene sorption capacity increased as the degree of newsprint degradation increased or as the O-alkyl/alkyl ratio of newsprint decreased. The results of this study further verified that the sorbent O-alkyl/alkyl ratio is useful for predicting sorption capacities of natural organic materials for hydrophobic organic contaminants.

AB  - Palaeoclimatic records derived from a variety of independent proxies provide evidence of post-glacial changes of temperature and soil moisture in northern Fennoscandia. We use pollen percentage, pollen influx, stomatal and chironomid records from Toskaljavri, a high-altitude lake in northern Finland, to assess how treelines and alpine vegetation there have responded to these climate changes. The evidence suggests that the cool, moist climate of the early Holocene supported birch forest in the area 9600 cal. yr BP onwards and that a rise of temperature triggered the immigration of pine at 8300 cal. yr BP. At 6100-4000 cal. yr BP altitudinal treeline in the area was formed by pine, in contrast to the modern situation where mountain birch reaches a higher elevation. Alpine vegetation also demonstrates clear changes. Plant communities typical of dry, oligotrophic heaths of northern Fennoscandia expanded during the dry climatic period at 7000-4000 cal. yr BP and decreased in response to cooler and moister conditions after 4000 cal. yr BP. Alpine plant communities favouring moist sites show an inverse pattern, expanding after a change towards moister climate after 4000 cal. yr BP. in a redundancy analysis (RDA), a statistically significant proportion of the variability in the total chironomid assemblages was captured by changes in the pollen types reflecting alpine vegetation typical of moist sites. Although chironomid community changes appeared to follow the major patterns in the alpine vegetation succession, the present study does not support a direct link between the changing treeline position and chironomid stratigraphy. Rather, the data indicate that the terrestrial and aquatic environments have each responded directly to the same ultimate cause, namely changing Holocene climate.

AB  - Sulfate attack research is at a critical stage. In spite of meaningful advances in the past few years, this problem is still not well understood. Due to its complicated mechanism, the reaction between cement hydration products and sulfate-bearing solutions manifests itself in a variety of ways. In order to provide adequate means for selection of materials for concrete exposed to such aggressive environments, additional research is necessary to further clarify the interaction between concrete and sulfate-bearing solutions. Specifically, the role of the cation in the sulfate solution, and the effects of formation of various products like gypsum, ettringite, and thaumasite, on the extent of damage need to be investigated. The available testing methods for sulfate aback have been subject to some criticism lately. Although these test methods can give an indication of the mechanisms involved in sulfate attack, prediction of field performance using lab studies is difficult. Efforts are needed to introduce appropriate changes in the tests in order to obtain field-like conditions in the laboratory. Combined with good monitoring methods, this would enable the prediction of service life of structures exposed to sulfate solutions. Recent advances in nondestructive testing techniques can be applied to the task of monitoring field structures, although there is a significant effort necessary to calibrate these methods for sulfate attack-related scenarios. In order to produce efficient concrete designs for service in aggressive environments, it is imperative to develop reliable models. Modeling can help in selecting the appropriate materials and their proportions, as well as in determining service life parameters. As a first step towards modeling, critical parameters, which serve as an indicator of deterioration, need to be recognized and established. This paper discusses these issues, and cites some interesting recent developments. Finally, some recommendations for future studies are provided. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1 Stress may affect compensatory plant growth and plant responses to herbivory may therefore be modified by pollution. We compared the effects of leaf clipping on growth, reproduction and developmental stability of two willow species (Salix borealis and S. caprea) growing at different distances from two copper-nickel smelters (Monchegorsk, NW Russia and Harjavalta, SE Finland).
   2 In unpolluted sites, the defoliation of both willow species adversely affected sexual reproduction and increased the formation of epicormic shoots, but did not change either shoot growth or leaf size. Timing and extent of clipping had little effect on the responses.
   3 Compensatory responses to leaf clipping in polluted habitats were reduced, especially in S. borealis, as reflected by decrease in shoot growth and fruit production and an increase in leaf fluctuating asymmetry, a non-specific indicator of stress.
   4 Activation of dormant buds was a common compensatory response to herbivory in unpolluted sites. The lack of an increase in epicormic shoots in polluted sites may be due to already weakened apical dominance.
   5 Compensatory abilities may be affected both by direct damage caused by pollutants and pollution-induced increases in environmental stress. Although S. borealis shows no visible sign of stress in polluted sites, regrowth from dormant buds and enhanced shoot growth were seen under these conditions. Resources were not therefore available for further compensation of damage caused by defoliation. Our results fit the hypothesis that fast growing plants have low compensative abilities.
   6 Salix caprea shows more pollution-induced stress than S. borealis, expressed as increased developmental instability near the weaker and shorter shoots near the stronger pollution source. This may explain the differences in their compensatory responses in polluted sites.

AB  - Sustainability of agricultural management systems has become an issue of wide public concern and international debate. One result is that soil quality assessment has been suggested as a tool for evaluating sustainability of soil and crop management practices. Our objective was to adapt a soil quality index to assess the effects of three long-term tillage systems on sloping Grantsburg silt loam soil. Soil quality was evaluated using a framework that included three soil functions: (1) resist erosion (water relations), (2) provide plant nutrients (nutrient relations), and (3) provide a favorable root environment (rooting relations). A score for each of these functions was computed using measurements (indicators) that were normalized with one of the three (more is better, optimum, or worse) scoring functions. Six different indices were developed from a basic framework. Modifications included changing the weighting factors, threshold limits, or type of scoring function applied to indicators, and the addition of air-filled and water storage porosity to the nutrient and rooting relations functions. Changing threshold limits and the type of scoring function used for surface residue improved the correlation between water relations and soil lass. The addition of porosity indicators increased the sensitivity of nutrient and rooting relations functions to yield and cone index, respectively, and resulted in a better correlation between porosity indicators and plant population. Computing soil quality indices helped to combine different soil properties and processes into a simple tool that explained changes in complex soil properties in response to different tillage practices. This supports previous studies suggesting that computing soil quality indices and functions could be useful for selecting management practices to maintain or improve soil quality. Our results demonstrated that adjusting threshold limits for local conditions can make the function ratings more or less sensitive to thr management practices being evaluated.

AB  - Pilot-plant studies were conducted in two source waters to determine the effects of predisinfection with ozone alone and with a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ozone (PEROXONE) on the production of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) compounds. Colorado River water (CRW) and State project water (SPW) from Northern California were treated with ozone alone at applied dosages ranging from 1 to 4 mg/L and with PEROXONE at hydrogen peroxide/ozone (H2O2/O3) ratios of 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. Ozonation of CRW with applied dosages of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/L increased AOC concentrations from 70 mug C/L to 275, 350, and 224 mu C/L, respectively. Ozonation of SPW with an applied dosage of 4.0 mg/L elevated AOC concentrations from 70 to 522 mug C/L.
   In most cases, application of PEROXONE at an H2O2/O3 ratio of 0.05 increased production of AOC by up to 100% in comparison with the use of ozone alone; however, there was no clear relationship between PEROXONE ratios and AOC concentrations.
   Subsequent filtration through biologically active, dual-media anthracite/sand filters reduced AOC concentrations to levels that were lower than or equal to source - water AOC levels. Continuous chloramination at a dosage of 1.5 mg/L across the filters decreased AOC removal efficiency by 80%, indicating that biological activity is required for AOC reduction. Changing the application points of ozone from prefiltration to post-filtration resulted in at least threefold AOC increases over influent values for both source waters. Similar AOC increases were observed when the treatment process was altered to include both prefiltration and post-filtration ozone application. This indicates that even after biological filtration, there may be sufficient organic material remaining to produce AOC upon ozone or PEROXONE disinfection.

AB  - High-resolution records of the concentration and mass accumulation rate (MAR, or flux) of biogenic sediments from core RC11-210 in the central equatorial Pacific are compared for the entire late Pleistocene. The fluxes of calcium carbonate and organic carbon correlate well. The opal flux pattern shows no direct correlation with the other two; rather, opal flux maxima correlate with slopes of (i.e. both precede and follow) the organic carbon and carbonate MAR peaks. Organic carbon and calcite therefore may both be better indicators of past productivity than opal, which is an indicator of transition at this location. We interpret the sequence low biogenic fluxes, high opal fluxes, high carbonate, carbon, and opal fluxes as representing the transition from low to high sea surface biological productivity. The phase relationships for eccentricity of the biogenic sedimentation records were compared to those of other climatic indications including the oxygen isotope record of ice volume, the ice core CO2 record, the Pacific Delta delta C-13 record, the deep nutrient (Cd/Ca) record, and the eolian grain-size record of wind intensity. We find that starting from maximum ice volume (phase angle of 0 degrees) the phase relationships of the 100,000-year periodicity show, in the first quadrant, maximum wind intensity (30 degrees) and maximum calcite and carbon flux (45 degrees) occurring first, followed by maximum opal flux (75 degrees) and then maximum deep nutrients (95 degrees). Minimum Pacific Delta delta C-13 occurs at a phase angle of 155 degrees, the maximum CO2 in the Vostok record and minimum ice volume is at 180 degrees. Thus, in the eccentricity climate cycle, glacial conditions lead to stronger wind-driven circulation which enhances productivity which in mm results in enhanced oceanic and atmospheric carbon dioxide and minimum ice volume.

AB  - Nutrients in centralized discharge area of treated sewage can cause high ecological risks to aquatic systems, thus a deep-level nutrient removal is necessary. Recently, periphyton has attracted increasing interests for its excellent performance in nutrient removal. In this study, the suitability and durability of basalt fiber (BF) as a new green carrier of periphyton was evaluated, and development process of basalt fiber-periphtyon (BFP) was tracked with bacterial community succession and physiological indicators. Then, well-developed BFP was applied to deeply purify water containing the same concentration of nutrient as the treated sewage. Results showed the periphyton could adapt to BF and formed in large quantities. In addition, the tensile strength of BF after being used as a carrier was still strong. Bacterial community and physiological indicators indicated that BFP was well developed in 40-50 days. LEfSE and random forest analysis revealed that Deinococcus-Deinococci, Spartobacteria and Chlamydiia at class-level, Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales at order-level were the biomarkers for development of BFP. Moreover, application results showed BFP efficiently removed nitrogen and phosphorus from water and promoted the transformation of ammonia to nitrate. The concentration of ammonia and phosphorus severely decreased from 4.90 +/- 0.11 mg/L to 0.51 +/- 0.20 mg/L, from 0.66 +/- 0.016 mg/L to 0.023 +/- 0.013 mg/L, respectively. The efficient nutrient removal was attributed to accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism related organisms in BFP as well as favorable water physic-chemical conditions created by BFP. These results suggest that BF is a suitable and durable green carrier of periphyton, and BFP could efficiently reduce ecological risk to aquatic systems receiving treated sewage.

AB  - The black mudstone of the Chang-7 Member is the most important source rock in the Ordos Basin. In order to understand the paleo-climate, weathering, redox conditions, salinity, water temperature, water depth, and primary productivity under which black mudstone of the Chang-7 Member was deposited, we have analyzed total organic carbon (TOC), rock pyrolysis parameters, major elements, and trace elements of 60 black mudstone samples from the Chang-7 Member of the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin. Geochemical indicators such as TOC, volatile hydrocarbon and residual hydrocarbon (S1 + S2), hydrogen index (HI), chloroform asphalt "A", maximum pyrolysis peak temperature (Tmax), Vitrinite reflectance (Ro), kerogen macerals, and other organic indicators, show that the kerogen type of the Chang-7 Member was type I-II1, the thermal evolution of organic matter was in the mature stage, and it has good hydrocarbon generation potential. The major and trace element characteristics, such as C-value, Sr/Cu, Rb/Sr and Mg/Ca ratios, chemical alteration index(CIA), Sr/Ba, B, Ga-BRb trace element triangle, B/Ga, 1000 x Rb/K2O, V/(V + Ni), pristane/phytane ratio (Pr/Ph), foraminiferal Mg/ Ca, and Co values indicate that the sedimentary environment of the Chang-7 Member was semi-arid and semihumid, with continental freshwater, a reductive sedimentary environment, and an average paleotemperature of 16 degrees C. Based on the analysis of Baxs and Ba/Al ratio, the Chang-7 Member has medium-high primary productivity, which together with the sedimentary environment, played an important role in the enrichment and preservation of organic matter.

AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the aptness of two commercial simulators, HOMER Pro and RETScreen Expert, as predictors of the performance of a large-scale photovoltaic power plant designed to deliver up to 20 MW in a hot climate, for which 26 months of real operational data are available. The power plant is located in the province of Adrar in the south of Algeria and classified as one of the hot regions worldwide. Performance parameters were reference yield, performance ratio, capacity factor, temperature loss and statistical indicators. The results showed that photovoltaic power plant performance depends on cell technology, insolation, and environmental conditions, especially temperature. The deviations between the simulation results and real monitoring data were found to be smaller in the case of HOMER Pro simulation tool. The total annual energy supplied in 2018 by the power plant was 36364MWh, whereas RETScreen Expert predicted 42339 MWh, or about 14% more and HOMER Pro predicted 34508 MWh or about 5.1% less. The influence of temperature on the power plant output was strong, causing a 40% drop during the summer, due to the limitations of the polycrystalline cell technology. This needs to be considered in the design of future photovoltaic power plants to be operated in hot climates. HOMER Pro and RETScreen Expert predicted an average annual final yield of 5.128 h/day, a module efficiency of 15% and an inverter efficiency of 98%. The t statistics were 3.75 for HOMER Pro and 6.12 for RETScreen Expert. The analysis shows that the 20 MW photovoltaic plant in hot climate experiences high losses compared to an equivalent plant based on thin-film photovoltaic cells. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Underground coal mining can result in land deformation (e.g., land subsidence and ground fissures), and may consequently change the soil nutrients. Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), and available phosphorus (AP) are critical indicators of soil fertility and eco-restoration in mining areas. In this study, soil samples (depth: 0-20 cm) were collected twice from 20 sampling points in pre-mining and post-mining in the No.12 panel of Caojiatan coalfield, in the Loess Plateau of China. SOM, TN, and AP in soil samples were measured, and the nutrient loss was evaluated. Ten environmental factors affecting soil nutrient loss were identified from a 5-m resolution digital elevation map (DEM). The paired t-test was utilized to evaluate the differences between SOM, TN, and AP in pre-mining and post-mining soil. The mechanisms of the effects of environmental factors on soil nutrient loss were revealed based on multiple linear regression, redundancy analysis (RDA), and the random forest algorithm (RF). Ordinary kriging and RF were utilized to predict and optimize the spatial distribution of the soil nutrient loss. The results showed that significant differences existed between the SOM, TN, and AP in the pre-mining and post-mining soil. The model established by RF provided a higher accuracy in terms of fitting the correlation between soil nutrient loss and environmental factors compared to the model established by multiple linear regression, and the feature importance obtained by RF showed that profile curvature, distance to working panel margin, and surface roughness were the most significant factors affecting the loss of SOM, TN, and AP, respectively. This study provides a theoretical reference for eco-restoration, as well as soil and water conservation, in subsided lands in coalfields.</p>

AB  - The effect of climatic events such as droughts, will have severe and disproportionate impacts on poor rural communities and small-scale farmers who base their livelihoods on rain fed agriculture. These groups are considered socially vulnerable to climate change, due to various socio-economic conditions that increase their susceptibility to droughts, specifically socio-economic droughts which are associated with a failure of water resources to meet water demands leading to adverse impacts on humans and the economy of a given region. This has led to a growing emphasis on research assessing the social factors that sustain a community's vulnerability to natural hazards. The aim of this article was to assess and identify social vulnerability amongst small-scale farmers and rural communities in the uMsinga community in the KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa using an adapted social vulnerability index (SoVI). Nine social indicators were identified using qualitative and quantitative research methods. Indicators were identified from questionnaire surveys and literature that has proven the role that certain social factors play in sustaining vulnerability. The results from the study revealed an SoVI estimated for uMsinga was very high with a Likert scale index of 5 for gender, education level, preparedness strategies, social dependence, access to early warning systems and external support attributing to very high social vulnerability. Social networks and marital status scored a SoVI value of 1 and 2 respectively, which was of low vulnerability contributing positively to resilience to drought. The study also revealed that government involvement in drought management and risk reduction was minimal, as a result the study recommends the development of policies and a drought management plan at local level that includes key stakeholders to build resilience and enhance the adaptive capacity of small-scale farmers.

AB  - The energy consumed by the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system accounts for a large part of the energy consumption of buildings. Solar energy technologies in buildings have attracted more and more attention from scholars and architects because of their significant advantages in sustainable development, such as energy saving, environmental protection, and cost reduction. Sunspace has been studied for many years as a passive solar heating and ventilation technology. Nevertheless, there are also some problems associated with sunspace, such as overheating in summer and heat loss at night. The main objective of the work is to review the application of sunspace in buildings for heating and cooling, and possibly inspire more future works. This research adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The novelty of this work is to categorize different types of sunspaces according to the integration relationship with buildings and different configurations, materials and functions, and further analyze all the possible factors that can affect the performance of a sunspace. This paper concludes that sunspace can be divided into ventilated and unventilated sunspace based on the main utilization methods. According to their integration relationship with buildings, sunspace can also be divided into two types: facade and roof sunspace. Based on different configurations, materials and functions, facade sunspace further includes glazed sunspace, membrane sunspace, phase change material (PCM) sunspace; and roof sunspace includes on-top sunspace, courtyard sunspace, and integrated rooftop greenhouse. There are eight factors affecting sunspace performance that are further evaluated from the perspective of energy, environment, and economy. Directions of potential studies of sunspace are suggested. The authors hope that this research will be helpful to scholars and architects and promote the development of the multifunctional sunspace system.

AB  - Snow and glaciers are important sources of sustainable indicators for the availability of natural resources like freshwater, energy, minerals, forest, and agricultural products. Glaciers are disappearing, and snow cover areas are decreasing in the Himalayas due to increasing global temperatures and other related sensations. This study has been done using Hyperion imagery to identify different types of seasonal snow and glacier features in the north-western Himalayan states of India. Minimum noise fraction (MNF), Pixel Purity Index (PPI), and n-Dimensional (n-D) visualizer were applied to the atmospherically corrected Hyperion image. The spectral unmixing algorithm was applied to collect the endmembers or pure pixels from the Hyperion image. These endmembers were used for image classification. Different snow and glacier facies such as clean snow, ice mixed debris, blue ice, refreezing ice, dirty snow, dirty glacier ice, firn, moraine, glacier ice, and water body were found out using advanced pixel-based classification techniques. The field visits were conducted two times in a year from 2017 to 2019 in different parts of Himachal Pradesh, India. Sentinel-2 satellite data were used for accuracy assessment of the classification maps. Three advanced classifier methods artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF) were used for the classification of Hyperion image. The overall accuracy for the classification algorithms ANN, SVM, and RF is 81.14%, 87.27%, and 90.98% respectively. These classification methods prove to be beneficial for classification of snow and ice properties for remote locations which are difficult to access and have rough weather conditions. However, appropriate field investigations and analyses using multiple satellite dataset are useful to increase the reliability of the results obtained from image classification.

AB  - Meeting future global staple crop demand requires continual productivity improvement. Many performance indicators have been proposed to track and measure the increase in productivity while minimizing environmental degradation. However, their use has lagged behind theory, and has not been uniform across crops in different geographies. The consequence is an uneven understanding of opportunities for sustainable intensification. Simple but robust key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed to standardize knowledge across crops and geographies. This paper defines a new term 'agronomic gain' based on an improvement in KPIs, including productivity, resource use efficiencies, and soil health that a specific single or combination of agronomic practices delivers under certain environmental conditions. We apply the concept of agronomic gain to the different stages of science-based agronomic innovations and provide a description of different approaches used to assess agronomic gain including yield gap assessment, meta-data analysis, on-station and on-farm studies, impact assessment, panel studies, and use of subnational and national statistics for assessing KPIs at different stages. We mainly focus on studies on rice in sub-Saharan Africa, where large yield gaps exist. Rice is one of the most important staple food crops and plays an essential role in food security in this region. Our analysis identifies major challenges in the assessment of agronomic gain, including differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain, unreliable in-person interviews, and assessment of some KPIs at a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we suggest to (i) conduct multi-environment trials for assessing variety x agronomic practice x environment interaction on KPIs, and (ii) develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development of indirect methods using remote-sensing technology, mobile devices for systematized site characterization, and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs.

AB  - Anticipatory behaviour occurs in the period before a reward or other positive event is presented and has been interpreted as an indicator of the welfare and emotional state of animals. The use of this indicator has received limited attention in dairy calves. Therefore, we investigated how anticipatory behaviour is affected by housing environment and reward quality, and if anticipatory behaviour changes when reward quality changes unexpectedly. Sixteen pairs of calves were assigned to treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design (two housing environment and two reward quality combinations). Housing was either basic (2 m(2)/calf, river stone surface) or enriched (5 m(2)/calf, woodchip, and enrichment items), and the reward was access to either an additional basic or enriched pen. Calves were conditioned to anticipate reward pen access; anticipatory behaviour toward receiving the reward pen was measured. Signaling reward access increased the frequency of transitions between behaviours and duration of touching and looking at the signal and exit door. Basic-housed calves showed more anticipatory behaviour (increased frequency of transitions between behaviours) and decreased latency to access the reward compared to enriched-housed calves, but the reward pen quality had no effect on anticipatory behaviour. When the reward pen quality changed from enriched to basic unexpectedly, resulting in sudden reward loss, basic-housed calves decreased, while enriched-housed calves increased, anticipatory behaviour. However, there was no change in anticipatory behaviour during reward gain (change from basic to enriched reward pen). Our findings align with previous work showing that animals in basic housing show more anticipation for a reward, and demonstrate suppressed behavioural response when experiencing reward loss, suggesting greater sensitivity to reward. Sensitivity to reward has associations with mood state; thus, calves in basic environments may experience a more negative emotional state, and thus reduced welfare, compared to calves in enriched environments.

AB  - Sustainable management of groundwater in desert environments dictates better knowledge of the quality status and the controlling processes. To this end, an integrated analysis of hydrochemical and statistical assessment was carried out for 692 groundwater samples collected from the multi-layered aquifer system in Wadi ad-Dawasir area (Saudi Arabia). The four water-bearing formations arranged upwards, namely Lower Wajid, Upper Wajid, Khuff-Kumdah, and Quaternary, were investigated. The prime objective was to delineate the baseline conditions and the dominant process controlling the groundwater evolution that can help make resource management better. We used fifteen indicators, namely the total dissolved solid (TDS), total hardness, Eh, pH, temperature degrees C, turbidity, Fe2+, dissolved oxygen (DO), NH4, HCO3-, NO3-, F, NO2-, PO42-, and SiO2. Descriptive statistics, violation of the international standards, geostatistical modeling, and factorial analyses (FA) were performed. Geologic, soil, topographic, and climatic factors controlling the quality were investigated. The Quaternary aquifer was the most polluted by TDS, total hardness, NO3-, SiO2, Fe2+, F, and HCO3-. Khuff-Kumdah showed largest means of DO and NH4. Upper Wajid was the largest in NO2-. Lower Wajid proved largest in PO42-. Violation of the international standards clarified largest emergence of the pH for the Lower Wajid; Fe2+ and NO3- for the Upper Wajid; and total hardness, TDS, Fluoride, turbidity, and NH4 for the Quaternary aquifer. Rock interaction and evaporation are the dominant processes that contributed largely to the hydrochemical evolution of the groundwater. FA distinguished six main factors that explained for over 60.8% of the total groundwater quality variation lead byF1 (44.23%) that clarified strong positive loads of TDS (0.98), total hardness (0.95), nitrate NO3- (0.84), turbidity (0.78), NH4 (0.67), moderately loaded by fluoride (0.47), and Fe2+ (0.31).

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat decomposition proxies in an ombrogenous peatland in the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL). We anticipated that drainage would change peatland hydrology, vegetation, and biogeochemistry, leading to an increase in peat decomposition. As indicators of peat biogeochemical change and potential proxies for peat decomposition, we compared peat porewater chemistry and in situ nutrient availability of different microforms in a pristine ombrogenous bog, with a bog that has been subject to gradual lowering of the water table by 20 to 80 cm for approximately 7 years prior to, and during, our study. We also examined the chemical composition of peat and peat leachates (organic matter) fromSphagnumand lichen-covered hummocks at each site. Nutrient availability was greater in pools at the drained bog, indicating mineralisation of the dry and bare peat surface. However, our results did not show evidence of significant peat biogeochemical change or advanced decomposition in hummocks at the drained bog, with no difference in nutrient availabilities, peat porewater chemistry, or peat leachate chemistry at the drained and pristine bog. We also found no significant difference in enzyme activity (phenol oxidases) in hummocks at each site, proposed to be an important factor for C loss from peatland ecosystems in drier conditions. Overall, the effects of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat chemical composition at our sites were small and varied for different vegetation-microform types. Although decomposition in drained peatlands is likely constrained by cool temperatures in the HBL, our results suggest that ecohydrological feedbacks at the microform scale may also be important in slowing decomposition in these peatlands.

AB  - Environmental DNA is increasingly being used in marine invasive species surveillance despite the inability to discriminate between contemporary intracellular (i.e., living) and extracellularly persistent (i.e., legacy) DNA fragments. Environmental RNA is emerging as a powerful alternative when distinguishing the living portion of a community is essential. A positive relationship between DNA and RNA signals may justify the use of DNA only for more rapid and cost-effective detections. In this study environmental DNA and RNA were co-extracted from settlement plates and water samples collected in an Auckland harbor, New Zealand. Samples were analyzed using a specific droplet digital PCR assay for the invasive Mediterranean fanworm (Sabella spallanzanii), combined with metabarcoding of metazoan communities (Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1). The number and magnitude of S. spallanzanii detections was higher in DNA compared to RNA, and in water samples. An assessment of detection sensitivity and specificity using a Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) analysis supported a relationship between the magnitude of DNA signal and the likelihood of RNA detection for both sampled matrices. A prediction threshold of 400 COI copies in DNA samples provides an indicator for the detection of eRNA, hence the putative presence of living S. spallanzanii population under the conditions tested in this study. Metabarcoding community analysis revealed the taxonomic composition of the water samples to be more diverse than the plate samples which were largely dominated by mollusks. There was a strong association between mollusks and presumed extracellular droplet digital PCR signals. Nevertheless, droplet digital PCR detection signals based on environmental DNA were negatively correlated with metabarcoding diversity indices on plates. This highlights complex interactions between environmental DNA and RNA detections and environmental matrices that can affect targeted approaches. These interactions need to be considered when designing surveillance programs.

AB  - The EU programming cycle 2007-2013 marks the introduction of the concept of local development in fisheries policies. This new vision implies the need to develop sustainable development processes according to a place-based perspective. Knowledge, understood as a learning process, becomes the focal point of the territorial development process. The aim of this study is to bridge the cognitive gap at the local level about the socioeconomic aspects of the fisheries' sector, affecting the fleets involved in the definition of the Local Development Plan of the "Stretto" Coast Fishery Local Action Group (FLAG) in South Italy. The work aims to assess the economic performance of the fisheries' vessels operating in the FLAG area to deepen the knowledge about the costs and revenues of fishing activity that are critical variables for fishermen's choices. To this end, we carried out a budgetary analysis, from which seven performance indicators were derived. Moreover, a multicriteria analysis, performed through the Fuzzy VIKOR technique, allowed us to elaborate a composite indicator. The decision to operate in the fuzzy environment arises from the need to better manage the vagueness and imprecision of the data collected during the interviews. The framework is useful to both acquire and interpret in a synthetic manner the salient aspects needed to identify ideas and suggestions for the planning of development strategies, whose effectiveness is closely linked to the real conditions of the territory. The results show that the best economic performance was shown by vessels that adopt the surrounding as the main fishing system. However, at the local level, there is a general lack of interest shown by young people in undertaking fishing activities and carrying on the family business.

AB  - For studying cellular communications ex-vivo, a two-dimensional (2D) cell culture model is currently used as the "gold standard". 2D culture models are also widely used in the study of RNA expression profiles from tumor cells secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) for tumor biomarker discovery. Although the 2D culture system is simple and easily accessible, the culture environment is unable to represent in vivo extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment. Our study observed that 2D- culture derived EVs showed significantly different profiles in terms of secretion dynamics and essential signaling molecular contents (RNAs and DNAs), when compared to the three-dimensional (3D) culture derived EVs. By performing small RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of cervical cancer cells and their EVs compared with cervical cancer patient plasma EV-derived small RNAs, we observed that 3D- culture derived EV small RNAs differ from their parent cell small RNA profile which may indicate a specific sorting process. Most importantly, the 3D- culture derived EV small RNA profile exhibited a much higher similarity (similar to 96%) to in vivo circulating EVs derived from cervical cancer patient plasma. However, 2D- culture derived EV small RNA profile correlated better with only their parent cells cultured in 2D. On the other hand, DNA sequencing analysis suggests that culture and growth conditions do not affect the genomic information carried by EV secretion. This work also suggests that tackling EV molecular alterations secreted into interstitial fluids can provide an alternative, non-invasive approach for investigating 3D tissue behaviors at the molecular precision. This work could serve as a foundation for building precise models employed in mimicking in vivo tissue system with EVs as the molecular indicators or transporters. Such models could be used for investigating tumor biomarkers, drug screening, and understanding tumor progression and metastasis.

AB  - Background An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was employed to predict the oxidative stability of virgin olive oil (VOO) during storage as a function of time, storage temperature, total polyphenol, alpha-tocopherol, fatty acid profile, ultraviolet (UV) extinction coefficient (K-268), and diacylglycerols (DAGs). Results The mean total quantities of polyphenols and DAGs were 1.1 and 1.9 times lower in VOOs stored at 25 degrees C than in the initial samples, and the mean total quantities of polyphenols and DAGs were 1.3 and 2.26 times lower in VOOs stored at 37 degrees C than in the initial samples, respectively. In a single sample, alpha-tocopherol was reduced by between 0.52 and 0.91 times during storage, regardless of the storage temperature. The mean specific UV extinction coefficients (K-268) for VOO stored at 25 and 37 degrees C were reported as 0.15 (ranging between 0.06-0.39) and 0.13 (ranging between 0.06-0.35), respectively. The ANFIS model created a multi-dimensional correlation function, which used compositional variables and environmental conditions to assess the quality of VOO. The ANFIS model, with a generalized bell-shaped membership function and a hybrid learning algorithm (R-2 = 0.98; MSE = 0.0001), provided more precise predictions than other algorithms. Conclusion Minor constituents were found to be the most important factors influencing the preservation status and freshness of VOO during storage. Relative changes (increases and reductions) in DAGs were good indicators of oil oxidative stability. The observed effectiveness of ANFIS for modeling oxidative stability parameters confirmed its potential use as a supplemental tool in the predictive quality assessment of VOO.

AB  - The occurrence, spatiotemporal distribution, and potential risks of 21 glucocorticoids (GCs) and 3 mineralocorticoids (MCs) in four rivers were studied by investigating the surface waters from the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. These environmental corticosteroids (ECs) were commonly present in the river surface waters with average concentrations varying from <0.17 ng/L for fluticasone propionate to 5.6 ng/L for clobetasone butyrate; and cortisone had the highest concentration, 32.9 ng/L. The total ECs ranged in concentration from undetectable to 83.3 ng/L, with a mean and median of 8.1 ng/L and 4.8 ng/L, respectively. Spatially the total EC concentration levels in the Pearl River system occurred in the following order: Zhujiang River (ZR) > Dongjiang River (DR) > Shiziyang waterway (SW) > Beijiang River (BR). These levels generally demonstrated a trend of increasing from upstream to midstream or down-stream then attenuating toward the estuary. Considerable seasonal variations in the ECs differed among rivers. Higher ECs concentrations in winter were mostly found in the ZR, whereas lower levels were found in the DR. Moreover, the temporal variations of the ECs were marginal in the BR and SW. These spatiotemporal distributions of the ECs might have been simultaneously influenced by pollution sources derived from anthropogenic activities and river hydrologic conditions. Correlation analyses indicated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could play a key role in the occurrence and distribution of ECs in an aquatic environment. Risk assessment demonstrated that the occurrence of ECs might have posed medium to high risk to aquatic organisms in the Pearl River. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) is a useful indicator of maternal condition and the intrauterine environment during pregnancy. Therefore, we investigated protein expression in HUVECs obtained from patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). HUVECs were prepared from the umbilical cords of GDM patients and controls who underwent planned cesarean section between 2013 and 2014 at Teikyo University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). There were no differences in blood glucose levels between the GDM patients and controls at admission. However, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was higher in GDM patients, although the changes in gestational BMI were smaller during hospitalization. To evaluate the state of the endothelium, we examined the protein expression levels of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1, thrombomodulin (TM), endothelial nitric oxide synthase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and VE-cadherin, which are altered by various factors in endothelial tissue. VCAM-1, PAI-1, and COX-2 expression was higher in HUVECs from patients with GDM than the controls. Because the pre-pregnancy BMI was higher in GDM patients, we examined the relationship between BMI and protein expression. However, the expression levels of these proteins were not correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI and were higher in HUVECs from BMI-matched GDM patients than from BMI-matched controls. Intriguingly, TM expression was also higher in HUVECs from BMI-matched GDM patients. Thus, expression of VCAM-1, PAI-1, COX-2, and TM may reflect certain factors in the intrauterine environment that are altered in hospitalized GDM patients with controlled body weight.

AB  - 1. Advances in information technology are increasing the use of radar as a tool to investigate and monitor bird migration movements. We set up a field campaign to compare and validate outputs from different radar systems.
   2. Here we compare the pattern of nocturnal bird migration movements recorded by four different radar systems at a site in southern Sweden. Within the range of the weather radar (WR) Angelholm, we operated a "BirdScan" (BS) dedicated bird radar, a standard marine radar (MR), and a tracking radar (TR).
   3. The measures of nightly migration intensities, provided by three of the radars (WR, BS, MR), corresponded well with respect to the relative seasonal course of migration, while absolute migration intensity agreed reasonably only between WR and BS. Flight directions derived from WR, BS and TR corresponded very well, despite very different sample sizes. Estimated mean ground speeds differed among all four systems. The correspondence among systems was highest under clear sky conditions and at high altitudes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. While different radar systems can provide useful information on nocturnal bird migration, they have distinct strengths and weaknesses, and all require supporting data to allow for species level inference. Weather radars continuously detect avian biomass flows across a wide altitude band, making them a useful tool for monitoring and predictive applications at regional to continental scales that do not rely on resolving individuals. BirdScan and marine radar's strengths are in local and low altitude applications, such as collision risks with man-made structures and airport safety, although marine radars should not be trusted for absolute intensities of movement. In quantifying flight behaviour of individuals, tracking radars are the most informative.

AB  - The assessment of vulnerability in karst systems reveals to be extremely challenging since it varies significantly with time and highly depends on the identification of diffuse and concentrated infiltration from surface karst features. The origin, consumed loads, and transport mode of selected micropollutants (MPs) including two artificial sweeteners (ASWs) Sucralose (SUC) and Acesulfame-K (ACE-K), in addition to other less investigated pharmaceuticals such as the lipid regulator Gemfibrozil (GEM), and the contrast media Iohexol (IOX) were investigated in a karst system under dynamic conditions. A detailed analysis of selected spring responses' chemograph and hydrograph following a multi precipitation event shows that three of the tracked MPs, especially ACE-K, and to the exception of IOX, can be used as specific indicators for point source domestic wastewater in karst systems. They have revealed to be persistent, source specific, conservative, and highly correlated with in situ parameters easily measurable at the spring (chloride and turbidity). Even if the selected MPs are found in the system during low flow periods, they are mostly transported to the spring through fast flow pathways from flushed wastewater with surface water or flood rainwater. The highest mass inflow of ACE-K, IOX and GEM originated from a sinking stream, while SUC infiltrated exclusively through fast infiltration points (dolines). Their breakthrough curves coincide with the arrival of new waters and turbidity peaks. Unlike IOX, the mass fluxes of ASWs, and GEM to a lesser extent, can be linearly correlated with chloride mass fluxes and turbidity flux. Moreover, the variance of the normalized breakthrough curves of the MPs with respect to a mean transit time, increases in that order IOX < GEM < Turbidity < SUC < ACE-K indicating a higher restitution time for ACE-K with respect to other spring signals.

AB  - Widespread agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticides has resulted in frequent detection of mixtures of these compounds in global surface waters. Recent evidence suggests that neonicotinoid mixtures can elicit synergistic toxicity in aquatic insects under acute exposure conditions, however this has not been validated for longer exposures more commonly encountered in the environment. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the chronic (28-day) toxicity of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam mixtures under different doses and mixture ratios to determine if the assumption of synergistic toxicity would hold under more environmentally realistic exposure settings. The sensitive aquatic insect Chironomus dilutus was used as a representative test species, and successful emergence was used as a chronic endpoint. Applying the MIXTOX modeling approach, predictive parametric models were fitted using single-compound toxicity data and statistically compared to observed toxicity in subsequent mixture tests. Imidacloprid-clothianidin, clothianidin-thiamethoxam and imidacloprid-clothianidin-thiamethoxam mixtures did not significantly deviate from concentration-additive toxicity. However, the cumulative toxicity of the imidacloprid-thiamethoxam mixture deviated from the concentration additive reference model, displaying dose-ratio dependent synergism and resulting in up to a 10% greater reduction in emergence from that predicted by concentration addition. Furthermore, exposure to select neonicotinoid mixtures above 1.0 toxic unit tended to shift sex-ratios toward more male-dominated populations. Results indicate that, similar to acute exposures, the general assumption of joint additivity cannot adequately describe chronic cumulative toxicity of all neonicotinoid mixtures. Indeed, our observations of weak synergism and sex-ratio shifts elicited by some mixture combinations should be considered in water quality guideline development and environmental risk assessment practices for neonicotinoid insecticides, and explored in further investigations of the effects of neonicotinoid mixtures on aquatic communities.

AB  - All fine root systems consist of individual fine roots. Individual roots have morphological, anatomical, and functional heterogeneity (heterorhizy). Heterorhizy plays crucial roles in plant ecosystems. However, in many species, the heterorhizy and fine root system architecture based on individual root units are unclear. This study investigated heterorhizy along the root system architecture of Vaccinium virgatum Ait (rabbiteye blueberry) softwood-cuttings (propagated from annual shoots in growing season) using protoxylem groups (PGs), a classification according to the number of protoxylem poles, as an indicator of individual root traits. Individual roots of rabbiteye blueberry varied from monarch to heptarch. The frequency of roots with larger number of PGs decreased but those with smaller number of PGs increased from adventitious roots toward lateral roots with different branching levels. This architecture were stable among cultivars, collecting position of the cuttings, or indole acetic acids treatment. Individual root sizes and secondary growth were positively correlated with the PGs. These results indicate that branching itself strongly and broadly controls individual root traits. The individual roots were classified into two types: monarch and diarch roots with small size and lacking secondary growth (thought to be hair roots in core Ericaceae) and triarch or more PG roots with large size and showing secondary growth. These heterogeneous individual roots responded differently to the experimental factors. In particular, elongation of the large roots significantly contributed to increased total root length. These results mean that heterorhizic plasticity is a determinant of root system development and heterorhizic variation exists even under practical cutting condition. In conclusion, we demonstrated heterorhizy of rabbieye blueberry cuttings based on the strong relationships of PG, individual root morphology and growth potential, and root system architecture. This study also supports strong connection between root morphology and functional roles intermediated by the PG.

AB  - Fisheries and Oceans Canada has developed integrated fisheries management plans to promote a more holistic approach to fisheries management. Yet these management plans maintain an emphasis on the ecological domains, without sufficient attention to socioeconomic and institutional domains of management. In this study, I use a case study from Barrington, Nova Scotia, and dimensions from the Canadian Fisheries Research Network Comprehensive Sustainability Framework to demonstrate the importance of socioeconomic and institutional indicators to contribute to fisheries management plans. An analysis of survey data of captains and lobster fishing households revealed decreased access to multiple species fishing strategies, partially because of large inequities in access to individual fishing quotas. Harvesters with a high dependence on lobster as the primary source of income had lower incomes, and higher income sensitivity to the financial crisis of 2008. New strategies have emerged to cope with reduced access to multiple species, and high-yield lobster fishing is often the best available strategy to pay bills and meet costs when lobster prices are low. Outcomes for the region were split, with an equal number of harvesters reporting recent years as the best or worst year they experienced in fishing. Given a history of changing regulations and reduced options to remain flexible when economic and ecological conditions change, harvesters were pessimistic about their future access, and their children's future access, to fisheries. Harvesters faced livelihood challenges caused by cumulative effects of multiple regulatory and ecological events. I demonstrate how the Canadian Fisheries Research Network Comprehensive Sustainability Framework can guide researchers, managers, and fishing organizations to understand the current management objectives that are not being met, and to develop research priorities, methods, protocols, and personnel to meet a broader spectrum of objectives.

AB  - Chromium (Cr) is one of the major and most detrimental pollutant, widely present in the environment as a result of several anthropogenic activities. In mammalian cells, Cr(VI) is known to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to cause toxic and genotoxic effects. Less commonly investigated are the effects and mode of action of this contaminant in invertebrates, particularly in soil organisms. In this work, earthworms of the species Eisenia andrei were exposed for 1 and 3 days to various sublethal concentrations of Cr(VI) (2, 15, 30 mu g mL(-1)) using the paper contact toxicity test. In amoeboid leukocytes we investigated intracellular ROS and lipoperoxide production, oxidative DNA damage, and the effects on different cell functions. The analysis of the results shows that Cr(VI) triggered severe adverse reactions; the first events were an increase of intracellular ROS levels, generating in the cells oxidative stress conditions leading to membrane lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage. Lysosomes showed relevant changes such as a strong membrane destabilization, which was accompanied by an increased catabolism of cytoplasmic proteins and accumulation of lipofuscin. With an increase in the dose and/or time of exposure, the physiological status of intracellular organelles (such as lysosomes, nucleus and mitochondria) showed further impairment and amoebocyte immune functions were adversely affected, as shown by the decrease of the phagocytic activity. By mapping the responses of the different parameters evaluated, diagnostic of (oxidative) stress events, against lysosomal membrane stability, a "health status" indicator (able to describe the stress syndrome from its early phase to pathology), we have shown that this biomarker is suitable as a prognostic test for health of earthworms. This is viewed as a crucial step toward the derivation of explanatory frameworks for prediction of pollutant impact on animal health.

AB  - The sustainability of municipal landfills and quality of water-soil environment is being compromised by the leachate percolation through the bottom sealing liner. The compacted mineral liners, using clays of various plasticity to assure the saturated hydraulic conductivity lower than 1 . 10(-9) m . s(-1) are among the most popular isolations of municipal waste landfills. But high plasticity clays present significant expansivity so they are prone to swelling, shrinkage and resultant cracking. Swelling and shrinkage of compacted clay liners, caused by cyclic drying and watering of substrate, are irreversible and after several cycles may result in a huge increase in the hydraulic conductivity and drastically reduced sealing capabilities of compacted clay liners. This paper presents the assessment of selected substrates' plasticity influence on the isolating capabilities of the municipal landfill's bottom liner undergoing cyclic drying and rewetting. The plasticity of tested clay materials was determined and classified by the standard methods. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the studied clays formed by the standard Proctor method was measured by the laboratory falling head permeameters for compacted soils. Measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the tested substrates after three cycles of drying and rewetting were performed in the standard 100 cm(3) steel cylinders by the falling and constant head laboratory permeameter. Shrinkage of the tested compacted specimens was determined also in the standard 100 cm(3) steel cylinders and classified basing on dimensionless indicator COLE. Determination of water seepage through the tested bottom compacted clay liners was based on the standard form of Darcy law for the saturated conditions of soil medium. The obtained results showed influence of plasticity of clays on decrease in their scaling capabilities after several cycles of drying and rewetting and, by extension, undesirable increase in the seepage volume through the compacted bottom liner.

AB  - Research with humans and other animals suggests that walking benefits physical health. Perhaps because these links have been demonstrated in other species, it has been suggested that walking is important to elephant welfare, and that zoo elephant exhibits should be designed to allow for more walking. Our study is the first to address this suggestion empirically by measuring the mean daily walking distance of elephants in North American zoos, determining the factors that are associated with variations in walking distance, and testing for associations between walking and welfare indicators. We used anklets equipped with GPS data loggers tomeasure outdoor daily walking distance in 56 adult female African (n = 33) and Asian (n = 23) elephants housed in 30 North American zoos. We collected 259 days of data and determined associations between distance walked and social, housing, management, and demographic factors. Elephants walked an average of 5.3 km/day with no significant difference between species. In our multivariable model, more diverse feeding regimens were correlated with increased walking, and elephants who were fed on a temporally unpredictable feeding schedule walked 1.29 km/daymore than elephants fed on a predictable schedule. Distance walked was also positively correlated with an increase in the number of social groupings and negatively correlated with age. We found a small but significant negative correlation between distance walked and nighttime Space Experience, but no other associations between walking distances and exhibit size were found. Finally, distance walked was not related to health or behavioral outcomes including foot health, joint health, body condition, and the performance of stereotypic behavior, suggesting that more research is necessary to determine explicitly how differences in walking may impact elephant welfare.

AB  - Species attributes are commonly used to infer impacts of environmental change on multiyear species trends, e.g. decadal changes in population size. However, by themselves attributes are of limited value in global change attribution since they do not measure the changing environment. A broader foundation for attributing species responses to global change may be achieved by complementing an attributes-based approach by one estimating the relationship between repeated measures of organismal and environmental changes over short time scales. To assess the benefit of this multiscale perspective, we investigate the recent impact of multiple environmental changes on European farmland birds, here focusing on climate change and land use change. We analyze more than 800 time series from 18 countries spanning the past two decades. Analysis of long-term population growth rates documents simultaneous responses that can be attributed to both climate change and land-use change, including long-term increases in populations of hot-dwelling species and declines in long-distance migrants and farmland specialists. In contrast, analysis of annual growth rates yield novel insights into the potential mechanisms driving long-term climate induced change. In particular, we find that birds are affected by winter, spring, and summer conditions depending on the distinct breeding phenology that corresponds to their migratory strategy. Birds in general benefit from higher temperatures or higher primary productivity early on or in the peak of the breeding season with the largest effect sizes observed in cooler parts of species' climatic ranges. Our results document the potential of combining time scales and integrating both species attributes and environmental variables for global change attribution. We suggest such an approach will be of general use when high-resolution time series are available in large-scale biodiversity surveys.

AB  - Objectives To review systematically the literature on patients' experiences of, and participation in, technology-based monitoring of mental health symptoms. This practice was defined as patients monitoring their mental health symptoms, emotions or behaviours outside of routine clinical appointments by submitting symptom data using technology, with feedback arising from the data (for example, supportive messages or symptom summaries, being sent to the patient, clinician or carer).
   Design Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of studies evaluating technology-based symptom monitoring. Tools from narrative synthesis were used to analyse quantitative findings on participation rates and qualitative findings on patient views.
   Data sources PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, BNI, CINAHL, Cochrane Registers and Web of Science electronic databases were searched using a combination of psychiatry', symptom monitoring' and technology' descriptors. A secondary hand search was performed in grey literature and references.
   Results 57 papers representing 42 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Technology-based symptom monitoring was used for a range of mental health conditions, either independently of a specific therapeutic intervention or as an integrated component of therapeutic interventions. The majority of studies reported moderate-to-strong rates of participation, though a third reported lower rates. Qualitative feedback suggests that acceptability of monitoring is related to perceived validity, ease of practice, convenient technology, appropriate frequency and helpfulness of feedback, as well as the impact of monitoring on participants' ability to manage health and personal relationships.
   Conclusions Such symptom monitoring practices appear to be well accepted and may be a feasible complement to clinical practice. However, there is limited availability of data and heterogeneity of studies. Future research should examine robustly patients' role in the development and evaluation of technology-based symptom monitoring in order to maximise its clinical utility.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is a key indicator to assess ecosystem adaptation to water stress. Rain use efficiency (RUE) is usually used as a proxy for WUE due to lack of transpiration data. Furthermore, RUE based on aboveground primary productivity (RUEANPP) is used to evaluate whole plant water use because root production data is often missing as well. However, it is controversial as to whether RUE is a reliable parameter to elucidate transpiration efficiency (TE), and whether RUEANPP is a suitable proxy for RUE of the whole plant basis. The experiment was conducted at three differently managed sites in the Inner Mongolia steppe: a site fenced since 1979 (UG79), a winter grazing site (WG) and a heavily grazed site (HG). Site HG had consistent lowest RUEANPP and RUE based on total net primary productivity (RUENPP). RUEANPP is a relatively good proxy at sites UG79 and WG, but less reliable for site HG. Similarly, RUEANPP is good predictor of transpiration efficiency based on aboveground net primary productivity (TEANPP) at sites UG79 and WG but not for site HG. However, if total net primary productivity is considered, RUENPP is good predictor of transpiration efficiency based on total net primary productivity (TENPP) for all sites. Although our measurements indicate decreased plant transpiration and consequentially decreasing RUE under heavy grazing, productivity was relatively compensated for with a higher TE. This offset between RUE and TE was even enhanced under water limited conditions and more evident when belowground net primary productivity (BNNP) was included. These findings suggest that BNPP should be considered when studies fucus on WUE of more intensively used grasslands. The consideration of the whole plant perspective and "real" WUE would partially revise our picture of system performance and therefore might affect the discussion on the C-sequestration and resilience potential of ecosystems.

AB  - This paper encourages scholars of management to pay attention to the mutually constitutive nature of accounting, organizing, and economizing. This means viewing accounting as much more than an instrumental and purely technical activity. We identify four key roles of accounting: first, territorializing, the recursive construction of the calculable spaces that actors inhabit within organizations and society; second, mediating, that much of what accounting instruments and ideas do is to link up distinct actors, aspiration, and arenas; third, adjudicating, that accounting plays a decisive role in evaluating the performance of individuals and organizations, and also in determining failings and failures; and fourth, that accounting is a subjectivizing practice par excellence, that it both subjects individuals to control or regulation by another, while entailing the presumption of an individual free to choose. The entanglement of these four roles, we suggest, is what gives the accounting complex its productive force, such that it is perhaps the most powerful system of representation for social and economic life today in many national settings. We examine these issues through a selective review of the accounting literature based on the construction of two intellectual histories. One deals with the growth of scholarly interest in organizations which created the conditions for a behavioral turn in accounting research and the embedding of accounting within management scholarship. The other schematic history deals with the emergence of normative accounting pedagogy and theory from practice. This was challenged by an empirical revolution drawing on the methods of analytical economics which was broadly market-based, facing away from management. We argue for a third body of work which reacts to the reductionism of both and which focuses on the processes by which accounting representations and metrics are simultaneously powerful interventions which shape people, practices, and organizations. We suggest that accounting is a mechanism by which the economization of organizational life becomes elaborated and institutionalized.

AB  - Despite a significant decrease in the metallic waste emissions from an industrial site and a remediation process initiated in 2007, the Riou-Mort watershed (southwest France) still exhibits high Cd and Zn concentrations. Metal wastes have long been proven to significantly disturb aquatic communities. In this study, bioaccumulation capacities and responses to the chemical improvement of the hydrosystem were assessed for a year along the contamination gradient through the comparison of two biological models: Corbicula fluminea and periphytic biofilms, both considered as good bioindicators. Bioaccumulation results confirmed the persistence of water contamination in Corbicula fluminea and biofilms with, respectively, maximum Cd concentrations reaching 80.6 and 861.2 mu g gDW(-1), and Zn concentrations 2.0 and 21.3 mg gDW(-1). Biofilms exhibited bioaccumulation in close correlation with water contamination, while Corbicula fluminea presented Cd bioaccumulation clearly regulated by water temperature and metal concentrations, affecting the ventilatory activity, as revealed by condition indices measurements. Also, a linear regression using Cd bioaccumulation and temperature (Fig. 7) showed that below approximately 6 degrees C Corbicula fluminea did not appear to accumulate metals. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were higher in biofilms in comparison with Corbicula fluminea and showed the great accumulation capacity of suspended particulate matter in biofilms. However, bioaccumulation capacities are known to be influenced by many factors other than metal concentrations, such as temperature, water oxygenation or plankton and nutrient concentrations. Thus, this study demonstrates the power of a combined assessment using both Corbicula fluminea and biofilms as bioindicators to give a more integrated view of water quality assessment. Finally, when comparing our results with previous studies, the start of hydrosystem restoration could be shown by decreasing bioaccumulation in organisms.

AB  - The effects of food abundance, reproductive success and age of nestlings on parental care in female Tengmalm's Owls were tested in this study. The behaviour of female owls was monitored by a camera system from hatching to fledging at 12 nests in 2004 and 2006 in the Ore Mountains, Czech Republic. Food abundance and reproductive success (the latter measured at the end of female's attendance of the brood) were higher in 2004 than in 2006. Females remained for a significantly longer time with their nestlings at the nests in 2004 (24.8 +/- 2.4 days) than in 2006 (22.2 +/- 0.9 days). During the attendance period, they were leaving the nest for several short trips each night; the duration of these trips, the total time spent outside the nest per night, and the number of trips per night did not differ between years. However, these variables did increase with increasing age of the Young (though the number of trips per night increased only Juring the last week of the females' stay on the nests). Two types of female parental strategies were recorded after the end of brood attendance period: in 2004 when food was abundant, most of the females left their broods, whereas in 2006 when food was scarce, most of the females continued parental care and took part in the feeding of nestlings. The reproductive success was correlated negatively with both the total number of prey items and the proportional contribution of the females to nestling feeding. These results support the hypothesis that if the ecological conditions are Such that the offspring can be raised by a single parent, its mate may abandon the clutch or brood and increase its fitness by sequential polygamy (polyandry/polygyny) during a single breeding season.

AB  - A major limitation of traditional approaches to quantifying the relationship between soil quality and productivity is the confounding effect of landscape quality factors such as topography, hydrology, and climatic parameters. In this 14-yr study, we used a soil-transplant field bioassay under uniform landscape conditions to identify key soil quality attributes that could be related to spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) biomass production in southern Alberta, Canada. Thirty-six soils (main plots) collected from sites with divergent cropping and management histories were deposited at a common site from which topsoil had been removed. Total biomass yield, assessed with or without N fertilizer application (subplot), was used as an integrator of 24 soil quality indicators tested. Although between-soil variability in biomass production differed significantly among the years, we found no evidence of productivity convergence among the 36 soils after 14 yr. Partial least squares analysis identified total organic C (TOC), total inorganic C, total N (TN), light fraction (LF)-C, LF-N, mineralizable C and N (C-min and N-min), and extractable nutrients (N and P) among the most important soil quality indicators associated with variation in biomass production. Critical concentrations, above which no significant yield response to additional indicator level was expected, were estimated using segmented-model regression analysis. Nitrogen application increased critical concentrations for LF-C and LF-N and decreased those for N-min and Olsen P, but had no significant effect on TOC and TN critical concentrations and suppressed yield response to C-min and KCl-extractable N concentrations. Our findings provide evidence that selected indicators can provide a definitive, quantitative assessment of soil quality and lend credence to the value of our field approach in quantifying relationships between soil function and indicators for specific areas.

AB  - The medium to long-term environmental performances of organic, integrated and conventional olive-growing systems in the average conditions of the south of Spain are evaluated and compared with respect to soil erosion, soil fertility, rational use of irrigation water, water contamination, atmospheric pollution and biodiversity, based on experts' knowledge. The aim of the research was to test the common implicit assumption of environmental superiority of the two alternative farming systems over the conventional system. For this purpose, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a widely used multi-criteria decision-making tool, has been implemented. AHP enables us to deal with complex decision-making problems with multiple criteria, stakeholders and decision-makers, high uncertainty and risk, such as in the case of multi-criteria environmental comparison of alternative farming systems. Twenty experts in olive production, clustered into three groups according to their professional field of interest, were involved in the analysis. The utilization of experts' knowledge is justified when information relevant for urgent decision-making is not available, is partial or is time and resource demanding, and a holistic perspective is required. Indexes and procedures are proposed for group decision-making, to detect variation in expert opinions and differences between alternative systems' performances. Despite bias in the judgments of the groups of experts in some topics, results confirm the holistic environmental superiority of organic and integrated alternatives over the conventional olive system in Andalusia in the medium to long-term. The results represent a scientific base to justify and endorse institutional support regarding the promotion and implementation of organic and integrated olive-growing systems in the region, which are likely to result in greater social welfare.

AB  - Metal speciation analysis in MTs was carried out in two tropical fish species of Brazil, the freshwater fish pearl cichlid (Geophagus brasiliensis) and the marine fish white sea catfish (Netuma barba), that are presently used to monitor the effects of heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems in Brazil. In order to obtain the MT fraction, liver cytosols from both fish species where subjected to size exclusion fractionation, monitoring on-line the metal signal (Cd, Cu and Zn) by ICP-MS while protein elution was followed by on-line UV detection. That MT fraction was then separated by anion-exchange (AE)-FPLC, whose optimal chromatographic conditions were optimized for the separation of the different hepatic MT isoforms existing in both fish species. Specific detection of separated metalloforms was carried out again by the hyphenation of the AE chromatographic system with the ICP-MS instrument. The analytical results showed that MTs of these fish species, unknown so far, exhibited unique characteristics in comparison with standard MTs and other fish liver MTs. In fact, MT isoforms of N. barba turned out to be very anionic, as indicated by their high retention in the Mono Q column and the strong ionic strength required to separate them. As for G. brasiliensis, cadmium was exclusively present in only one of the peaks of the MT isoforms showing a unique metal-binding behavior for MT in this fish species. The differences between the MTs among these species and the different association of metals in particular MT isoforms display the importance of the metal speciation analysis in these proteins prior to its use as bioindicators.

AB  - Measurement data and metadata from the German Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys 1990, 1995 and 2000 are statistically analysed with regard to the following hypotheses on the variability of metal accumulation across several spatial scales: (1) The metal accumulation in mosses is correlated with the distance of the sampling sites to industrial plants, human settlements, roads and highways. (2) The metal accumulation in mosses is correlated with the distance between the sampling points and trees because of canopy drip effects. (3) Topographical features like inclination, exposition and altitude cause spatial variability of the metal accumulation. (4) Moss species accumulate metals specifically. (5) The accumulation of metals in mosses varies with ecoregions. The metadata were collected by the moss samplers during each monitoring campaign. They describe the measurement sites with respect to some of those surrounding environmental conditions like vegetation, land use and topography that could be relevant for the spatial variances of the metal accumulation in mosses. The statistical design to investigate these hypotheses includes GIS-techniques, conventional statistical methods like contingency tables and correlation analysis as well as geostatistical methods like variogram analysis, ordinary kriging and cross-validation. Although no directional dependencies can be detected by means of correlation analysis, ecoregions, altitude, moss species and the distance of the sampling site to the nearest trees influence the metal accumulation significantly. No correlation was found between the metal accumulation and the distance of the sampling sites to emission sources. This is probably caused by the low degree of differentiation of the metadata. Further statistical investigations should corroborate the findings on the spatial variability of metal accumulation and specify the multiple interrelations with site specific, local and regional influencing factors.

AB  - Microbial biomass, respiratory activity, and in-situ substrate decomposition were studied in soils from humid temperate forest ecosystems in SW Germany. The sites cover a wide range of abiotic soil and climatic properties. Microbial biomass and respiration were related to both soil dry mass in individual horizons and to the soil volume in the top 25 cm. Soil microbial properties covered the following ranges: soil microbial biomass: 20 mu g C g(-1-)8.3 mg C g(-1) and 14-249 g C m(-2), respectively; microbial C-to-total organic C ratio: 0.1%-3.6%; soil respiration: 109-963 mg CO2-C m-2 h(-1); metabolic quotient (qCO(2)): 1.4-14.7 mg C (g C-mic)(-1) h-(1); daily in-situ substrate decomposition rate: 0.17%-2.3%. The main abiotic properties affecting concentrations of microbial biomass differed between forest-floor/organic horizons and mineral horizons. Whereas microbial biomass decreased with increasing soil moisture and altitude in the forest-floor/organic horizons, it increased with increasing N-tot content and pH value in the mineral horizons. Quantities of microbial biomass in forest soils appear to be mainly controlled by the quality of the soil organic matter (SOM), i.e., by its C : N ratio, the quantity of Ntot, the soil pH, and also showed an optimum relationship with increasing soil moisture conditions. The ratio of C-mic to C-org was a good indicator of SOM quality. The quality of the SOM (C : N ratio) and soil pH appear to be crucial for the incorporation of C into microbial tissue. The data and functional relations between microbial and abiotic variables from this study provide the basis for a valuation scheme for the function of soils to serve as a habitat for microorganisms.

AB  - In the wastewater industry, decision-makers lack access to an environmental tool that can assist in further informing the non-financial analysis of a system. Such a tool should incorporate impacts beyond the effluent quality and look at the supporting processes of a plant as well as plant specific operations. Life Cycle Assessment can provide the means to fill a gap in pertinent information towards more sustainable decision-making. The project "Best Practice LCA in the Wastewater Industry" is commissioned by the CRC for Waste Management and Pollution Control at UNSW with representatives from Sydney Water Corporation (SWC), NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation and the NSW Department of Public Works. Two case studies were researched to provide a post-implementation review of changes in wastewater treatment.
   Case study 1: The conversion from chlorine gas to hypochlorite and UV disinfection has been completed for several inland wastewater plants at SWC. A review of operational data for each of the options has been incorporated into an LCA of each technology. Under efficient dosing conditions, disinfection with the hypochlorite system has the minimum environmental impact.
   Case study 2 deals with the conversion from anaerobic to aerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion minimises release of nutrients into a sidestream to be further treated in the plant. However conversion results in more biosolids production and higher electricity requirements. This study includes a consideration of the environmental impacts of biosolids production and application. On the basis of the extended system boundary including consideration of reflux composition, energy requirements and biosolids quality to potentially offset fertiliser production, anaerobic digestion performs best in 6 out of 9 impact categories.
   These results suggest that environmental LCA has a role in informing decision-making on unit process and treatment train selection by quantifying aspects on non-financial criteria. Also, improvement potentials are foreshadowed but not detailed.

AB  - Yutangba. where a sudden incidence Se poisoning occurred in 1963, is located in the northern part of Shuanghe Town of Enshi City in the SW of Hubei Province. China. In a small area of 0.01 km(2) in Yutangba, the mean concentrations of Se in soil and corn were. soil, 4.06 +/- 1.24 mug g(-1); total corn, 6.47 +/-4.29 mug g(-1): root, 4.36 +/-3.27 mug g(-1); stalk, 3.06 +/-2.24 mug g(-1); leaf, 9.79 +/-7.62 mug g(-1): and seed. 8.07 +/- 5.02 mug g(-1), the spatial distribution of Se in soil and corn is significantly uneven. Selenium is an active element in the supergene moderate-strong chemical weathering environment. relatively low-Se, median-Se and high-Se subregions can be distinguished according to St: concentrations in soil and corn. Microtopographic features and leaching conditions are the primary factors affecting Se content and distribution in soil and corn. Increased incidence of Se poisoning is likely to occur in the low-Se subregions where Se easily accumulates. Selenium concentrations differ significantly among the organs of corn and decrease in the following order: tassel (male flower), silk (female flower)> leaf > seed > root > stalk > leafy husk of the ear. The Se concentrations in the upper leaves and stalks were greater than in their lower cognates and the outer leafy husk of the ear had a greater Se concentration than the inner leafy husk. This distribution not only indicates that Se is probably an essential element for corn, but also that, under high-Se background and no Se-accumulating indicator plant occurrence. these plant organs with relatively high Se concentrations may be used as a sensitive indicator of Se levels in the environment. :(C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The methylxanthine, caffeine, quenches the fluorescence of the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator indo-1, but does not affect the ratio (R) of indo-1 fluorescence at 400 and 500 nm in the presence of caffeine concentrations up to 10 mM [1]. We have found that when caffeine is at concentrations of 20 mM or greater in vitro, or in saponin-permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers, a Ca2+-independent increase in R occurs, which leads to an overestimation of the free Ca2+ concentration. Depending on experimental conditions, two factors contribute to the alteration in R in vitro. First, when indo-1 fluorescence is low, fluorescence by caffeine, at 400 nm, can be significant. A second, and more dramatic effect, is that quenching of indo-1 fluorescence by 20-50 mM caffeine is dissimilar at 400 and 500 nm. Quenching at 500 nm is not linear, with respect to the concentration of caffeine, and causes a Ca2+-independent increase in R, that occurs even when the fluorescence of caffeine is a small portion of total fluorescence. However, unlike R, the Ca2+ calibration constant of indo-1, K(D)beta, is unchanged in 50 mM caffeine. Therefore, an accurate quantitation of Ca2+ in the presence of even high concentrations of caffeine can be made in vitro by determining the Ca2+ calibration factors of indo-1 (R-MIN and R-MAX) for each caffeine concentration. These effects of concentrations of caffeine greater than 20 mM are not observed in intact cells loaded with the cell permeant form of indo-1 when caffeine is applied extracellularly. This suggests either that the concentration of caffeine within the cell does not reach that necessary to produce the effect, or that the effects of caffeine on the dye are modified by the environment within the cell.

AB  - 1. Canopy invertebrate responses to Hurricane Hugo, tree species, and recovery time were examined at the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico during 1991-92 and 1994-95. Six tree species representing early and late successional stages were examined in paired plots representing severe hurricane disturbance (most trees toppled) and light hurricane disturbance (all trees standing and most branches intact).
   2. Hurricane disturbance affected invertebrate abundances significantly. Sapsuckers and molluscs were more abundant, and defoliators, detritivores, and emergent aquatic insects were less abundant in recovering tree-fall gaps than in intact forest during this 5-year period. These changes in functional organisation are consistent with comparable studies of arthropod responses to canopy removal during harvest in temperate forests.
   3. Tree species also affected invertebrate abundances significantly, but invertebrate communities did not differ significantly between the three early successional and three later successional tree species.
   4. Most taxa showed significant annual variation in abundances, but only two Homoptera species showed a significant linear decline in abundance through time, perhaps reflecting long-term trends during recovery:
   5. Leaf area missing, an indicator of herbivore effect on canopy processes, showed significant seasonal and annual trends, as well as differences among tree species and hurricane treatments. Generally, leaf area missing peaked during the wet season each year, but reached its highest levels during an extended drought in 1994. Leaf area missing also tended to be higher on the more abundant tree species in each disturbance treatment.
   6. Herbivore abundances and leaf area missing were not related to concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, or calcium in the foliage.
   7. This study demonstrated that invertebrate community structure and herbivory are dynamic processes that reflect the influences of host species and variable environmental conditions.

AB  - Progesterone (P4) profiles were studied in 61 crossbred primiparous postpartum dairy cows with normal parturition. Cows were located in a dry tropical environment (29.5 degrees C and 1,048 mm annual precipitation), grazing in Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and Survenola grass (Digitaria xumfolozi) supplemented with concentrate feeding according to milk production level, and body condition. The first postpartum estrus (FPE) was detected by visual observation twice a day. Rectal examination was performed once a week. Milk samples were taken twice a week beginning seven days postpartum. P4 levels in skim milk were determined by radioimmunoassay, as an indicator of ovarian activity (greater than or equal to 5 ng/ml). A first progesterone secretion (FPS) prior to the First Postpartum Estrus (FPE) was observed in 50.8% of the cows at 42 +/- 27 postpartum days (ppd). This FPS was less than or equal to 10 days in the 87.1% of the cases and 11-17 days in the rest of the animals (12.9%). The FPE was detected at 56 +/- 32 ppd; 10.9% of the FPE were anovulatory estrus (AE). Cows with AE were more frequently observed before 45 ppd. Only 38.2% of the FPE was detected prior to 45 ppd; the FPE was observed whitin 60 postpartum days in the 68.8% of the cows. Six cows (9.8%) were in luteal phase while 1.64% had persistent high P4 values (> 24 days) during the calving to FPE interval. An agreement of 44.64% was observed between P4 levels greater than or equal to 0.5 ng/ml and a detectable corpus luteum, and 84.74% after FPE. The FPE and P4 level greater than or equal to 0.5 ng/ml interval was 7.4 +/- 3.6 days.

AB  - Cloudiness derived from surface observations and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite VISSR( Visible-Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer) Atmospheric Sounder( VAS) are compared with thermodynamic properties derived from upper-air soundings over the Gulf Stream locale during a developing winter storm. The Gulf Stream locale covers the United States mid-Atlantic coastal states, the Gulf Stream, and portions of the Sargasso Sea. Cloudiness is found quite frequently in this region. Cloud-top pressures are derived from VAS using the CO2 slicing technique and a simple threshold procedure. Cloud-base heights and cloud fractions are obtained from National Weather Service hourly reporting stations. The saturation pressure differences, defined as the difference between air parcel pressure and saturation-level pressure (lifted condensation level), are derived from upper-air soundings. Collocated comparisons with VAS and surface observations are also made. Results indicate that cloudiness is observed nearly all of the time during the 6-day period, well above the 8-yr mean. High, middle, and low opaque cloudiness are found approximately equally. Furthermore, of the high- and midlevel cloudiness observed, a considerable amount is determined to be semitransparent to terrestrial radiation. Comparisons of satellite-inferred cloudiness with surface observations indicate that the satellite can complement surface observations of cloud cover, particularly above 700 mb.
   Surface-observed cloudiness is segregated according to a composite cloud fraction and compared to the mean saturation pressure difference for a 1000-600-mb layer. The analysis suggests that this conserved variable may be a good indicator for estimating cloud fraction. Large negative values of saturation pressure difference correlate highly with clear skies, while those approaching zero correlate with overcast conditions. Scattered acid broken cloud fractions are associated with increasing values of the saturation pressure difference. Furthermore, cloud fractions observed in this study are considerably higher than those reported in similar studies and by other cloud fraction formulations.

AB  - Thirty-three lines of maize, Zea mays L., from different latitudinal geographical regions were surveyed for concentrations of hydroxamic acids. All root extracts were found to contain four major hydroxamic acids: 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one (DIMBOA), 2,4-dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIM2BOA), 2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (HMBOA), and 6-methoxy-benzoxazolinone (MBOA). The range in hydroxamic acid levels between various maize lines was >30-fold, which may provide the variation necessary for selection of lines with high levels of hydroxamic acids in breeding programs. There was a trend showing that differences in concentrations of hydroxamic acids were associated with the different geographical groups, and that the intermediate temperate region (ITR) group had higher levels of all individual compounds, especially DIMBOA equivalents. Several maize lines commonly used in resistance studies of western com rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, were analyzed for hydroxamic acid levels. Corn rootworm-resistant inbreds such as SD-10 had both a larger root system and a higher hydroxamic acid concentration. A positive though weak correlation between concentration of DIMBOA in maize roots and in maize leaves was found. Seven maize lines with various hydroxamic acid levels were grown and infested by western corn rootworm larvae under controlled environmental conditions. Larval development parameters, including survival, weight, and head capsule width, were significantly and negatively correlated with hydroxamic acid levels in maize roots. These results suggest that hydroxamic acids may in some instances contribute to the resistance of maize to western corn rootworm larvae, and that hydroxamic acids may be useful as a phytochemical indicator of resistance in screening programs.

AB  - Environmental risk factors for psychiatric health are poorly identified. We examined the association between air pollution and psychiatric symptoms, which are often precursors to the development of psychiatric disorders. This study included 570 participants in the US Veterans Administration (VA) Normative Aging Study (NAS) and 1114 visits (defined as an onsite follow-up at the VA with physical examination and questionnaires) from 2000 to 2014 with information on the brief symptom inventory (BSI) to assess their psychiatric symptom levels. Differences in the three BSI global measures (global severity index (GSI), positive symptom distress index (PSDI) and positive symptom total (PST)) were reported per interquartile (IQR) increase of residential address-specific air pollutants levels (fine particulate matter-PM2.5, ozone-O-3, nitrogen dioxide-NO2) at averages of one week, four weeks, eight weeks and one year prior to the visit, using generalized additive mixed effects models. We also evaluated modification by neighborhood factors. On average, among the NAS sample (average age: 72.4 years (standard deviation: 6.7 years)), an IQR increase in one and four week averages of NO2 before a visit was associated with a PSDI T score (indicator for psychiatric symptom intensity) increase of 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 2.89), 1.71 (95% CI: 0.18, 3.23), respectively. Similarly, for each IQR increase in one and four week averages of ozone before a visit, the PSDI T-score increased by 1.66 (95% CI: 0.68, 2.65), and 1.36 (95% CI: 0.23, 2.49), respectively. Stronger associations were observed for ozone and PSDI in low house-value and low household income areas. No associations were found for PM2.5. Exposure to gaseous air pollutants was associated with a higher intensity of psychiatric symptoms among a cohort of older men, particularly in communities with lower socio-economic or housing conditions.

AB  - In this study, we present multi-season measurements from a remote mountain peak observatory in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). During the campaign, Doppler lidar and cloud radar were employed using coordinated scan patterns, to study seedable convective clouds, and identify pre-convection initiation clear-air signatures. The instruments were employed for approximately two years in an extreme environment with a high vantage point for observing valley wind f ows and convective cells. The instruments were conf gured to run synchronized plan position indicator (PPI) scans at 0 degrees, 5 degrees, and 45 degrees elevation angles and vertical cross-section range height indicator (RHI) scans at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees azimuth angles. Using this output imagery, along with local C-band radar and satellite data, we were able to identify and analyse several convective cases. To illustrate this synergy of measurements, we present two cases in unstable conditions - the 5 and 6 September 2018. In both cases, we observed areas of convergence/divergence to the south-west of the observatory, associated with wind f ow around a peak 2 km to the south-west. The extension of these deformations were visible in the atmosphere as high as 3 km above sea level. Subsequently, we observed convective cells developing in the same directions - apparently connected with these phenomena. The cloud radar Doppler images provided detailed observations of cloud hydrometeor dynamics. In both convective cases, pre-convective signatures were apparent before CI, in the form of convergence, wind shear structures, and updrafts. These results demonstrate the potential of these synergetic observations for understanding convection initiation processes and in the future, to provide cloud seeding guidance via early detection of CI events.

AB  - Chlorophyll is a good indicator of health status and nutritional condition as plant grows. Many studies have investigated the feasibility of retrieving leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) using vegetation indices (VIs) of multiple plant species, yet very few studies have examined the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for mapping LCC of mangrove forests. With field collected leaf SPAD values (relative chlorophyll content), this study explored the relationship of leaf SPAD values against five types of newly-developed VIs derived from leaf hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 data of four periods (May 2018, January 2019, August 2019, and December 2019). Linear regression with best-performing VIs and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) were developed to construct the SPAD retrieval model in each period. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was employed to compare the estimation results of VIs and KRR method, and the four periods of SPAD maps were produced by the bestperforming model. The results showed that the newly-developed index (ratio of single-band reflectance to the sum of two bands reflectance, RSSI) achieved the high correlation coefficient with leaf SPAD value at both leaf and canopy level. At canopy level, the linear model using RSSI (B8/(B2 + B5), B8a/(B2 + B4), B8/(B2 + B5), and B8/(B2 + B3)) outperformed than that using traditional broadband indices and KRR model with R-adjust(2) = 0.496, 0.742, 0.681, and 0.801; RMSE = 5.75, 4.29, 4.00, and 3.46; and RE = 7.67%, 5.68%, 4.97%, and 4.63% in each period. We concluded that there are great potentials of newly-developed index of RSSI using Sentinel-2 data for regional retrieving and mapping LCC of mangrove forests across different time periods, which is essential for mangrove ecological conservation and restoration.

AB  - The proposed research work accomplishes the experimental study and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique for erosive footprint prediction extent in hot abrasive jet machining (HAJMing) constraints on target surface erosion rate, surface roughness of intricately shaped tapered holes generation. The CFD-obtained footprints were in superior agreement with experimentally measured data. HAJMing process uses a relatively high speed air-hot abrasive stream to produce both high accuracy micro-channels and tapered holes. HAJM also defines itself phenomenal competence over all advanced manufacturing techniques due to its growing demands for better surface reliability with defects (mostly stress, heat) free surfaces. Zirconia is widely accepted and associated in the non-conventional machining processes and industries with the years of track on record of proven performance in a vast number of brittle materials. Most perceptible act in this research is the selection of abrasive particle to achieve the appropriate intricate shaped holes on zirconia ceramic with hot silicon carbide (SiC) abrasives. Machining of these features are done with varying the abrasive temperature. Optical microscopic view was considered for the generation of machined holes during HAJMing. All the experimental data were presented to study the effect of machining constraints on target surface erosion rate and surface roughness using HAJMing. Single impact experiments were executed to measure the target surface erosion due to impact of individual hot silicon carbide abrasive particles. An experimental setup has been designed to conduct the machining trials using Box-Behnken design of experiments. It is also shown that the generated workpiece surface contour and erosion rate are the function of machining constraints which have a negligible influence on air-abrasive flow characteristics. This research work also deals with the sustainability assessment under environmental-friendly hot abrasive-assisted machining conditions.

AB  - Introducing cover crops (CC) in annual cropping systems can promote nutrient cycling and improve soil health. However, impacts of CC on soil health indicators vary and depend on the duration of CC, cropping systems, and other environmental conditions. We performed an on-farm assessment of cover cropping impacts on soil health indicators including C and N pools, enzyme activities, and microbial community structure under different no-till maize-based cropping systems (maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) [CS], CS-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) [CSWw], and maize-oats (Avena sativa L.) [CO]). At five farms, fields with different durations of CC were compared to adjacent no CC (NCC) fields. In general, long-term CC enhanced the soil health parameters compared to NCC. Long-term (20-year) winter rye CC had higher water-extractable C and N content, enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase (1.2 times greater), urease (5.5 times greater), acid (1.5 times greater) and alkaline (4 times greater) phosphatase, arylsulfatase (0.8 times greater) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) (0.7 times greater)) and soil bacterial community abundance (1.2 times greater). Short-term (3-6 years) legume and grass CC mixtures increased beta-glucosidase (0.9 times), acid (0.7 times) and alkaline (1.5 times) phosphatase, arylsulfatase (3 times), FDA (0.8 times) activities and total phospholipid fatty acid (1.6 times) concentration. However, short-term (3-6 years) winter rye, legume and brassica mixtures did not significantly alter soil microbial community structure. This study showed that implementation of CC for >6 years promoted C, N, S, and P cycling that are beneficial to soil health in maize-based cropping systems.

AB  - The accuracy of attitude and heading measurement, as well as the system real-time performance are basic indicators used to evaluate an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS). In order to improve the attitude and heading measurement accuracy under dynamic complex environment, the AHRS system should also have numerical stability and calculation robustness. The AHRS system based on MEMS multi-sensor fusion can realize fusion processing of data measured by multiple sensors, so as to calculate and obtain the optimal carrier attitude and heading information, conduct real-time output, and improve the accuracy and reliability of attitude and heading measurement. For the AHRS system consisting of MEMS gyroscope, accelerometer and triaxial magnetometer, attitude and heading detection principle and algorithm based on MEMS multi-sensor fusion were proposed in this study: The information of the system itself was firstly used to discriminate motion state of the carrier within the filtering cycle, and then Kalman filtering was conducted using different measured information according to motion state to correct the attitude error angle caused by gyroscopic drift. On this basis, an attitude fusion algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering technology was designed for time update process of Kalman filtering, output information of accelerometer was taken as observed quantity under certain conditions to realize measurement updating process of Kalman filtering, and then attitude angle was calculated. In an optical fiber attitude and heading system project in practical engineering, a vehicle field test analysis was carried out simultaneously with the system using ordinary attitude algorithm, and the results showed that the extended Kalman filtering algorithm designed according to the simulation results could realize multi-sensor information fusion, improve measurement accuracy and realize accurate attitude positioning, so as to provide simpler and more flexible criteria for carrier motion status. The results have verified the accuracy and reliability of the algorithm, so it is feasible in practical engineering.

AB  - Rapid ATP testing and microbiological enumeration are two common methods to monitor the effectiveness of cleaning and sanitation in the food industry. In this study, ATP testing and microbiological enumeration were implemented at a tofu production facility with the goal of improving cleaning practices and overall plant hygiene. Results from ATP monitoring were used to target areas of the production environment needing additional cleaning; ATP results were verified by microbiological enumeration of aerobic microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts and molds. Products from the production line were enumerated for the same microorganisms to determine if there was an impact on product quality. After the implementation of ATP monitoring and targeted cleaning, there was a statistically lower proportion of swabs that failed to meet established sanitary requirements for ATP, aerobic microorganisms, and lactic acid bacteria (P < 0.05) but not for yeasts and molds. ATP swabs and microbiological enumeration agreed on site hygiene 75.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.3% to 77.7%) of the time. Product data indicated that unpasteurized finished products contained a statistically lower microbial load of the three groups of organisms following implementation of the practices (P < 0.05).
   IMPORTANCE Cleaning and sanitation are critical to maintaining safe and high-quality food production. Monitoring these activities is important to ensure proper execution of procedure and to assure compliance with regulatory guidelines. The results from monitoring activities can direct targeted cleaning of areas with higher risk of contamination from foodstuffs and microorganisms. The results of this study show that ATP monitoring and microbiological enumeration are useful tools to verify and improve the efficacy of cleaning and sanitation practices, which can have a positive impact on both plant hygiene and product quality. However, testing regimes and critical parameters will vary based on the product and facility.

AB  - Ponds in salt marshes are often misinterpreted as a symptom of degradation, yet ponds can also be part of a cyclical process of pond formation, expansion, breaching by tidal creeks, and vegetation recovery. Pond dynamics may be altered by accelerated sea level rise, with consequences for the long-term stability of ecosystems. This study tests the prediction that ponds are in dynamic equilibrium across one of the largest expanses of unditched salt marsh in the Northeast USA by (1) examining change in pond and marsh area between 1970 and present in both ditched and unditched regions and (2) by tracking individual pond dynamics across an 87-year time series. Across all marshes, vegetated area declined by 6.3%, with losses primarily due to edge erosion. Ditched marsh had significantly less pond area than unditched marsh. In unditched marshes, we found that net pond area has remained unchanged since 1970 because the amount of marsh conversion to ponds is equivalent to the amount of pond recovery to marsh. The overall extent of ponds connected to tidal creeks is increasing relative to isolated ponds that retain water at low tide, which suggests that some rates of change may be decoupling. This may correspond to a decline in the rate of pond formation, but other factors such as an increase in pond breaching rate and a lag in vegetation recovery rate may also contribute to this pattern. A nuanced understanding of marsh ponds needs to be incorporated into marsh condition assessments and establishment of restoration priorities so that ponds are not interpreted as evidence of degradation when they are exhibiting a recovery cycle. Unditched marshes around the world are a rare resource that remains essential for advancing scientific understanding and serving as reference sites for restoration of marshes altered by past management.

AB  - Data of climate-sensitive leaf traits, which are usually collected and analyzed for entire fossil leaf assemblages, also include intraspecific responses to environmental conditions. Intraspecific correlations between climate and leaf traits represent plastic responses on the individual level as well as plasticity caused by genetic differences between disjunct populations of a species. Plasticity is taxon-specific, as documented by various studies on extant plants. Data on plasticity in fossil plants are, however, rare. In this study, the plasticity of climate-sensitive leaf traits of three long-ranging species, each covering an extended time interval from the late middle Eocene to the late Oligocene or to even the early Miocene, were tracked by using material from 16 sites located in Austria, Czech Republic and Germany. Selected taxa are Daphnogene cinnamomifolia, Eotrigonobalanus furcinervis and Platanus neptuni. Leaf size-related data (lamina size, length, width) as well as leaf shape-related data (centroid, length-to-width ratio and two parameters for "roundness") were considered. All three considered fossil-species show various site-specific and significant differences for leaf size-related traits as well as for leaf shape-related traits. Data from allochthonous marine deposits show the highest plasticity, probably due to the accumulation of heterogeneous plant material from different growing sites. For the Oligocene and Miocene, the results are mostly consistent with palaeo-temperature data. This is particularly the case for "roundness" data, confirming the suitability of this trait as an indicator for climate. The high variability of various traits found for the Eocene is, however, difficult to attribute to temperature alone. Rather, the considerable variability of Eocene trait data may be explained by environmental instability during climate transition, such as changing precipitation patterns.

AB  - The effects of three environmental factors, salinity, carbonate alkalinity, and pH, on the survival, feeding, and respiratory metabolism of Eogammarus possjeticus (Amphipoda: Gammaridae) were investigated experimentally. The results show that E. possjeticus could tolerate a broad salinity range. The 24-h lowest median lethal salinity was 2.70, and the highest was 47.33. The 24-h median lethal alkalinity and pH were 23.05 mmol/L and 9.91, respectively; both values decreased gradually with time. Different values of salinity, carbonate alkalinity, and pH resulted in significant differences in the cumulative mortality (P<0.05). The ingestion rate and feed absorption efficiency were significantly affected by the coupling of the three environmental factors (P<0.05). With increases in carbonate alkalinity, salinity, and pH, both ingestion rate and feed absorption efficiency exhibited a downward trend, indicating a decline in feeding ability under high salinity and more alkaline water conditions. The coupling of salinity, carbonate alkalinity, and pH also had a significant effect on respiration and excretion (P<0.05). The oxygen consumption rate increased first and then decreased with increasing carbonate alkalinity. Under the same carbonate alkalinity values, the oxygen consumption rate increased with increasing salinity. Under the same carbonate alkalinity and salinity, the oxygen consumption rate initially increased and then decreased with increasing pH. The O:N ratio first increased and then decreased with increasing carbonate alkalinity. When carbonate alkalinity was less than 6 mmol/L, the O:N ratio increased with increasing salinity and decreased with increasing pH. The results demonstrate that changes in salinity, carbonate alkalinity, and pH had a measurable impact on the osmotic pressure equilibrium in E. possjeticus and affected the energy supply mode (i.e. ratio of metabolic substrate).

AB  - The Lower Permian Irati Formation in the northeastern and central eastern Parana Basin (southern Brazil) was investigated in terms of bulk and molecular organic geochemistry in order to enlighten the complex depositional paleoenvironment during deposition of Irati black shales. The geochemical data reflect temporal and spatial variations of freshwater incursions promoting salinity stratification and high primary productivity in surface waters with the establishment of photic zone euxinia. Overall, highly concentrated C-17 long-chain alkylnaphthalenes point to algal blooms as a result of freshwater inflows into the Irati Sea, mostly in the central eastern basin segment, and resemble concentration variations of pristane, phytane and nC(17). The freshwater inflows were also retraced by increasing chroman ratios toward the top of the investigated units along with the general decrease of further palaeosalinity indicators, e.g., gammacerane, tetracyclic (C-24), beta-carotane, and the herein suggested gamma-carotane and lexane indexes. The existence of a water column stratification promoting organic matter preservation is supported by the detection of tetrahydrophenanthrene at high concentrations, in addition to the known prominent occurrence of gammacerane. The detection of C-10 to C-31 aryl isoprenoids in addition to C-16 and C-18 pseudohomologue aryl isoprenoids points to the presence of photic zone euxinia. In general, samples from the central eastern basin were deposited in a deeper marine setting with lower salinity than samples from the northeastern basin, which displays signals of a shallower marine environment with reducing bottom water conditions, both deposited under freshwater influxes.

AB  - Knowledge of the origin of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in lakes contributes to our understanding of the carbon cycle and provides valuable guidance for lake ecosystem management. To elucidate the changes in the spatial and seasonal origins of SOM in a eutrophic lake, we collected sediment at 31 sampling points in Lake Hachiro, northern Japan, in June and November of 2016 and April and June of 2017, and measured total organic carbon (TOC) and fatty acid biomarkers. We found that TOC and the origin of SOM showed both spatial and seasonal variations. TOC was relatively high in the eastern part of the lake and may reflect the hydrological conditions therein. The average TOC of sediment collected from the 31 sampling points increased from June to November 2016, concomitant with an increase in cyanobacterial fatty acids. A cyanobacterial bloom was observed in the water column from July to October of that year, and the input of cyanobacterial carbon to the sediment may explain the TOC increase during this period. We also detected an increase in TOC from November 2016 to April 2017, which coincided with increases in fatty acids of terrestrial and diatom origin. In this regard, we suspect that meltwater inflow during this period may have borne large quantities of terrestrial organic matter, and diatoms are known to predominate in Lake Hachiro during the spring. In contrast, from April to June 2017, we recorded decreases in TOC and all fatty acid biomarkers, with the exception of those derived from bacteria, indicating that decomposition processes prevailed during this period. Quantitative estimates indicated that, despite the spatial and seasonal variations, terrestrial organic carbon was the predominant carbon source in Lake Hachiro, even when the waters were eutrophic and algal blooms were present.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystem services are negatively affected by factors such as climate change (e.g. changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise) and human interventions (e.g. agriculture practices, impoundment of dams, and land use/land cover change). Moreover, the potential synergic impacts of these factors on ecosystems are unevenly distributed, depending on geographical, climatic and socio-economic conditions. The paper aims to review the complex effects of climatic and non-climatic drivers on the supply and demand of freshwater ecosystem services. Based on the literature, we proposed a conceptual framework and a set of indicators for assessing the above-mentioned impacts due to global change, i.e. climate change and human activities. Then, we checked their applicability to the provisioning services of two well-known case studies, namely the Po River basin (Italy) and the Red River basin (Vietnam).
   To define the framework and the indicators, we selected the most relevant papers and reports; identified the major drivers and the most relevant services; and finally summarized the fundamental effects of these drivers on those services. We concluded that the proposed framework was applicable to the analyzed case studies, but it was not straightforward to consider all the indicators since ecosystem services were not explicitly considered as key assessment endpoints in these areas. Additionally, the supply of ecosystem services was found to draw much more attention than their demand. Finally, we highlighted the importance of defining a common and consistent terminology and classification of drivers, services, and effects to reduce mismatches among ecosystem services when conducting a risk assessment.

AB  - The revegetation onmine spoiled lands has potential to improve the status of reclaimed mine-soil quality. However, to date the temporal dynamics of labile and stable fractions of soil organic carbon (SOC) and glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) have not been satisfactorily demonstrated. We investigated SOC and GRSP fractions including labile particulate OC (POC) and easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and stable non-particulate OC (NPOC) and difficulty extractable GRSP (DE-GRSP) along with other important soil properties in six reclaimed mine lands chronosequence (1 to 26 years old) and a reference forest site in Raniganj Coalfield, India. Our results demonstrated that the accumulation of SOC and GRSP significantly increased with increasing age of the sites, with greater extent of increment after 26 years were seen in labile POC (6.6x) and EE-GRSP (11.5x) compared to stable NPOC (1.8x) and DE-GRSP (6.2x). The higher contribution of GRSP-C in NPOC compared to TOC across the sites, indicate the proximate role of GRSP in accumulation and stabilization of SOC during the pedogenesis. The multivariate analysis revealed strong association among arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore density, microbial biomass carbon, SOCs and GRSPs, suggesting the factors involved in SOC accumulation likely contributed to AMF proliferation and GRSP enrichment during the reclamation process. Moreover, strong correlation of GRSP and SOC with soil's bulk density, pH, total N and C/N ratio, suggest increasing GRSP and SOC content resulted inmulti-level improvement in soil properties. Our results highlight the importance of using GRSP and SOC as indicator during mine land reclamation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. The aim of our study is to compare the role of the new natural alternative (Quercetin) with the current iron-chelation therapy (Deferoxamine (DFO)) in the effect of iron overload on small intestinal tissues and to investigate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms of such toxicity. Methods. Forty-two adult male albino rats were divided into six groups: control groups, DFO, Quercetin, iron overload, iron overload+DFO, and iron overload+Quercetin groups. Animals received daily intraperitoneal injection of Deferoxamine (125 mg/kg), Quercetin (10 mg/kg), and ferric dextran (200 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Results. Iron overloaded group showed significant increase in serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation percentage (TS %) hepcidin (HEPC), serum ferritin, nontransferrin bound iron (NTBI), and small intestinal tissues iron levels. Iron overload significantly increased the serum oxidative stress indicator (MDA) and reduced serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC). On the other hand, iron overload increased IL6 and reduced IL10 in small intestinal tissues reflecting inflammatory condition and increased caspase 3 reactivity indicating apoptosis and increased iNOs expressing cell indicting oxidative stress especially in ileum. In addition, it induced small intestinal tissues pathological alterations. The treatment with Quercetin showed nonsignificant differences as compared to treatment with DFO that chelated the serum and tissue iron and improved the oxidative stress and reduced tissue IL6 and increased IL10 and decreased caspase 3 and iNOs expressing cells in small intestinal tissues. Moreover, it ameliorated the iron overload induced pathological alterations. Conclusion. Our study showed the potential role of Quercetin as iron chelator like DFO in case of iron overload induced small intestinal toxicity in adult rats because of its serum and tissue iron chelation, improvement of serum, and small intestinal oxidative stress, ameliorating iron induced intestinal inflammation, apoptosis, and histopathological alterations.

AB  - This paper examines the causal relationship between social capital and development in micro settings at a time of violent conflict by taking a case study of six villages in the north of Sri Lanka. The rich and vast literature on social capital has documented the causal linkages between social capital and the various social and economic outcomes, which, among others include development, better functioning democracies, ethnic harmony, and so on. This particular paper is focusing on micro settings to seek whether social capital is a significant factor of development in such settings, especially, at a time when these settings have gone through violent conflict, where people have been set apart by cleavages of ethnicity and/or religion. This requires understanding and measuring both social capital and development in a manner sensitive and meaningful for micro settings. Relatively, few studies show how this can be achieved and hence the research gap. This study finds that bonding social capital is a strong factor in development in terms of supporting agriculture even at a time of conflict. Bonding social capital is important in converting natural resources into economic assets which improve the level of development. Bridging social capital has had historical significance not only in agriculture but also in many other aspects. An equally important objective of the paper is to illustrate how a mixed-method approach of using both qualitative and quantitative techniques can be used for social capital research. Most studies on social capital depend either on quantitative or qualitative methods and fail to capture the intricate dynamics between components of social capital and development outcomes. This particular study shows how social capital can be measured using the indicators that local people suggest, so that, the indexes developed actually measure what is important for the people.

AB  - The article describes the system of mass higher education in terms of political economy. The author discusses how the social and economic results of the education system depend on the principles of its organization. In identifying the economic effect of education, the author emphasizes that in certain circumstances certificates of education may function in the market as fictitious capital, increasing the economic opportunities of certificate holders without any basis in an actual increase in training or professionalism. The analogy with fictitious capital is methodologically justified because the certificate itself brings about an increment in money received although it creates no new value. The social consequence of the formalization of education is the falsification of its cultural content and significance. This formalization of education and the decline in the role of education and knowledge in society may make the cultural capital to which education contributes fictitious as well because it is verified only by a certificate of qualification in place of an actual advanced level of education.
   The author describes the process of formalization of education as a bureaucratic attack on the autonomy of the academic environment. To overcome the formalization of education and to repel this bureaucratic attack on it, it is necessary to establish the proper conditions for academic and personal development while enlisting society at large in formulating standards and specific criteria for the development of education. The author sees the processes taking place in education as signs of a crisis of institutionalization as a principle for regulating human activity. This crisis is manifested today not only by numerous disruptions in the operation of the educational system but also in the crisis concerning its social significance, and more broadly in questioning the social significance of knowledge.

AB  - The degradation process involving the formation of metal soaps in drying oils is a well-known problem due to cations from pigments reacting with free fatty acids from the oil. The aggregation of these carboxylates in semi-crystalline structures can lead to eruptions through the paint layers and 'blooming' on the surface. In this work, the metal soaps formation in presence of natural resins has been assessed and studied by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with experiments concerning the ageing of drying oil and different natural resins (shellac, dammar and colophony) in the presence of common historic pigments (smalt, ochre, umber, azurite, lead white, zinc white and titanium white). Mixtures of resins and pigments have been exposed to photo-ageing in solar box up to 1000 h, thermal ageing at 50 degrees C up to 1100 h and 6 month of room conditions exposure as reference.
   The decrease in the intensity of the carbonyl band in the spectra, as well as the contemporary increase of the metal carboxylates (in the range from 1500 to 1650 cm(-1)) absorption bands, were used as the main indicators of metal soap formation. It has been observed that some pigments, particularly zinc white and smalt, present a 'catalytic' effect favouring the simultaneous formation of associated oxalates. The formation of oxalates and different degradation products from natural resins in the presence of pigments is particularly important, as it deeply affects the removability of varnishes and, more generally, the cleaning processes. Moreover, it permanently modifies the interface between painting and varnish layers as well as the aesthetic aspects of the painted surfaces. The influence of natural resins reactivity with pigments and their role in the oxalate formation is an issue still unexplored. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The diagnosis of psychoactive substance use disorders has been based primarily on descriptive, symptomatic checklist criteria. In opioid addiction, there are no objective biological indicators specific enough to guide diagnosis, monitor disease status, and evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) of the brain has potential to identify and quantify biomarkers for the diagnosis of opioid dependence. The purpose of this study was to detect the absolute glutamate concentration in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of patients with prescription opioid dependence using H-1 MRS, and to analyze its clinical associations.
   Methods: Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed definitive prescription opioid dependent (mean age = 26.5 +/- 4.3 years) and 20 matched healthy controls (mean age = 26.1 +/- 3.8 years) participated in this study. Patients were evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the opiate Addiction Severity Inventory (ASI). We used point-resolved spectroscopy to quantify the absolute concentrations of metabolites (glutamate, choline, N-acetylaspartate, glutamine, creatine) within the NAc. The difference between metabolite levels of groups and Pearson's correlation between glutamate levels and psychometric scores in patients were analyzed statistically.
   Results: Glutamate concentrations in the NAc were significantly higher in prescription opiate addicts than in controls (t = 3.84, p =.001). None of the other metabolites differed significantly between the two groups (all ps >.05). The glutamate concentrations correlated positively with BIS-11 scores in prescription opiate addicts (r =.671, p =.001), but not with SAS score and ASI index.
   Conclusions: Glutamate levels in the NAc measured quantitatively with in vivo H-1 MRS could be used as a biomarker to evaluate disease condition in opioid-dependent patients.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is a composite indicator of soil quality. Recycling of organic wastes is one of the environmentally compatible and economically viable options to increase and/or maintain SOM content. Our study was conducted to evaluate the effects of vermicompost (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4% w/w) on the consistency limits and the Proctor compaction test parameters of three texturally different soils (sandy loam, loam, and clay) from similar climatic conditions and cropping management practices. Results showed that vermicompost increased the optimum moisture content (OMC) with an associated decrease in maximum dry soil bulk density (MBD). The increase in OMC at 4% vermicompost was 64.2%, 42.4%, and 33.9% for sandy loam, loam, and clay, respectively, when compared to the control. Similarly, the rate of decrease in MBD at 4% vermicompost was 8.9%, 10.9%, and 10.4% for sandy loam, loam, and clay, respectively, than that of the control. Vermicompost increased the moisture contents of both liquid (LL) and plastic (PL) limits at OMC, in which the MBD occurred. While the OMC at control was 53% of LL and 75% of PL, these values were found as 55%, 56%, 56%, and 57% of LL and as 75%, 80%, 80%, and 76% of PL for 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4% vermicompost rates, respectively. Our results indicate that vermicompost could be applied to minimize physical degradation and compaction caused by the adverse effects of frequent tillage at higher soil moisture contents. The electrical conductivity of vermicompost used in this study was high and it requires careful and controlled use in terms of soil salinity when applied in high doses.

AB  - 1. Experimental work increasingly suggests that non-random pathogen associations can affect the spread or severity of disease. Yet due to difficulties distinguishing and interpreting co-infections, evidence for the presence and directionality of pathogen co-occurrences in wildlife is rudimentary.
   2. We provide empirical evidence for pathogen co-occurrences by analysing infection matrices for avian malaria (Haemoproteus and Plasmodium spp.) and parasitic filarial nematodes (microfilariae) in wild birds (New Caledonian Zosterops spp.).
   3. Using visual and genus-specific molecular parasite screening, we identified high levels of co-infections that would have been missed using PCR alone. Avian malaria lineages were assigned to species level using morphological descriptions. We estimated parasite co-occurrence probabilities, while accounting for environmental predictors, in a hierarchical multivariate logistic regression.
   4. Co-infections occurred in 36% of infected birds. We identified both positively and negatively correlated parasite co-occurrence probabilities when accounting for host, habitat and island effects. Two of three pairwise avian malaria co-occurrences were strongly negative, despite each malaria parasite occurring across all islands and habitats. Birds with microfilariae had elevated heterophil to lymphocyte ratios and were all co-infected with avian malaria, consistent with evidence that host immune modulation by parasitic nematodes facilitates malaria co-infections. Importantly, co-occurrence patterns with microfilariae varied in direction among avian malaria species; two malaria parasites correlated positively but a third correlated negatively with microfilariae.
   5. We show that wildlife co-infections are frequent, possibly affecting infection rates through competition or facilitation. We argue that combining multiple diagnostic screening methods with multivariate logistic regression offers a platform to disentangle impacts of environmental factors and parasite co-occurrences on wildlife disease.

AB  - 1 An increasing production of annual bioenergy crops such as maize has led to regional land-use changes, causing further shortages of already scarce floral resources for pollinators. Diversification of energy crop production with flowering crops is discussed as a mitigation strategy. The perennial Silphium perfoliatum, characterized by a flowering period between July and September, represents a promising candidate crop.
   2 The present study aimed to investigate the management and landscape conditions under which a cultivation of S. perfoliatum could be an effective measure for pollinator conservation. In this context, hoverflies served as suitable indicators as a result of the different feeding behaviours of adults (floral resources) and larvae (mostly zoophagous or microphagous).
   3 We compared abundance and species richness of adult hoverflies in 15 flowering S. perfoliatum fields in Germany with that in neighbouring habitats (maize fields, ditches/brooks and forest edges) and tested whether the landscape composition influenced local abundance and species richness in S. perfoliatum fields depending on larval feeding type.
   4 Only microphagous hoverflies were more abundant in S. perfoliatum fields than in neighbouring habitats, primarily in mid-September. This might be explained by the different activity periods and adaptations to flower traits of the two hoverfly groups. Although the abundance of zoophagous hoverflies was positively influenced by a higher crop diversity, the abundance and species richness of microphagous hoverflies responded positively to higher proportions of semi-natural habitats in the surroundings.
   5 Silphium perfoliatum can support certain hoverfly groups when it is harvested late to ensure a flower supply through to September and when semi-natural habitats are maintained in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Nitrogen management in combination with sustainable agronomic techniques can have a great impact on the wheat grain proteome influencing its technological quality. In this study, proteomic analyses were used to document changes in the proportion of prolamins in mature grains of the newly released Italian durum wheat cv Achille. Such an approach was applied to wheat fertilized with urea (UREA) and calcium nitrate (NITRATE), during the transition to no-till Conservation Agriculture (CA) practice in a Mediterranean environment. Results obtained in a two-years field experiment study suggest low molecular weight glutenins (LMW-GS) as the fraction particularly inducible regardless of the N-form. Quantitative analyses of LMW-GS by 2D-GE followed by protein identification by LC-ESI-MS/MS showed that the stable increase was principally due to C-type LMW-GS. The highest accumulation resulted from a physiologically healthier state of plants treated with UREA and NITRATE. Proteomic analysis on the total protein fraction during the active phase of grain filling was also performed. For both N treatments, but at different extent, an up-regulation of different classes of proteins was observed: i) enzymes involved in glycolysis and citric acid cycles which contribute to an enhanced source of energy and carbohydrates, ii) stress proteins like heat shock proteins (HSPs) and antioxidant enzymes, such as peroxidases and superoxide dismutase which protect the grain from abiotic stress during starch and storage protein synthesis. In conclusion N inputs, which combined rate with N form gave high yield and improved quality traits in the selected durum wheat cultivar. The specific up-regulation of some HSPs, antioxidant enzymes and defense proteins in the early stages of grain development and physiological indicators related to fitness traits, could be useful bio-indicators, for wheat genotype screening under more sustainable agronomic conditions, like transition phase to no-till CA in Mediterranean environments.

AB  - Here we examine the arrangement of plant species across an oligotrophic bog/poor fen peatland complex in the North American boreal plain and the relationships of these species to their physical and chemical environment. A semi-uniform spatial sampling approach was utilized to describe the species assemblages, pore-water chemistry and physical condition of 100 plots throughout a single peatland complex. Regardless of sharing the same ground cover of Sphagnum mosses, the remaining species separated into four distinct assemblages, each with unique indicators. These species groups along with associated chemical and physical factors are organized into four ecosites: bog, margin (edge) and two poor fen ecosites. The plant assemblages of this peatland have a complex relationship with numerous gradients, both physical and chemical, including depth to water table, shade, pH, nutrient and base cation. Rather than being homogenous across the landscape, most environmental variables exhibit distinct spatial patterns and do so in relationship to the plant assemblages, forming spatially distinct ecosites across the complex. Base cation concentrations play a smaller role than previously thought in differentiating these ecosites, and in addition to shade and depth to water table, nitrogen in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen was highly related to the placement of these ecosites. Many significant chemical factors appear related to evaporative water loss within the peatland complex, and these chemical factors are used to differentiate the ecosites. However, the mediation of evaporative water loss is due largely to self-generated responses of the plant assemblages related to shade through plant morphology and peat acrotelm development related to depth to water table. We conclude that plant species and associated environmental gradients act together to form spatially distinct ecosites. The distribution of these ecosites within this large, environmentally complex peatland is largely controlled by differing self-generated responses along the hydrotopographical gradient of differential water loss.

AB  - Cattle manure compost (CMC) combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) was applied to a wheat-maize rotation field, in Eastern China, to assess soil physical and chemical properties, biological activity and land productivity. Indicators of organic matter, carbon storage and sequestration, bulk density, water content, total N content and earthworm population from topsoil (0-20 cm) were quantified. This consecutive study (2009-2014) was carried out on the base of the same total N, P, K application rate (375.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 92.4 kg P2O5 ha(-1) yr(-1) and 316.3 kg K2O ha(-1) yr(-1)) in each treatment that was fertilized. Six treatments were designed as: (1) CK, without any fertilizer; (2) NPK, 100% CF; (3) NPKM1, 25% CMC combined with 75% CF; (4) NPKM2, 50% CMC combined with 50% CF; (5) NPKM3, 75% CMC combined with 25% CF; and (6) CM, 100% CMC. The results demonstrated that organic matter, water content, total N content and earthworm density from topsoil were significantly and positively (P <= 0.01) related to CMC input, with significantly negative correlation being observed between soil bulk density and CMC input. The average annual yield of the wheat-maize rotation system significantly increased (P <= 0.05) in NPK, NPKM1, NPKM2, NPKM3, and CM compared with CK, with the highest yield being obtained from NPKM1. Applying merely CF not only led to the lower SOM, water content and total N content, but also resulted in negative effects on earthworm activity, while CMC alleviated such negative effects. Our finding may help to increase food supply by improving soil conditions with organic fertilizer compost application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the design and characterization of a limited number of areas to be used as spatial monitoring and reporting units (MRU) by CropWatch, the global crop monitoring system ( ) hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The MRUs are modified and adapted from an existing standard vegetation zoning map. They are designed to be areas of uniform vulnerability as assessed by three sets of variables: environmental (such as climate and NDVI), seasonality (such as intra-annual climate variations and interannual NDVI variability) and agronomy (such as presence/absence of major crops and their yield). The paper pays due attention to within-zone spatial variability for each of the three groups of variables: in general, the variability measured as the average of the spatial coefficient of variation inside MRUs, is much larger for agronomic variables (330%) than for environmental variables (38%) and seasonality (55%). The MRUs provide a rather coherent picture of the variations of global agriculture, for instance, the links between the distribution of crops, agricultural production potential, and environmental variability (over space and time). They closely delineate the distribution of the major nonsugar food crops (barley, cassava, maize, potatoes, rice, soybean, and wheat). The discussion focuses on the relations between the size of the MRUs and the within-MRU variability (spatial heterogeneity) of cropping, and environmental conditions including seasonality. The conclusion stresses that spatial variability in agriculture is bound to be larger than the variability in the environmental variables used to define the units, regardless of the units' size. The size of the spatial units (and therefore their number) is not a very critical constraint for operational impact reporting, especially if impact indicators focus on agricultural areas inside MRUs.

AB  - Organic fertilizers (manures and slurries) applied repeatedly over many cropping seasons favourably influence nutrient recycling, maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM), and improve soil quality parameters such as soil aggregation and porosity. These aspects are particularly relevant in Mediterranean environments characterized by low SOM. This study was set up in a subhumid Mediterranean area where two different trials, devoted to winter cereals, were fertilized with dairy cattle manure (DCM) or pig slurry (PS) for a period of 12 years. One objective of this research was to evaluate the impacts of these fertilization practices on aggregate stability and SOM fractions, when compared with a mineral N fertilizer and a control (no-N) treatment. Porosity and pore shape were also studied in PS plots. The use of DCM significantly increased water stable aggregates by up to 16.4-18.0 %. Slurry addition did not affect aggregation but it increased the area occupied by pores > 65 A mu m. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and light organic fraction (0.05-0.2 mm) increased with DCM incorporation but in PS treatments the SOC increment was non-significant. Data from DCM and PS together showed a positive and significant linear relationship between SOC (p < 0.05, R-2 = 0.60), SOC light fraction (p < 0.01, R-2 = 0.75) and SOC light fraction at 0.05-0.2 mm size (p < 0.01, R-2 = 0.83), with water-stable aggregate. The use of animal residues (DCM or PS), applied according to an N criterion, increased available phosphorus and potassium soil content while improving yields. The enrichment of soil nutrients with DCM and PS use requires further research in order to avoid potential environmental impacts.

AB  - This paper examines uncertainty research in Impact Assessment (IA) and the focus of attention of the IA scholarly literature. We do so by first exploring 'outside' the IA literature, identifying three main themes of uncertainty research, and then apply these themes to examine the focus of scholarly research on uncertainty 'inside' IA. Based on a search of the database Scopus, we identified 134 journal papers published between 1970 and 2013 that address uncertainty in IA, 75% of which were published since 2005. We found that 90% of IA research addressing uncertainty focused on uncertainty in the practice of IA, including uncertainty in impact predictions, models and managing environmental impacts. Notwithstanding early guidance on uncertainty treatment in IA from the 1980s, we found no common, underlying conceptual framework that was guiding research on uncertainty in IA practice. Considerably less attention, only 9% of papers, focused on uncertainty communication, disclosure and decision-making under uncertain conditions, the majority of which focused on the need to disclose uncertainties as opposed to providing guidance on how to do so and effectively use that information to inform decisions. Finally, research focused on theory building for explaining human behavior with respect to uncertainty avoidance constituted only 1% of the IA published literature. We suggest the need for further conceptual framework development for researchers focused on identifying and addressing uncertainty in IA practice; the need for guidance on how best to communicate uncertainties in practice, versus criticizing practitioners for not doing so; research that explores how best to interpret and use disclosures about uncertainty when making decisions about project approvals, and the implications of doing so; and academic theory building and exploring the utility of existing theories to better understand and explain uncertainty avoidance behavior in IA.

AB  - Most agricultural experiments involve evaluation of multiple variables and at times it can be difficult to identify the biologically relevant effects of the experimental treatments after performing the traditional ANOVA, Tukey and t-tests. The coefficient of variation formula could be an important tool to focus 'Result and Discussion' sections only on the most important changes produced by the experimental treatments. This short report is intended to exemplify the use of the coefficient of variation in three plant physiology experiments. The first one dealt with the effects of common bean plantlet exposure to high temperature under controlled conditions (levels: 28 and 40 degrees C). The second experiment was related to Common bean seed exposure to liquid nitrogen during five different periods of time (levels: 0, 7, 14,21 and 28 days). The third experiment was bi-faccorial: factor 1 was the 'type of plant material' (levels: pineapple plants generically transformed and the untransformed control); and factor 2 was the 'time of in tntro-plantlet hardening' (levels: 0, 15 and 30 days). Contents of phenolics, aldehydes, chlorophylls and proteins were determined. Percentage of seed germination, electrolyte leakage, peroxidase activity, plant height and weight were also measured. Experiments were monofactorial with two levels, monofactorial with five levels and bifactorial, respectively, with randomized design. The coefficient of variation showed that the most remarkable effects of high temperature were recorded in free phenolics and chlorophylls (a, b, total). Electrolyte leakage and chlorophyll b concentration were the most modified indicators as a result of seed exposure to liquid nitrogen. In the third experiment, modification in the levels of malondialdehyde and other aldehydes were the most relevant changes resulting from factors interactions. A similar procedure has not been published, except for our previous publications, not focused on the use of the coefficient of variation, just on the biological results.

AB  - This paper examines investment decisions regarding innovation and emissions abatement in a dynamic framework, where knowledge stock is an impure public good. We take a sector perspective based on neo Schumpeterian theory that emphasises the role of both sector and innovation systems. We interpret results taking into account sector and country based institutional, market and policy conditions. Econometric outcomes, based on an original sector dataset which exploits the NAMEA source for 15 European Union (EU) countries and 23 manufacturing sectors in the time frame 1995-2006, show that innovation efforts are positively correlated to various spillover effects. Those effects include the emissions abatement of the other sectors, thus pointing out the relevance of forces which opposite typical free riding behaviour in public or mixed public good frameworks. Different reactivity strengths for different global and local emissions also allow us to disclose the specific role of technological and economic complementarity. When considering CO2 emissions, innovation is mainly triggered by national interactions, a fact which is coherent with a dominance of national innovation and policy systems in the EU. The result is also consistent with the fact that CO2 abatement technologies heavily regard energy efficiency that provides joint private and public benefits. The fact that NMVOC abatement efforts by other sectors from abroad impact R&D investments positively means that, in some cases, a realm of sectoral systems of innovation is also relevant. The different evidence between local and global externalities is surely explained not only by the different technological and economic contents, but also by the fact that the EU has witnessed different policy implementation.

AB  - Changes in olive growing techniques in the last years have shown the need for new bred cultivars able to replace the traditional ones today cultivated. In this work, seven new advanced selections recently obtained in the olive breeding program of Cordoba, Spain, and coming from crosses between 'Arbequina' and 'Picual' were evaluated for fruit traits and oil quality parameters. Fruit weight, oil and moisture content, ripening index, fruit removal force and fatty acid composition were analyzed once a month over the ripening season from September to December over two consecutive years. Analysis of variance showed that the genotype effect was the main contributor to the total sums of squares for most of the traits evaluated, However, high influence of year, harvest date and interactions was also observed in some cases. Significant differences between cultivars were observed for all the evaluated characters. Ranking correlations indicate that the evaluation in a single common harvest date could be a reliable indicator for a correct classification of advanced olive selections for the traits considered. This would avoid the need for repeated measurements throughout the season or for collection of samples at a common ripening index for comparison. The correlations observed among fruit characteristics and fatty acids could be of interest in future breeding programs for those traits and some of them confirm previous results with seedling progenies and other breeding selections. Among all the selections evaluated, UC-I-42-48 seems promising for its good fruit size, oil content and low fruit removal force. Additionally UC-I-2-35 could be highlighted for its high oleic acid content, although further evaluation will be carried out in the future to obtain a complete commercial evaluation under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Microbial source tracking (MST) methods were evaluated in the Source Identification Protocol Project (SIPP), in which 27 laboratories compared methods to identify host sources of fecal pollution from blinded water samples containing either one or two different fecal types collected from California. This paper details lessons learned from the SIPP study and makes recommendations to further advance the field of MST. Overall, results from the SIPP study demonstrated that methods are available that can correctly identify whether particular host sources including humans, cows and birds have contributed to contamination in a body of water. However, differences between laboratory protocols and data processing affected results and complicated interpretation of MST method performance in some cases. This was an issue particularly for samples that tested positive (non-zero C-t values) but below the limits of quantification or detection of a PCR assay. Although false positives were observed, such samples in the SIPP study often contained the fecal pollution source that was being targeted, i.e., the samples were true positives. Given these results, and the fact that MST often requires detection of targets present in low concentrations, we propose that such samples be reported and identified in a unique category to facilitate data analysis and method comparisons. Important data can be lost when such samples are simply reported as positive or negative. Actionable thresholds were not derived in the SIPP study due to limitations that included geographic scope, age of samples, and difficulties interpreting low concentrations of target in environmental samples. Nevertheless, the results of the study support the use of MST for water management, especially to prioritize impaired waters in need of remediation. Future integration of MST data into quantitative microbial risk assessments and other models could allow managers to more efficiently protect public health based on site conditions.

AB  - The transport experiment at the MADE site (a highly heterogeneous aquifer) was investigated extensively in the last 25 years. The longitudinal mass distribution m(x,t) of the observed solute plume differed from the Gaussian shape and displayed strong asymmetry. This is in variance with the prediction of stochastic models of flow and transport in weakly heterogeneous aquifers. In the last decade, we have forwarded a model coined as MIM (multi-indicator), in which the heterogeneous structure consists of blocks of different of different and independent random lognormal K. Thus, the structure is completely characterized by K-G (the geometric mean), sigma(2)(Y) (the logconducitvity variance) and the integral scale I. Flow (uniform in the mean) and advective transport were solved by the semianalytical SCA (self-consistent approximation). The SCA models the travel time of a solute parcel from an injection to a control plane as a sequence of independent time steps, each resulting from the simple solution for isolated blocks surrounded by a uniform matrix. The aim of the article is to determine whether the model could predict the observed mass distribution of MADE (sigma(2)(Y)similar or equal to 7 based on the most recent direct-push injection logger data), by using the recently collected detailed K data and the observed mean head gradient. It was found that the agreement with the measured plume is quite satisfactory, differences related to incomplete mass recovery, injection condition and ergodicity notwithstanding. It is concluded that the physical mechanism of advection, modeled by the local ADE, and the heterogeneity of K, are able to explain the MADE plume behavior and the stochastic model could predict it.

AB  - Interactions between epilithic biofilm and local hydrodynamics were investigated in an experimental flume. Epilithic biofilm from a natural river was grown over a 41-day period in three sections with different flow velocities (0.10, 0.25 and 0.40 m s(-1) noted LV, IV and HV respectively). Friction velocities u* and boundary layer parameters were inferred from PIV measurement in the three sections and related to the biofilm structure. The results show that there were no significant differences in Dry Mass and Ash-Free Dry Mass (g m(-2)) at the end of experiment, but velocity is a selective factor in algal composition and the biofilms' morphology differed according to differences in water velocity. A hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (Bray-Curtis distances) and an Indicator Species Analysis (IndVal) showed that the indicator taxa were Fragilaria capucina var. mesolepta in the low-velocity (u*. = 0.010-0.012 m s(-1)), Navicula atomus, Navicula capitatoradiata and Nitzschia frustulum in the intermediate-velocity (u*. = 0.023-0.030 m s(-1)) and Amphora pediculus, Cymbella proxima, Fragilaria capucina var. vaucheriae and Surirella angusta in the high-velocity (u*. = 0.033-0.050 m s(-1)) sections. A sloughing test was performed on 40-day-old biofilms in order to study the resistance of epilithic biofilms to higher hydrodynamic regimes. The results showed an inverse relationship between the proportion of detached biomass and the average value of friction velocity during growth. Therefore, water velocity during epilithic biofilm growth conditioned the structure and algal composition of biofilm, as well as its response (ability to resist) to higher shear stresses. This result should be considered in modelling epilithic biofilm dynamics in streams subject to a variable hydrodynamics regime. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rating of environmental aspects plays a central role in the ISO 14001 environmental management system (EMS) and EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme because it is the basis for the identification of an organization's environmental targets. The existing methods for the assessment of environmental aspects are grouped into three categories: risk assessment-based (RA-based), life cycle assessment (LCA)-based, and criterion-based methods. The first category accurately determines abnormal, or accidental aspects, as well as the probabilistic causality of aspect-pathway-receptor-impact relationships, but when evaluating environmental impact, it cannot provide a sound theoretical basis. The second category provides a theoretical foundation for the assessment of environmental impact, due to LCA, but cannot adequately represent the probabilistic aspect-pathway-receptor-impact relationship. The third category puts emphasis on the significance criteria, but the scoring methods are too simple. To combine the benefits of these three categories of research, this study proposes an integrated framework, combining RA-, LCA-, and criterion-based methods.
   The integrated framework incorporates LCA techniques for the identification of the causal linkage for aspect-pathway-receptor-impact, uses fuzzy logic to assess aspects, considers fuzzy conditions, in likelihood assessment, and employs a new multi-criteria decision analysis method-multi-criteria and multi-connection comprehensive assessment (MMCA)-to estimate significant aspects in EMS.
   The proposed model is verified, using a real case study-a waste-recycling factory. The results show that this method successfully prioritizes the environmental aspects. Compared with criterion-based methods, the case study demonstrates that the proposed method provides a more solid theoretical basis.
   This study integrates RA, LCA, and MMCA, to assess environmental aspects. The method identifies the probabilistic causality of aspect-pathway-receptor-impact relationships, enhances the theoretical foundations, and strengthens decision-making.

TI  - Spatial distribution of Hevea brasiliensis trunk phloem necrosis within a plot: aggregation but no evidence of constraint on cumulated growth
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - RUBBER TREE
KW  - IVORY-COAST
AB  - P>Trunk phloem necrosis (TPN) is a major constraint in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. Current knowledge supports a scenario of a multi-factor physiological 'disease' caused by an accumulation of endogenous and exogenous stresses. Without evidence of a pathogen, the apparent spread of the syndrome from tree to tree along the planting line, strongly suggested the implication of a major local soil constraint. The objectives of the study were to address, within a plot, three points of the above scenario: the short-distance aggregation of affected trees; their correspondence with local micro-areas facing the highest environmental constraints; and the relative weakness of TPN trees that had accumulated several stresses since planting. The study was conducted in a young rubber tree stand (clone RRIM 600) of Northeast Thailand, where the number of TPN affected individuals was 8% after 3 years of tapping. Trunk girth and trunk basal area were used as indicators of local environmental constraints. Spatial patterns were analysed using the framework of marked point processes and K functions. The results confirmed the short-distance aggregation of TPN affected trees. But, TPN trees were not located within micro-areas where trees had a lower trunk basal area than average. Hence, the clusters of TPN do not occur in the most constraining environmental micro-areas of the plot in terms of growth since planting. Moreover, from comparison of girth, current girth increment and height of bark consumption, we infer that TPN trees were not smaller and less vigorous than other trees before the syndrome outbreak. Finally, our conclusions mean the previous scenario driven by major soil constraints becomes a 'more complex scenario' in which specific soil conditions (not the most constraining in term of cumulated growth), possibly in interaction with inter-individual competition, induce a late and subtle stress favouring a necrotic reaction against tapping stress.

AB  - Phytoremediation strategies utilize plants to decontaminate or immobilize soil pollutants. Among soil pollutants, metalloid As is considered a primary concern as a toxic element to organisms. Arsenic concentrations in the soil result from anthropogenic activities such as: the use of pesticides (herbicides and fungicides); some fertilizers; Au, Pb, Cu and Ni mining; Fe and steel production; coal combustion; and as a bi-product during natural gas extraction. This study evaluated the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), wand riverhemp (Sesbania virgata), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) as phytoremediators of soils polluted by As. Soil samples were placed in plastic pots, incubated with different As doses (0; 50; 100 and 200 mg dm(-3)) and then sown with seeds of the three species. Thirty (pigeon pea) and 90 days after sowing, the plants were evaluated for height, collar diameter and dry matter of young, intermediate and basal leaves, stems and roots. Arsenic concentration was determined in different aged leaves, stems and roots to establish the translocation index (TI) between the plant root system and aerial plant components and the bioconcentration factors (BF). The evaluated species showed distinct characteristics regarding As tolerance, since the lead tree and wand riverhemp were significantly more tolerant than pigeon pea. The high As levels found in wand riverhemp roots suggest the existence of an efficient accumulation and compartmentalization mechanism in order to reduce As translocation to shoot tissues. Pigeon pea is a sensitive species and could serve as a potential bioindicator plant, whereas the other two species have potential for phytoremediation programs in As polluted areas. However, further studies are needed with longer exposure times in actual field conditions to reach definite conclusions on relative phytoremediation potentials.

AB  - Freshwater discharge is one of the most critical parameters driving water properties within fjord estuarine environments. To date, however, little attention has been paid to the issue of freshwater runoff into, Glacier Bay, a recently deglaciated fjord in southeastern Alaska. Estimates of discharge into Glacier Bay and the outlying waters of Icy Strait and Cross Sound are therefore presented. Existing regression equations for southcentral and southeastern coastal Alaska are applied to Glacier Bay to arrive at the estimates. A limited set of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements generally support the predictions of the regression equations. The results suggest that discharge into the bay ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand m(3) s (1) during a typical year. Peak discharges can be much higher, approximately 10,000 m(3) s (1) for the 10-year flow event. Estimates of the seasonal variation of discharge are also obtained and reveal a broad peak during the summer months.
   The hydrologic estimates are then coupled with a barotropic tidal circulation model (ADCIRC - ADvanced CIRCulation model) of Glacier Bay waters. This Coupling is achieved by treating the entire coastline boundary as a non-zero normal-flux boundary. Numerical simulations with the inclusion of runoff allow for the estimation of parameters such as the estuarine Richardson number, which is an indicator of estuary mixing. Simulations also allow for the comparison of Lagrangian trajectories in the presence and absence of runoff. The results of the present paper are intended to complement a comprehensive and recently-published dataset on the oceanographic conditions of Glacier Bay.
   The results will also guide continuing efforts to model three-dimensional circulations in the bay, (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1 To explore the role of edaphic controls in the response of arctic tundra to climate change, we analysed Holocene pollen records from lakes in northern Alaska located on glaciated surfaces with contrasting soil texture, topography and tundra communities. Using indicator taxa, pollen accumulation rates (PARs) and multivariate comparison of fossil and modern pollen assemblages, we reconstructed the vegetational changes at Upper Capsule Lake (Sagavanirktok surface) and Red Green Lake (Itkillik II surface) in response to increased effective moisture between the early and middle Holocene.
   2 In the Red Green record, low PARs and the continuous presence of taxa indicative of prostrate-shrub tundra (PST; Equisetum, Polypodiaceae, Thalictrum and Rosaceae) indicate that the vegetation resembled PST throughout the Holocene. During the warm, dry early Holocene (11 300-10 000 cal years BP), PST also occurred on Sagavanirktok surfaces, as evidenced by PST indicators (Bryidae, Polypodiaceae, Equisetum and Rosaceae) in this interval of the Upper Capsule record. However, PARs increased, suggesting increased vegetation cover, PST taxa declined and taxa indicative of dwarf-shrub tundra (DST; Rubus chamaemorus and Lycopodium annotinum) increased between 10 000 and 7500 cal years BP.
   3 We hypothesize that between the early and middle Holocene the fine-textured soils and smooth topography of Sagavanirktok surfaces led to increased soil moisture, greater vegetation cover, permafrost aggradation, anoxic and acidic soil conditions, slower decomposition and the development of a thick organic layer. In contrast, soil moisture remained low on the better-drained Itkillik II surface, and vegetational changes were minor.
   4 Landscape-scale substrate variations have an effect on how tundra responds to climate change, suggesting that the response of arctic ecosystems to future variability may be spatially heterogeneous.

AB  - A new method is described for measuring spatial colonization by plants from three-dimensional (3-D) records of their aerial morphology. Nonparametric indices were devised to quantify the space colonized by the plant by measuring the spatial dispersion of sets of points representing relevant morphological features of its architecture, such as the nodes and petiole tips. These indices are defined as the square root of the second-order moments of these sets, i.e., as dispersion radii. They can be split into the components that characterize the major directions of colonization and those that analyze the contributions of the various morphological features. Horizontal dispersion can be visualized as an indicator ellipse ( to characterize the anisotropy), and vertical dispersion as equivalent heights. The kinetics of spatial colonization are then characterized as the changes in these dispersion radii during the development of the plant. This method is illustrated using isolated white clover plants. Two phases can be distinguished in the growth of this species: (i) a phase of rapid horizontal colonization involving the petioles and (ii) a phase in which the rate of horizontal colonization becomes slower and steady and involves both internodes and petioles. Petioles therefore make a major contribution to both vertical and horizontal colonization. We also show that these conclusions could not have been reached using only organ lengths and that the usual assumptions about the function of petioles in white clover should be reconsidered. We argue that this is a general method that can be applied to most species and growth forms of plants. It should be particularly useful for analyzing plastic morphogenetic responses to light conditions and their contribution to light foraging as a complement to estimating light interception.

AB  - Slightly weathered white and pink tuffs of the Midas monument have deterioration problems. In this study, depths and characteristics of the weathering zones developed within the tuffs are investigated through optical microscopy, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), chemical analyses, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and some index parameters. Accelerated weathering tests including wetting-drying, freezing-thawing and salt crystallization are performed, and durability assessment methods are used to predict the durabilities of the tuffs. The findings are compared with field observations. By examining quantitative weathering indices and comparing them with thin section studies, it is found that thin section analyses of the crystals, Lol, and WPI are good indicators to quantify the depth of weathering for the tuffs. However, thin section studies have limited value for fine-grained tuffaceous matrix. The chemical weathering of the tuffs produces weathered zones that are 4.5-cm thick within the white tuff and 2.5-cm thick within the pink tuff. Physical weathering causes scaling of outer layers of the tuffs and fracturing of feldspars along their cleavage planes. However, variations of the index properties of the tuffs due to weathering are not so significant to quantify the weathering depths in the tuffs. Among the accelerated weathering tests, salt crystallization is found to be the most destructive environmental condition. Pigeon droppings rich in NO31- are found to be the main source of soluble salt at the Midas monument. The salt transported up by capillary rise due to surface water causes spalling of the tuffs in the capillary zone. Surface water and salt of any kind in the close vicinity of the monument should be totally eliminated for the purpose of conservation. Field observations and the durability equations reveal that the white tuff is less durable than the pink tuff. Wet-to-dry strength ratio yields a better stone durability assessment among various durability methods used in this study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploration programs in deepwater Tertiary basins (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico) typically rely on bright-spot and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) technology to help identify oil- and gas-charged sands. The reliance on these attributes, along with the high cost of exploration programs in deepwater environments, has driven the need to examine the limitations of these technologies and to build robust models for the conditions under which AVO is useful as a fluid and/or lithology indicator.
   We build subregional AVO background trends for both brine- and gas-saturated sands from several wells from the eastern deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These trends are built from the depth dependencies of velocities and densities for both shale and sands (brine saturated). Simple models of AVO gradient and intercept are constructed as a function of depth below the mud line. Sand and shale properties show little velocity contrast, justifying the interpretation of these data in the context of linearized AVO models. In addition to the in-situ brine response, the response to gas is also calculated. These trend models indicate that the AVO response is suppressed (although still positive) below a depth of approximately 10000 ft below the mud line. Even optimistic porosity modeling (sand porosity > 30%) does not substantially change this conclusion, An important corollary is that the absence of it strong AVO anomaly at these deeper depths cannot be used with confidence when ruling out hydrocarbon presence. This observation also highlights the need to crossplot attributes to best predict hydrocarbon presence.
   Velocity data collected as part of this study are also used to generate a local shear velocity estimator for sands and shale, These shear estimators are similar in form to other published estimators, but minor differences in coefficients may become important in AVO modeling.

AB  - Experimental studies of the upper thermal limits of corals from Orpheus Island, an inshore reef in the central Great :Barrier Reef, show that Acropora formosa has a 5-day 50%-bleaching threshold of between 31 and 32 degrees C in summer, only 2 to 3 degrees C higher than local mean summer temperatures (29 degrees C). Summer bleaching thresholds for Pocillopora damicornis and A. elseyi were 1 degrees C higher (between 32 and 33 degrees C). The winter bleaching threshold of Pocillopora damicornis was 1 degrees C lower than its summer threshold, indicating that seasonal acclimatisation may take place. This seasonal difference raises the possibility that at least some corals may be capable of short-term thermal acclimatisation. Neither P. damicornis nor A. elseyi showed habitat-specific (reef flat versus reef slope) differences in bleaching thresholds. Further, colonies of P. damicornis collected from sites 3 km apart also showed no difference in bleaching threshold despite populations of this species responding differently at these two sites during a natural bleaching event. The bleaching thresholds determined in this study are best considered as the maximum tolerable temperatures for local populations of these species because they were determined in the absence of additional stressors (e.g. high light) which often co-occur during natural bleaching events. We consider the 5-day 50% bleaching thresholds determined in these experiments to be fair indicators of upper thermal limits, because > 50% of a sample population died when allowed to recover in situ. We found a delay of up to a month in the bleaching response of corals following thermal stress, a result that has implications for identifying the timing of stressful conditions in natural bleaching events.

AB  - The response of chlorophyll fluorescence to chilling temperatures was evaluated by two different experiments. In the first, the F685/F730 and the F-v/F-m chlorophyll fluorescence ratios were measured in Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv. Mondragone plants under chilling stress at 4 degrees C and moderate light (100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) up to 72 hours. F-v/F-m decreased linearly with chilling time indicating a photoinhibitory effect (no change was observed in the dark under the same conditions). F685/F730 underwent a rapid exponential decay followed by a linear slow decline. In a second experiment, the F685/F730 ratio, the total chlorophyll fluorescence, F685 + F730, and the leaf temperature were monitored on a single leaf in a climate chamber as the temperature was decreased from 20 to 4 degrees C. The experiment was run simultaneously on the chilling-sensitive Phaseolus vulgaris and on the chilling-tolerant Pisum sativum L. (cv. Shuttle) plants. For both species two phases related to the leaf temperature can be distinguished: the first 4-hour period during which the leaf temperature decreased from 24 to 4 degrees C, and a second period during which the leaf temperature slightly oscillated around 4 degrees C. The behaviour of F685/F730 for the bean was quite different from that of the pea plant. During the first phase, it decreased markedly for the chilling-sensitive bean while a slight increase was observed for the chilling-resistant pea. In the following period, the F685/F730 values for the pea remained constant while those for the bean were found still to decrease. On the basis of our results, the use of the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio as indicator of plant chilling sensitivity can be envisaged.

AB  - Large-capacity facilities bring about stresses to which the animals respond in keeping with their individual behavioral characteristics. In this context many authors draw attention to inadequate social behavior of pigs, to their aggressiveness, caudophagy and canibalism. Such behavior results from stresses in some excitable individuals which were preferentially used for their commercial traits in hybridization programs.
   In the papers published until now individual characteristics of animals were investigated by habituation tests. The results of observations of age differences in habituation indicated a possibility of predicting individual behavioral characteristics at early age (Novacky, Liday, 1994). In the present paper individual CNS excitability and process of habituation of pigs are evaluated with respect to differences between the males and females which are of the same importance as age differences in practical farming conditions.
   In four 30-minute habituation tests locomotor activity and voice signs, which are characteristic activities of habituation of orientation-exploratory behavior in a new environment, were investigated in 78 pigs (39 young boars and 39 gilts) of the Landrace, Hampshire and Duroc breeds and different cross combinations. The animals were individually tested in morning and afternoon tests at the age of three (37 kg) and six (85 kg) months. The results make it possible to describe: a) individual excitation level of CNS given by the values of indicator reactions; b) dynamics of habituation process with respect to sexual differences between the young boars and gilts at the age of 3 and 6 months.
   Excitability level. Frequency of reactions in gilts prevailed (Fig. 2 - solid curves). It is to note that frequency of reactions in gilts was more expressive at the age of 6 months than at 3 months of age, and it was higher in the indicator of locomotor activity than in voice (acoustic) signs. There was a significant sexual difference in locomotor activity in the animals 6 months old. While 3-month boars and gilts had the same values, a large sexual difference was observed in 6-month animals since the activity of young boars decreased in comparison with the gilts (P < 0.001)
   Habituation speed. Locomotor activity and voice sings were adopted more quickly by young boars than by gilts in morning tests. This difference was significant in the indicator of voice signs in 6-month animals (Fig. 1). Dishabituation was observed in gilts, accompanied by an increasing trend of the frequency of reactions described by positive regression coefficients while the young boars had their characteristic process of habituation.
   It was also found out that 3-month animals were more mobile and the frequency of their voice sings was higher than in the 6-month ones. The activity is in general decreasing with the growing weight. The decrease is larger in the young boars than in the gilts and it is likely to be due to castration at early age. There are other sexual differences in the dynamics of locomotor activity and voice signs. While the average habituation curves of locomotor activity have their peaks at the beginning of tests, habituation curves of voice signs have the peaks 6 to 8 minutes after the beginning of tests and the habituation process starts at that moment. The weakening of the frequency of voice signs in gilts is due to the fact that the 6-month gilts are more excitable than the young boars of equal age in the period of maturation, therefore their habituation to an experimental chamber is slower. The frequency of voice signs was found to increase in the 6-month gilts (Fig. 2B). The increase is related to the need of acoustic communication with the males in the housing space. These are so called informative acoustic signals which are changing from low-pitch sounds to wailing acoustic signs as the excitation of animals is increasing. The trend of dishabituation of acoustic signs in the gilts is conditioned by their instinctive characteristics with regard to the innate need for the care of the young. The sows communicate with the young through acoustic communication, like e.g. in the wild boar (Sus scrofa), the ancestor of pigs. The high frequency of voice signs in gilts in comparison with boars ensues from inborn characteristics of domesticated swine.

AB  - Under the prevailing turbidite paradigm, the term 'turbidite' (i.e., deposits of turbidity currents with Newtonian rheology and turbulent state) is used very loosely and is commonly applied to deposits of debris flows with plastic rheology and laminar state. For example, because 'high-density turbidity currents' are defined on the basis of three different concepts (i.e., how density, grain size, and driving force), there are no consistent criteria for recognition of their deposits. As a result, deep-water massive sands of debris-flow origin are routinely misinterpreted as high-density turbidites. The concept of waxing flow as a type of turbidity current is problematic because waxing flows are defined on the basis of velocity, not on fluid rheology and flow state. The waxing-flow concept allows inversely graded sands to be misinterpreted as turbidites. Perhaps, the most problematic issue is the use of alluvial channel traction bed forms observed in flume experiments as the analog for the five divisions of the Bouma Sequence (i.e., classic turbidites deposited from suspension). This is because flume experiments were conducted under equilibrium flow conditions, whereas natural turbidity currents deposit sediment under disequilibrium waning flow conditions. This and other problems of deep-water processes and facies models are addressed in this paper from the author's personal perspective. Classification of sediment-gravity flows into Newtonian flows (e.g., turbidity currents) and plastic flows (e.g., debris flows), based on fluid rheology and flow state, is a meaningful and practical approach. Although popular deep-water facies models are based on transport mechanisms, there are no standard criteria in the depositional record to reliably interpret transport mechanisms. According to existing turbidite-facies models, an ideal turbidite bed, which has normal grading, with gravel- to mud-size particles should contain a total of 16 divisions. However, no one has ever documented a complete turbidite bed with 16 divisions in modern or ancient deposits. Recognition of units deposited by deep-water bottom currents (also referred to as contour currents) is difficult. Traction structures are good indicators of bottom-current reworking, but distinguishing deposits of bottom currents from deposits of overbanking turbidity currents is difficult even though it has important implications for developing depositional models for hydrocarbon exploration and production. I consider sandy debris flows to be the dominant process responsible for transporting and depositing sands in the deep sea. Experiments on sandy debris flows suggest that low clay content (as little as 1%) is sufficient to provide the strength necessary for sandy debris flows. Deposits of experimental sandy debris hows are characterized by massive sand, sharp upper contacts, floating clasts, inverse grading, normal grading with clasts, and water-escape structures. As a counterpart to turbidite-dominated fan models suited for basinal settings, a slope model is proposed that is a debris-Bow dominated setting with both non-channelized and channelized systems. Contrary to popular belief, deposits of sandy debris flows can be thick, areally extensive, clean (i.e., mud poor), and excellent reservoirs. High-frequency flows tend to develop amalgamated debris-flow deposits with lateral connectivity and sheet-like geometry. Submarine-fan models with turbidite channels and lobes have controlled our thinking for nearly 35 years, but I consider that these models are obsolete.
   The suprafan lobe concept was influential in both sedimentologic and sequeace-stratigraphic circles because it provided a basis for constructing a general fan model and for linking mounded seismic facies with sheet-like turbidite sandstones. However, this concept recently was abandoned by its proponent, which has left the popular sequence-stratigraphic fan models with a shaky foundation. A paradigm shift is in order in the 21st century. This shift should involve the realization that thick deep-water massive sands are deposits of debris flows, not 'high-density turbidites'. However, there are no standard vertical facies models that can be applied universally for either turbidites, contourites, or sandy debris flows. Science is a journey, whereas facies models terminate that journey and become the final destination. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with analysis of the dry stonewall network structural features and their relationship with the natural landscape. Thus, specific approach was applied elements of dry stonewall network are analyzed within previously determined spatial units (geocomplex types) that are defined by their internal vertical structure. Based on this set of relations, it is possible to reconstruct the spatial distribution and characteristics of the areas under impact of anthropopression which directly affected the degree of fragmentation and diversity. Landscape metrics (indicators of the composition and configuration of the landscape) was applied in analysis of dry stonewalls structure.
   Several basic research objectives were set: a) to determine the characteristics of size of dry stonewall network and to select landscape indicators that are most appropriate to define its structure, b) to determine the basic features of the dimension of landscape elements (geocomplex types) within which parts of dry stonewall network are contained c) to determine the nature and the degree of their relationship (relationship between dry stonewall network and anthropogenic impact on the landscape).
   Data obtained from GIS analysis were further processed by landscape metrics methods and statistical methods of linear correlation and factor analysis. To determine the nature and degree of correlation between eleven analysed variables, method of multiple linear correlation was used. Factor analysis was conducted in order to reduce a number of variables to a smaller number of factors that define the structure and complexity of dry stonewall network and the degree of anthropogenic impact on the landscape
   The authors presume that the achievement of these goals will enable to define the features of the current structure and the associated landscape of southern part of Vis Island. Additionally, it will enable definition of general patterns of impact of the socio-geographic processes during historical and geographical development that led to their present appearance and condition. All this should serve as guidance when deciding on the method and degree of protection of specific natural and cultural landscapes; and eventual revitalization to sustainable tourism valuation.
   On the basis of the analysis we can conclude the following:
   1. Anthropogenic impact (in spatial terms) is very unevenly expressed in the southern part of Vis Island, primarily due to its geographic predisposition (diversity of geomorphological, climatic and soil conditions, distance from populated areas, availability, etc.), as indicated by the high variability in the values of the analyzed parameters on the level of geocomplex types which is reflected in the landscape as a whole.
   2. Dry stonewall network shows great complexity of the structure, defined by variables of configuration and composition. This complexity is expressed through significant differences in the mutual relations of the analyzed variables of 92 geocomplex types, represented by a matrix of correlation coefficients.
   3. Shapes of geocomplex types are in significant correlation with almost all variables of dry stonewall network (except the average length of drywall). Relatively high correlation with the variables of diversity and dominance confirms the importance of anthropogenic impact.
   4. Factor analysis of thirteen variables of dry stonewall structure and associated landscape reduced this to two factors. The first factor is defined as the factor of the landscape structure (caused by changes in biotic / abiotic features due to anthropogenic activities), and the other as a factor of anthropopression or anthropogenically caused fragmentation and diversification of the landscape (as a consequence of the mode and intensity of construction of dry stonewall network) that represent the structural characteristics of the dry stonewall network within the individual elements of the landscape. Within the second factor, based on the factor points, individual impact of variables on transformation of the natural landscape is determined.
   Analyses have shown that used methodologies can serve to reconstruct anthropogenic impact on the landscape and the degree of intensity of land use during historical and geographical development. Extensive database containing information on structure of dry stonewall network and natural features of the landscape allows precise selection of the areas that are most suitable for reconstruction in terms of reconstruction and interior of dry stonewall network for tourism or renewal of traditional agriculture, in line with sustainable development.

AB  - Introduction
   HIV infection is a disease that demands a consistent and efficient practice of adherence behaviors related to antiretroviral treatment. However, research findings in the last few years have shown that psychological and social variables (e.g., depression, stress, low motivation, as well as little or no social support) interfere with the practice of those behaviors. This facilitates the clinical progression of the disease, and reduces the quality of life and survival time in people living with HIV.
   The intersection area between psychology and health involves widely diverse theoretical models, including self-regulation, health beliefs, and the one linking information-motivation-behavior. Such models have sought to account for the way in which the addressed variables affect adherence behavior. While analyzing psychological factors, these models usually emphasize either cognitive concepts or adopt a more traditional stance such as relating adherence behavior to personality, motivation, behavioral skills and stress management. Although this diversity seems inclusive, it fails to integrate explanations on therapeutic adherence under a more comprehensive theoretical umbrella. Thus, the present study was conducted within the scope of an interactive-functional model which attempts to articulate the interaction of sets of biological and psychological variables along four phases. The first involves psychological processes and results variables; the second comprises the diagnostic of HIV infection and later development of other opportunistic diseases; the third contains two types of behavior: therapeutic adherence and disease-related behaviors; the fourth involves conventional biological indicators and health outcomes.
   This model contrasts with others not only in the sense of proposing an inter-behavioral approach derived from Kantor's work, including articulated behavioral and personality theories, but it also proposes an interactive and functional emphasis on analyzing those variables assumed to determine therapeutic adherence behaviors. Such variables subsume personality phenomena, behavioral competencies and motives to behave. Thus, the approach includes those consistent ways in which HIV-positive persons interact with stress-related situations which contain unpredictable, ambiguous or uncertain stimulus signals and behavior consequences. The behavioral competencies category synthesizes what the patient knows on HIV, including those self-care actions that need to be taken efficiently. For instance, what is HIV-AIDS, what are the clinical stages of the infection, what medications help, how should they be used and, above all, why is so important to take medications in a consistent and efficient manner on the basis of the indications of the healthcare personnel. On the other hand, motives or motivation refer, in the traditional conception, to variables related to willing to act. It is said that a person is motivated to engage in therapeutic adherence behaviors when he/she is willing to behave accordingly, after having understood the relation between such behavior and some specific consequences. Such consequences may vary widely, ranging from interpersonal in nature, such as verbal praise or support from others, and intrinsic, such as self-perceived physical and psychological well-being.
   Materials and method
   A cross-sectional study was carried out in order to identify predictors of adherence behaviors related to antiretroviral treatment in a group of 68 persons living with HIV. Participants answered two self-administered questionnaires: i) psychological factors and adherence behaviors, and ii) stress-related situations in three modalities: decision-making, tolerance to ambiguity, and tolerance to frustration. Data analysis included univariate statistics, the Pearson's x(2) test, the T-test for independent samples, as well as a linear multiple regression analysis.
   Results
   Of the total of participants, 58 (85.3%) reported that they self-administered their antiretroviral medication everyday of the lost week, and 10 (14.7%) did it with some inconsistence. Differences were significant (x(2) [1]=33.882; p<0.001); the T-test showed a significant difference among adherents and non-adherents in the motivation variable (/ [66]=-27.954; p<0.001). Finally, the linear multiple regression analysis contributed as predictor of the adherence behaviors of variables like motivation (beta=0.802; p<0.001), as well as low stress-related situations in the modalities of decision-making (beta=-0.268; p<0.01) and tolerance to frustration (beta=-0.280; p<0.01), with the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R-2]=0.629, thus explaining 62.9% of the total variance.
   Discussion
   The results of this study show that persons with HIV who are 100% adherent to antiretroviral medication are those who are clearly more motivated and are experiencing less stress-related to decision-making, as well as higher levels of tolerance to frustration.
   These findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving the treatment of HIV-positive patients should expressly include components related to these factors. It seems especially relevant to consider two additional aspects: first, once psychological factors are identified and explained through research, they need to be translated into viable intervention strategies subject to systematic methodological evaluation. Second, interventions must be consistent with the theoretical assumptions underlying the model used so that those techniques designed or selected to establish adequate medication use and other adherence and wellbeing-inducing behaviors will actually result effective.
   Given the context of the institutional treatment of this condition, it seems especially relevant to insure that such programs actually have an interdisciplinary character in order to facilitate and maintain therapeutic adherence. Such inter-professional collaboration is especially important in a public healthcare context in which resources, ranging all the way from facilities, equipment and caregiver salaries to the schooling of the patients, pose special challenges in places like Latin American countries, where real optimization can occur mainly through the quality of integrated professional performance. After all, the key healthcare ingredient in public health problems affecting ever-growing portions of the population, such as the HIV infection, remains the human being, i.e., actual persons with biological, psychological, and social functional components.

AB  - Chloride salts are the most commonly used deicing materials for winter maintenance of roads. Numerous studies indicate a significant increase in the salinity of aquatic ecosystems associated with the long-term use of deicing materials in countries located in cold climates. The functioning of ecosystems largely depends on salinity, since salinity is one of the key factors determining the species composition, the structure of food webs and the productivity of aquatic communities. Given the growing threat of salinization of groundwater and surface waters, it is extremely important to study the effect of deicing materials on the biota and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this research is to determine the threshold concentrations of solutions of the deicing salt mixture "Bionord" containing sodium and calcium chlorides, at which negative effects on the development of animal and plant test objects are observed.
   In this study, we used the salt-containing mixture "Bionord" as a model deicer. Similarly, with the most commonly used ice melting chemicals, the "Bionord" salt mixture contains a large amount of sodium and calcium chlorides (about 85% of the total weight). To evaluate the toxicity of the deicer solutions, we used acute and chronic toxicity tests with cladoceran Moina macrocopa (Straus, 1820) (Cladocera: Moinidae) and standard onion-based test with Allium cepa L. (Liliopsida: Amaryllidaceae) (Allium-test). In acute and chronic toxicity tests with Cladocera, the females on the first day of their life (body size 0.5-0.6 mm) were placed individually in jars with aged (not less than for 72 h) tap water with a volume of 20 ml with the addition of a deicer at a certain concentration. A group of animals that was placed in the medium without the deicer was used as a control. In the acute toxicity tests, we used the following concentration of the deicer: 1.3; 2.5; 4.0, 5.0; 6.0; 8.0; 10.0 g/l. The mortality of animals was recorded 24 and 48 hours after the start of the experiment. The concentration of the deicer (LC50) at which 50% of animals was observed to die, compared to the control, was determined in the acute toxicity test. In a chronic toxicity test, animals were tested in the following range of concentrations of the deicer: 0.3; 0.6; 1.3; 2.5; 5.0; 6.0 and 8.0 g/l. The chronic toxicity test was conducted until the death of all test animals. Based on the data obtained in the chronic toxicity test, the specific growth rate of juvenile females, average fecundity, and average life span of M. macrocopa were calculated for each concentration of the deicer. Bulbs of onions of the Stuttgartenrisen variety with a diameter of 1.8 +/- 0.1 cm and a weight of 2.27 +/- 0.17 g were used in the onion test. Bulbs with their bottoms were placed in test tubes containing 20 ml of a solute of the deicer or tap water for 48 hours. Three bulbs were tested for each concentration and for the control. The following concentrations of the deicer were used in the onion test: 1.0; 2.5; 5.0; 7.0; 10.0; 15.0; 20.0; 50.0 g/l. The general toxic and cytotoxic effects were evaluated in the onion test. The average root length and the total root length on each bulb were used as indicators of the total toxicity of the solutions of deicer. To evaluate proliferative activity, we calculated the mitotic index as the fraction of dividing cells in the apical root meristem to the total number of cells. Based on the results of the experiments, we determined median effective mixture concentrations (EC50) at which there is a 50% decrease, compared to the control, in the values of root growth indicators: average root length, sum of root lengths on each bulb and mitotic index.
   Median lethal concentration (LC50) of the deicing salt determined in the 48-hour acute toxicity test with females of Al. macrocopa was equal to 5.1 g/l. In the chronic test, we showed that the exposure to the solutions of the deicing salt in the range of concentrations from 0.3 to 5.0 g/l does not affect the life span, specific growth rate of juveniles and fecundity of females of M. macrocopa. The median effective concentration (EC50) of the deicing salt determined in the Allium-tests were 6.3, 5.2 and 10.4 g/l for the sum of root lengths, average root length on each bulb and proliferative activity at the tips of roots (mitotic index), respectively (See Table 1 and 2). Complete inhibition of onion root growth was observed at the concentration of the decider equal to 20 g/l, while the death of all test animals in the acute toxicity test occurred at the concentration of the deicer equal to 8,0 g/l (See Fig. 1).
   Thus, we demonstrated that similar concentrations of the deicer induced 50% inhibition of the growth of onion roots and 50% mortality of cladocerans. These values, in general, corresponded to a critical salinity of 5-8 %o above which qualitative changes occur both in the external and internal condition of aquatic animals. The electrical conductivity of the deicer solutions, which had a negative effect on the selected test species, coincides with the previously obtained values of the electrical conductivity of sodium chloride solutions harmful to cladocerans. We can assume that the main mechanism of the effect of the deicing material that we study is associated with the biological effect of its chlorine and sodium salts Taking this into account, the value of electrical conductivity measured for solutions of deicing salt can be used to assess its negative potential effects. We estimated that in the absence of timely cleaning, regulated by the rules for using the material, the runoff from each square meter of the treated surface can lead to the pollution of 8-13 liters of fresh water. Thus, the basic requirement for the use of deicing salts on roads is the need to comply with the cleaning regime of the treated surfaces. Otherwise, the gradual accumulation of sodium and calcium chlorides in water bodies can cause an increase in salinity which will affect the survival of freshwater aquatic organisms and lead to serious disturbances in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

   For several decades, we have observed re-structuring of social welfare services at an international level that create a new network of agents and models for governance to meet basic needs (Marban and Rodriguez, 2006; Evers, 2005; Salinas et al., 2011; Jorge et al., 2013; Etxezarreta and Bakaikoa, 2011; Etxezarreta and Bakaikoa, 2012; Arnaez, 2014; Mori, 2014).
   The offer of social services or proximity services (Laville, et al., 2001, Fernandez and Vivas, 2001; Enjolras, 2008, Pastor, 2011; Etxezarreta and Lasa, 2016) as well as the creation of structures to provide protected employment spaces to people who are in a situation of social exclusion (Defourny et al., 1998; Marcuello et al., 2007; Manterola, 2013; Retolaza et al., 2014b; Gianfaldoni, 2014), are spheres where Social Economy has taken root as an essential agent. In parallel, the need to assess these interventions in terms of social and economic efficiency has arisen. Measuring the social contribution of these entities for these services has opened an extremely broad field to design appropriate methods and indicators for this objective (Diaz et al., 2012; Stievenart and Pache, 2014; Marcuello, 2015; Retolaza et al., 2015; Bassi and Vincenti, 2015).
   The objective of this work is to attempt to contribute to the design of measurement tools that best meet the particularities inherent to Social Economy. To this end, we have applied a measurement methodology (the polyhedral model) to a social cooperative in Guipuzcoa (Zabalduz S.Coop), and we have analysed the results obtained.
   Methodology
   The methodology applied in our case study is called the integrated social value quantification, based on a polyhedral model of analysis, which falls under the participatory evaluation models (Bouchard and Richez-Battesti, 2010), and was broadly documented in prior works (Retolaza et al, 2016, 2015, 2014).
   The polyhedral model is methodologically based on a cost-benefit analysis, whose main goal is to asses in terms of efficiency, the outputs created and the inputs necessary to do so (either by reducing inputs or by maximising outputs). To identify and then quantify an organization's outputs, the polyhedral model considers the value each interest group assigns to the organisation, which, depending on its particular interest, is greater or lesser.
   Using the work conducted for the organisation Lantegi Batuak as the main reference (Retolaza et al, 2014), and the process established by Retolaza et al (2015), we followed these six steps: i) making a Map of Stakeholders; ii) identifying Variables of Social Value (Ecosystem of Interests); iii) making a Matrix of Social Value; iv) identifying proxies and assigning quantitative values, using the reasonable value approximation; v) writing the Social Value report; vi) in coherence with the research-action perspective, feedback was given on the results, facilitating improvement processes for the social value measurement methodology.
   Results/Limitations/Implications
   The results obtained for the Zabalduz S.Coop case show that the cooperative has a considerable social impact, both directly through its economic activity, and indirectly, on its main client, the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa. The indirect value for suppliers is more limited, since these are large supplier companies (gas, food, electricity, etc.), where the invoices for Zabalduz S.Coop's activity are scarcely noticed by them.
   Moreover, it was decided to dismiss calculation of savings in both the public administration and in families. Disbursements made through cooperative funds were added to the specific social value section, which, since this is a social cooperative that is small in size, are not large amounts, either.
   Lastly, the SROI (social return on investment) is calculated based on total public funding received, through provision of services and grants. The grants received by Zabalduz S.Coop are small. Since this is the provision of a publicly-owned social service, the public administration tenders these services through the public procurement form, and not via grants. The ratio obtained is 1.38, which would mean that for every euro assigned to the indirect provision of the service, the administration creates a total social value of 1.38 euros
   Conclusions/originality
   The theoretical framework proposed in this work establishes a relation between governance models and ways to evaluate, which would lead to presume that the participatory evaluation models are more suitable for entities in the "new" Social Economy. These new entities, such as Zabalduz S.Coop, are characterised and set apart from traditional mutualism, since they have more open governance models, and thus, the self-management model is affected by the participation of very different kinds of stakeholders(private, public, social, etc.).
   The polyhedral model is especially suitable to measure the social value of this kind of entity, since the social impact is not measured based on pre-established indicators; rather, variables are generated ad hoc for each organization based on the stakeholders affected by its activity.
   Notwithstanding, the conclusions stemming from the results obtained in our case study pose a series of limitations that collide with the very nature of the evaluation model applied.
   On one hand, regarding the value generated as socioeconomic return, and beyond the increased tax revenue, it does not appear that the rest of tax savings identified is considered as a positive value by all stakeholders, since, as previously analysed, the savings generated could partially lead to precarious employment conditions caused by outsourcing the service.
   On the other hand, the results obtained in the specific social value collide with one of the main limitations of this methodology, since it cannot assign an economic value to social aspects that are difficult to monetise. Many aspects were identified in this study that cannot be monetised and that were finally related to emotional value. Of tremendous importance are the interests identified by employees, both individual (excitement, motivation, attachment, feeling of belonging, etc.) and collective (exemplary nature of the management model, self-management, participation, belonging to the third sector, etc.), which, if possible to quantify them, would particularly modify the final result for social value generated.
   Under no circumstances do we believe that the aforementioned limits jeopardise the validity of the polyhedral model; rather, they must be complemented by measurement methodologies that are more qualitative. The existence of countless variables that cannot be monetised (due to their intangible nature) does not mean that they cannot be measured. Thus, the alternative would be to pose evaluation methods that are more qualitative. This is the exercise put forth with Zabalduz S.Coop in more recent works, where a series of indicators was established on participation, in order to first diagnose the channels through which participation is facilitated to propose measures for improvement, and to finally analyse evolution over time.

AB  - The state of the art on innovation has allowed the position which rank the concept like a key tool in processes of organizations at knowledge's society, that characterizes the territories and regions of today, however, their appropriation still presents limitations on organizations, positioning itself as possible causes: the scarce investment in science and technology by some regions or the entrenched traditionalist thinking from some type of organizations, especially in contexts such as Latin American, where these limitations still prevail in the performance of various territorial actors including some business, higher education's institutions and government agencies.
   The theoretical framework of this paper, has focused on regional innovation systems as a point of reference for competitiveness and innovation and economic development on territories, at the same way it has been exposed relevance acquired between industry, university and government actors in collective construction of platforms for growth and economic development in territories, and for their integration and social cohesion; finally, regional strategy for promotion and execution of scientific research, development and innovation projects whose results contributes to respond to the needs and social problems which each territorial environment presents.
   The analyzed theoretical referents agree on idea that the Latin America context, despite its advances in economic growth, still require improve the results of its innovation regional systems and evidence a greater work of its social institutions, in such a way that through a constructive form of actors, which is aimed to generate and develop innovative processes; at same way, that knowledge is positioned as one of assets of organizations that facilitate to appropriation of innovative activity, being the linking element of proposed institutions in triple helix model, since its directly related to scientific research activity for its construction (higher education institutions), its practical application (industry and business companies) and the definition of policies of scientific and academic according to regional interests (government).
   On this way, the diverse theories of university-industry-government linkage has been seen as a key concept to build capabilities and initiatives to promote the design and execution of projects adjusted to regional resources and capacities, which responses the problems of each context, however, today to deeper dependence on the subject, requiring a glimpse of the dependence between actors, power relations and expected results through collective constructions that allow evidence of university-industry-government linkage and contribute to improving conditions and performance of regional systems of innovation on different territorial competitiveness reports.
   Extrapolating the concepts which has been analyzed in the case of Colombia, starting from the results in science, technology and innovation how referents about territorial performance, it becomes evident the limited investment of Gross Domestic Product in research and development stands out, characterizing the national territory for its heterogeneity of results both on the relative contribution to economic structure from the country, as the performance of its regional innovation systems; in spite of the direction in subjects which have been directed towards achievement of major recognitions on international scientific communities and under standards that advocate for the high quality of the scientific production.
   The results of the national science, technology and innovation policy in Colombia are also aimed at improving the quality of results of scientific production, as well as the formation of high level human capital and social appropriation from different knowledge, looking for the joint working from universities, technological development centers, business companies and the government, as a link oriented to achievement of programs and projects responding to problems demanded by different scenarios and parts of country's national science, technology and innovation system.
   For development of documentary review, the study assumes an descriptive-documentary research approach, which has been methodologically based on secondary sources that characterized by their scientific contribution, formalization in official platforms and circuits with international visibility; in such a way that the arguments set forth are supported by reliable and up-to-date information on academic and scientific debates that take place at the frontiers of knowledge about the promotion of innovation in university-industry-government organizations and relationships at territorial contexts.
   Documentary review has reached a total of 58 bibliographical references among scientific articles, specialized books, papers from academic conferences and official documents from certified entities, which has been developed under a constructivist and critical approach, it's given a conceptual construct of innovation and the different forms of university-industry-government linkage and its convergence like actors in the dynamics of the system of science, technology and innovation, as well as the forces which determine the innovative processes of territories and the role that the concepts have acquired on the basis for the fundamental decisions and the actions of interrelationship with interest groups to promote knowledge and innovation.
   The results and contributions to academic discussion for the promotion of innovation from the university-industry-government linkage, it has been determined in main characteristics which have been alluded to the concept on science, technology and innovation national system, materialized their results in: categorization of research groups, highly innovative companies, higher impact scientific production, among others. These elements have been positioned as indicators of competitive performance and generators of economic development in territories with the principles of innovative activity applied to organizations, according to its development in the front of sciences and the practical exercise in different disciplines which integrate schools in higher education institutions and activities of each business or government agency; fortifying the public service of education and performance of human and intellectual capital at territories and innovation regional systems.
   This series of data, also allow establish the real image of a territorial system, which has made significant progress in science, technology and innovation, but still requires greater efforts to advance the construction of a distinguished scientific nation that develop projects of high impact from the communion university-industry-government, its aimed to achieve a better private investment in research, development and innovation, reach a critical mass of researchers according to the number of higher education institutions, high-level scientific production according with quality standards of international scientific communities, its entrepreneurial nature leads actions that respond to social problems and fosters collective construction for the sustainable development of their knowledge, quality education, value added goods and services and a sustainable socio-economic environment based on knowledge, technology and innovation.

AB  - The understanding of child suicide has achieved more and more specific notions since it started to be studied from the theory of adult suicide. Now, the implication of certain factors such as the evolution of death conceptualization, the desire of joining an absent significant person, the premeditation of the suicidal act, the involvement of family environment as a contributing or protective factor, or a previous mistreatment experience, has become clearly recognized.
   Suicides which occur during the childhood period have been associated to previous sexual-nature abuse experiences. In adult suicides, the presence of some kind of mistreatment during their childhood period has also been found. Both phenomena, mistreatment and child suicide, are usually under-registered because of the variability of their defining approaches or because of some cultural influences such as violence occurring naturally or negation of child suicide or premeditation.
   It is postulated that the mechanics of child mistreatment traps the abuser into a dynamics based on the inequality of physical, intellectual and/or moral conditions; this reality plus the defenseless nature of children, impedes the termination of that situation unless it finishes by means of another violent act such, as a suicide. Furthermore, the consequences suffered by a child victim of mistreatment can become contributing factors for a suicidal behavior consummation. Consequently, dysfunctions or disturbances on cognitive, psychological, identity, belonging or hopelessness state of the victim, as well as the emotional pain caused by the mistreatment may favor a suicide behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the presence of any given type of child mistreatment in children (since eight to 14 years old) that incurred in a suicide in the State of Guanajuato between 1995 and 2001.
   The methodology used for this descriptive, observational, retrospective and transversal study, was ex-post:facto (after the event), since the technique for data gathering was carried out by psychological autopsy. This technique facilitates an access into the families and to the understanding of their dynamics, and also to recognizing the circumstances prior to the decease. This technique included one or several interviews with people close to deceased child, besides a detailed analysis of the suicidal event and of all the deceased child's residual belongings (suicide notes in this case). This study searched some direct and indirect indicators of a possible child mistreatment suffered by suicidal children. The psychological autopsy was conformed by a Questionnaire of Psychosocial data, a Suicidal Act Evaluation Questionnaire and by an Informant's Reliability Scale. Because of the lack of specific backgrounds for the cases of child suicide, the Psychological Questionnaire was specifically developed for this study.
   Studied cases were those belonging to child suicides, up to 14-year-old children, who consummated their death in the State of Guanajuato in the 1995 to 2001 period. The files were obtained by the General Attorney Department. With the information extracted from such files, we proceeded to establish phone and mail contact with relatives of the deceased children. Later on, some interviews were carried out with one or more people close to each child; these interviews were held by psychologists qualified in Psychological Autopsy and Emotional Contention Techniques.
   The examined data came basically from the Psycho-Social Questionnaire and from the Content Analysis of suicide notes. The analysis method for first data, of quantitative nature, was by frequency distribution and correlation, computed by SPSS statistical software. Qualitative data resulting from the analysis of suicide notes content were verified by a technical jury integrated by three participating clinical psychologists.
   Results: Twenty nine suicide cases were analyzed, representing 69% of child suicides up to 14-year-old children in the State of Guanajuato within the aforementioned period. The rest of the files were not included in this research because the impossibility for locating the victim's relatives due to changes of residence, and in a lower percentage because they refused to participate in the study due to the emotional pain of talking about the suicide event, or because they ignored the minor child's data regarding the circumstances and causes of his death.
   Of all the examined cases, 19 (65.5%) were men and 10 (34.5%) were women. The range of child suicides' age was from eight to 14 years old, with a 12.55 year-old average and a 1.62 year-old standard deviation. Five suicide notes were analyzed, which belonged to 4 children: 3 girls (one of them left two notes) and one boy. With respect to 72.4% of the cases, the interviewed persons were first-degree relatives and regarding the remaining percentage, they were cousins, uncles or grandparents who reported having had a close relationship with the deceased child. The average age of the interviewees was 43 years, with a standard deviation age of 17.19 years.
   In almost half of the suicides (51.7%) some kind of violence was suffered. According to the interviewees' statements, 31 % of the children who committed suicide had suffered some kind of psychological mistreatment, 41.1% of them had received some of kind of physical mistreatment, 3.4% were victims of sexual abuse and 10.34% were neglected. Almost a quarter of all the children had suffered two or three kinds of mistreatment. Additionally, 41.4% of suicidal children had seen physical violence at home. Four of the suicide notes included explicit declarations of mistreatment experiences.
   Other variables that were found were the presence of previous suicide attempts in 20.7% of the cases; and a 26.3% of cases where a relative also had a previous suicide attempt. Family alcohol consumption was detected in 65.5% and drug consumption in 24% of the cases. Further analysis show a correlation between child previous suicide attempts and psychological mistreatment (p= 0.004) or any other kind of violence exposure (p= 0.015).
   It is concluded that an important percentage of children who incurred in a suicide were indeed victims of some kind of child mistreatment, of which physical one was particularly evident. However, neither physical not sexual abuse can be separated from their implicit component: the emotional mistreatment. Studies of pure qualitative nature could contribute with more information about the dynamics that associates both phenomena. It is deemed that child mistreatment prevention would directly impact both suicide occurrence for the same group of age, and probably also within adult populations thus reducing its prevalence.

AB  - Background, Aim and Scope. Microorganisms play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of soils and sediments; hence the microbiological quality of these environments can be evaluated by measuring microorganism population densities, diversity and enzyme activity. For example, dehydrogenase activity is known to be sensitive to pollutants, such as heavy metals, and to correlate with the carbon cycle. This article presents an optimized protocol for measuring dehydrogenase in a range of different sediments and, more precisely, in urban storm-water sediments. The influence of blank preparation, ratio substrate/sediment and time of formazan extraction was studied on sediments coming from urban sewage works, or lakes and rivers.
   Methods. After a microbial and chemical characterization of the sediments studied, the initial protocol of dehydrogenase measurement consited in incubating 2 g of dry sediment with 2 mu mol of INT (the substrate) at 37 degrees C for 24 hrs. It was carried out on three different urban storm-water sediments. Once an optimum dehydrogenase activity was obtained, the new protocol was tested on six other sediment materials.
   Results. The results for all the sterilized samples were significantly different to those obtained for the corresponding, non-sterilized sample, with the exception of the St Vallier sediment, which was treated with formaldehyde or the maximum dose of gamma radiation. Sediments that are rich in organic matter must be treated with high concentrations of INT in order to reach, or approach, substrate excess, especially if it is intended to compare formazan measurements. In order to more easily achieve excess substrate, we investigated the possibility of reducing the quantity of solid matter used for the tests. For the two samples tested, and especially for the road basin sample, tests carried out using a ratio of sediment mass (in g) to INT quantity (in mu mol) of 0.05 (0.5 g of sediment/10 mu mol INT) produced values of 2,000-2,200 mu g of formazan/g of sediment/24 hrs. Activities are much lower (between 1.5 and 3 times lower) when the ratio is equal to 0.2. Sonication should increase formazan extraction as it separates aggregates, thereby improving the contact between the acetone and the sediment. Sonication has an effect on the extraction of formazan. For sample EC2, 30% more formazan was extracted with sonication than without.
   Discussion. Sterilization by formaldehyde and by autoclaving demonstrated very different levels of activity. Autoclaving is the least satisfactory sterilization method, as the modifications it causes, especially to the sediment texture, are too great (Trevors 1996). The main advantage of sterilization by irradiation is the minimal disturbance of the sediment structure (Trevors 1996, McNamara et al. 2003). The quickest and most economic sterilization method is the use of formaldehyde. Therefore, blanks sterilized using formaldehyde were used in the tests of the different methods. Organic matter absorbs INT salts, so they are no longer bioavailable for the microorganisms. Sediments that are rich in organic matter must be treated with high concentrations of INT in order to reach, or approach substrate excess, especially if it is intended to compare formazan measurements. Based on our results, the results reported in the literature and practical considerations, such as the solubility of INT and the toxicity of INT with respect to bacteria (Hatzinger et al. 2003), we decided to use a quantity of INT equivalent to 10 mu mol (i.e. 2.5 mM in a final concentration in the test) for our subsequent experiments, even though we realized this would Dot produce saturation conditions for the highly organic sediments. In order to more easily achieve excess substrate, we investigated the possibility of reducing the quantity of solid matter used for the tests. The literature shows that previous work has often been carried out using I g samples of dry soil or dry sediment (Merlin et al. 1995, Taylor et al. 2002, Benitez et al. 2004, Plaza et al. 2004). Here, we find a direct relation between the amount of sample and the reduction of the substrate. To ensure that samples remained representative, it was decided not to test samples of less than 0.5 g dry weight. Acetone was chosen as the extractant, as it has been used by many other workers (Brohon 1998, Engelen et al. 1998). Sonication has an effect on the extraction of formazan. Kruskal and Wallis tests, at p=0.05, show that the increase of INT extraction is significant for EC2 at 10 minutes, but not for EC1. EC2 is much coarser (around 75% sand and 25% silt) than EC1 (40% sand and 60% silt) (data not shown). This difference in grain size distribution may be one explanation for the different behavior of the two matrices when subjected to sonication . This pretreatment is known to destroy aggregates. Therefore, in order to measure the maximum activity, the acetone extraction time, with or without ultrasound, must be chosen to suit the matrices being studied. So, depending on the characteristics of the sediment (mostly the grain size distribution), it may be useful to use ultrasound in order to achieve a good level of formazan extraction. The method to be used must be determined for each sediment.
   Conclusions. When tested on different types of sediment (river, urban sewage, etc.) the optimized protocol (0.5 g sediment and 10 mu mol of INT) gave higher activity measurements than the initial protocol and appears to provide a useful test method for comparative studies or for monitoring sediment quality. The organic matter content appeared to be one the most important parameter controlling the measurement and playing an important part on the different contact and extraction steps of the experiment. The best method for preparing blanks is sterilization using gamma radiation, as this has the lowest impact on sediment structure. However, if cost and time considerations render this method impracticable, samples can be sterilized using formaldehyde.
   Perspectives. The final protocol can be used to monitor the spatial (in terms of the different vertical and horizontal zones at the surface) and temporal (monitoring changes in activity over time using surface samples taken after different rain events) evolution of this activity within sediment samples from rainwater infiltration basins.

TI  - Experiences of physical violence experted by their partner of women in prison.

LA  - Spanish

KW  - prison
AB  - Violence against women is an everyday problem which is expressed in various ways, whether physically, sexually or emotionally, and it may occur at either public or private level. The subject of violence against women has been regarded as a worldwide priority, since it obstructs every area of women's development. Society has acknowledged the fact that this violence "prevents the achievement of the objectives of equality, development and peace and that it violates, reduces or prevents (women's) enjoyment of human rights and fundamental liberties.
   A recent report by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the Center for Health and Gender Equity shows that at least one out of every three women has been physically mistreated, forced to engage in sexual relations or suffered some type of abuse in the course of their lives.
   In Mexico as in other countries, violent behavior has been regarded as "natural" in relation to the way how to treat women; norms and everyday life have kept it hidden. Epidemiological surveys, however, show figures that reflect the scope of the problem which in turn has meant that it is now considered as a serious health problem. Consequently, approaching the issue of intra-familial violence compels one to consider a characteristic cultural aspect: the questionable fact of referring to its existence solely within the private sphere. It is felt that what goes on inside a home is an intimate affair and that outsiders should not be aware of this, far less intervene. The same happens when one discusses the violence experienced by women Living in prison, since they often continue to experience violence or abuse when they receive their conjugal visits; or else at the hands of other prisoners or from the institute itself and no-one seems willing to intervene.
   Women living in a penitentiary environment designed essentially for men, occupy a secondary position and are marginalized as regards planned work, cultural, sports, and recreational programs, partly due to the fact that the prison population is thought to be primarily male (1990 to 1994 reports).
   As Barquin notes, most women in prison experienced violence from their parents or witnessed their mothers being mistreated, and therefore became used to this type of behavior and more tolerant of it. This does not mean that these experiences should be regarded as the reason why women commit a crime or the main cause why they were admitted to the penal system. The cycle of violence that begins in the family is perpetuated in marriage and would appear to be completed in prisons, recommencing when women are released from prison. Being deprived of freedom as a result of imprisonment, together with the abuse that take place in jail appear to be a further link in the chain of multiple types of violence which constitute the path for some part of this population.
   Human Rights Watch is an organization that has undertaken specialized research in prisons since 1987 and in its 1988 report points out that Venezuelan prisons housed a total population of 25381 individuals, 4% of which were women.
   This same source reported that drug-related crimes led to a 55% increase in the jail population. In 1991, the percentage of female prisoners held in US state prisons for violent crimes was 32.2%, although that the majority had been imprisoned for nonviolent crimes. Donzinger points out that the majority of women prisoners that had been sentenced for the murder of someone close to them had been victims of mistreatment or sexual abuse at some time in their lives, and thus violence against women should become an important issue for the authorities, as it is one of the most outstanding problems that reflects the current situation of the living conditions in prison centers.
   Given the importance that has violence against women in general, and the lack of statistical indicators on the issue of women in prison, the main objective of this paper was to describe the types of physical violence exercised by the partners of 213 women, interviewed at a Preventive Center and at Social Re-adaptation Center, in order to determine the scope of the problem and to propose intervention strategies. A non-probabilistic sample of 213 women, selected for reasons of convenience, was used.
   A specially designed instrument was used, consisting of a semi-structured interview with 242 questions, covering the following areas of the lives of the women inter-viewed: demographic data, school history, current family, family of origin, legal status, previous history of imprisonment, work experience, social networks depression, suicide risk, anguish, alcohol consumption variables, alcohol consumption measurement, variables for measuring the use of medical and non-medical drugs, scale of motives for consumption, treatment barriers, intimate relationships and sexuality, sexual abuse, violence/victimization, criminal violence, post-traumatic stress, prison environment, general health, and life styles and impulsiveness.
   The most important demographic characteristics of women found were: most were in the group aged from 28 to 40 year (45.5%), had six years or less of schooling (41.3%), secondary school (36.2%) and high school or technical college (16.4%) and were single (48.6%) or living with their partners (21.6%) while 50.7% had children under the age of 18.
   Of the 213 women interviewed, only 161 reported having suffered violence at the hands of their partners; 29.2% had experienced 1 to 5 acts, 23.4% had experienced 6 to 10, and 23.4% had been the object of 11 to 17 acts of violence.
   Statistics presented in this article in various research studies on family violence in most countries only show a small part of all the violence produced in families, and the results found in this research show that violence is higher among the group of female prisoners.
   One should not forget that prison reflects an exercise of the system that performs a marginalizing function, as it includes the poorest women from the most disadvantaged sectors, with low educational level. As Lima suggests, women are doubly stigmatized in prison, as they suffer first as women and second as criminals, not only because they belong to an underprivileged group in every social aspect, but because they belong to die group that has violated the classic image of women imposed by society, a fact for which they are severely punished, while the violence and abuse they have suffered is ignored.

AB  - Simple Summary Firefighters must endure extreme environments. Such exposure increases their body temperature, which can induce fatigue, reduce motivation, and impair their decision-making. This study set out to investigate the relationship between these factors. Nine firefighters were required to complete simulated firefighting tasks in a controlled structural fire for 15 min. Logical reasoning, speed and accuracy, memory recall, general motivation and fatigue, and physical and mental effort were recorded prior to, immediately after, and 20 min after the simulation. Results of this study identified that alongside a significant increase in firefighter tympanic membrane temperature post-task; (1) body weight loss was poorly correlated with post-task motivation and fatigue scores; (2) pre-task logical reasoning scores were predictive of change in tympanic membrane temperature. Firefighters work in strenuous conditions for prolonged periods wearing up to 20 kg of personal protective equipment. This often contributes to significant heat and cardiovascular strain. This study examined the relationships between psychological and physical measures taken prior to undertaking a 15 min firefighting task, and the occurrence of heat stress and high levels of fatigue following the task. Nine qualified firefighters completed a 15 min "live burn" scenario designed to mimic a fire started by a two-seater couch in a lounge room and completed simulated tasks throughout the duration. Logical reasoning, speed and accuracy, general motivation and fatigue, and physical and mental effort were recorded pre-scenario, and at 0- and 20-min post-scenario. General motivation and fatigue scores at 0- and 20-min post-scenario were highly correlated with each other (r(s) = 0.90; p = 0.001). The general motivation and fatigue scores, at 0- and 20-min post-scenario, were also strongly related to pre-task logic/reasoning test scores (Post 0 r(s) = -0.77, p = 0.016; Post 20 r(s) = -0.87, p = 0.002). Firefighters with lower logical reasoning and speed and accuracy scores were more susceptible to fatigue and impaired cognition when exposed to rises in core temperature and heat stress.

AB  - Changing climate and disturbance regimes are increasingly challenging the resilience of forest ecosystems around the globe. A powerful indicator for the loss of resilience is regeneration failure, that is, the inability of the prevailing tree species to regenerate after disturbance. Regeneration failure can result from the interplay among disturbance changes (e.g., larger and more frequent fires), altered climate conditions (e.g., increased drought), and functional traits (e.g., method of seed dispersal). This complexity makes projections of regeneration failure challenging. Here we applied a novel simulation approach assimilating data-driven fire projections with vegetation responses from process modeling by means of deep neural networks. We (i) quantified the future probability of regeneration failure; (ii) identified spatial hotspots of regeneration failure; and (iii) assessed how current forest types differ in their ability to regenerate under future climate and fire. We focused on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2.9 x 10(6) ha of forest) in the Rocky Mountains of the USA, which has experienced large wildfires in the past and is expected to undergo drastic changes in climate and fire in the future. We simulated four climate scenarios until 2100 at a fine spatial grain (100 m). Both wildfire activity and unstocked forest area increased substantially throughout the 21st century in all simulated scenarios. By 2100, between 28% and 59% of the forested area failed to regenerate, indicating considerable loss of resilience. Areas disproportionally at risk occurred where fires are not constrained by topography and in valleys aligned with predominant winds. High-elevation forest types not adapted to fire (i.e., Picea engelmannii-Abies lasiocarpa as well as non-serotinous Pinus contorta var. latifolia forests) were especially vulnerable to regeneration failure. We conclude that changing climate and fire could exceed the resilience of forests in a substantial portion of Greater Yellowstone, with profound implications for carbon, biodiversity, and recreation.

AB  - School resilience is characterized as risk management techniques to build a safe environment for students. Recognizing the need of building disaster resilience for the education sector, this study is aimed at assessing flood disaster resilience of elementary schools in four extremely vulnerable districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. This paper established the assessment tool by incorporating climate resilience indices and 16 tasks of the Hyogo Framework for action designed for the education sector. It discusses four dimensions: physical conditions of elementary schools, human resources, institutional issues, and external relationships, each with three parameters and five variables. The data were obtained for 60 variables from 20 randomly selected elementary schools. Indicators of resilience were identified, and an index-based approach was used to get the composite values of the four dimensions of resilience. Correlations between the dimensions, components, and indicators were also checked in the current study. Results show that schools in Nowshera, followed by Charsadda, Peshawar, and Dera Ismail Khan, are the most resilient to flood disasters. For all 12 parameters under 4 dimensions, the relative resilience of study districts is the same. The findings further indicated that there is a strong correlation between the pairs of human resources and institutional issues as well as institutional issues and external relationships that can also enhance human resources and external relationships. Furthermore, institutional issues are also correlated with external relationships and human resources, which indicate that there is a triangular relationship among human resources, institutional issues, and external relationships. The findings would encourage policymakers and practitioners to develop an effective plan to improve the resilience of schools using the overall resilience situation. In short, education sector disaster resilience can be achieved by integrated planning and implementation approach. In this respect, disaster managers, public and private education sectors, school staff, students, and parents need to establish synergies to devise a comprehensive plan of action to enhance disaster education.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) is harmful to the environment and human health. Microorganisms-mineral interactions are responsible for AMD generation but can also remediate AMD contamination. Understanding the microbial response to AMD irrigation will reveal microbial survival strategies and provide approaches for AMD remediation. A terrace with sharp geochemical gradients caused by AMD flooding were selected to study the microbial response to changes in environmental parameters related to AMD contamination. AMD intrusion reduced soil microbial community diversity and further changed phylogenetic clustering patterns along the terrace gradient. We observed several genera seldom reported in AMD-related environments (i.e., Corynebacterium, Ochrobactrum, Natronomonas), suggesting flexible survival strategies such as nitrogen fixation, despite the poor nutritional environment. A co-occurrence network of heavily-contaminated fields was densely connected. The phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Euryarchaeota were all highly interconnected members, which may affect the formation of AMD. Detailed microbial response to different soil characterizations were highlighted by random forest model. Results revealed the top three parameters influencing the microbial diversity and interactions were pH, Fe(III), and sulfate. Various acidophilic Fe- and S-metabolizing bacteria were enriched in the lower fields, which were heavily contaminated by AMD, and more neutrophiles prevailed in the less-contaminated upper fields. Many indicator species in the lower fields were identified, including Desulfosporosinus, Thermogymnomonas, Corynebacterium, Shewanella, Acidiphilium, Ochrobactrum, Leptospirillum, and Allobaculum, representing acid-tolerant bacteria community in relevant environment. The detection of one known sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e., Desulfosporosinus) suggested that biotic sulfate reduction may occur in acidic samples, which offers multiple advantages to AMD contamination treatment. Collectively, results suggested that the geochemical gradients substantially altered the soil microbiota and enriched the relevant microorganisms adapted to the different conditions.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) has accumulated in forested landscapes in the Northeastern U.S., and hotspots with enhanced deposition have been identified throughout the region. Due to a variety of favorable landscape characteristics, including relatively high dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fluctuating water levels, and low pH and dissolved oxygen, vernal pools provide ideal conditions for the conversion of Hg to its more toxic and bioavailable form, methylmercury (MeHg). Yet little is known about the concentrations, speciation, and bioavailability of Hg in vernal pools, or its bioaccumulation in vernal pool fauna and potential export into terrestrial systems. We investigated the role of forest cover type on the bioaccumulation of MeHg in wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) eggs, larvae, and adults, and investigated relationships among MeHg and water chemistry (pH, DOC). Water samples from pools located in coniferous stands had greater concentrations of THg and MeHg compared to deciduous pool water, and showed significant positive correlation to DOC (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and correlated negatively with pH (r = -0.613, P < 0.001). Methylmercury levels in amphibian embryos were similar between the two species (L. sylvatica mean = 5.4 ng/g dw; A. maculatum mean = 3.5 ng/g dw). Concentrations of MeHg increased substantially in larvae, and were significantly greater in A. maculatum (mean = 237.6 ng/g +/- 18.5 SE) than L. sylvatica larvae (62.5 ng/g +/- 5.7 SE). Forest cover type did not explain variation in MeHg concentration among amphibian embryos or larvae. Methylmercury levels in adult tissue samples were significantly greater in A. maculatum (mean = 79.9 ng/g +/- 8.9 SE) compared to L. sylvatica (mean = 47.7 ng/g +/- 9.7 SE). This research demonstrates that vernal pools are important hotspots where amphibians bioaccumulate MeHg, which may then be transferred to terrestrial ecosystems. The abundance of amphibian larvae suggests they could be important bioindicators for monitoring MeHg loading and bioavailability.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of a homogeneous state-run network of museums. Nonparametric models are used to measure relative efficiency in these institutions, and we employ a complex production function embracing a number of inputs and outputs adapted to the various functions which museums fulfil: preservation, research, communication, and exhibition. Our approach considers that managers drive certain outputs, but that others escape their control since they are co-produced by visitors and determined by demand conditions and external factors. Based on this, a network two-stage data envelopment analysis approach is applied to evaluate museums' overall performance and to distinguish between efficiency in two stages: internal management and external outcomes. The low levels of performance and gaps in the scores from the first to the second stage suggest there are external factors that might determine museum performance. We therefore apply truncated regression models to analyse how and how much certain environmental variables might shape levels of museum efficiency. In this case, we consider indicators such as accessibility, tourism capacity, cultural appeal, museum age and the institutional management model. The application is performed on a sample taken from a Spanish state-run network of museums. Results show that, in general, good levels of efficiency in terms of management do not guarantee success when attracting visitors, and there seems to be a trade-off between the two goals. Variables such as tourism capacity and heritage endowments in the surrounding area, as well as the museum's management model, may determine museums' efficiency levels. The research findings may prove useful for running these cultural institutions and for those responsible for public resource allocation in cultural policies as well as for scholars, who may find a fresh approach for modelling museum efficiency and for discussing drivers of museum management success.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on the values of 22 quality indicators of surface waters flowing out of two small catchments differing in physiographic parameters and land use, in particular forest cover and urbanization of the area. The research was carried out in the years 2012-2014 at four measurement-control points located on the Checho river and the Moszowka stream (Poland), which are the main tributaries of the retention reservoir. Basic descriptive statistics, statistical tests, as well as cluster analysis and factor analysis were used to interpret the research results. The water that outflowed from the forestry-settlement catchment of the Moszowka stream contained higher concentrations of total phosphorus, phosphates, nitrite, and nitrate nitrogen and salinity indicators than outflow from the Checho river. Water from the Moszowka stream was characterized by more favourable oxygen conditions. Higher oxygen concentration in the catchment influenced a large slope of the watercourse and thus higher water velocity, which is promoted by the mixed process. In the case of the forest catchment of the Checho river, the water quality was generally better than in the Moszowka stream, mainly in cases of total suspended solids TSS, total phosphorus TP, phosphates PO43-, total nitrogen TN, nitrite N-NO2-, nitrate N-NO3-, and salinity parameters. Despite it being a short section of the river taken into the study, favourable self-purification processes like mixed, nitrification, and denitrification were observed in its water. The research shows that forest areas have a positive effect on the balance of most substances dissolved in water, and natural factors in many cases shape the quality and utility values of surface waters on an equal footing with anthropogenic factors. In the case of a large number of examined parameters and complex processes occurring in water, the interpretation of the results makes it much easier by applying multivariate statistical methods.

AB  - The study was aimed to analyse reactions of the major groups of phytoplankton to the mixing regime of fresh and brackish waters in coastal lakes and the associated changes in physicochemical properties of lake waters. For this purpose, on the basis of data collected from 6 coastal lakes located along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, differing in intensity of intrusion of brackish sea water: limnetic, L (2), limnetic/oligohaline, L/O (2), and oligohaline, O (2), we assessed the associations of major phytoplankton groups with environmental conditions. Statistical analyses revealed that the structure of phytoplankton groups significantly differed among three lakes types, and the variation in these variables was best explained by water temperature, total phosphorus, salinity, PO43-, transparency, dissolved oxygen, and NO3-. Relative phytoplankton biomass showed significant differences among the O-L/O-L lake types and formed the following proportion 1:2:3.5. Cyanobacteria constituted a dominant algae group in the lakes, showing the decreasing trend from 86.5% in the L to 69.3% in the O lakes. The indicator value analysis showed that all the studied lakes were dominated by algae preferring freshwater habitats, among which Cyanobacteria and Cryptophyta were indicator groups. Redundancy analysis showed that increasing salinity has got a negative effect on Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyta biomass, and did not stimulate the development of any algal group.
   In the coastal lakes we observed 2 distinct stable states (limnetic and oligohaline) as well as transitional phases between them: (1) seaward drift (limnetic-oligohaline) with increasing salinity, and (2) landward drift (oligohaline-limnetic) with decreasing salinity. Algal communities showed the most distinct differences in biomass in limnetic and oligohaline states. These observations suggest that the structure and biomass of phytoplankton may respond gradually on the level of hydrological connectivity, or may respond abruptly creating two alternative stable states: limnetic and oligohaline.

AB  - Snow water equivalent (SWE) is an important indicator used in hydrology, water resources, and climate change impact. There are various methods of estimating SWE (falling in 3 categories: indirect sensors, empirical models, and process-based models), but few studies that provide comparison across these different categories to help users make decisions on monitoring site design or method selection. Five SWE estimation methods were compared against manual snow course data collected over 2years (2015-2016) from the Dorset Environmental Science Centre, including the gamma-radiation-based CS725 sensor, 3 empirical estimation models (Sexstone snow density model, McCreight & Small snow density model, and a meteorology-based model), and the University of British Columbia Watershed Model snow energy-balance model. Snow depth, density, and SWE were measured at the Dorset Environmental Science Centre weather station in south-central Ontario, on a daily basis over 6 winters from 2011 to 2016. The 2 snow density-based models, requiring daily snow depth as input, gave the best performance (R-2 of .92 and .92 for McCreight & Small and Sexstone models, respectively). The CS725 sensor that receives radiation coming from soil penetrating the snowpack provided the same performance (R-2=.92), proving that the sensor is an applicable method, although it is expensive. The meteorology-based empirical model, requiring daily climate data including temperature, precipitation and solar radiation, gave the poorest performance (R-2=.77). The energy-balance-based University of British Columbia Watershed Model snow module, only requiring climate data, worked better than the empirical meteorology-based model (R-2=.9) but performed worse than the density models or CS725 sensor. Given differences in application objectives, site conditions, and budget, this comparison across SWE estimation methods may help users choose a suitable method. For ongoing and new monitoring sites, installation of a CS725 sensor coupled with intermittent manual snow course measurements (e.g., weekly) is recommended for further SWE method estimation testing and development of a snow density model.

AB  - Opportunistic pathogens (OPs) in drinking water, like Legionella spp., mycobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and free-living amobae (FLA) are a risk to human health, due to their post-treatment growth in water systems. To assess and manage these risks, it is necessary to understand their variations and environmental conditions for the water routinely used. We sampled premise tap (N-cold = 26, N-hot = 26) and shower (N-shower = 26) waters in a bathroom and compared water temperatures to levels of OPs via qPCR and identified Legionella spp. by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. The overall occurrence and cell equivalent quantities (CE L-1) of Mycobacterium spp. were highest (100 %, 1.4 x 10(5)), followed by Vermamoeba vermiformis (91 %, 493), Legionella spp. (59 %, 146), P. aeruginosa (14 %, 10), and Acanthamoeba spp. (5 %, 6). There were significant variations of OP's occurrence and quantities, and water temperatures were associated with their variations, especially for Mycobacterium spp., Legionella spp., and V. vermiformis. The peaks observed for Legionella, mainly consisted of Legionella pneumophila sg1 or Legionella anisa, occurred in the temperature ranged from 19 to 49 degrees C, while Mycobacterium spp. and V. vermiformis not only co-occurred with Legionella spp. but also trended to increase with increasing temperatures. There were higher densities of Mycobacterium in first than second draw water samples, indicating their release from faucet/showerhead biofilm. Legionella spp. were mostly at detectable levels and mainly consisted of L. pneumophila, L. anisa, Legionella donaldsonii, Legionella tunisiensis, and an unknown drinking water isolate based on sequence analysis. Results from this study suggested potential health risks caused by opportunistic pathogens when exposed to warm shower water with low chlorine residue and the use of Mycobacterium spp. as an indicator of premise pipe biofilm and the control management of those potential pathogens.

AB  - Environment-friendly adsorption (AD) cycles have gained much attention in cooling industry and its applicability has been extended to desalination recently. AD cycles are operational by low-temperature heat sources such as exhaust gas from processes or renewable energy with temperatures ranging from 55 degrees C to 85 degrees C. The cycle is capable of producing two useful effects, namely cooling power and high-grade potable water, simultaneously. This article discusses a low temperature, waste heat-powered adsorption (AD) cycle that produces cooling power at two temperature-levels for both dehumidification and sensible cooling while providing high-grade potable water. The cycle exploits faster kinetics for desorption process with one adsorber bed under regeneration mode while full utilization of the uptake capacity by adsorbent material is achieved employing two-stage adsorption via low-pressure and high-pressure evaporators. Type A(++) silica gel with surface area of 863.6 m(2)/g and pore volume of 0.446 cm(3)/g is employed as adsorbent material. A comprehensive numerical model for such AD cycle is developed and the performance results are presented using assorted hot water and cooling water inlet temperatures for various cycle time arrangements. The cycle is analyzed in terms of key performance indicators i.e., the specific cooling power (SCP), the coefficient of performance (COP) for both evaporators and the overall system, the specific daily water production (SDWP) and the performance ratio (PR). Further insights into the cycle performance are scrutinized using a Duhring diagram to depict the thermodynamic states of the processes as well as the vapor uptake behavior of adsorbent. In the proposed cycle, the adsorbent materials undergo near saturation conditions due to the pressurization effect from the high pressure evaporator while faster kinetics for desorption process is exploited, subsequently providing higher system COP, notably up to 0:82 at longer cycle time while the COPs for low-pressure and high-pressure evaporators are recorded to be 0.33 and 0.51, respectively.

AB  - The distribution of bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) is influenced by growth temperature and pH. This results in the widespread application of the brGDGT-based MBT(')/CBT proxy (MBT - methylation of branched tetraethers, CBT - cyclization of branched tetraethers) in terrestrial paleo-environmental reconstructions. Recently, it was shown that the amount of precipitation could also have an impact on CBT, as well as the abundance of brGDGTs relative to that of archaeal isoprenoidal (iso)GDGTs (R-i/b) and the absolute abundance of brGDGTs, potentially complicating the use of MBT/CBT as paleothermometer. However, the full influence of hydrology, and in particular soil water content (SWC), on GDGT distributions remains unclear. Here we investigated variations in the GDGT distribution across a SWC gradient (0-61%) around Qinghai Lake in the Tibetan Plateau, an arid to semiarid region in China. Our results demonstrate that SWC affects the brGDGT distribution. In particular, we show that SWC has a clear impact on the degree of methylation of C6-methylated brGDGTs, whereas C5-methylated brGDGTs are more impacted by temperature. This results in a combined SWC and temperature control on MBT'. In this context we propose a diagnostic parameter, the IR6ME (relative abundance of C6-methylated GDGTs) index, to evaluate the applicability of brGDGT-based paleotemperature reconstructions. Using the global dataset, expanded with our own data, MBT' has a significant correlation with mean annual air temperature when IR6ME < 0.5, allowing for the use of MBT'/CBT as temperature proxy. However, MBT' has a significant correlation with mean annual precipitation (i.e., a substantial reflection of SWC impact) when IR6ME > 0.5, implying that MBT' may respond to hydrological change in these regions and can be used as a proxy for MAP.

AB  - Fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controllers are designed for load-frequency control (LFC) of two interconnected power systems. Conflicting time-domain design objectives are considered in a multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based design framework to design the gains and the fractional differ-integral orders of the FOPID controllers in the two areas. Here, we explore the effect of augmenting two different chaotic maps along with the uniform random number generator (RNG) in the popular MOO algorithm the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Different measures of quality for MOO, e.g. hypervolume indicator, moment of inertia-based diversity metric, total Pareto spread, spacing metric, are adopted to select the best set of controller parameters from multiple runs of all the NSGA-II variants (i.e. nominal and chaotic versions). The chaotic versions of the NSGA-II algorithm are compared with the standard NSGA-II in terms of solution quality and computational time. In addition, the Pareto optimal fronts showing the trade-off between the two conflicting time domain design objectives are compared to show the advantage of using the FOPID controller over that with simple PID controller. The nature of fast/slow and high/low noise amplification effects of the FOPID structure or the four quadrant operation in the two inter-connected areas of the power system is also explored. A fuzzy logic-based method has been adopted next to select the best compromise solution from the best Pareto fronts corresponding to each MOO comparison criteria. The time-domain system responses are shown for the fuzzy best compromise solutions under nominal operating conditions. Comparative analysis on the merits and de-merits of each controller structure is reported then. A robustness analysis is also done for the PID and the FOPID controllers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal motor neuron disease that progressively debilitates neuronal cells that control voluntary muscle activity. Biomarkers are urgently needed to facilitate ALS diagnosis and prognosis, and as indicators of therapeutic response in clinical trials. microRNAs (miRNAs), small posttranscriptional modifiers of gene expression, are frequently altered in disease conditions. Besides their important regulatory role in variety of biological processes, miRNAs can also be released into the circulation by pathologically affected tissues and display remarkable stability in body fluids. In a mouse model of ALS that expresses mutated human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1-G93A) skeletal muscle is one of the tissues affected early by mutant SOD1 toxicity. To find biomarkers for ALS, we studied miRNA alterations from skeletal muscle and plasma of SOD1-G93A mice, and subsequently tested the levels of the affected miRNAs in the serum from human ALS patients. Fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles from symptomatic SOD1-G93A mice (age 90 days) and their control littermates were first studied using miRNA microarrays and then evaluated with quantitative PCR from five age groups from neonatal to the terminal disease stage (10-120 days). Among those miRNA changed in various age/gender/muscle groups (miR-206, -1, -133a, -133b, -145, -21, -24), miR-206 was the only one consistently altered during the course of the disease pathology. In both sexes, mature miR-206 was increased in fast-twitch muscles preferably affected in the SOD1-G93A model, with highest expression towards the most severely affected animals. Importantly, miR-206 was also increased in the circulation of symptomatic animals and in a group of 12 definite ALS patients tested. We conclude that miR-206 is elevated in the circulation of symptomatic SOD1-G93A mice and possibly in human ALS patients. Although larger scale studies on ALS patients are warranted, miR-206 is a promising candidate biomarker for this motor neuron disease.

AB  - The national governance structure for REDD + refers to the institutions, processes, decision-making mechanisms that enable the country to channel resources from the international level to measures on the ground that address the drivers of deforestation. The emerging national governance structure for REDD + in DRC has a hybrid nature, combining the establishment of a national REDD + fund and independent REDD + projects at the local level. The authors argue that, in the DRC context, the legitimacy and effectiveness of this emerging governance structure is higher than that of other options. This hybrid structure would experience a fairly high level of legitimacy from government entities, civil society organizations and private sector given its participatory design and broad accessibility to funding for different stakeholders. This structure would be more effective in that it allows the country to target both underlying causes of deforestation through international payments conditioned to policy reforms through the National REDD + Fund; and direct drivers of deforestation through REDD + projects. The efficiency of the system is difficult to assess at present, as it is not yet known what type of activities would be supported by the National REDD + Fund or what REDD + projects would be implemented. However, this governance structure is likely to attract more financing to REDD, both from donors and private sector. The authors suggest that institutional and policy indicators should be used to measure and reward REDD + "performance" at a national level in lieu of emissions reductions in the REDD + investment phase, paving the way for DRC to capture payments for verified emissions reduction in the long term. Informing policy reforms through project interventions is a key element of this governance structure, and particularly important in a country where deforestation rates may increase dramatically in the future given new emerging pressures. The authors recognize, however, that structural policy changes will face vigorous opposition from vested interests, and implementation challenges typical of a fragile state. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting plant functional composition of managed grasslands in response to stress (nutrients and temperature) and disturbance (grazing and cutting) is still a challenge. We aim to examine two issues. (i) Is the leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of Poaceae species (g) weighted by their abundance (LDMCgw) an appropriate indicator of grassland response to stress and disturbance? Comparison was done for stress and disturbance was assessed through proxy variables describing abiotic conditions (altitude) and management (fertilization practices and three defoliation regimes) or through measured indicators (temperature, N availability and canopy height at the time of defoliation). (ii) Does the degree of disturbance that maximises functional diversity increase as productivity increases? Using the distribution of the specific LDMCg values in the analyzed plant communities as a measure of functional diversity (FD), we explore its response to the gradients of stress and disturbance. For 136 vegetation datasets (meadows and pastures) recorded, the N-Ellenberg indicator value (N-Ell) was calculated to assess nutrient availability, and canopy height was measured. We show that LDMCgw was significantly negatively correlated with temperature, N fertilizer rate or N-Ell and canopy height (greater for meadows than for pastures). There was a parabolic relationship between FD and LDMCgw only if the temperature, the N-Ell and the defoliation regimes are considered together. This suggests the following framework for explaining the response of FD to stress and disturbance by a single plant trait: low stress (high temperature and nutrients) and high plant competition for light resulting from cutting favour plants with an exploitative strategy; high stress (low temperature and nutrients) and low plant competition for light resulting from grazing favour plants with a conservative strategy; intermediate stress favours the coexistence of both plant strategies for cutting as well for grazing. This framework can be used to define combinations of management practices and environmental factors, allowing a variety of management objectives to be achieved.

AB  - 1. Studies from Central Europe have shown a relationship between the impaired population status of threatened freshwater mussel species and elevated nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3-) concentrations in running waters.
   2. Causal mechanisms, however, remain unknown, and no experimental data or comprehensive studies involving more species are available, which causes uncertainty in prioritizing conservation actions.
   3. This study uses both descriptive and experimental approaches to identify the effects of nitrates on freshwater mussels and demonstrates the need for integrating different research methods for development of conservation strategies for threatened species.
   4. Spatial co-occurrence of five native freshwater mussel species (Anodonta anatina, Pseudanodonta complanata, Unio pictorum, Unio tumidus, Unio crassus) and N-NO3- concentrations were examined in a 7th-order river catchment (Luznice River, Czech Republic) with anthropogenically-induced increasing N-NO3- levels and declining populations of these species during the 20th century.
   5. Acute toxicity of N-NO3- was then estimated for artificially reared juveniles of A. anatina and U. crassus using both lethal and sublethal test endpoints.
   6. Results showed that the probability of occurrence of all species was significantly reduced in reaches with elevated N-NO3- levels.
   7. In contrast, the results of toxicity testing revealed that the juvenile stages of the two tested species were less sensitive to N-NO3- than most previously tested freshwater macroinvertebrates. The detected 96-h median lethal N-NO3- concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher than the limits derived from distributional data.
   8. Despite the probable absence of a direct negative effect of N-NO3- on freshwater mussel populations, N-NO3- has potential to be used as an effective indicator of biotope conditions. Identification of causal mechanisms responsible for the observed relationship between unionids and N-NO3- will require further research. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Plant phenology is strongly controlled by climate and has consequently become one of the most reliable bioindicators of ongoing climate change. We used a dataset of more than 200 000 records for six phenological events of 29 perennial plant species monitored from 1943 to 2003 for a comprehensive assessment of plant phenological responses to climate change in the Mediterranean region. Temperature, precipitation and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were studied together during a complete annual cycle before phenological events to determine their relative importance and potential seasonal carry-over effects. Warm and dry springs under a positive phase of NAO advance flowering, leaf unfolding and fruiting dates and lengthen the growing season. Spatial variability of dates (range among sites) was also reduced during warm and dry years, especially for spring events. Climate during previous weeks to phenophases occurrence had the greatest impact on plants, although all events were also affected by climate conditions several months before. Immediate along with delayed climate effects suggest dual triggers in plant phenology. Climatic models accounted for more than 80% of variability in flowering and leaf unfolding dates, and in length of the growing season, but for lower proportions in fruiting and leaf falling. Most part of year-to-year changes in dates was accounted for temperature, while precipitation and NAO accounted for < 10% of dates' variability. In the case of flowering, insect-pollinated species were better modelled by climate than wind-pollinated species. Differences in temporal responses of plant phenology to recent climate change are due to differences in the sensitivity to climate among events and species. Spring events are changing more than autumn events as they are more sensitive to climate and are also undergoing the greatest alterations of climate relative to other seasons. In conclusion, climate change has shifted plant phenology in the Mediterranean region.

AB  - The rainfall regime of the South of Portugal is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence. Long-term series of reliable precipitation records are essential for land and water resources management, climate-change monitoring, modelling of erosion and run-off, among other applications for ecosystem and hydrological impact modelling. This study provides a qualitative classification of 106 daily rainfall series from stations located in the South of Portugal and evaluates temporal patterns in extreme precipitation by calculating a number of indicators at stations with homogeneous data within the 1955/1999 period. The methodology includes both absolute and relative approaches and a new homogeneity testing procedure, besides the application of other statistical tests. The proposed technique is an extension of the Ellipse test that takes into account the contemporaneous relationship between several candidate series from the same climatic area (SUR+Ellipse test). The results indicate that this technique is a valuable tool for the detection of non-climatic irregularities in climate time series if the station network is dense enough. The existence of trends and other temporal patterns in extreme precipitation indices was investigated and uncertainty about rainfall patterns evolution was assessed. Three indices describing wet events and another three indicators characterizing dry conditions were analysed through regression models and smoothing techniques. The simple aridity intensity index (All) reflects increases in the magnitude of dryness. Especially pronounced trends are found over most of southern Portugal in the 1955/1999 period, highlighting the fact that large areas are threatened by drought and desertification. The trend signals of the wetness indices are not significant at the majority of stations, but there is evidence of increasing short-term precipitation intensity over the region during the last three decades of the twentieth century. Finally, the results also indicate that extreme precipitation variability and climate uncertainty are greater in recent times. Copyright (C) 2008 Royal Meteorological Society

AB  - 1 Insects using olfactory stimuli to forage for prey/hosts are proposed to encounter a 'reliability-detectability problem', where the usability of a stimulus depends on its reliability as an indicator of herbivore presence and its detectability.
   2 We investigated this theory using the responses of female seven-spot ladybirds Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to plant headspace chemicals collected from the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae and four commercially available Brassica cultivars; Brassica rapa L. cultivar 'turnip purple top', Brassica juncea L. cultivar 'red giant mustard', Brassica napus L. cultivar 'Apex', Brassica napus L. cultivar 'Courage' and Arabidopsis thaliana. For each cultivar/species, responses to plants that were undamaged, previously infested by M. persicae and infested with M. persicae, were investigated using dual-choice Petri dish bioassays and circular arenas.
   3 There was no evidence that ladybirds responded to headspace chemicals from aphids alone. Ladybirds significantly preferred headspace chemicals from B. napus cv. Apex that were undamaged compared with those from plants infested with aphids. For the other four species/cultivars, there was a consistent trend of the predators being recorded more often in the half of the Petri dish containing plant headspace chemicals from previously damaged and infested plants compared with those from undamaged ones. Furthermore, the mean distance ladybirds walked to reach aphid-infested A. thaliana was significantly shorter than to reach undamaged plants. These results suggest that aphid-induced plant chemicals could act as an arrestment or possibly an attractant stimulus to C. septempunctata. However, it is also possible that C. septempunctata could have been responding to aphid products, such as honeydew, transferred to the previously damaged and infested plants.
   4 The results provide evidence to support the 'reliability-detectability' theory and suggest that the effectiveness of C. septempunctata as a natural enemy of aphids may be strongly affected by which species and cultivar of Brassica are being grown.

AB  - Phages are valuable models or surrogates for enteric viruses because they share many fundamental properties and features. Among these are structure, composition, morphology, size and site of replication. Even though they use different host cells, coliphages and Bacteroides fragilis phages predominantly replicate in the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and warm-blooded animals where enteric viruses also replicate. A major advantage of phages is that, compared to viruses, they are detectable by simple, inexpensive and rapid techniques. In view of these features, phages are particularly useful as models to assess the behaviour and survival of enteric viruses in the environment, and as surrogates to assess the resistance of human viruses to water treatment and disinfection processes. Since there is no direct correlation between numbers of phages and viruses, phages cannot to a meaningful extent be used to indicate numbers of viruses in polluted water. The presence of phages typically associated with human and animal excreta indicates the potential presence of enteric viruses. However. the absence of these phages from water environments is generally a meaningful indication of the absence of enteric viruses. This is because phages such as somatic coliphages, F-RNA coliphages and B. fragilis phages generally outnumber enteric viruses in water environments, and they are at least as resistant to unfavourable conditions including those in water treatment and disinfection processes. However, using highly sensitive molecular techniques viruses have been detected in drinking water supplies which yielded negative results in conventional tests for phages. Initially, data on phages were rather confusing because a wide variety of techniques was used. However, techniques for the detection of phages are being standardised internationally. This applies in particular to somatic and F-RNA coliphages, and B. fragilis phages, which are most commonly used in water quality assessment. Reliable and practical techniques now available include direct quantitative plaque assays on samples of water up to 100 ml, and qualitative tests on 500 ml or more using highly sensitive enrichment procedures.

AB  - The present studies investigate the hypothesis that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system plays a role in the neural substrates underlying individual differences in behavioral reactivity to stress. Individuals were selected from a random sample of Sprague-Dawley rats and categorized as a high responder (HR), middle responder (MR), or low responder (LR) based on the initial locomotor response to a novel open field. Rats with behavioral scores at least 1 SD away from the mean for the subject sample were categorized as HR or LR rats. Middle responder rats exhibited locomotor scores representative of the mean locomotor activity of the population sample. Locomotor activity scores measured 6 days after the initial determination were similar to scores obtained in the original screening, suggesting that the locomotor response to novelty is a stable individual trait, Additionally, locomotor activity during the dark phase of the diurnal cycle was not different among the groups, suggesting that differences in locomotor activity in response to a novel open field are an index of behavioral reactivity to the stressful situation rather than an indicator of global differences in motoric activity. In vivo microdialysis was used to measure extracellular levels of hippocampal NE in the hippocampus, During baseline conditions, the efflux of hippocampal NE was similar among HR, MR, and LR rats, In response to tail-pinch stress, hippocampal NE release was elevated in all groups, This response was significantly greater in HR compared to LR rats, Across all groups, locomotor response in the novel open field was significantly correlated with the magnitude of NE release in response to subsequent application of tail-pinch stress. In contrast, administration of 1.5 mg/kg, i.p,, amphetamine resulted in a similar elevation of extracellular NE level among HR, LR, and MR rats, These data suggest that activation of the LC-NE system may be involved in determining the behavioral response of individuals to environmental stress, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - A detailed analysis of sedimentary organic matter (or palynofacies) was carried out on thermally immature to early mature Upper Jurassic and Hauterivian condensed intervals in deep-sea carbonate-marl alternations outcropping in the Vocontian Basin (SE France). All the condensed sections studied are characterized by intense bioturbation and very low organic carbon content (< 0.25 wt.%), indicative of oxic depositional conditions.
   Oxic condensed sections display variable palynofacies signatures, which are best illustrated by: (1) the ratio of continental to marine constituents; (2) the ratio of opaque to translucent phytoclasts (i.e. woody debris) and (3) the preservation of palynomorphs (based on fluorescence intensity and morphological preservation state in transmitted light microscopy). Both of the ratios increase with the degree of palynomorph degradation, which shows that phytoclasts, especially the opaque ones, become relatively concentrated in the most degraded facies. These observations lead to the classification of oxic condensed sections into three organic facies types showing different degrees of preservation and palynofacies signatures. Type 1 organic facies display intense degradation and are characterized by high values of the ratio of continental to marine fraction. They record unfavourable depositional environments for preservation of organic matter. Type 2 organic facies are most common and are characterized by a decreasing value of the ratio of continental to marine fraction. Type 3 organic facies display the same trend of the ratio of continental to marine fraction as type 2, but the palynomorph assemblage is better preserved. Type 1 and type 3 organic facies are relatively rare.
   Recognizing these organic facies types is important when analysing the relationship between sedimentary organic matter and sequence stratigraphy, because it allows the use of the appropriate palynofacies parameters. In particular, the use of the ratio of continental to marine constituents, usually a very good indicator of regressive-transgressive trends, becomes questionable in highly degraded intervals. Moreover, distinguishing between well-preserved or highly degraded palynofacies in condensed intervals provides valuable information on the oxicity of the depositional environment.

AB  - V(D)J recombinase is normally involved in the highly regulated rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell-receptor gene segments (in B and T cells, respectively) to form functional antibody genes and T-cell-receptor genes. Occasionally, this tightly controlled process acts on inappropriate places in the genome and results in deletions and translocations. Some of these illegitimate V(D)J recombinase-mediated events have been implicated in the genetic changes associated with several forms of leukemia and lymphoid malignancy. We have developed a sensitive, specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay to quantify such events in the peripheral blood cells of humans. This assay detects a V(D)J recombinase-mediated deletion in the hprt gene, which codes for a housekeeping enzyme and is not implicated in cancer development. Alterations in this gene serve as a surrogate indicator for these illegitimate events, which may be occurring throughout the genome. The essay involves a hemi-nested PCR with two sets of primers. Multiple replicates of genomic DNA (each representing 4 x 10(5) cells) are amplified with specific primers under conditions in which a single copy will give a detectable PCR product. Poisson statistics are then used to estimate the deletion mutant frequency. The frequency of cells with the hprt deletion among 20 healthy young adults ranged from <1.3 x 10(-7) to 4.1 x 10 and was compared with the frequency of t(14; 18) previously determined in these same individuals. No correlation was found between the frequencies of these two measures of genomic rearrangement. The DNA sequences at the deletion junctions were determined and provided evidence for multiple independent mutations in some individuals. This assay may serve as a biomorker For the level of illegitimate V(D)J recombination occurring in peripheral blood cells of humans. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Persistence of individual differences in animal behavior in reactions to various environmental challenges could reflect basic divergences in temperament, which might be used to predict details of adaptive response. Although studies have been carried out on fear and anxiety in various species, including laboratory, domestic and wild animals, no consistent definition of fearfulness as a basic trait of temperament has emerged.
   After a classification of the events that may produce a state of fear, this article describes the great variability in behavior and in physiological patterns generally associated with emotional reactivity. The difficulties of proposing fearfulness - the general capacity to react to a variety of potentially threatening situations - as a valid basic internal variable are then discussed. Although there are many studies showing covariation among the psychobiological responses to different environmental challenges, other studies find no such correlations and raise doubts about the interpretation of fearfulness as a basic personality trait. After a critical assessment of methodologies used in fear and anxiety studies, it is suggested that discrepancies among results are mainly due to the modulation of emotional responses in animals, which depend on numerous genetic and epigenetic factors. It is difficult to compare results obtained by different methods from animals reared under various conditions and with different genetic origins.
   The concept of fearfulness as an inner trait is best supported by two kinds of investigations. First, an experimental approach combining ethology and experimental psychology produces undeniable indicators of emotional reactivity. Second, genetic lines selected for psychobiological traits prove useful in establishing relationships between behavioral and neuroendocrine aspects of emotional reactivity. It is suggested that fearfulness could be considered a basic feature of the temperament of each individual, one that predisposes it to respond similarly to a variety of potentially alarming challenges, but is nevertheless continually modulated during development by the interaction of genetic traits of reactivity with environmental factors, particularly in the juvenile period. Such interaction may explain much of the interindividual variability observed in adaptive responses.

AB  - Induced thermoluminescence measurements have been performed on eighteen eucrites, thirteen howardites (plus seven splits from the Bholghati howardite), six diogenites, and fifteen mesosiderites in order to help clarify their metamorphic, shock, and brecciation history. The TL sensitivities of the basaltic meteorites reflect their bulk composition, and the effects of (1) igneous processes (diogenites and mesosiderites) and (2) the mixing of materials of different compositions (e.g., diogenitic and eucritic) during brecciation (howardites) can be observed. Two previously unclassified mesosiderites, LEW87006 and EET87500, are assigned to class A and B, respectively, on the basis of their TL sensitivities. The eucrites show a 15-fold range of TL sensitivities, which correlate with petrographic indicators of metamorphic intensity. We therefore describe a petrologic type scale based on TL and petrographic evidence, where the least metamorphosed eucrites are type 1 and most equilibrated are type 8. We see no evidence for two discrete metamorphic environments corresponding to the equilibrated and unequilibrated eucrites.
   The temperature of the dominant TL peak observed for basaltic meteorites, and experiments in which four eucrites with diverse petrographic properties were annealed at various temperatures in the laboratory, suggests the metamorphic equilibration temperatures for most basaltic meteorites were less-than-or-equal-to 800-degrees-C. This estimate is generally consistent with palaeotemperatures determined from two-pyroxene, olivine-pyroxene, and oxygen isotope equilibria. Assuming this temperature was typical of conditions during metamorphism, then burial depths for type > 5 eucrites were > 350 m and < 50 m for type 2 eucrites. An important exception is LEW85303 (and three samples paired with it, LEW85300, 85302, and 88005) which has been shock-heated above 1000-degrees-C. Ibitira and LEW85305 have also been shocked but subsequently suffered low-temperature annealing (less-than-or-equal-to 800-degrees-C). Since TL peak temperatures are related to the degree of disorder in the Al, Si chain in feldspar, the present data provide independent evidence for very slow cooling rates for mesosiderites and for the slower cooling rates for some cumulate eucrites relative to equilibrated non-cumulate eucrites.

AB  - The Russian Arctic regions have a significant geographical, historical, and economic connection with the Northern Sea Route (NSR); the successful implementation of Russia's geo-political and geo-economic strategies in the Arctic is mainly dependent upon the socio-economic situation in these regions. Population migration is a determinant of the current and future labour potential of the supporting regions; compared to natural growth, it has been a key driver of population and an indicator of the quality of human resources. The research herein considered the factors and impacts of migration on the quality of human resources in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF). Russian population census data for 2002 and 2010, and statistical materials were analysed by age and migrant education to characterise the quality of human resources. To identify the causes of migration, the quantitative data analyses were supplemented with results from sociological studies and expert assessments. An index methodology was used to compare the quality of life and human capital development of the Arctic regions. Accordingly, most of the analysed Arctic regions showed high indicators of human development, which were higher than the national average in education, but significantly lower in longevity. Further, most of the Arctic regions occupied lower positions in Russian regional quality of life. It was concluded that the AZRF regions hold high quality of human capital; however, since high-quality living conditions are lacking, they serve as donors of human capital to other parts of the country. These regions would require external labour resources in the near future due to the planned large-scale projects for the development of the NSR, concurrent reduction and ageing of labour resources, and demand changes in the labour market. The government's socio-economic policies would determine the scale, dynamics, and direction of migration, as well as their impact on the demographics and labour potential of the supporting regions of the NSR.

AB  - Cretaceous continental sediments in Sichuan Basin, China, have different colors, and the reasons for their formation are not determined. Based on mineralogical and geochemical characteristics, red beds and nonred beds in the Upper and Lower Cretaceous sedimentary strata in the western Sichuan Basin are described and tested in this study. The test and analysis of the mineral composition, element content, and iron speciation of mudstone samples with gray-green, gray, and red colors in Cangxi, Bailong, and Guankou formations found that the change in hematite content directly causes the color difference of samples. For red mudstone, the average chemical index of alteration, chemical index of weathering, weather eluviation index (Ba), Ca/(Mg*Al), and Al2O3/SiO2 index are 67.75, 79.94, 2.07, 0.26, and 0.26, respectively, indicating that chemical weathering is the most intense. The geochemical indexes corresponding to gray samples are 64.41, 74.91, 2.08, 0.19, and 0.24, respectively. Those corresponding to the gray-green samples are 62.30, 70.68, 2.17, 0.21, and 0.24, with the weakest chemical weathering. The ratio of Cu/Zn and the enrichment factor of V show that red and nonred bed samples are formed in weak oxidation and weak reduction environments, respectively. The red sample contains the highest content of hematite iron. The gray-green sample mainly represents paramagnetic ferrous in clay minerals. The geochemical contents of the gray sample's three iron elements are slightly different, mainly trivalent iron. The change in iron speciation content in different color samples shows that the Fe element forming hematite in red bed samples may come from the weathering of source rock and clay minerals subjected to secondary weathering. At present, it is confirmed that different colors of samples are related to different weathering degrees of source rocks, which can be related to hot, dry/humid climates. It is necessary to distinguish the climate type in combination with other indicators.

AB  - Objectives We assessed the relationship between the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at intake and other measurements intended to assess biological factors, markers of disease and health status.
   Design, setting and participants We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2365 participants from the Baseline Health Study, a prospective cohort of adults selected to represent major demographic groups in the USA. Participants underwent deep phenotyping on demographic, clinical, laboratory, functional and imaging findings.
   Importance Despite extensive research on the clinical implications of the PHQ-9, data are limited on the relationship between PHQ-9 scores and other measures of health and disease; we sought to better understand this relationship.
   Interventions None.
   Main outcomes and measures Cross-sectional measures of medical illnesses, gait, balance strength, activities of daily living, imaging and laboratory tests.
   Results Compared with lower PHQ-9 scores, higher scores were associated with female sex (46.9%-66.7%), younger participants (53.6-42.4 years) and compromised physical status (higher resting heart rates (65 vs 75 bpm), larger body mass index (26.5-30 kg/m(2)), greater waist circumference (91-96.5 cm)) and chronic conditions, including gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (13.2%-24.7%) and asthma (9.5%-20.4%) (p<0.0001). Increasing PHQ-9 score was associated with a higher frequency of comorbidities (migraines (6%-20.4%)) and active symptoms (leg cramps (6.4%-24.7%), mood change (1.2%-47.3%), lack of energy (1.2%-57%)) (p<0.0001). After adjustment for relevant demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and medical characteristics, we found that memory change, tension, shortness of breath and indicators of musculoskeletal symptoms (backache and neck pain) are related to higher PHQ-9 scores (p<0.0001).
   Conclusions Our study highlights how: (1) even subthreshold depressive symptoms (measured by PHQ-9) may be indicative of several individual- and population-level concerns that demand more attention; and (2) depression should be considered a comorbidity in common disease.

AB  - Recent evidence indicates the relevant role of the tryptophan (TRP) metabolites in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases via inflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. Therefore, quantification of TRP and its metabolites in biological samples can be a powerful tool to elucidate the disease mechanisms. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence detection (FD) (LC-UV/FD) method for the quantification of TRP and its metabolites (L-kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KA)) in urine samples from heart failure (HF) patients. Biochemical parameters and inflammatory markers were quantified, and data correlated with urinary concentrations of TRP and its metabolites. Optimized chromatographic conditions were achieved using a Luna (R) 3 mu m PFP( 2) analytical column, a mobile phase of 20 mM of ammonium formate in ultra-pure water (with 0.01 % of formic acid), acetonitrile and ethanol (95/2/3, v/v/v), a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and a column oven temperature set at 25 C. The method was validated according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines and showed to be linear (r(2) >0.99), accurate (82-116%) and precise (%RSD below 15 %). The limits of quantification varied between 50 and 125 ng/mL. The method was applied to the quantification of TRP, KYN and KA in healthy volunteers and male HF patients. The results obtained through this pilot study (small group of patients) showed a relationship between biochemical parameters, inflammatory markers and changes in the concentration of TRP, KYN and KA. The KYNITRP and KAIKYN ratios were calculated. Results support the hypothesis that KYNITRP ratio is related with enzymatic activity and that KAIKYN ratio can be a good neuroprotection indicator. The potential of the LC-UV/FD method for the monitoring of the selected compounds in cardiac patients was also demonstrated. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The water footprint (WF) of crop production has been widely accepted as a comprehensive indicator of agri-cultural water consumption. Rationality and accuracy in crop WF accounting are thus prerequisites for implementation of WF assessments that yield sustainable regional agricultural water management. However, few studies have focused on the rationality of multiple quantitative approaches and the associated differences in crop WF accounting among different studies. Here we, focusing on maize, wheat and rice, review quantitatively the effects of different quantification approaches and scales on the results of crop WF accounting and simulations in relevant published research during 2002-2018 worldwide. Results show that (i) The number of studies on crop WF accounting has increased by 17 times since 2002 (similar to the year of creation of WF concepts); the research direction is focused on improvement of quantification and resolution in both time and space. (ii) The current approaches to WF calculation can be divided into five main types: the field crop water requirement (FCWR) approach, field soil water balance (FSWB) approach, regional water balance (RWB) approach, remote sensing (RS) approach and field measured water balance (FMWB) approach. The FCWR and FSWB approaches are more widely adopted than the other three. (iii) There were non-negligible differences in the WF accounting results among approaches and scales. At the global level, the deviations in WF for maize, wheat, and rice were relatively low among different studies, with the world average values of 0.73 m(3) kg(-1) +/- 14.9%, 1.136 m(3) kg(-1) +/- 13.5%, and 1.269 m(3) kg(-1) +/- 27%, respectively. The ranges of uncertainty varied significantly when downscaling to specific countries and provinces. The maximum coefficients of variation (CV) of WF for maize, wheat, and rice in different regions were up to 40%, 49%, and 50%, respectively. (iv) The WF simulations showed very reasonable agreement and lower deviation between the FCWR and FSWB approaches.

AB  - Cerium is the most abundant rare earth metal in the earth's crust, and it has deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems from fertilizer runoff.Scenedesmus obliquusis an oil-rich microalga that grows rapidly and is sensitive to many kinds of toxins. Given that microalgae are useful indicators of eutrophication and toxic stress, it was found that lower concentrations of cerium (0.50-5.00 mg center dot L-1) stimulated algal growth and increased chlorophyll a content, whereas higher concentrations (above 50.00 mg center dot L-1) had an inhibitory effect on algal growth and chlorophyll a content. The algal growth rate and chlorophyll a content peaked at a cerium concentration of 5.00 mg center dot L-1. Both the donor and acceptor sides of photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers were sensitive to cerium-induced stress. Specifically, high concentrations of cerium damaged the oxygen evolving complex and PSII reaction center and suppressed electron transport at the donor and receptor side of the reaction center, influencing the absorption, transfer, and application of light energy inS. obliquusXJ002. In addition, we established a simple method to quantify the intracellular lipid content ofS. obliquusXJ002, and the optimum staining conditions for Nile red were as follows: volume percentage of dimethyl sulfoxide was 2%, the concentration of Nile red was 2.0 mu g center dot mL(-1), and the staining time of Nile red was 5 min. The addition of cerium resulted in a significant increase in the total lipid content of XJ002. When the concentration of cerium was 50 mg center dot L-1, the total lipid content was 16.26% higher than the control group. This information will enhance our ability to utilize microelement fertilizer in biomass accumulation programs and will help to further reveal the key regulatory factors in the lipid metabolism, and would lay the foundation for promoting the research of microalgae bioenergy.

AB  - Explosive volcanic eruptions generate a range of physical processes with great hazard potential. Subsequent fluvial processes have major effects on channel and valley-floor geometry, potentially resulting in extreme sediment and large wood (LW) yields. The associated impacts can be severe, both immediately and in the longer term as river channels are permanently reworking the large volumes of their own sediment. The city of Chaiten (Lake District, Chile) is a unique case, since sediment- and wood-laden flows in the Blanco River may still pose, even 11 years after the paroxysmal eruption of the Chaiten volcano, large urban sectors at risk. Thoroughly assessing the flood hazard and the generated impact for such urban settings is, hence, of utmost importance. To achieve this goal, we designed a workflow integrating the following tasks: (i) hydrologic modelling at catchment scale employing the HEC-HMS model to obtain flood hydrographs for a 30 and 100 years flood, respectively, (ii) estimation of the sediment fluxes to establish reliable boundary conditions for (iii) the subsequent extensive 2D flood modelling with the model Iber in the unconfined floodplain and delta of the Blanco River including also the effects of possible clogging of the "Austral Road" bridge with transported LW, (iv) quantification of a series of building performance indicators for a set of 13 residential buildings as a basis for subsequent vulnerability and risk assessment. We found that, even without a new volcanic eruption as a potent hazard trigger, vast urban sectors are still exposed to flooding, in particular if LW gets entrapped at the "Austral Road" bridge and channel outbursts occur as a consequence of the reduced conveyance and backwater rise. Our results indicate a great spatial variability of flood impacts, being worst in the urban areas either located closely to the channel outburst locations or where overland flow locally channelizes on concave floodplain topographies. Based on our findings we outline provisional recommendations for risk mitigation and informed land use planning.

AB  - Sediment quality monitoring is commonly used to assess for river pollution by industrial activities, but requires knowledge of pre-disturbance conditions. This has long been a critical knowledge gap for assessing pollution of the Lower Athabasca River within the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) because sediment quality monitoring started 30 years after mining operations began in 1967. Here, we analyze oil-sands pollution indicator metals vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) in sediment cores from five Athabasca River floodplain lakes spanning from 17 km upstream to 58 km downstream of central oil sands operations. These data are used to define pre-development baseline (i.e., reference) concentrations and assess for enrichment in sediment deposited after 1967. Measurements of organic and inorganic matter content were used to differentiate periods of strong and weaker Athabasca River influence in the sediment records, as needed to discern pathways of metal deposition. Numerical analyses reveal that post-1967 V and Ni enrichment factors have remained below the 1.5 threshold for `minimal enrichment' (sensu Birch, 2017) in stratigraphic intervals of strong river influence in the floodplain lakes. Thus, concentrations of V and Ni carried by Athabasca River sediment have not become measurably enriched since onset of oil sands development, as demonstrated by our before-after study design with >99.99% power to detect a 10% increase above pre-development baselines. At the closest lake (<1 km) to oil sands operations, however, enrichment factors for V and Ni increased to 2.1 and 1.5, respectively, in the mid-1980s and have remained at this level when river influence was weaker, indicating contamination via atmospheric transport. Localized enrichment within the oil sands region via atmospheric pathways is a greater concern for ecosystems and society than local and far-field transport by fluvial pathways. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to highlight the need to combine lifecycle environmental assessment with durability evaluation (tribology and engine tests) to evaluate the potential of surface technologies to contribute to the green deal, in order to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent. Tribology is a scientific discipline that allows one to understand the system reaction to friction and wear. Tribological testing machines are prepared to measure friction at the laboratory level to minimize the wear and heat dissipation of two bodies in relative movement, thus improving the energy efficiency and minimizing CO(2)emissions. In this paper, different surface technologies, such as high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF), physical vapor deposition (PVD), and clean Cr electrolytic processes, are analyzed as promising surface technology solutions from both performance and environmental impact perspectives to replace harmful Cr(VI) coatings. The tribology simulates the working conditions of the real system at the laboratory level, reproducing the failure mechanism and facilitating the laboratory screening of the energy efficiency and durability of materials solutions for certain tribological systems-in this case, engine components. The tribological test results give information about the behavior of materials, while the engine tests gives information about the behavior of components. In this paper, the environmental impact of the production process of the coatings is also analyzed. Two hard chrome processes are compared, demonstrating that by controlling the production process it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the chrome-plated process, minimizing the environmental impact to that of PVD coatings. The environmental impact of the tested HVOF process is lower than traditional Cr(VI)-plated coatings but higher than PVD coatings. Combining the information from the lifecycle assessment (LCA) and tribological studies, it is possible to assess both the performance and the environmental impact of the surface treatments. This methodology is a tool to that can be used minimize CO(2)emissions at the design phase to improve the energy efficiency of products and processes.

AB  - No-tillage systems are able to reduce the negative effects of agricultural intensification on soil properties. However, knowledge of long-term impacts of no-tillage systems on soil properties is insufficient. It is essential to know which soil quality indicators are the most sensitive to management practices in each particular environment. Therefore, the objective of this work is to determine which soil quality properties are more sensitive to the impact of two tillage systems in a vertic Argiaquoll soil from Buenos Aires, Argentina. This work started in 2006 and included crop rotation and tillage systems, including both tillage and no-tillage. Physical and chemical properties were measured in three consecutive years (2013-2015) at two depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm). The tillage system modified soil physical and chemical properties, mainly in the surface layer. No-tillage showed significantly higher bulk density (2013-2015 p < 0.05), gravimetric moisture (2013; 2014 p < 0.05), organic carbon (2013-2015 p < 0.05), and aggregates stability in the face of a heavy rain (2013; 2015 p < 0.05), than soil under tillage. Soil saturation (or total porosity) was significantly greater under tillage. The tillage system did not affect hydraulic conductivity, total nitrogen and extractable phosphorus from the surface, nor physical and chemical properties from the second depth. No-tillage alleviates, but is not enough to mitigate, the loss of soil organic carbon and aggregate stability caused by continuous cropping in this vertic Argiaquall. Bulk density, organic carbon, aggregates stability and saturation are indicators for future studies performed in environments with similar soil and climate conditions.

AB  - The application of the exergy approach to thermal comfort models is a modern tool for providing and evaluating the level of thermal comfort. The purpose of the paper is to apply exergy analysis to the "heat source - human - building envelope" system to reduce energy consumption and to identify the most influential factors. The regression models for determining comfortable indoor temperature taking into account subjective and objective microclimate parameters and indicators are obtained. The variety of influence factors, namely human activity, thermal resistance of clothing and the values of reference state for exergy evaluation, have been expanded for analysis within cold and warm periods. The paper proposes to investigate the effect of reference environment on both the exergy consumption of human body and the comfortable indoor air temperature. The changes of exergy consumption by the human body for various values of the reference environment and the subjective parameters of thermal comfort are estimated. It has been found that the decrease of the ambient temperature results in an increase of the exergy consumption in within the human body. However, the value of the comfortable air temperature in the room practically remains unchanged. Therefore, when considering the "heat source - human building envelope" system, where the influence of a person is determined by the comfortable air temperature in the room, the reference environment can be chosen equal to the ambient temperature. Based on the obtained regression equations both the influence of thermo-modernization and the change of the building category for providing comfortable conditions are estimated. Dynamic mathematical models for representative samples of rooms with different design parameters (orientation, geometry) and thermophysical properties of enclosures have been developed. The models provide a possibility to evaluate energy performance and saving in case of determining comfortable indoor temperature based on the proposed regression model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the shallow subsurface sediments retrieved from a short sediment core (2.05 m long) collected from the tidal flat south of Al-Kharrar Lagoon, Rabigh area, Saudi Arabia, are presented to determine the impact of temporal change of depositional environment and distinguish the principal control(s) on their chemical composition. The sediments are dominantly siliciclastic, consisting of two vertically stacked sedimentary fades: lagoonal (LG) gray silt-rich mud to argillaceous very fine sand at the base and intertidal flat (TF) brown mud and argillaceous very fine-grained sands at the top. The sediments of the two facies are similar in their mineralogical and chemical composition except for slight vertical variations in the relative abundance of minerals and concentrations of major oxides and trace elements. The mineralogical composition is dominated by quartz, feldspars, and plagioclase with less abundant clay minerals and hornblende, all of detrital origin. In addition, traces of high and low Mg-calcite, dolomite, and gypsum were recognized. Geochemically, the sediments are first-cycle and compositionally immature. The Al2O3/TiO2 ratios range from 9.4 to 17 and from 13 to 15.4 for the sediments of the LG and TF facies, respectively. These values suggest an intermediate igneous source rock of the Birak group that belongs to the oceanic island arc of the Hijaz Terrane, western Arabian Shield. The average values of paleoweathering indices CIA, CIW, and PIA are <50, suggesting unweathered to poorly weathered source rock that is consistent with the late Holocene arid climate. Although the redox-sensitive V and Cr in the sediments of LG facies are slightly enriched relative to the average shale, the values of the V/Cr ratio are generally <2, suggesting deposition under oxic conditions. The chemical characteristics of the sediments are primarily controlled by the composition of source rock and to a lesser extent by hydraulic sorting during transportation and deposition.

AB  - Ruminant production is predominant in mountainous areas, where grassland plots are often difficult to reach or non-machinable. Many mountain-area livestock systems combine a dairy-cow herd with a sucker-cattle herd. Here we posit that mixed herds allow better utilization of grazed grass than specialized herds on plots with constraints. To determine the influence of herd composition on grassland valorization, animal production and economic performance, we studied the functioning of two farms derived from two farm types representative of real mixed cattle mountain systems in the south of the Auvergne (France). Farm_l is a medium-sized operation with a summer mountain pasture, and Farm_2 is a large operation with fragmented plots of grassland and cereal crops. We used modeling to vary the proportion of herd livestock units (LU) between the dairy herd and the suckler herd. We used the bioeconomic optimization model 'Orfee' (Optimization of Ruminant Farm for Economic and Environmental Assessment) modified for mountain conditions by integrating geographical constraints and the heterogeneity of grassland plots based on the French permanent grassland typology. The experimental design used 5 simulations defined by percentage of LUs found in the dairy (D) herd: 100D, 75D, 50D, 25D, and OD. The results show better utilization of grazed grass with mixed herds than specialized herds. Based on total amount of pasture grass available in each farm, Farm_1 had the maximum grazed grass utilization rate at 85%, while Farm_2 had total valorization by grazing (rate of 100%). This better utilization of grazed grass increases average profit per Annual Work Units, especially when the difference in profitability between dairy and suckler herds is small. In addition, mixing herd reduces profit variability, taking into account market and policy variations over the period 2000-2015. This study shows that understanding the farm structure is key for getting the right herds mix to improve grazed grass utilization with good economic performance.

AB  - Grain size is one of the most fundamental properties of sediments. It is frequently used in paleoclimate, paleoceanographic, and paleoenvironmental research as a proxy for river discharge, current and wind strength, and to identify mass flow deposits. Measuring grain size is, however, time-consuming and destructive. Given the strong influence of grain size on sediment inorganic geochemistry, single-element variations measured by, for example, X-ray fluorescence core scanning are increasingly used to estimate grain-size variations at high resolution in sediment cores. This approach is however limited to a narrow grain-size range since individual elements only monotonically relate to grain size over a narrow size range. Here, we present a simple, code-free, multielement method based on partial least squares regression to predict sediment mean grain size from inorganic geochemical data over the range of sizes commonly encountered in sedimentary basins (clay to sand). The method was first tested using river sediment samples separated in 11 grain-size fractions, and it was later successfully applied to two sediment cores from the Chilean fjords. Our method only requires measuring grain size on a limited number (around 10) of selected training samples, and it allows to predict mean grain size at X-ray fluorescence core scanner resolution. This method has the potential to be applied to any lake or marine sediment core, provided sediment provenance, weathering, and diagenesis remain relatively stable through time, and we anticipate that it will result in a significant increase in the resolution of sediment proxy records of climate and environmental change.
   Plain Language Summary Sediment grain size is one of the best indicators of past transport conditions. Here we present a method to predict mean sediment grain size from inorganic geochemical measurements. This method can be applied to geochemical measurements obtained by X-ray Fluorescence core scanning to generate grain-size profiles quickly and at high resolution, and we anticipate that it will result in much improved paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB  - New paleoclimatic data from the Casa Branca salt marsh, in the southwest coast of Portugal, are compared with records previously published on the northwest coast (Caminha salt marsh) to offer a more comprehensive overview of the environmental evolution of the west Iberian margin over the last six centuries. These reconstructions are based on the foraminiferal records of two dated sediment cores retrieved from the high marsh settings and supported by geochemical-sedimentological data.
   Both marshes were originally formed in the AD 1300s, between the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA), highlighting a major episode of increased sediment supply in lower estuaries linked to climate-driven changes in continental runoff. Afterwards, the two marshes evolved under different climatic regimes as reflected by their foraminiferal assemblages. The environmental conditions are characterized by higher salinity in Casa Branca (southwest), with Jadammina macrescens and Trochammina inflata as dominant species, than in Caminha (northwest), where Haplophragmoides spp. dominates. We suggest that a long-term trend of a net gain in evapotranspiration at Casa Branca inducing a higher marsh salinity baseline may explain this microfaunal contrast. Trochammina inflata seems to be a good indicator of drier periods in the studied area, connected to key events of aeolian large-dust input to the southwest coast of Portugal. The influence of the most important climate drivers was assessed, namely external (solar) and internal (North Atlantic Oscillation - NAO) forcings.
   Spectral and wavelet transform coherence analyses were used to detect solar footprints on foraminiferal and climate-related time series. A main significant quasi-periodicity was identified within the range of the secular Gleissberg cycle of solar activity modulating the annual NAO and regional spring-summer (simulated) temperatures after AD 1700. This stronger solar-climate coupling may be related to the known upward secular trend in the total solar irradiance after the Maunder Minimum.

AB  - A detailed and multidisciplinary study of physical and biotic factors of a coastal sector of southern Italy, the Pineta della foce del Garigliano SCI (Site of Community Importance) area, has been carried out in the frame of the European research project LIFE + Nature & Biodiversity PROVIDUNE. We evaluated the degree of dunes vulnerability (Dune Vulnerability Index, DVI) and sustainable anthropogenic load (carrying capacity) of the emerged beach of the study area, which is largely affected by shoreline retreat and degradation of dune habitat. The values of about 0.6 of the DVI in the two key sectors of the study area suggest a high level of vulnerability of beach/dune system due to both natural and human factors. The partial vulnerability index related to the geomorphological condition exhibits the highest values, as a consequence of a coastal system largely affected by recent and present-day beach erosion and severe hydrodynamics processes. Several inadequate human practises have been recognized in the study area whose impact appears to be an important factor in controlling the reduction of the beach-dune system resilience. Integrated analysis of DVI and carrying capacity suggests that the northern and central sectors of the study area have a high level of dune vulnerability due to hydrodynamic and geomorphological factors whereas the human impact can be considered relatively less important. The southern sector of the study area is featured by a well-developed infrastructure system, which is able to assure a sustainable beach occupation. Nevertheless, significant interventions such as dune replacement by permanent or ephemeral infrastructures, uncontrolled pedestrian or vehicular access and inappropriate use of mechanical beach cleaning have been recognized in this sector of the beach. These long-lasting impacts have promoted the dismantling of large sector of the dune habitats. Obtained results allowed identifying the critical area where appropriate actions can be performed for the mitigation of impacts, the conservation of dune habitats and their sustainable use.

AB  - With the development of modernization and industrialization in China, the infrastructure energy consumption increases, which shows the process of modernization in our country. Despite there are a lot of researches about the energy consumption in the field of construction, transportation and other infrastructure, in academia, there are less statistics about energy consumption for the infrastructure as a whole in the life cycle, and its proportion in total energy consumption in the whole country. Thus, this paper tries to characterize infrastructures of China, which include construction, transportation, energy, water supply and drainage, post and telecommunications communication system by establishing an estimation model of infrastructure system CO2 emissions in the life cycle through national official macro-level statistical data. The results show that CO2 emissions from the infrastructure have rapidly grown over the past decades. And based on the extension of STIRPAT model framework, we make an empirical analysis of the important factors on China's macro infrastructure systematic CO2 emissions from the population, urbanization level, residents' consumption level, the third industry development, and investment in fixed assets using dynamic panel data. Results show that in the above factors, the contribution rate of infrastructure investment is the highest, followed by family size, 30.9% and 22.6%, respectively, and the urbanization rate is the highest in the elasticity of all the factors affect the carbon emissions, whenever the urbanization rate increases by 1%, the macro infrastructure carbon emissions increase 1.624. In this paper, from the perspective of the overall environmental benefits, we provide a more comprehensive environmental assessment analysis method for the policy makers. And the infrastructure construction of China has periodic characteristic. We analyze the specific features of the infrastructure CO2 emissions in the life cycle, and put forward emission-reduction measures in consideration of the current conditions. In addition, the method of building the model of infrastructure CO2 emissions in the operation stage development is also important for future quantifications of CO2 emissions of other sectors in China and beyond.

AB  - Modification of the hydrological regime by human actions can reduce the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality. For the first time, a study was conducted of the inherent pollution attenuation capacity of wetlands associated with the highly regulated Spanish Tagus River. We determined the natural purification capacity of a floodplain where irrigated agriculture predominates and hydraulic connection with the river is virtually nonexistent. To this end, continuous hydrophysical measurements and sediment and water samples were taken during the period extending from April 2013 to March 2014. A multi-parametric dataset including hydraulic, physico-chemical, bacterial and macroinvertebrate indicators was collected from ten piezometers located within a meander, together with two additional sampling points in the river. Sampling was performed monthly to measure hydraulic and physico-chemical parameters and quarterly for bacteria and macroinvertebrates. The data enabled us to implement different but complementary methodological approaches to characterize denitrification. Specifically, we performed: (i) end-member mixing analysis (EMMA); (ii) macroinvertebrate characterization; (iii) denitrification potential analysis; (iv) bacterial assemblage structure analysis; and (v) hydrological modeling of the current and different future management scenarios. All the approaches except EMMA indicated the same conclusion: denitrification is almost nonexistent due to the fact that the study site does not present the hydric soil and oxygen-limited conditions required to enable denitrification. The EMMA analysis showed that theoretical nitrate concentrations were lower than expected in some areas during the summer months (e.g. Delta NO3 = -41 in August 2013), which may have been because irrigation intensity was spatiotemporal variable at the study site. Our results show that floodplain denitrification has been drastically reduced due to the suppression of flood pulses. In this context, restoration of the hydrological regime in riverine wetlands would lead to the decay of nitrates whose dynamic evolution increases with flooding, as scenarios tested by the MOHID hydro-biogeochemical model have demonstrated.

AB  - Shrubland ecosystems are less studied than grasslands regarding the role of domestic grazing on ecosystem degradation in the world, but particularly in Mexico. Of special concern is the paucity of research on soil hydrological responses to the impact of livestock. Here, we assessed the role that specific soil and surface characteristics play in soil hydrology as a response to goat grazing intensity in two different soil types, Regosol and Vertisol, in the Tamaulipan thornscrub of north-eastern Mexico. At each soil unit, a set of grazing regimes was identified, including heavy grazing (HG), moderate grazing (MG) and a no-grazing (NG) reference area, and selected soil properties and plant cover were evaluated. In Regosol sites, soil organic matter varied among all grazing regimes (4.6% higher on NG and 2.1% higher on MG with respect HG) and no dissimilarities on bulk density were recorded. For Vertisol sites, soil bulk density increased with grazing intensity (16% higher on MG and37% higher on HG with respect to NG) whereas plant cover linearly decreased from 86% in NG to 29% in MG and 9% in HG sites. Soil organic matter content for Regosol, and plant cover and soil bulk density for Vertisol appeared as the best indicators of water infiltration and moisture retention for the grazing conditions assessed. Differences in those key driving variables may help explain surface hydrology responses to goat grazing in rangeland soils of Tamaulipan thornscrub ecosystems and possibly on similar rangelands around the world. Clear signs of vegetation degradation were also observed, manifested by a loss in species diversity and plant cover, especially under heavy grazing. This reflects unsustainable livestock management practices that should be avoided. This study contributes to improve our understanding of rangeland degradation processes and justifies devising more sustainable grazing management schemes.

AB  - 1. Conservation and restoration strategies require knowledge of the autecology of target species. The thick-shelled river mussel Unio crassus is an endangered freshwater bivalve with largely unknown habitat preferences. In this study, hydrological and substrate parameters including shear stress, flow velocity and penetration resistance of substrate were examined in relation to mussel presence/absence data in six streams with recruiting and self-sustaining populations to derive information on the hydrological and substrate habitat requirements of the species. 2. Mean flow velocities between 0.11 and 0.31ms(-1) and absolute maximum values in the study streams ranging from 0.22 to 0.95ms(-1) indicate that the species is tolerant of a wide range of hydrological conditions. 3. Areas with high mussel densities were characterized by low flow velocities (< 0.3ms(-1)), low mean penetration resistances (0.36 +/- 0.52 kg cm(-2)) as well as by low near-bed shear stress (1.06 +/- 0.33 x 10 +/- 6 N cm(-2)) compared with non-colonized sites. 4. Maximum near-bed flow velocity at mussel beds was 0.33ms(-1) and 0.35ms(-1) at 60% depth. Higher flows with maximum velocities of 0.52ms(-1) and 0.95ms(-1) at 60% depth were measured at non-colonized sites. Mussel density was significantly negatively correlated with near-bed shear forces. 5. The results indicate that the hydrological and substrate characteristics of U. crassus habitat are broader than expected. In contrast to the assumption that it depends on moderate to high flows (> 0.3ms(-1)), streams with low water flow and soft substrate were also identified as suitable habitats. 6. Functional characteristics of the substrate, especially stability and areas with low shear stress (< 1.5 Ncm(-2)), seem to be of great importance for the persistence of the species, and monitoring protocols used at present for habitat assessment of U. crassus should be updated.

AB  - In this work, we develop a data-driven method for the diagnosis of damage in mesoscale mechanical structures using an array of distributed sensor networks. The proposed approach relies on comparing intrinsic geometries of data sets corresponding to the undamaged and damaged states of the system. We use a spectral diffusion map approach to identify the intrinsic geometry of the data set. In particular, time series data from distributed sensors is used for the construction of diffusion maps. The low dimensional embedding of the data set corresponding to different damage levels is obtained using a singular value decomposition of the diffusion map. We construct appropriate metrics in the diffusion space to compare the different data sets corresponding to different damage cases. The developed algorithm is applied for damage diagnosis of wind turbine blades. To achieve this goal, we developed a detailed finite element-based model of CX-100 blade in ANSYS using shell elements. Typical damage, such as crack or delamination, will lead to a loss of stiffness, is modeled by altering the stiffness of the laminate layer. One of the main challenges in the development of health monitoring algorithms is the ability to use sensor data with a relatively small signal-to-noise ratio. Our developed diffusion map-based algorithm is shown to be robust to the presence of sensor noise. The proposed diffusion map-based algorithm is advantageous by enabling the comparison of data from numerous sensors of similar or different types of data through data fusion, hereby making it attractive to exploit the distributed nature of sensor arrays. This distributed nature is further exploited for the purpose of damage localization. We perform extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully determine the extent of damage on the wind turbine blade and also localize the damage. We also present preliminary results for the application of the developed algorithm on the experimental data. These preliminary results obtained using experimental data are promising and is a topic of our ongoing investigation.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been increased interest in the subjective quality of life (QoL) of patients with bronchial asthma. QoL is a significant indicator guiding the efforts of professionals caring for patients, especially chronically ill ones. The identification of factors affecting the QoL reported by patients, despite their existing condition, is important and useful to provide multidisciplinary care for these patients.
   Aim: To investigate the clinical factors affecting asthma patients' QoL.
   Methods: The study comprised 100 patients (73 female, 27 male) aged 18-84 years (mean age was 45.7) treated in the Allergy Clinic of the Wroclaw Medical University Department and Clinic of Internal Diseases, Geriatrics and Allergology. All asthma patients meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate. Data on sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected. In this study, we used medical record analysis and two questionnaires: the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) to assess the QoL of patients with asthma and the Asthma Control Test to measure asthma control.
   Results: Active smokers were shown to have a significantly lower QoL in the "Symptoms" domain than nonsmokers (P=0.006). QoL was also demonstrated to decrease significantly as the frequency of asthma exacerbations increased (R=-0.231, P=0.022). QoL in the domain "Activity limitation" was shown to increase significantly along with the number of years of smoking (R=0.404; P=0.004). Time from onset and the dominant symptom of asthma significantly negatively affected QoL in the "Activity limitation" domain of the AQLQ (R=-0.316, P=0.001; P=0.029, respectively). QoL scores in the "Emotional function" and "Environmental stimuli" subscale of the AQLQ decreased significantly as time from onset increased (R=-0.200, P=0.046; R=-0.328, P=0.001, respectively).
   Conclusion: Patients exhibiting better symptom control have higher QoL scores. Asthma patients' QoL decreases as time from onset increases. A lower QoL is reported by patients who visit allergy clinics more often, and those often hospitalized due to asthma. Smoking also contributes to a lower QoL in asthma patients.

AB  - The effects of cold shock on fish have rarely been assessed in sub-tropical regions despite the fact that such events can occur as a result of upwelling, storms, or other climactic events that are expected to increase as a result of global environmental change. Here, the sub-lethal physiological and behavioural consequences of cold shock on bonefish (Albula vulpes) were assessed using four treatment groups (control, handled control, 7 degrees C below ambient, and 14 degrees C below ambient conditions; n = 8 fish/treatment). The control and handled control remained at ambient temperature (similar to 24 degrees C) while other treatments were exposed to a 2 h cold shock. Handled controls were treated with the same handling procedures as cold shock treatments, while control fish were less disturbed. Ventilation rate and reflex indicators (e.g., equilibrium, response to stimuli) were recorded throughout the experiment, and swimming ability was evaluated 2 h after cold shock exposure. A blood sample was taken after the cold shock exposure and 2 h following the swimming assessment to quantify glucose and lactate concentrations, hematocrit and pH in whole blood, and cortisol titers from spun plasma. Bonefish exposed to 14 degrees C below ambient temperature experienced elevated lactate concentrations and high reflex impairment, with the majority of fish losing equilibrium <30 min into exposure. During cold shock exposure, ventilation rates were significantly lower in the 7 degrees C below ambient treatment than in the handled control. After cold shock exposure, swimming ability decreased as the magnitude of cold shock increased, however, it was also depressed in the handled control relative to unhandled controls. Exposure to 14 degrees C below ambient temperatures had significant physiological and behavioural impacts on bonefish, while 7 degrees C below ambient had little effect.

AB  - Although elevation data are globally available and used in many existing hydrological models, their information content is still underexploited. Topography is closely related to geology, soil, climate and land cover. As a result, it may reflect the dominant hydrological processes in a catchment. In this study, we evaluated this hypothesis through four progressively more complex conceptual rainfall-runoff models. The first model (FLEXL) is lumped, and it does not make use of elevation data. The second model (FLEXD) is semidistributed with different parameter sets for different units. This model uses elevation data indirectly, taking spatially variable drivers into account. The third model (FLEXT0), also semi-distributed, makes explicit use of topography information. The structure of FLEXT0 consists of four parallel components representing the distinct hydrological function of different landscape elements. These elements were determined based on a topography-based landscape classification approach. The fourth model (FLEXT) has the same model structure and parameterization as FLEXT0 but uses realism constraints on parameters and fluxes. All models have been calibrated and validated at the catchment outlet. Additionally, the models were evaluated at two sub-catchments. It was found that FLEXT0 and FLEXT perform better than the other models in nested sub-catchment validation and they are therefore better spatially transferable. Among these two models, FLEXT performs better than FLEXT0 in transferability. This supports the following hypotheses: (1) topography can be used as an integrated indicator to distinguish between landscape elements with different hydrological functions; (2) FLEXT0 and FLEXT are much better equipped to represent the heterogeneity of hydrological functions than a lumped or semi-distributed model, and hence they have a more realistic model structure and parameterization; (3) the soft data used to constrain the model parameters and fluxes in FLEXT are useful for improving model transferability. Most of the precipitation on the forested hillslopes evaporates, thus generating relatively little runoff.

AB  - Using monsoonal and arid Central Asia as a case study, we have compiled lake level information from proxy records for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and compared these to the simulated hydrologic cycle from four 21 ka model experiments completed for the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project, phase 2 (PMIP2). Our new review of proxy records indicates that lake levels were nearly all lower at LGM compared to the pre-industrial across Asia. This water-balance pattern is largely reproduced by all four models and results from decreased precipitation during the LGM. An offline lake energy balance model forced with output from the PMIP2 models shows that lake evaporation also significantly decreased at LGM, but that in most areas the change in lake evaporation is overshadowed by changes in precipitation. Based on the model experiments, higher LGM lake levels only existed in the dryland regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and north of monsoonal East Asia (similar to 45 degrees N, similar to 90-120 degrees E), which differs from previous studies that suggested that higher lake levels prevailed during the LGM in western China and arid Central Asia. A detailed atmospheric water budget analysis performed with output from the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) indicates that a combination of atmospheric dynamics (i.e., convergence) and thermodynamics (i.e., the Clausius-Clayperon relationship) were responsible for decreases in LGM precipitation in Siberia and monsoonal Asia. Our results support the idea that monsoonal Asia will become wetter in the future due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, though more than atmospheric thermodynamics may be at play. The situation is more complex for arid Central Asia, though current trends towards wetter conditions there might be consistent with the pattern we observe and model for LGM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many models exist in the scientific literature for determining indoor daylighting values. They are classified in three categories: numerical, simplified and empirical models. Nevertheless, each of these categories of models are not convenient for every application. Indeed, the numerical model requires high calculation time: conditions of use of the simplified models are limited, and experimental models need not only important financial resources but also a perfect control of experimental devices (e.g. scale model), as well as climatic characteristics of the location (e.g. in situ experiment).
   In this article, a new model based on a combination of multiple simplified models is established. The objective is to improve this category of model. The originality of our paper relies on the coupling of several simplified models of indoor daylighting calculations. The accuracy of the simulation code, introduced into CODYRUN software to simulate correctly indoor illuminance, is then verified.
   Besides, the software consists of a numerical building simulation code, developed in the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment (PIMENT) at the University of Reunion.
   Initially dedicated to the thermal, airflow and hydrous phenomena in the buildings, the software has been completed for the calculation of indoor daylighting. New models and algorithms - which rely on a semi-detailed approach - will be presented in this paper.
   In order to validate the accuracy of the integrated models, many test cases have been considered as analytical, inter-software comparisons and experimental comparisons. In order to prove the accuracy of the new model - which can properly simulate the illuminance - a confrontation between the results obtained from the software (developed in this research paper) and the major made at a given place is described in details. A new statistical indicator to appreciate the margins of errors. - named RSD (Reliability of Software Degrees) - is also be defined.
   The objective is not only to develop an efficient research tool to improve visual comfort and reduce energy consumption, but also to transfer the knowledge through these decision-making aids tools to patricians and decision makers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Andosols, available P for crops is limited primarily by sorption and precipitation processes, but application of organic materials may improve the P availability by enhancing organic P mineralization. A field study was conducted during 2005-2007 on a Silandic Andosol in Fukushima, Japan, to investigate whether and how applications of composted cattle manure (0, 61, and 122 or 183 kg P ha(-1)) and/or cover-crop residue (no cover crop, rapeseed, and cereal rye) would improve P availability to soybean. Cover crops were grown over winter and incorporated into the soil 2 weeks before compost application. Soybean P uptake at flowering was improved by application of compost and/or rye residue. Bray-2 soil P (i.e., readily soluble and desorbable P) increased only in the compost treatment. Soil phosphatase activity and microbial P, both representing the potential of P mineralization, were enhanced in treatments with compost and rye. Rapeseed had minor effects on the soil P parameters. Soil nematode community structure was evaluated as an indicator for soil conditions including decomposition pathways. Compost application increased free-living nematodes, especially fungal-feeding nematodes, implying that fungal decomposition dominated in the soil. The increase in free-living nematodes was less pronounced in the cover-crop treatments than in the compost treatment; only bacterial-feeding nematodes consistently increased after the rye treatment. The different changes in the community composition of soil nematodes and the P parameters indicate that the use of a rye cover crop affected P availability to soybean differently to compost application. The density of Pratylenchidae, the prevailing plant feeder in the soil investigated, declined in the treatments with compost and rye, but increased in the rapeseed treatment. The feeding activity of Pratylenchidae may also have affected root growth and consequently P uptake by soybean. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluoxetine has been tested in a two-species water-sediment system, which allowed a two-generation study with Chironomus riparius and a partial life-cycle with the freshwater snail Physa acuta to be performed at the same time. The design considered the continuous application of fluoxetine to overlaying water for nominal concentrations of 31.25, 62.5, 125 and 250 mu g/L. A fifth treatment (87.5 mu g/L) level consisted of pulse applications once a week. Measures of water and sediment concentrations were determined once a week and at the end of experiment (day 44), respectively. The fate study demonstrated that water dissipation can be explained by partitioning of fluoxetine to sediment. At the end of experiment, the percentage of detected fluoxetine was up to 10-fold higher in sediment than in overlaying water. The employed two-species test allowed distinguishing, in the same exposure conditions, effects due to waterborne exposure together ingestion at the sediment surface (freshwater grazing snail P. acuta) and exposure by burrowing activities (sediment-dwelling insect larvae C. riparius). The effect assessment showed a stimulation of P. acuta reproduction at lower concentrations (31.25 and 62.5 mu g/L), while the opposite effect was observed at the highest treatment (250 mu g/L). Additional studies should be conducted to establish if the statistically significant differences observed in F0 sex ratio at the 62.5 mu g/L and F1 adult emergence at 31.25 mu g/L of C. riparius have a toxicological significance. This study showed that fluoxetine can affect reproduction of freshwater molluscs. The results of the present study may contribute to knowledge on ecotoxicology of pharmaceuticals, about which little data is available. The possible consequences and implications for targeting the environmental risk assessment of fluoxetine are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infestation of forests by the Little Spruce Sawfly Pristiphora abietina (CHRIST), (Hym. Tenthr.) results in losses of increment, deformation of spruce (Picea abies KARST.) crowns and, in the worst case, in tree mortality.
   Ln many parts of Europe artificial spruce stands are endangered by outbreaks of this primary pest and the feeding of larvae on the young shoots. The only adequate long term instrument for avoiding mass outbreaks are preventive silvicultural measures. Their realisation affords knowledge about environmental conditions that faciliate epidemics and about the localisation of endangered stands. The aim of the present paper was to select parameters, which concern the probability of an infestation and are suitable as agents of a risk assessing system. The analysis is based on the most recent developments in research and on meteorological data. The following variables have high indicative quality regarding the risk of infestation of a stand by the Little Spruce Sawfly: altitude a.s.l., the average yearly precipitation, the average precipitation of the months June to August, base saturation, humus form, deposition of nitrogen, stand composition especially the percentage of spruce - and composition of ground vegetation. These parameters were integrated in a checklist that supports an estimation of the susceptibility of forest sites and stands against outbreaks of P. abietina (tab. 1). The system is based on the assignment of award or penalty points in case of appropriate indicators. The risk assessment can be carried out either for a forest site or a forest stand, thus site related risks can be distinguished from risks according to stand composition and structure. In case of high predisposition of a forest stand regarding I! abietina, specific silvicultural measures help minimize the risk of infestation. Pls a further step the results of the present paper can be applied to a digitalized information system. The mapping of "risk areas" in relation to site factors would lead to new possibilities in the prophylaxis of P. abietina-out-breaks.

AB  - Soil samples were collected to a depth of IO cm in 1991 and 1993 from a vegetable crop rotation experiment initiated in 1989. The two cropping treatments, with either 0 or 280 kg N ha(-1), represented the traditional vegetable rotation (TVR) and an alternative legume vegetable rotation (LVR) when a vegetable crop alternated with a red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) seed-crop that was incorporated as green manure in the following spring. The enzyme activities of L-asparaginase, amidase and beta-glucosidase were determined on whole soil and five soil aggregate size fractions: 1.00-2.00, 0.50-1.00, 0.25-0.50, 0.10-0.25 and <0.1 mm. Thermal stability of the enzymes was determined by conditioning soil samples at 85 degrees C for 2 h or by exposing soil samples to five successive freeze-thaw cycles prior to enzyme assays. Enzyme activities for LVR were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than TVR for beta-glucosidase and amidase at both N-rates in 1991. This difference in activity for these enzymes was sustained only at the high N-rate in 1993. The activity of L-asparaginase was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the LVR in 1993. Sixty to seventy percent of the soil enzyme activity (on a mass basis) was associated with macroaggregates with specific distribution of activity across aggregate fractions varying with enzyme. Average beta-glucosidase activity decreased by 50% from 1991 to 1993. In contrast, amidase activity increased 1.43-fold over the same period. beta-glucosidase activity was sensitive to temporal trends, showing proportional decreases in activities in each system that were consistent with decreases in organic C. Furthermore, beta-glucosidase activity showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) resistance to heat-induced thermal stress in the LVR in both sampling years. Amidase and L-asparaginase activities showed no such treatment effects. The results showed that soil enzyme activity is a sensitive biological indicator of the effects of soil management practices.

AB  - Cretaceous continental sediments in Sichuan Basin, China, have different colors, and the reasons for their formation are not determined. Based on mineralogical and geochemical characteristics, red beds and nonred beds in the Upper and Lower Cretaceous sedimentary strata in the western Sichuan Basin are described and tested in this study. The test and analysis of the mineral composition, element content, and iron speciation of mudstone samples with gray-green, gray, and red colors in Cangxi, Bailong, and Guankou formations found that the change in hematite content directly causes the color difference of samples. For red mudstone, the average chemical index of alteration, chemical index of weathering, weather eluviation index (Ba), Ca/(Mg*Al), and Al2O3/SiO2 index are 67.75, 79.94, 2.07, 0.26, and 0.26, respectively, indicating that chemical weathering is the most intense. The geochemical indexes corresponding to gray samples are 64.41, 74.91, 2.08, 0.19, and 0.24, respectively. Those corresponding to the gray-green samples are 62.30, 70.68, 2.17, 0.21, and 0.24, with the weakest chemical weathering. The ratio of Cu/Zn and the enrichment factor of V show that red and nonred bed samples are formed in weak oxidation and weak reduction environments, respectively. The red sample contains the highest content of hematite iron. The gray-green sample mainly represents paramagnetic ferrous in clay minerals. The geochemical contents of the gray sample's three iron elements are slightly different, mainly trivalent iron. The change in iron speciation content in different color samples shows that the Fe element forming hematite in red bed samples may come from the weathering of source rock and clay minerals subjected to secondary weathering. At present, it is confirmed that different colors of samples are related to different weathering degrees of source rocks, which can be related to hot, dry/humid climates. It is necessary to distinguish the climate type in combination with other indicators.

AB  - Research background: The paper investigates the earnings management phenomenon in the context of Central European countries, attempting to identify the factors and incentives that can influence earnings management behavior on a sample of 8,156 enterprises from Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.
   Purpose of the article: The main purpose of the manuscript is to prove that there are significant differences in earnings management practices (measured by discretionary accruals) across the countries and to find the firm-specific features that influence the way enterprises manage their earnings.
   Methods: The modified Jones model was used to calculate the discretionary accruals, which are further analyzed across the countries. The statistically significant differences were confirmed across the countries. Thus, the impact of the economic sector, firm size, firm age, legal form, and ownership structure on earnings management behavior is studied by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc tests then revealed the significant differences across the categories of the investigated earnings management determinants. To find the association between the particu- lar earnings management practice (income-increasing or income-decreasing manipulation), corre- spondence analysis was used to visualize the mutual relations.
   Findings & value added: The results of the realized investigation revealed that the economic sector is one of the most important earnings management determinants, as its statistical signifi- cance was confirmed in each analyzed country. The correspondence analysis determined specific sectors, where income-increasing manipulation with earnings is practiced (NACE codes F, J, K, M, N), and vice versa, income-decreasing earnings management is characteristic for enterprises in sectors A, C, D, G or L. In specific economic conditions, firm size is also a relevant indicator (Hungary), or firm age and legal form and ownership structure (Poland). The recognition of crucial earnings management incentives may be helpful for authorities, policymakers, analysts and auditors when identifying various techniques and practices of earnings manipulation which could vary across the sectors and taking necessary measures to mitigate potential financial risks.

AB  - Background National and international institutions periodically demand information on forest indicators that are used for global reporting. Among other aspects, the carbon accumulated in the biomass of forest species must be reported. For this purpose, one of the main sources of data is the National Forest Inventory (NFI), which together with statistical empirical approaches and updating procedures can even allow annual estimates of the requested indicators. Methods Stand level biomass models, relating the dry weight of the biomass with the stand volume were developed for the five main pine species in the Iberian Peninsula (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus pinea, Pinus halepensis, Pinus nigra and Pinus pinaster). The dependence of the model on aridity and/or mean tree size was explored, as well as the importance of including the stand form factor to correct model bias. Furthermore, the capability of the models to estimate forest carbon stocks, updated for a given year, was also analysed. Results The strong relationship between stand dry weight biomass and stand volume was modulated by the mean tree size, although the effect varied among the five pine species. Site humidity, measured using the Martonne aridity index, increased the biomass for a given volume in the cases of Pinus sylvestris, Pinus halepensis and Pinus nigra. Models that consider both mean tree size and stand form factor were more accurate and less biased than those that do not. The models developed allow carbon stocks in the main Iberian Peninsula pine forests to be estimated at stand level with biases of less than 0.2 Mg center dot ha(- 1). Conclusions The results of this study reveal the importance of considering variables related with environmental conditions and stand structure when developing stand dry weight biomass models. The described methodology together with the models developed provide a precise tool that can be used for quantifying biomass and carbon stored in the Spanish pine forests in specific years when no field data are available.

AB  - Background and objectives: The Australian Defence Force (ADF) engages in combat-related activities in hot climatic conditions, which exposes ADF members to the threat of exertional heat illness (EHI). After an episode of EHI, the heat tolerance test (HTT) is conducted to determine heat tolerance. Heat intolerance is the inability to maintain thermal balance while exercising in a hot environment. This study investigated the predictive roles of individual characteristics (age, gender, aerobic capacity (VO(2)max) and body composition) on physiological responses to the HTT in a group comprising ADF personnel and civilian volunteers. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used and 52 (38 males and 14 females) participants were recruited from the ADF and the general population for the HTT. Heat intolerance was defined following the standard criteria for the HTT (temperature and heart rate). Data were analysed using inferential statistics. Results: The mean age of the participants was 31.1 +/- 11.6 years, and 44% (23 people: 19 males and 4 females) of the participants were heat intolerant. Independent samples T-test showed that body mass index (p = 0.011) and body fat% (p = 0.034) of heat-intolerant participants were significantly higher than their heat-tolerant counterparts. Body surface area to mass ratio (p = 0.005) and aerobic capacity (p = 0.001) were significantly lower in heat-intolerant participants. Regression analyses showed that age, gender, aerobic capacity and body fat% were significant (p < 0.001) predictors of heat tolerance outcomes, with R-2 values ranging from 0.505 to 0.636. Conclusions: This study showed that aerobic capacity, body fat%, age and gender are predictors of heat intolerance among military and non-military populations. However, there may be a need for future studies to consider identifying other indicators such as clinical biomarkers of heat intolerance, which could be used to develop a more reliable HTT protocol.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are driven by different global change factors, such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition and precipitation reduction. Nitrogen deposition and precipitation reduction have a great impact on the aboveand underground processes. Most previous studies mainly focused on the effects of nitrogen deposition and/or precipitation reduction on aboveground processes, while the effects on underground processes were relatively scarce. As an important part of the underground soil food web, soil nematode community occupies different nutritional niches and is sensitive to external disturbances, and it is often used as indicator for studying underground processes. However, we know little about the response of soil nematode community to nitrogen deposition and/or precipitation reduction. Here, we used a 10-year of factorial manipulation by applying nitrogen solution and reducing the amount of precipitation to the soil, and to investigate the responses of soil nematode community to nitrogen deposition and/or precipitation reduction in a temperate forest. We expected that nitrogen addition could promote while precipitation inhibited the activity of soil nematode community. Furthermore, we expected nitrogen addition and precipitation could have interactive effect on soil nematode community. Our results found that nitrogen addition and/or precipitation reduction treatment caused significant changes in the composition of soil nematode community. Nitrogen addition and nitrogen addition combined with precipitation reduction induced negative effects and significantly decreased the abundance and diversity of soil nematode community, while precipitation reduction only decreased the abundance of soil nematode community. Nitrogen addition and precipitation reduction had synergistic effect on soil nematode community with higher trophic levels. Compared with precipitation reduction treatment, the negative effect of nitrogen addition on soil nematode community was more severe. According to the structural equation model (SEM), we found that nitrogen addition and precipitation reduction could affect the abundance of soil nematode community by affecting the plant richness and soil pH. Since the decrease of enrichment index (EI) and the increase of structure index (SI), our research results revealed that nitrogen addition could lead to soil food web in a lower nutrients available condition.

AB  - While the Middle East and North African (MENA) region is facing challenges to sustain water security, water reclamation has received increasing consideration as a favorable mitigating solution. Despite the availability of adequate technologies, economic, political, legal, social, and environmental constraints often hamper stakeholders, and especially decision makers, from exploiting the existing potential into solution implementation. In the present paper, a comprehensive assessment for water reclamation and reuse was developed. This assessment consisted of 4 objectives: 1) apply a decision-support tool (DST) for water reclamation potential for municipal wastewater, 2) apply a DST for simulating and estimating the lifecycle costs of project-related technologies for water reclamation (municipal and industrial wastewater, as well as drainage canal water), 3) assess the national-level conditions for water reuse with a multicriteria decision analysis (MCA), and 4) establish exemplary strategies, barriers, and measures for water reuse. The present MCA considered 6 thematic subjects: policy and institution, economy, society, water management, legislation, and environment. The assessment was applied to food and nonfood crop irrigation in Egyptian, Moroccan, and Tunisian case studies. For all defined case studies, adapted treatment trains that could treat wastewater to the desired quality at reasonable costs were identified and are presented in the present paper. Results showed that technological options are available for water reuse, but the concept is not widely implemented in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. The present paper identifies key barriers and drivers for the implementation of water reclamation for irrigation. In particular, the considered countries showed different characteristics regarding efficient water management, water pricing, subsidies and wastewater tariffs, implementation of monitoring and reporting systems, or legal aspects regarding the use of reclaimed water for food crop irrigation. Further exploration of case studies on high potential water reuse and financially affordable wastewater reclamation, particularly case studies that explore the impacts of policies and practices across countries, would be useful for helping the MENA region improve their water security situation.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-13.

AB  - Severe and persistent bottom-water hypoxia (<= 2 mg O-2 L-1) occurs on the Louisiana/Texas continental shelf from mid-May through mid-September over a large area (up to 23,000 km(2) in mid-summer). Benthic infauna are less mobile than demersal organisms and become stressed by the low dissolved oxygen; benthic community composition, abundance, diversity, and biomass become altered. From the 1950s to the early 1970s, when sediment core indicators identified the initiation and subsequent worsening of dissolved oxygen conditions, there were no hydrographic data or benthic infaunal studies within the current area of frequent bottom-water hypoxia. This study highlights the impacts of severe hypoxia on benthic macroinfaunal communities and how they may have changed from less-hypoxic periods. Polychaetes were and are the dominant taxa in the available studies, but polychaete species richness in summer is now curtailed severely beginning with our 1985-1986 data. Species richness of polychaetes in summer hypoxia (1985-1986 and 1990-1991) was about 60% less than comparable taxa in 1972-1973. Abundance of polychaetes was much less in summer than spring, and recent infaunal biomass in summer was only 15% of what was found in spring. The result is less prey for demersal penaeid shrimp and fishes. Over the period of our comparison, infaunal feeding modes shifted from subsurface deposit feeders and surface deposit feeders to primarily surface deposit feeders (i.e., 95.5% of all polychaetes). Most were opportunistic, hypoxia tolerant, and recruited in high numbers following hypoxia abatement, some in fall and winter but most in spring. As benthic communities succumb to the stress of severe and continued seasonal low oxygen, they occupy the few upper centimeters of the sediment profile above the redox discontinuity layer with negative feedbacks to the water column by way of altered biogeochemical processes.

AB  - Accurate diagnosis of incipient faults in wind turbine (WT) assets will provide sufficient lead time to apply an optimal maintenance for the expensive WT assets which often are located in a remote and harsh environment and their maintenance usually needs heavy equipment and highly skilled engineers. This paper presents an online bearing clearance monitoring approach to diagnose the change of bearing clearance, providing an early and interpretable indication of bearing health conditions. A novel dynamic load distribution method is developed to efficiently gain the general characteristics of vibration response of bearings without local defects but with small geometric errors. It shows that the ball pass frequency of outer race (BPFO) is the primary exciting source due to biased load distribution relating to bearing clearance. The geometric errors, including various orders of runouts on different bearing parts, can be the secondary excitation source. Both sources lead to compound modulation responses with very low amplitudes, being more than 20 dB lower than that of a small local defect on raceways and often buried by background noise. Then, Modulation Signal Bispectrum (MSB) is identified to purify the noisy signal and Gini index is introduced to represent the peakness of MSB results, thereby an interpretable indicator bounded between 0 and 1 is established to show bearing clearance status. Datasets from both a dedicated bearing test and a run-to-failure gearbox test are employed to verify the performance and reliability of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed method is capable to indicate a change of about 20 mu m in bearing clearance online, which provides a significantly long lead time compared to the diagnosis method that focuses only on local defects. Therefore, this method provides a big opportunity to implement more cost-effective maintenance works or carry out timely remedial actions to prolong the lifespan of bearings. Obviously, it is applicable to not only WT assets, but also most rotating machines.

AB  - To predict the I-V characteristics of the photovoltaic module, five parameters photovoltaic model Abstract: To predict the I-V characteristics of the photovoltaic module, five parameters photovoltaic model was utilized. The most influential parameters in the photovoltaic module are the solar irradiance level (E) and the temperature (T). The present research was conducted due to the high-temperature values in Ouargla city (can reach 60 degrees C in the hot season), which will affect remarkably the installed PV installations in this region. The experimental was done in several days cause the investigation need a constant irradiance values with different temperature. The temperature of a photovoltaic module varies according to other conditions, the temperature measurements made on the rear face of the PV module may not be indicative due to a temperature gradient in the material of the rear face of the module. Unfortunately, photovoltaic systems manufacturers do not take into consideration these environmental circumstances which negatively influence the module parameters and yielded deterioration in the system efficiency. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the temperature term on the electrical performances such as the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc), optimal power (Pm) and Fill Factor. The temperature distribution is non-uniform temperature on the surface of PV modules joined to that of the quality of temperature measurements affects the values of temperature coefficients found. To validate a model allows the researcher to get approximately the I-V characteristic similar to the experiment values. It use the conventional technique (Newton Raphson method) and it was compared by an artificial intelligent method which is the PSO technique, the five parameters estimated (Iph, Is, R-s, R-p, n). This proposed approach can be utilized to model any marketable PV module based on given datasheet parameters only. Statistical indicators were adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models; where the relative error of the PSO method comes more less the conventional method.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is a serious pollutant of water bodies. Its presence in water can cause severe health problems in humans and may also induce serious toxicological effects in aquatic organisms. Euglena gracilis, a unicellular freshwater flagellate, is considered very sensitive to environmental pollutants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the responses of different parameters in E. gracilis toward arsenite (As-III) toxicity and to assess As-III removal potential of E. gracilis from water by calculating bio-concentration factor (BCF). Under the optimized experimental conditions (0.1 to 10mgL(-1) of As-III, (pH6.8) 7-day exposure), various parameters of E. gracilis like cell growth, motility, cell velocity (speed), cell shape, gravitactic orientation, biochemical parameters, and oxidative-stress markers were measured as endpoints. The experimental results showed that cell growth and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b, and total carotenoids) were significantly affected at higher concentrations of As-III, while slight stimulation was observed in motility, orientation, and cell compactness of E. gracilis. Similarly, an increase was observed in total soluble protein and sugar content which can be regarded as a protective strategy in response of As-III stress. The adverse effects of As-III in E. gracilis can be attributed to oxidative stress as revealed by the results for oxidative markers. E. gracilis removed 13.3% of As-III from the medium with a calculated 0.27mg As-III g(-1) DW of E. gracilis. The calculated BCF, an index of the potential of accumulating metal/metalloids, in this study was 27 showing E. gracilis as accumulator but not hyper-accumulator of As-III. It is concluded that cell growth and photosynthetic pigments in E. gracilis were adversely affected by As-III and can be used as indicators of the adverse effects of As-III to aquatic autotrophs. E. gracilis can be recommended as accumulator (but not hyper-accumulator) for removal of As-III from water.

AB  - Unsustainable wildlife trade affects biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities dependent upon those resources. Wildlife farming has been proposed to promote sustainable trade, but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behavior remain neglected but essential steps in the design and evaluation of such operations. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands, where turtles have been farm raised for human consumption for almost 50 years, as a case study to explore consumer preferences toward wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment through in-person interviews from September to December 2014. Households were randomly selected using disproportionate stratified sampling, and responses were weighted based on district population size. We approached 597 individuals, of which 37 (6.2%) refused to participate. Although 30% of households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was rare (e.g., 64-742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat [i.e., 0.3-3.5% of households] but represented a large threat to wild turtles in the area due to their reduced populations). Differences among groups of consumers were marked, as identified through choice experiments, and price and source of product played important roles in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtles, 13.5% of consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, which demonstrates the limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a combination of indirect questioning, choice experiments, and sales data to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behavior that can be used to develop conservation-demand-focused initiatives. Lack of data from long-term social-ecological assessments hinders the evaluation of and learning from wildlife farming. This information is key to understanding under which conditions different interventions (e.g., bans, wildlife farming, social marketing) are likely to succeed.

AB  - High environmental temperature is a major constraint in sheep production under semi-arid tropical environment. Behavior is the earliest indicator of animal's adaptation and responses to the environmental alteration. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of high ambient temperature on the behavior of sheep under a semi-arid tropical environment. The experiment was conducted for 6 weeks on 16 Malpura cross (Garole x Malpura x Malpura (GMM)) rams. The rams were divided equally into two groups, designated as C and T. The rams of C were kept in comfortable environmental conditions served as control. The rams of T were exposed to a different temperature at different hours of the day in a climatic chamber, to simulate a high environmental temperature of summer in semi-arid tropic. The behavioral observations were taken by direct instantaneous observation at 15-min intervals for each animal individually. The feeding, ruminating, standing, and lying behaviors were recorded twice a week from morning (0800 hours) to afternoon (1700 hours) for 6 weeks. Exposure of rams to high temperature (T) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the proportion of time spent in feeding during the observation period in most of the hours of the day as compared to the C. The proportion of time spent in rumination and lying was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the T group compared to the C. The animals of T spent significantly (P < 0.05) more time in rumination in standing position as compared to the C. The overall proportion of time spent in standing, panting in each hour, and total panting time was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the T as compared to the C. The result of the study indicates that the exposure of sheep to high ambient temperature severely modulates the behavior of sheep which is directed to circumvent the effect of the stressor.

AB  - The article analyzes the position of the sociology of religion in Russian education system. Sociology of religion is considered as study of the social manifestations of religion, carried out by means of quantitative and qualitative methods, which is conducted on theoretical, empirical and applied levels of scientific knowledge. The principle of the sociology of religion - any religious phenomenon must be considered from the intention to figure out social meaning in the actions of followers of religious doctrines, rituals, organizations in the structures of society. Sociology of religion combines two interrelated research areas: 1) research what is happening in religious communities, with characteristics of subjects of religious institutions and religious practices in their quantitative and qualitative indicators; 2) research of the conditions and circumstances of existence of religious associations in the social space. All these research tasks require a high level of professional training of specialists in sociology of religion.
   The author has considered the possible content of the training courses on the sociology of religion and posed the question of the relationship between sociology and religious studies in the training of specialists in the sociology of religion. To his mind, one of the important reasons for the weak development of the sociology of religion in Russia is the marginality of teaching this subject in high school. It is shown that the existing scientific and educational literature on the sociology of religion promotes awareness of this area of knowledge, but is not training in techniques and methods of the sociological study of religion. The author speaks critically about the confessional approach in the sociology of religion, evaluating this approach as limited and unproductive. It is concluded that in Russia there is a growing gap between objective necessity of sociological study of the dynamically changing situation around religion in the public space of modern society and the modest presence of sociologists of religion who are professionally engaged in research and expert work in this field.

AB  - A transition to a solar-based carbon neutral economy is crucial to reduce the overall ecological footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while providing new housing for the growing urban population worldwide. One of the key measures to achieve such reductions as a way to mitigate and adapt to climate change is to increase food and energy self-sufficiency in residential areas. The objective of this study is to explore the potential self-sufficiency in terms of food and energy in generic residential districts in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Computational tools are employed to obtain quantifiable indicators based on sunlight availability. A series of building typologies and urban forms was created as abstractions from actual residential developments in Singapore (1.3 degrees N). In total, 57 cases were assessed in terms of sunlight availability and the impact of three density and geometry parameters: plot ratio, site coverage and building height were considered. Results from selected cases were compared to Hanoi's conditions (21 degrees N).
   The results show that the indicators having the higher impact on the food and energy self-sufficiency are plot ratio and building height. The cases with the lowest plot ratio (PR < 1.9) achieved food self-sufficiency when a hybrid higher-yield farming method was applied. Regarding energy harvesting, the cases with the lowest building height (<42 m) achieve energy self-sufficiency due to the maximum exposed area with PV per number of residents. In low-latitude regions, solar access is more evenly distributed among all facade orientations than in higher latitudes, therefore providing all facade orientations with food and energy harvesting potential. Food and energy self-sufficiency in equatorial regions is more heavily influenced by the available farming and PV area in relation to the total population than by the reduction of sunlight availability due to building typology and morphology.

AB  - We aimed at quantifying the extent to which agricultural management practices linked to animal production and land use affect environmental outcomes at a larger scale. Two practices closely linked to farm environmental performance at a larger scale are farming intensity, often resulting in greater off-farm environmental impacts (land, non-renewable energy use etc.) associated with the production of imported inputs (e.g. concentrates, fertilizer); and the degree of self-sufficiency, i.e. the farm's capacity to produce goods from its own resources, with higher control over nutrient recycling and thus minimization of losses to the environment, often resulting in greater on-farm impacts (eutrophication, acidification etc.). We explored the relationship of these practices with farm environmental performance for 185 French specialized dairy farms. We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling to build, and relate, latent variables of environmental performance, intensification and self-sufficiency. Proxy indicators reflected the latent variables for intensification (milk yield/cow, use of maize silage etc.) and self-sufficiency (home-grown feed/total feed use, on-farm energy/total energy use etc.). Environmental performance was represented by an aggregate 'eco-efficiency' score per farm derived from a Data Envelopment Analysis model fed with LCA and farm output data. The dataset was split into two spatially heterogeneous (biophysical conditions, production patterns) regions. For both regions, eco-efficiency was significantly negatively related with milk yield/cow and the use of maize silage and imported concentrates. However, these results might not necessarily hold for intensive yet more self-sufficient farms. This requires further investigation with latent variables for intensification and self-sufficiency that do not largely overlap-a modelling challenge that occurred here. We conclude that the environmental 'sustainability' of intensive dairy farming depends on particular farming systems and circumstances, although we note that more self-sufficient farms may be preferable when they may benefit from relatively low land prices and agri-environment schemes aimed at maintaining grasslands.

AB  - Bed sediments of streams and rivers may store high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens. Due to resuspension events, these contaminants can be mobilized into the water column and affect overall water quality. Other bacterial indicators such as microbial source tracking (MST) markers, developed to determine potential sources of fecal contamination, can also be resuspended from bed sediments. The primary objective of this study was to predict occurrence of waterborne pathogens in water and streambed sediments using a simple statistical model that includes traditionally measured FIB, environmental parameters and source allocation, using MST markers as predictor variables. Synoptic sampling events were conducted during baseflow conditions downstream from agricultural (AG), forested (FORS), and wastewater pollution control plant (WPCP) land uses. Concentrations of FIB and MST markers were measured in water and sediments, along with occurrences of the enteric pathogens Campylobacter, Listeria and Salmonella, and the virulence gene that carries Shiga toxin, stx(2). Pathogens were detected in water more often than in underlying sediments. Shiga toxin was significantly related to land use, with concentrations of the ruminant marker selected as an independent variable that could correctly classify 76% and 64% of observed Shiga toxin occurrences in water and sediment, respectively. FIB concentrations and water quality parameters were also selected as independent variables that correctly classified Shiga toxin occurrences in water and sediment (54%-87%), and Salmonella occurrences in water (96%). Relationships between pathogens and indicator variables were generally inconsistent and no single indicator adequately described occurrence of all pathogens. Because of inconsistent relationships between individual pathogens and FIB/MST markers, incorporating a combination of FIB, water quality measurements, and MST markers may be the best way to assess microbial water quality in mixed land use systems.

AB  - Studies assessing impacts of industrial activities on wildlife typically examine population- or community-level responses. However, changes in measures such as species abundance or diversity are driven by cumulative responses of individuals to disturbance, and may take time to detect. Quantifying individual responses could allow us to foresee and mitigate future population declines resulting from industrial activities, while providing ecologically informative indices to assess quality of reclaimed land. We examined life-history and phenotypic traits of mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding on reclaimed copper mine lands in Canada over two years in comparison to a nearby undisturbed reference area. Bluebirds feed on terrestrial invertebrates, whereas swallows feed on adult forms of insects with aquatic larvae, allowing us to assess quality of both reclaimed terrestrial and aquatic systems as habitat for insectivorous birds. Supplemental feeding of bluebirds also was used to experimentally assess nutritional limitation of birds feeding on terrestrial invertebrates. Bluebirds on reclaimed land initiated clutches later, and in one year had lower fledging success compared to birds on the reference area. Tree swallows also bred later in the season on reclaimed land, but were otherwise comparable to or exceeded performance of birds on the reference area. Annual differences in responses of nestling bluebirds on the mine to supplemental feeding revealed an apparent switch in life-history strategy of parents between years, from brood reduction to brood survival, suggesting greater annual fluctuations in ecological conditions within terrestrial systems on reclaimed land. Sex differences in response of nestling bluebirds to food supplementation additionally suggested high within-brood competition for food on reclaimed land. We suggest that measures of avian life-history and phenotypic traits, particularly when assessed over multiple years using experimental approaches such as food supplementation, are informative and sensitive indices of the health of reclaimed terrestrial and aquatic systems.

AB  - While documenting the vegetation response to climatic changes in mountains, the use of grass phytolith data relies on the ability of phytolith assemblages or indices to differentiate the elevationally stratified vegetation zones. To infer the potential and limitations of grass phytolith assemblages and indices to reconstruct vegetation vis-a-vis climate in the Himalayan mountain regions, we analyzed phytolith assemblages from 66 dominant grasses and 153 surface soils from four different forest types along the c. 130-4000 m a.s.l. elevation gradients in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas. Grass short cell phytolith assemblages from modern grasses show significant variability with rising elevation. To test the reliability of the above observation, phytoliths from the soil samples were subjected to linear discriminant analysis (DA). DA classified 85.3% and 92.3% of the sites to their correct forest zones in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas respectively. Relative abundance of bilobate, cross, short saddle, plateau saddle, rondel and trapeziform types allow discrimination of the phytolith assemblage along the elevation gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on the soil phytolith data further revealed their relationships with the climatic variables. Temperature and evapotranspiration were found to be the most influential for differential distribution of grass phytolith assemblages with rising elevation in the eastern Himalayas. We also tested the reliability of phytolith indices (Ic, Iph and Fs) for tracing the dominance of different grass subfamilies in the eastern Himalayas. lc proved to be most reliable in discriminating C3/C4 grass along the elevation gradient while Iph and Fs proved to be less reliable. We observed that in the monsoon dominated eastern Himalayas, a little adjustment in Ic index may enhance the accuracy of interpretations. In future studies more precise identification of phytolith sub-types from additional sites in the eastern Himalayas may further improve our interpretations related to past climate condition.

AB  - The depositional environments and hydrocarbon potential of the siliciclastic, clayey and carbonate sediments from the Middle Miocene succession in the Varna-Balchik Depression, located in the south-eastern parts of the Moesian Platform, were studied using core and outcrop samples. Based on the lithology and resistivity log the succession is subdivided from base to top into five units. Siliciclastic sedimentation prevailed in the lower parts of units I and II, whereas their upper parts are dominated by carbonate rocks. Unit III is represented by laminated clays and biodetritic limestone. Units IV and V are represented by aragonitic sediments and biomicritic limestones, correlated with the Upper Miocene Topola and Karvuna Formations, respectively. Biogenic silica in the form of diatom frustules and sponge spicules correlates subunit IIa and unit III to the lower and upper parts of the Middle Miocene Euxinograd Formation. Both (sub) units contain organic carbon contents in the order of 1 to 2 wt. % (median: 0.8 for subunit IIa; 1.3 for unit III), locally up to 4 wt. %. Based on Hydrogen Index values (HI) and alkane distribution pattern, the kerogen is mainly type II in subunit IIa (average HI = 324 mg HC/g TOC) and type III in unit III (average HI similar to 200 mg HC/g TOC). TOC and Rock Eval data show that subunit IIa holds a fair (to good) hydrocarbon generative potential for oil, whereas the upper 5 m of unit III holds a good (to fair) potential with the possibility to generate gas and minor oil. The rocks of both units are immature in the study area. Generally low sulphur contents are probably due to deposition in environments with reduced salinity. Normal marine conditions are suggested for unit III. Biomarker composition is typical for mixed marine and terrestrial organic matter and suggests deposition in dysoxic to anoxic environments.

AB  - Macroalgae and filamentous turf algae (FTA) are abundant on degraded coral reefs, and the reproductive responses of corals may indicate sub-lethal stress under these conditions. The percentage of gametogenic stages (PGS) and the maximum diameter of eggs (MDE; or egg size) of Orbicella annularis were used to evaluate the effect of long-(7-10 months) and short-term (2.5 months) FTA removal (treatments T1 and T2, respectively) at both the beginning (May) and the end (August) of gametogenesis. Ramets (individual lobes of a colony) surrounded by FTA (T3) or crustose coralline algae (CCA; T4) were used as controls. The removal of FTA enhanced the development of gametes (i.e., a larger and higher percentage of mature gametes (PMG)) of O. annularis for T1 vs. T3 ramets in May and T1 and T2 vs. T3 ramets in August. Similar values of PGS and MDE between gametes from T3 and T4 in both May and August were unexpected because a previous study had shown that the same ramets of T4 (with higher tissue thickness, chlorophyll a cm(-2) and zooxanthellae density and lower mitotic index values) were less stressed than ramets of T3. Evaluating coral stress through reproduction can reveal more sensitive responses than other biological parameters; within reproductive metrics, PGS can be a better stress indicator than egg size. The presence of turf algae strongly impacted the development of gametes and egg size (e.g., PMG in ramets with FTA removal increased almost twofold in comparison with ramets surrounded by FTA in August), most likely exerting negative chronic effects in the long run due to the ubiquity and permanence of turf algae in the Caribbean. These algae can be considered a stressor that affects coral sexual reproduction. Although the effects of turf algae on O. annularis are apparently less severe than those of other stressors, the future of this species is uncertain because of the combined impacts of these effects, the decline of O. annularis populations and the almost complete lack of recruitment.

AB  - Salinity may play an important role in the larval Biology and Ecology of many brachyuran decapod crustaceans. Usually, ontogenetic changes in salinity tolerance represent a good indicator of larval dispersal in marine coastal ecosystems. In an experimental laboratory study, we investigated the effects of eight different salinities (Sal. 0-35) on zoeal development of the neotropical fiddler crab Uca rapax from a northern Brazilian estuary. In the study area the species reproduces year-round, including the wet season when low salinities (<= 5) are frequent, resulting from heavy tropical rainfalls and input of freshwater mostly from the Amazon River. Larval survival and development duration from hatching to megalopa of U. rapax were significantly affected by salinity. All larvae died in Sal. 0-20, while they successfully developed through five zoeal stages to megalopa in higher salinities (Sal. 25-35). However, in Sal. 25 the survival rate was still significantly lower (33.8 +/- 4.8%) and the zoeal development duration was longer (13.7 +/- 0.5 days) than in salinities 30 and 35, where >90% of the larvae successfully survived after an average of 11.8-12.4 days of development, respectively. Our results strongly suggest that the early life-history stages of U. rapax perform ontogenetic migrations towards adjacent coastal or fully marine waters to develop in favourable high salinities. Comparison with two other sympatric crab species, e.g. Ucides cordatus and Uca vocator, suggests that the larval 'export' strategy is a convergent adaptation exhibited by decapod species in the Amazon region to avoid mass mortality within parental mangroves that are frequently subjected to strong salinity fluctuations caused by the specific meteorological and hydrological conditions.

AB  - Functional indicators of stream health have the potential to provide insights into stream condition that cannot be gained by traditional structural indices. We examined breakdown of leaves, wood, and cotton cloth strips at 18 sites along a gradient of effects of drainage from coal mines in New Zealand to determine the usefulness of these methods as functional indicators of stream health. The pH varied from 2.7 to neutral across the streams, and the more acidic streams typically had higher concentrations of aluminum, iron, zinc, and other metal ions. Precipitates of metal (mainly iron) hydroxides were present in most streams affected by mine drainage, especially in those with a pH of 4-5. Breakdown rates of all organic matter types were highest in several reference streams with neutral pH and lowest in sites with high rates of metal hydroxide deposition. Breakdown was relatively fast in the most acidic streams (pH < 3), in some cases as fast as at reference sites; these sites also had elevated nutrient concentrations. Shredding invertebrates were absent in litterbags from acidic streams and common at only 2 reference sites; their presence contributed to fast breakdown of leaves in the field and in lab microcosms. Microbial respiration was closely related to breakdown rates of leaves and wood; it was high at neutral and highly acidic streams, but lower at sites with pH 4-5, where metal hydroxides were precipitating onto solid surfaces. In these metal hydroxide-stressed streams, leaf and wood breakdown was slower, and associated biota, including microbes, were more affected than by water chemistry stressors (pH, dissolved metals) associated with mine drainage. Litter breakdown and microbial respiration provide insight into the functioning of streams, yielding different responses than traditional structural measures based on macroinvertebrates, which did not accurately distinguish impacts from acid mine drainage.

AB  - Objective To determine whether the timing and route of nutritional support strategy affect length of hospitalization in dogs with naturally occurring septic peritonitis. Design Retrospective study encompassing cases from 2000 to 2009. Setting University teaching hospital. Animals Forty-five dogs that survived septic peritonitis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Nutritional strategy for each dog was categorized as either enteral nutrition (EN: free choice voluntary eating or assisted tube feeding) or central parenteral nutrition (CPN). Early nutritional support was defined as consistent caloric intake initiated within 24 hours postoperatively. Consistent caloric intake occurring after 24 hours was defined as delayed nutritional support. Data reflective of nutritional status included body condition score, serum albumin concentration, and duration of inappetence before and during hospitalization. Body weight change from the beginning to the end of hospitalization was calculated. A modified Survival Prediction Index 2 score was calculated for each dog at admission. Additional clinical data recorded for comparison of illness severity included indicators of severe inflammation (eg, presence of toxic changes in neutrophils and immature neutrophils), coagulopathy (eg, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time), the use of vasopressors and blood transfusions, and presence of concurrent illnesses. Nutrition-related complications were classified as mechanical, metabolic, or septic complications. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship of nutritional strategy with hospitalization length, while considering the presence of nutrition-related complications, the nutritional status- and illness severity-related variables. While controlling for other variables, dogs that received early nutrition had significantly shorter hospitalization length (by 1.6 days). No statistically significant association was found between route of nutrition and hospitalization length. The presence of concurrent illnesses and nutrition-related metabolic complications were also associated with longer hospitalization length (by 2.1 and 2.4 days, respectively). Conclusion Early nutritional support in dogs with septic peritonitis is associated with a shorter hospitalization length.

AB  - The wild horse Equus ferus was one of the most frequent species of the Late Pleistocene large ungulate fauna in Eurasia and played an important role in the subsistence of human groups, especially at the end the Late Glacial. It is frequently assumed that E. ferus became extinct in Europe at the beginning of the Holocene because of the development of woodlands and loss of open habitats. Because of its preference for open habitats and in spite of its adaptability, the appearance or disappearance of the wild horse could therefore be a suitable palaeoecological indicator for the opening of the Holocene primeval woodlands. We revised the dating and reliability of the subfossil record and dated several bones by atomic mass spectrometry C-14 dating. From the beginning of the Holocene (9600 cal a BC) to the end of the Atlantic Period (3750 cal a BC) there are 207 archaeological sites with wild horse records available in Europe. E. ferus survived the Pleistocene Holocene transition in Europe, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of populations fluctuated remarkably in the early and middle Holocene. Small and sparse populations increasingly became extinct during the early Holocene, until between 7100 and 5500 cal a BC the wild horse was almost absent in central parts of the European Lowlands. Particular conditions in natural open patches in the canopy forests, chalklands and floodplains may have maintained the local survival of the horse in some regions of the Lowlands, however. In the Late Atlantic, between 5500 and 3750 cal a BC the range of the wild horse was again extended. It re-immigrated into central and western Europe, probably as a consequence of increasing landscape opening by Neolithic peoples. The data presented here may be a valuable part of the debate on the degree of openness of the early and middle Holocene landscape. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - P>1. Biodiversity data are needed for conservation and management of tropical habitats, but the high diversity of these ecosystems makes comprehensive surveys prohibitively expensive and indicator taxa reflecting the biodiversity patterns of other taxa are frequently used. Few studies have produced the necessary comprehensive data sets to assess the quality of the indicator groups, however, and only one previous study has considered the monetary costs involved in sampling them.
   2. We surveyed four plant groups (herbs, liverworts, trees, lianas) and eight animal groups (ants, canopy and dung beetles, birds, butterflies, bees, wasps and the parasitoids of the latter two) in 15 plots of 50 x 50 m2 each, representing undisturbed rainforest and two types of cacao agroforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. We calculated three biodiversity measures (alpha and beta diversity; percentage of species indicative of habitat conditions), built simple and multiple regression models among species groups (single groups, combinations of 2-11 groups, averaged relative diversity of all 12 groups), and related these to three measures of survey cost (absolute costs and two approaches correcting for different sampling intensities).
   3. Determination coefficients (R2 values) of diversity patterns between single study groups were generally low (< 0 center dot 25), while the consideration of several study groups increased R2 values to up to 0 center dot 8 for combinations of four groups, and to almost 1 center dot 0 for combinations of 11 groups. Survey costs varied 10-fold between study groups, but their cost-effectiveness (indicator potential versus monetary cost) varied strongly depending on the biodiversity aspect taken into account (alpha or beta diversity, single or multiple groups, etc.).
   4. Synthesis and applications. We found that increasing the number of taxa resulted in best overall biodiversity indication. We thus propose that the most cost-efficient approach to general tropical biodiversity inventories is to increase taxonomic coverage by selecting taxa with the lowest survey costs.

AB  - The human impact on soil functions with reference to environmental pollution and climatic changes have received great attention during the last decades. A widespread and integral environmental indicator is the soil microbial respiration and can be estimated either on the basis of carbon dioxide evolution or of oxygen uptake. In accordance with many previous studies, we found that soil respiration decreased in the presence of heavy metals such as Cu. The Cu spiking of an acid and unpolluted, organic-rich pine forest soil at approximately the limits for sewage sludge (100 to 200 mu g Cu g(-1) soil) led to high concentrations of up to 0.35 mu g Cu per ml in the soil solution and reduced carbon dioxide evolution by 27% and the oxygen uptake by 18% during basal respiration. Thus, the respiratory quotient (RQ) which is defined as the carbon dioxide evolution related to oxygen uptake was reduced with increasing Cu levels. The Cu effect was also detected after the addition of glucose as a readily available substrate. In the soil investigated, the carbon isotope characteristic of the C-13-CO2 evolved did not give any indication of specific carbon use and fractionation processes during basal metabolism as indicated by enrichment or depletion of C-13 values. However, carbon isotope characteristic of the C-13-CO2 evolved showed that glucose addition stimulated mineralization of the soil organic matter (SOM) which derived from either increased biomass turnover or simulated dead SOM degradation and is defined as priming effect. The results showed that (1) the evaluation of heavy metal effect on soil respiratory indicators and the transformation of active SOM are method-dependent and (2) under aerobic conditions, soil microbial communities consumed relatively more oxygen in the presence of Cu than in its absence in this acid, unpolluted and organic rich soil under pine forest.

AB  - This paper analyses the purification efficiency and mass removal of organic material, suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus in a hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system treating wastewater from a basic school in Paistu, Estonia. The CW consists of two subsurface flow filter beds using lightweight aggregates (LWA): a two-chamber vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) filter bed followed by a horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) filter bed, with a total area of 432 m(2). This CW was constructed in summer 2002 by the Centre for Ecological Engineering in Tartu (CEET). Eighteen series of water samples (from 30.10.2003 to 15.10.2005) were undertaken. The analyses show the outstanding purification effect of the system: for BOD7 the average purification efficiency is 91%; for total suspended solids (TSS)-78%, for total P-89%, for total N-63%, and for NH4-N-77%. The average outlet values for the above-listed parameters were 5.5, 7.0, 0.4, 19.2 and 9.1 mg L-1, respectively. According to our results, the purification parameters meet the standards set by the Water Act of Estonia for wastewater treatment plants of 2000-9999 PE: 15, 25, and 1.5 mg L-1 for BOD7, TSS and total P, respectively. The results show that hybrid CW systems consisting of subsurface flow filter beds can work efficiently in conditions of changing hydraulic loading and relatively cold climate. We did not find significant differences between the removal efficiency, mass removal, and values of the first-order rate-constant k for most water quality indicators during the warm (May-October) and cold (November-April) periods. Locally produced LWA as a filter material in CWs has shown good hydraulic conductivity and phosphorus sorption capacity (k = 17.1 +/- 12.4 m yr(-1)). The Paistu CW, with its proper design and outstanding purification results, can be considered one of the best systems in Estonia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To enlarge the possibilities of using organisms of the soil fauna to assess the bioaccumulative potential of chemicals, the kinetic of soil cadmium (Cd) transfer to the terrestrial gastropod Helix aspersa was investigated under laboratory conditions during a long-term experiment (6 months). During the exposure phase (3 months), juvenile snails were subjected to three different concentrations of Cd spiked in artificial ISO soil (ISO 0, 20 and 100 mg Cd kg(-1)) and to a field soil (ME4) industrially contaminated by 20 mg Cd kg(-1). For both soils, internal steady-state Cd concentrations were reached in the viscera of the snails, the main storage organ for Cd, after 2 weeks of exposure whatever the Cd concentration in soil. The equilibrium concentrations in the viscera were 0.7 (+/- 0.1), 11.3 (+/- 2.4), 73.3 (+/- 4.8) and 6.3 (+/- 1.3) ing Cd kg(-1) dry mass for ISO 0, ISO 20, ISO 100 and ME4, respectively. During the deputation phase (3 months), from 0 to 52% of the accumulated Cd in the viscera were removed by excretion or relocation in the foot. However, the snails were not able to depurate down to initial concentrations. Data were modelled by integrating a specific growth rate constant into one-compartment toxicokinetic models. This allowed the calculation of Cd uptake rates that can be used as indicators of metal bioavailability. Since this parameter was found to be lower for snails exposed to the field soil ME4, we concluded that lower Cd bioavailability in this field soil was responsible of the lower transfer to the snails compared to the ISO 20 soil, even though they were polluted to similar extents. Internal validation showed that the toxicokinetic models could be applied for predictive purposes, promising for the development of a bioaccumulation directive for terrestrial environment.

AB  - No validated models in Europe are capable of simulating the environmental fate of pesticides under the specific conditions of rice fields. Rice water quality-vadose zone flow and transport (RICEWQ-VADOFT) is a model developed from the coupling of a surface runoff model (RICEWQ) and a vadose zone flow and transport model (VADOFT) for determining predicted environmental concentrations in paddy water and sediment, runoff, and groundwater. This study is intended to evaluate the capability of this model to simulate effectively the environmental fate of the herbicide pretilachlor in the paddy environment. A two-year field study conducted in a representative rice-cultivated area of northern Italy provided measured concentrations of pretilachlor in paddy water and sediment and also a limited number of observations on runoff losses. The model successfully predicted the water balance in the paddy field in both years. After limited calibration, the model predicted the fate of pretilachlor in paddy water and sediment with high accuracy. Agreement between predicted and measured concentrations of pretilachlor in both years was assessed statistically using several statistical indicators. For example, modeling efficiency (EF) values of 0.867 to 0.935 and 0.702 to 0.718 in paddy water and sediment, respectively, document the strong agreement between predicted and measured pesticide concentrations. The model predictions showed high agreement with the limited amount of measured runoff data in 2002. The model predicted that no significant amounts of pretilachlor would leach below the top 25 cm of the soil, although no measured data were available to evaluate the predicted results. A sensitivity analysis of the model to variables controlling pesticide partitioning to paddy sediment (VBIND, depth for direct partitioning of pesticide to bed sediment; VMIX, mixing velocity by molecular diffusion) revealed that the predictions of pesticide leaching were influenced strongly by those variables. Generally the RICEWQ-VADOFT model is a useful modeling fool for pesticide risk assessment in rice paddies.

AB  - Rocky shore communities are often influenced by near-shore coastal upwelling. For macrofauna in algal turf, these effects may be caused directly by well-studied bottom-up mechanisms or indirectly via changes in habitat structure provided by algal turf associated high nutrient loads. Here, we investigated possible interactions between upwelling and habitat structure by sampling diverse faunal assemblages in coralline algal turf on seven rocky intertidal shores in northern Chile, ranging from El Cobre [23 degrees 17'1"S, 70 degrees 31'40"W] to La Loberia [23 degrees 03'40"S, 70 degrees 33'14"W]. Some of these shores were located adjacent to strong upwelling centers, while others were in areas rarely affected. On each shore, we sampled four (2 X 2 m) sites separated by 15-50 m. In each site, we collected three replicate cores (80 mm in diameter) from which we measured macrofauna greater than 850 gm, biomass of sediment and epiphytes, frond density and average frond length. We used mean water temperature and its variation at 1-1.5 m water depth (below Extreme Low Water Spring, ELWS) to represent local upwelling intensity because long-term data have shown that these variables make excellent indicators for this region. In total, we found 94 macrofaunal taxa in coralline turf, which is almost three times higher than has previously been reported in Chile. Although macrofaunal assemblages varied significantly among shores, there were no patterns to suggest mesoscale variation in upwelling intensity affected either faunal assemblages or local habitat characteristics. In contrast, multivariate and univariate correlations highlighted sediment and frond density as strong determinants of community structure. We therefore conclude that traditionally studied habitat characteristics, such as structural complexity and habitat heterogeneity, have greater influence on faunal assemblages in mat-like habitats on rocky shores than environmental variables associated with mesoscale coastal upwelling.

AB  - Recovery of degraded semiarid rangeland is influenced by the degree of soil erosion and changes in soil physical and chemical properties that follow the loss of herbaceous cover. The objectives of this study were to compare changes in physical and chemical properties of a chaparral soil protected from grazing for 18 years, and to evaluate these changes relative to succession and threshold paradigms. Litter and soil samples were collected beneath shrub live oak (Ouercus turbinella), birchleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides) and open spaces between shrubs in a livestock exclosure and the surrounding grazed area. Additional soil was collected beneath shrub live oak and from open spaces between shrubs for a bioassay of soil fertility within the exclosure and the grazed area using oats (Avena saliva) as the indicator species. Percentage silt and clay were greater and percentage sand was lower within the exclosure. Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were greater in soil beneath mountain mahogany and from shrubless openings within the exclosure compared to the grazed area, but not beneath shrub live oak. Soil from shrubless openings in the exclosure produced greater oat shoot weights compared to soil from open spaces in the grazed area, but there was no difference in oat shoot weights between grazed and protected areas beneath shrub live oak. Shoot weights increased in response to nitrogen and nitrogen + phosphorus, but not phosphorus alone, indicating the site was primarily nitrogen limited. Improvements in soil physical and chemical properties within the exclosure did not result in recovery of herbaceous vegetation in open areas between shrubs. A very heterogeneous distribution pattern in soil properties, characterized by large differences between sails under shrubs compared to open areas between shrubs, was evident within the exclosure and in the grazed area, indicating the presence of a degraded ecosystem. Improvements in soil physical and chemical properties within the exclosure represent an upward trend within a stable threshold of lower productivity, rather than a slow return to climax condition.

AB  - Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)-based gels were doped with two optically active organic indicators, thionin and nile blue A. Before trapping in a sol-gel host, thionin and nile blue A were both evaluated for solvent and protonation effects on their spectral properties. Only extreme pH values provided by HCl, NaOH, and NH4OH produced new absorption and/or fluorescence bands. Introduction of nile blue A into alkaline environments (0.1N NaOH, NH4OH) results in the appearance of a broad absorption band centered near 520 nm whereas highly acidic environments (1N HCl) show a reduction of the 635 nm absorption peak accompanied by an absorption band located near 460 nm. A marked decrease is observed in the optical density of thionin in 1N HCl solution which results in a reduction in the fluorescence intensity. The absorption and fluorescence spectra also reveal a decrease in a pH 11 solution of NH4OH as compared to neutral conditions. Both dyes formed dimers when the sol-gel host, initially synthesized with TEOS, was organically modified with methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS). However, thionin dimers were present in all silica-based sol-gel compositions, as evidenced by the absorption and fluorescence spectra. Substitution of MTMS for some of the TEOS in the gel matrix resulted in blue shifts in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of nile blue A. The absorption peak shifted 50 nm to 596 nm whereas the fluorescence shifted around 40 nm to 635 nm. These blue shifts resulted from the reduced polarity of the silica-based xerogel. Thionin also exhibited shifts in its absorption and fluorescence spectra with organic modification by MTMS. The absorption shifted approximately 3 nm to 595 nm while the fluorescence maximum decreased 7 nm to 630 nm. The blue shifts in the spectra of thionin with additions of MTMS were attributed to surface sites that altered the molecular structure of the adsorbed thionin molecules.

AB  - This work provides an evaluation of the emission factors (EFs) of typical garden waste burning (fallen leaves and hedge trimming) in terms of particulate matter (PM), elemental and organic carbon (EC-OC) together with a detailed chemical characterization of 88 particle-bound organic species including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), levoglucosan and its isomers, lignin breakdown products (methoxyphenols), cholesterol, alkanes, polyols and sugars. Furthermore, wood-log based burning experiments have been performed to highlight key indicators or chemical patterns of both, green waste and wood burning (residential heating) sources, that may be used for PM source apportionment purposes. Two residential log wood combustion appliances, wood stove (RWS) and fireplace, under different output conditions (nominal and reduced) and wood log moisture content (mix of beech, oak and hornbeam), have been tested. Open wood burning experiments using wood logs were also performed. Green waste burning EFs obtained were comparable to the available literature data for openair biomass burning. For PM and for most of the organic species studied, they were about 2 to 30 times higher than those observed for wood log combustion experiments. Though, poor performance wood combustions (open-air wood log burning, fireplace and RWS in reduced output) showed comparable EFs for levoglucosan and its isomers, methoxyphenols, polyols, PAHs and sugars. Toxic PAH equivalent benzo[a]pyrene EFs were even 3-10 times higher for the fireplace and open-air wood log burning. These results highlighted the impact of the nature of the fuel burnt and the combustion performances on the emissions. Different chemical fingerprints between both biomass burning sources were highlighted with notably a predominance of odd high -molecular weight n-alkanes (higher carbon preference index, CPI), lower levoglucosan/mannosan ratio and lower sinapylaldehyde abundance for green waste burning. However, the use of such indicators seems limited, especially if applied alone, for a clear discrimination of both sources in ambient air. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Last decades increase in reported events of drought-induced tree mortality evidences how climate-change is transforming forest ecosystems all over the world. The parallel increase in human pressure over the land is also causing major changes in forest functioning but it remains unclear how these two driving forces interact between them. We combined tree-ring data with aboveground cover, leaf area index (LAI), soil variables, and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as water availability indicator to disentangle the existence of linkages between contrasting Holm oak (Quercus ilex L. subsp. ballota [Desf.] Samp) land-use practices and its drought-induced decline and mortality. We selected ten sites covering different soil and climatic gradients, land-use practices (i.e., declining dehesas, DH; declining coppices, FRd; and healthy coppices, FRh), and tree vigour classes (i.e., living, affected, and dead trees) in Spain. DH sites presented lower tree coverage, soil water holding capacity and soil pH than coppice (FR) sites. Dead Holm oaks from DH sites were younger than living ones, whereas dead trees from FRd sites were smaller and showed lower growth rates than living ones. We also found that conservation of traditional land-use practices in FR sites, resulting in less understorey cover but more soil erosion (less nutrients and microbial biomass and more bare soil), may positively affect the growth plasticity and sensitivity to drought of Holm oak trees by alleviating inter-specific competition, but in detriment of vegetation cover and soil health. Further studies should evaluate whether what holds true for FRh sites regarding the maintenance of traditional land-use practices might also apply for healthy DH. In the face of drier and hotter scenarios, our results add robust evidences on how the modulation of the intensity of the traditional uses could be a useful tool to optimize ecosystem services in Mediterranean systems highly vulnerable to climate change.

AB  - Methods of estimation of tourist and recreational resources are traced; the analysis of natural tourist and recreational resources of the Republic of Malta is carried out; the analysis of historical and cultural tourist and recreational resources of the country is carried out; a point assessment of the country's provision of tourist and recreational resources; the place of the Republic of Malta on the tourist market of Ukraine is revealed. The Republic of Malta is one of the few countries in the world with such a large and diverse historical and cultural site. The lands of the country have experienced centuries of historical events, after which there are memories in the form of cathedrals, palaces, museums, fortifications, etc. Malta has been established as a country with an ancient history. It has a large number of unique cultural monuments, as there were Carthaginians and Phoenicians, Roman and Byzantine empires, Arabs, knights of the Order of St. John, Napoleon, the British Empire. The country's historical and cultural tourist resources make it interesting for tourists to visit. Malta has a great historical past, which has left a great legacy in the form of ancient fortresses, churches, cathedrals, majestic palaces. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is no exception for the country; there are 3 of them in the list. There are 7 sites in the country that are also currently candidates for inclusion in the World Heritage List. The country is rich in fortifications; there are 35 units in the country, which are of particular interest for tourists. Most of the fortifications were built during the Order of Malta to fortify the country from invaders. The natural conditions of Malta, which are the basis for tourism development, are analyzed. Methods for estimating the tourist potential of the country have been studied, in particular. normative-index, balance, graphic, cartographic, expert, statistical and mathematical methods, scoring. Integrated indicators for each region of Malta were determined using a score. Three categories of regions have been identified according to the assessment of the tourist potential of the territory.

AB  - Debris flows and lahars are dense masses of water and sediment which are common phenomena in mountainous and volcanic regions, respectively. Where these flows debouch into water bodies they can trigger impulse waves (tsunamis) and form subaqueous deposits. Such deposits are important indicators for areas at risk from debris flows, lahars, and tsunamis and form archives of past environmental conditions. Correctly interpreting this archive, however, depends on our understanding of the sedimentology and architecture of the deposits. While subaerial debrisflow deposits have been extensively studied, there is a comparative lack of understanding of the deposits of subaerial debris flows that debouch into a water body. We experimentally investigate the similarities and contrasts between subaerial and subaqueous debris-flow deposits for flows of various magnitudes and compositions initiated in a subaerial environment. We show that flows depositing on a subaqueous plane generally have a deposit area similar to flows forming in a subaerial setting. Deposits forming on a subaqueous plane, however, are typically shorter and wider with similar thickness, as a result of interactions between the flow and the reservoir water body. Both in subaerial and subaqueous environments the deposits form coarse-grained lateral levees and frontal snout margins. However, where the levees are able to laterally confine the subaerial flows leading to deposits with constant to tapering width, the subaqueous deposits widen with distance offshore because of flow fluidization. Moreover, the frontal snout is often very dispersed, a sharp frontal margin is absent, and many isolated particles are deposited in front of the main deposit margin as a result of interactions between the debris flow and the reservoir water body. These results largely agree with observations of subaqueous pyroclastic-flow deposits. The similarity in area of subaerial and subaqueous deposits suggests that we can apply empirical relations based on subaerial flows to estimate the inundation area and flow volume of subaerial-subaqueous flows.

AB  - The present study was undertaken with an objective to determine diurnal changes of the eye temperature of buffalo young bulls under different shelter management to determine the effect of heat stress. Twenty four buffalo bulls were randomly divided into two groups, each group comprising of 12 animals based on age (16-18 months) and body weight (Control = 301 +/- 8.24 kg and Treatment = 311.45 +/- 6.24 kg). The control group was housed under normal management practices followed, and the height of the shed was 10 ft. and width was 12 ft. with concrete floor. Whereas, the treatment group was housed in shed having 15 ft. height and 25 ft. width along with rubber mat as flooring and the total area provided for each animal in both the groups was 45.96 sq. feet. They were also provided with dairy fans and mist cooling in day time to ameliorate the heat stress. The thermal humidity index (THI), floor and roof temperature variation of the shed was recorded. The eye temperature of bulls was measured to evaluate the effect of different housing on the animals' thermal status under hot dry summer conditions. Results revealed that the THI of treatment shed was significantly (P< 0.01) lower than the control at different times. The floor and roof surface temperature of the treatment shed was significantly (P<0.05) lower than the control shed. Diurnal patterns of eye temperature measured in both the groups showed increased eye temperature in control group bulls compared to treatment group. The eye temperature at 7.00 hrs was similar in both groups, whereas it was highly significant (P<0.01) at 13.00 and 19.00 hrs. The heat stress in the buffalo bulls was exhibited by increased eye temperature. Thus, the variation in the eye temperature can be effectively used as an indicator of heat stress and the dairy fans and mist cooling along with rubber mat flooring can be utilized to ameliorate the heat stress in the buffalo bulls.

AB  - To avoid trophic mismatches, large herbivores should reschedule the breeding timing to keep in synchrony with the recent advance of plant phenology caused by climate change. To do so, individuals must track resources along two main non-exclusive axes: time (rescheduling the breeding timing) and space (i.e., shifting their range). While the vast majority of studies have focused on the study of specific populations inhabiting small and homogeneous environments, little is known about the response of species across large regions with highly heterogeneous topographies. Here, we studied roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), an income breeder that has demonstrated a lack of phenotypic plasticity on birth timing in a densely forested lowland area, and evaluated its ability to track resources along a wide elevational gradient (288-2366 m a.s.l.). We used data from 8986 parturition events collected in Switzerland during the period 1971-2015. We hypothesize that the mismatch between roe deer parturition dates and peak resource availability will increase over the study period. In addition, we expect this mismatch to be larger in low areas compared to higher elevation areas. Contrary to previous studies, we did find a consistent, but small, trend toward more advance parturition dates through time across all elevations. However, this rate of advance was less than that of the plant phenology indicators, resulting in an increasing mismatch at all elevations. Parturition dates changed on average at a rate between 7.5 times slower than the growing season start and 5 times slower than the flowering start. Thus, at the lowest elevations, parturition timing has already fallen outside the optimal time window for high-quality forage, while at high elevations, parturitions are still synchronized with the peak availability of quality forage. Our study emphasizes the need for large-scale study designs along climatic gradients to help understand the complex relationships that shape adaptation across environments. This would allow for better understanding of how populations will respond to the new environmental conditions imposed by climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary Game hunting is an activity largely practiced all over the world. Understanding its consequences on wildlife is crucial for the proper management and development of hunting directives. In this study, we examined stress levels in hunted wild red deer by assessing cortisol levels and its metabolites in multi-temporal biological samples. Overall, we found evidence for an influence on stress levels of red deer caused by repeated exposure to hunting events, which could have important implications on the sustainability and conservation of wild populations. Furthermore, our results highlight the use of hair samples as a useful long-term stress indicator. Hunting activity is usually seen as a factor capable of causing an intense stress response in wildlife that may lead to short but also long-term stress. In the Lousa Mountain, Portugal, the population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) is the target of intensive seasonal hunting. We collected and measured cortisol (and its metabolites) in three tissues types (blood, feces and hair) from red deer hunted during two hunting seasons to evaluate the stress levels at different time windows. We also assessed the immunological and physical condition of the animals. We predicted that the hunting activity would act as a stressor inducing increased short and long-term stress levels in the population. Results showed an increase in hair cortisol levels during the months of harvesting. Surprisingly, the tendency for plasma cortisol levels was to decrease during the hunting season, which could be interpreted as habituation to hunting activity, or due to the hunting duration. Contrary to our predictions, fecal cortisol metabolites did not show any clear patterns across the months. Overall, our results suggest an influence of hunting activities on the physiological stress in red deer. In addition, hair seems to be useful to measure physiological stress, although more studies are required to fully understand its suitability as an indicator of long-term stress. Methodologically, our approach highlights the importance of simultaneously using different methods to assess short and long-term effects in studies on physiological stress reactions.

AB  - One of the areas discussed in modern geology is the oil and gas potential of deep horizons, including the basement of sedimentary basins. The genesis of oil deposits is the subject of heated debate.
   Modern geochemical methods for studying a substance, together with the instrument capabilities, which include an isotopic mass-spectrometer, make it possible to distinguish between oils generated by different oil source deposits.
   The most important indicator identifying the genesis of hydrocarbons with respect to oil and gas formation zones in a specific section is the isotopic composition of carbon. Each zone, in its turn, is characterized by individual geochemical and thermodynamic parameters, including the type and degree of conversion of dispersed organic matter, modern geothermal temperatures and paleotemperature conditions, and the phase composition of hydrocarbons.
   Deposits of the Aryskum depression of the South Torgai oil and gas basin (South Kazakhstan) are associated with various lithological-stratigraphic complexes of the Jurassic-Cretaceous deposits, the Devonian-Lower Carboniferous formations of the quasi-platform complex and disintegrated basement ledges.
   In recent years, the prospects of the South Torgai basin have expanded and are associated with pre-Jurassic deposits. In this regard, there is the issue of the nature of hydrocarbon masses and formation of their clusters in the Mesozoic and Pre-Mesozoic formations of the Aryskum depression.
   The aim of the research is the comparative analysis of the carbon isotopic composition of oils from the Aryskum depression from the Mesozoic, Paleozoic sediments, as well as the ones from the zone of contact of the Paleozoic with the Mesozoic sedimentary cover to solve genetic problems and elucidate the features of the formation of oil fields in the Aryskum depression.
   The results made it possible to establish the regularity of the change in the delta C-13 value depending on the age, depth, and territorial confinement of the deposits within the Aryskum depression and, based on isotopic data, make an assumption about the genesis of Mesozoic and Pre-Mesozoic oils.

AB  - Providing a broiler chicken embryo with a lighting schedule during incubation may stimulate leg bone development. Bone development may be stimulated through melatonin, a hormone released in darkness that stimulates bone development, or increased activity in embryos exposed to a light-dark rhythm. Aim was to investigate lighting conditions during incubation and leg bone development in broiler embryos, and to reveal the involved mechanisms. Embryos were incubated under continuous cool white 500 lux LED light (24L), continuous darkness (24D), or 16h of light, followed by 8h of darkness (16L:8D) from the start of incubation until hatching. Embryonic bone development largely takes place through cartilage formation (of which collagen is an important component) and ossification. Expression of genes involved in cartilage formation (col1 alpha 2, col2 alpha 1, and col10 alpha 1) and ossification (spp1, sparc, bglap, and alpl) in the tibia on embryonic day (ED) 13, ED17, and at hatching were measured through qPCR. Femur and tibia dimensions were determined at hatch. Plasma growth hormone and corticosterone and pineal melatonin concentrations were determined every 4h between ED18.75 and ED19.5. Embryonic heart rate was measured twice daily from ED12 till ED19 as a reflection of activity. No difference between lighting treatments on gene expression was found. 24D resulted in higher femur length and higher femur and tibia weight, width, and depth at hatch than 16L:8D. 24D furthermore resulted in higher femur length and width and tibia depth than 24L. Embryonic heart rate was higher for 24D and 16L:8D in both its light and dark period than for 24L, suggesting that 24L embryos may have been less active. Melatonin and growth hormone showed different release patterns between treatments, but the biological significance was hard to interpret. To conclude, 24D resulted in larger leg bones at hatch than light during incubation, but the underlying pathways were not clear from present data.

AB  - Human exposure to water contaminated with faeces is a leading cause of worldwide ill-health. Contaminated water can be transmitted rapidly in karst terrain as a result of the connectivity of surface and groundwater systems, high transmissivity of aquifers over large areas, and well-developed underground conduit systems. Faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) are the most widely-used indicator of faecal contamination and microbial water quality; however, the conceptualisation of FIO risk and associated sources, pathways, and survival dynamics of FIOs in karst landscapes requires a degree of modification from traditional conceptual models of FIO fate and transfer in non-karst systems. While a number of reviews have provided detailed accounts of the state-of-the-science concerning FIO dynamics in catchments, specific reference to the uniqueness of karst and its influence on FIO fate and transfer is a common omission. In response, we use a mixed methods approach of critical review combined with a quantitative survey of 372 residents of a typical karst catchment in the southwest China karst region (SWCKR) to identify emerging research needs in an area where much of the population lives in poverty and is groundwater dependent. We found that the key research needs are to understand: 1) overland and subsurface FIO export pathways in karst hydrology under varying flow conditions; 2) urban and agricultural sources and loading in mixed land-use paddy farming catchments; 3) FIO survival in paddy farming systems and environmental matrices in karst terrain; 4) sediment-FIO interactions and legacy risk in karst terrain; and 5) key needs for improved hydrological modelling and risk assessment in karst landscapes. Improved knowledge of these research themes will enable the development of evidence-based faecal contamination mitigation strategies for managing land and water resources in the SWCKR, which is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts on water supply and quality of water resources.

AB  - The authors use the analysis of existing research ideas regarding the structure and content of the criminological prediction methodology to examine modern approaches to predicting illegal activities in penitentiary institutions. They analyze and classify the objects of prevention - those inmates in places of confinement who need to be controlled while serving their sentence because they have a range of unlawful behavior. In the diagnostic sub-task the object is viewed as a source of information whose attributes and features are studied as they manifest its essence and condition. The authors present a large-scale review of Russian and foreign publications to research the evolution of scientific ideas regarding the contents of the hypothesis as a basis of criminological prediction. While recognizing the value of theoretical criminological achievements, the authors set the goal of analyzing the possible ways of integrating criminology and operative search activities for the identification of pre-criminal behavior in places of confinement. Using the theory of criminological prediction and empirical materials, the authors analyze the possibilities of designing a multi-factor prediction model for individual unlawful behavior by transforming this model into a system of corresponding indicators and risk factors of pre-criminal behavior. They conduct a systemic analysis of the contents of socio-demographic, penitentiary, psychological variables, as well as variables connected with the criminal past as an aggregate of risk factors of pre-criminal behavior. They also describe the essence of digital prediction methods - predictive analytics, analytical intelligence, initiative analytics, - which are used to build a system of indicators for studying and assessing the behavior of certain categories of inmates. The authors show the necessity of using digital analytical methods of making managerial decisions regarding the preventive measures of rapid response in cases of the destructive behavior of inmates. Using the regularities that form the basis of criminological prediction, the authors state that it is necessary to develop the methods of digital prediction and to adapt key features of the digital environment and newest information and telecommunication technologies to solving the tasks of preventing offences among inmates.

AB  - Currently, the high-resolution satellite images in near real-time have gained more popularity for natural disaster detection due to the unavailability and difficulty of acquiring frequent ground observation data over a wide region. In Sudan, the occurrence of drought events is a predominant natural disaster that causes substantial damages to crop production. Therefore, monitoring drought and measuring its impact on the agricultural sector remain major concerns of policymakers. The current study focused on assessing and analyzing drought characteristics based on two meteorological drought indices, namely the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Drought Severity Index (DSI), and inferred the impact of drought on sorghum productivity in Sudan from 2001 to 2011. To identify the wet and dry areas, the deviations of tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) precipitation products from the long-term mean from 2001 to 2011 were computed and mapped at a seasonal scale (July-October). Our findings indicated that the dry condition fluctuated over the whole of Sudan at various temporal and spatial scales. The DSI results showed that both the Kordofan and Darfur regions were affected by drought in the period 2001-2005, whereas most regions were affected by drought from 2008 to 2011. The spatial correlation between DSI, SPI-3, and TRMM precipitation products illustrated a significant positive correlation in agricultural lands and negative correlation in mountainous areas. The relationship between DSI and the Standardized variable of crop yield (St. Y) for sorghum yield was also investigated over two main agricultural regions (Central and Eastern regions) for the period 2001-2011, which revealed a good agreement between them, and a huge drop of sorghum yield also occurred in 2008-2011, corresponding to extreme drought indicated by DSI. The present study indicated that DSI can be used for agricultural drought monitoring and served as an alternative indicator for the estimation of crop yield over Sudan in some levels.

AB  - The utilization of a newly discovered Jordanorigin oil shale was outlined in this work. Both industrial and environmental issues were discussed for better handling the wastes that often generated upon processing of oil shale. Two by-products of oil shale were studied, retorted, and combusted oil shale. The wastes were produced under different conditions. Different analytical techniques (XRF, XRD, proximate analysis, infrared spectroscopy, particle size distribution, TGA/DSC, and ultimate analysis) were used to follow up the physicochemical changes in generated solid residues. Oil shale was rich in carbonate with spent content of 73.2%. Upon processing oil shale, many heavy metals were concentrated in the final residue. The most concentrated metals were Cr, Cu, Co, and V with enrichment factor more than 2.0 in both residues. Compared with raw oil shale, leaching of toxic heavy metals was increased many folds and percentage of extraction was higher than 60% of all metals using HNO3. Total characteristic leaching tests TCLT, a standard test to stimulate metals elution in the environment, confirmed that retorted oil shale was more toxic when contacted with aquatic environment. TCLT indicated that the released amount of Cr was 4.4 higher than the safe limit set by international agencies. Elemental analysis indicated that H/C ratio of oil shale was 0.11 and hence would be used as low-grade fuel. The maximum content of kerogen was 19%, which is estimated by Soxhlet extraction with methanol. The best utilization of retorted and combusted solid residues was as solid medium for Pb ions and phenol removal from solution. Retorted oil shale has better efficiency toward phenol, while combusted oil shale exhibited better removal for Pb ions. Gross heating value, textural parameters, density, and Si/Al ratio were found useful indicators to assess the best utilization of solid wastes generated upon oil shale processing.

AB  - The development of tourism industry at the regional level is relevant for all the subjects of the Russian Federation. The issue is especially acute in those of them that do not have rich cultural-historical heritage and unique natural-climatic conditions. In particular, these areas include highly urbanized industrial regions of the country, which at present do not make an effective use of their potential for the development of domestic and inbound tourism. The subject of the research in this paper is tourist activity in federal districts of the Russian Federation. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the volume of tourist services in the Russian Federation and to substantiate the development of industrial tourism in the regions for the purpose of attracting additional tourist flows. The study uses the system approach, the basic scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction, and statistical analysis methods. One of the innovations in the tourism business of the Russian Federation could be the organization and conducting of excursions to the enterprises of the country not only for official delegations and business partners, but also for ordinary tourists. The article highlights the opportunities and threats for the development of industrial tourism in the Russian Federation. As a result of the statistical analysis of economic indicators of tourism industry development for 2011-2015, the authors identify a decline in the growth rate of the volume of tourist services. The lack of new tourist offerings reduces opportunities for growth. In this case the authors find it appropriate to promote a new type of domestic tourism associated with visiting industrial enterprises. The development of industrial tourism provides the regional economy with the multiplier effect including the stimulating effect on the activity of related sectors, and promotes import substitution in tourism. Main provisions of the present paper, due to their their universal character, can be used in educational process by educational institutions; they can also be recommended for use by the authorities in order to promote regional tourism.

AB  - Magnetic minerals in paleosols hold important clues to the environmental conditions in which the original soil formed. However, efforts to quantify parameters such as mean annual precipitation (MAP) using magnetic properties are still in their infancy. Here, we test the idea that diagenetic processes and surficial weathering affect the magnetic minerals preserved in paleosols, particularly in pre-Quaternary systems that have received far less attention compared to more recent soils and paleosols. We evaluate the magnetic properties of non-loessic paleosols across the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (a short-term global warming episode that occurred at 55.5 Ma) in the Bighorn Basin, WY. We compare data from nine paleosol layers sampled from outcrop, each of which has been exposed to surficial weathering, to the equivalent paleosols sampled from drill core, all of which are preserved below a pervasive surficial weathering front and are presumed to be unweathered. Comparisons reveal an increase in magnetization in outcrops compared with core equivalents, which is principally driven by secondary hematite production. Authigenic hematite production in outcrops presents a complication for goethite-hematite based paleoprecipitation proxies where estimates will be biased toward drier climate regimes. The occurrence of low coercivity minerals is more consistent between core and outcrop. However, we propose an alteration process for pedogenic magnetite that is observed in both core and outcrop, where pedogenic magnetite becomes progressively oxidized leading to higher mean coercivities and broader coercivity distributions compared to modern pedogenic magnetite. This combination of diagenetic processes and surface weathering influences the magnetic properties of paleosols. Despite these changes, magnetic enhancement ratios from B-horizons correlate with independent MAP estimates from geochemical proxies, which suggests that paleoprecipitation information is preserved. Future work should continue to address these complications by developing useful protocols that isolate the magnetic properties that are most resistant to alteration and remain strong indicators of MAP and climate.

AB  - The abundance of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) (CSLs) and Guadalupe fur seals (Arctocephalus philippii townsendi) (GFSs) from the San Benito Archipelago (SBA) was determined through nine monthly surveys in 2014-2015. Assessment of their foraging habits was examined based on the isotopic analysis of pups (maternal indicators) (SIAR/SIBER-R). Environmental variability between 2014 and 2015 was also analyzed, in terms of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration. Both otariids reached their highest abundance in July of both years; however, relative to 2014, the 2015 survey showed a 59.7% decline in the total GFS abundance and a 42.9% decrease of GFS pups, while total CSL abundance decreased 52.0% and CSL pup presence decreased in 61.7%. All monthly surveys for both otariids showed a similar trend (>50% decrease in 2015). Compared to 2014, the 2015 GFSs isotopic niche was three times larger (2.0 in 2015, 0.6 in 2014) and the delta C-13 was significantly lower. CSLs also showed significantly lower d13C and higher delta N-15 in 2015. Interannual segregation was greater for CSLs, and their pup body mass was also significantly lower during the 2015 breeding season (mean = 8.7 kg) than in the same season of 2014 (mean = 9.9 kg). The decrease in d13C for both otariids reflected a more oceanic foraging; most likely associated with the decline in primary productivity in surrounding areas to the SBA, related to a higher SST caused by the 2015 ENSO, with a subsequent increase in foraging effort. These would explain the fewer observed individuals on land, especially pups, which showed diminished body condition (CSLs). This study highlights the importance of marine mammals as sentinel species that respond dynamically to changes in environment, providing valuable information on the effect of ENSO on pinnipeds in Mexican waters.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for various fertility traits on Holstein upgraded dairy heifers and cows in a smallholder system under tropical conditions using data sets from the Thailand national recording scheme. The investigated traits were age at first service (AFS), age at first calving (AFC), days from calving to first service (DTFS), days between first and last service (DFLS), days open (DO), calving interval (CI), number of services per conception (NSPC), and conception at first service (FSC). The data consisted of 68,555, 34,401, and 54,004 records on heifers, primiparous, and multiparous cows, respectively, calving between 1996 and 2011. Gibbs sampling was employed to obtain (co)variance components using both univariate and bivariate analyses with linear and threshold animal models. Virgin heifers had better fertility performance than primiparous and multiparous cows. The reproductive performance in primiparous cows was inferior compared with multiparous cows. "Cows with higher Holstein-Friesian blood showed lower reproductive efficiency. Estimated heritabilities for most of the fertility traits were 0.04 or less except for AFS (0.26) and AFC (0.25). The estimated genetic correlations among fertility traits within parity indicated that selection for cows with high conception rate could lead to shortened DO and CI, as well as DTFS. The FSC and NSPC could be used as the best indicators for heifer and cow fertility and could be complemented by other traits, which were genetically considered as different traits such as DTFS and DFLS in terms of a fertility index. This would enable efficient selection for better fertility. Genetic correlations for fertility traits in primiparous and multiparous cows were very high (>0.90), but those between heifers and cows were lower (0.03 to 0.83). The latter results indicated that fertility traits of heifers and cows should be considered as different traits.

AB  - The green shore crab, Carcinus maenas, undergoes on average 6 h periods of emersion during each low-tide cycle during the summer months. Under those conditions, the crab is cut off from its normal water environment and is exposed to potential stress from a suite of environmental and physiological changes: dehydration, compromised gas exchange and resultant internal hypoxia and hypercapnia, thermal stress, and ammonia toxicity. This study examined the comprehensive responses of the green crab in water and to a 6 h emersion period laboratory simulation of a tidal cycle followed by a 1 h re-immersion period, measuring indicators of dehydration, hemolymph osmolality, oxygen uptake, hemolymph acid-base status, heart and ventilatory rate, and hemolymph ammonia and ammonia excretion. Green crabs showed physiological responses of varying magnitude to 6 h of emersion. Individuals were found in the field exclusively under rocks and large clumps of seaweed where temperatures were approximately half those of exposed surfaces and relative humidity was about twice as high as ambient air. During emersion, crabs lost less than 5% of their wet weight, and hemolymph osmolality did not increase significantly. Oxygen uptake continued in air at about 50% of the control, aquatic values; and the gills continued to be ventilated by the scaphognathite, albeit at lower rates. Hemolymph lactate concentrations increased, indicating a shift to a greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism to support energetic needs. A slight acidosis developed in the hemolymph after 1 h of emersion, but it did not increase thereafter. Ammonia concentrations in the hemolymph were unchanged, as ammonia was volatilized by the gills and excreted into the air as NH3 gas. These results show that the green crab copes with emersion by seeking refuge in microhabitats that mitigate the changes in the physical parameters of intertidal emersion. Physiologically, desiccation is avoided, cardio-respiratory processes are maintained at reduced levels, and hemolymph acid-base balance is minimally affected. Ammonia toxicity appears to be avoided by a shift to excreting NH3 gas directly or indirectly to air.

AB  - Bioinfiltration systems facilitate the infiltration of urban stormwater into soil and reduce high flow events and flooding. Stormwater carries a myriad of pollutants including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Significant knowledge gaps exist about the ability of bioinfiltration systems to remove and retain FIB. The present study investigates the ability of model, simplified bioinfiltration systems containing quartz sand and iron oxide-coated quartz sand (IOCS) to remove two FIB (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) suspended in synthetic stormwater with and without natural organic matter (NOM) as well as the potential for accumulated FIB to be remobilized during intermittent flow. The experiments were conducted in two phases: (1) the saturated columns packed with either sand or IOCS were contaminated by injecting stormwater with bacteria followed by injection of sterile stormwater and (2) the contaminated columns were subjected to intermittent infiltration of sterile stormwater preceded by a pause during which columns were either kept saturated or drained by gravity. During intermittent flow, fewer bacteria were released from the saturated column compared to the column drained by gravity: 12% of attached E. coli and 3% of attached Ent. faecalis were mobilized from the drained sand column compared to 3% of attached E. coli and 2% attached Ent. faecalis mobilized from the saturated sand column. Dry and wet cycles introduce moving air water interfaces that can scour bacteria from grain surfaces. During intermittent flows, less than 0.2% of attached bacteria were mobilized from IOCS, which bound both bacteria irreversibly in the absence of NOM. Addition of NOM, however, increased bacterial mobilization from IOCS: 50% of attached E. coli and 8% of attached Ent, faecalis were released from IOCS columns during draining and rewetting. Results indicate that using geomedia such as IOCS that promote irreversible attachment of bacteria, and maintaining saturated condition, could minimize the mobilization of previous attached bacteria from bioinfiltration systems, although NOM may significantly decrease these benefits.

AB  - Inshore turbid reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are exposed to high and fluctuating sediment loads normally associated with poor reef growth, but many have high coral cover (>30%) and diversity (>50 species). Previous assessments of sediment regimes on these reefs have largely relied on sediment trap data, which overestimate sedimentation rates and may not accurately reflect sedimentary conditions. A new approach, based on paired sediment trays, is described here that allows the sedimentation rate, sediment resuspension, and total mass of mobile sediments transported on to and off of a site per unit time and area (termed the two-way total sediment flux) to be measured or calculated. The sediment trays were deployed on Middle Reef and Paluma Shoals, two inshore turbid reefs on the GBR where the two-way total sediment flux ranged from 34 g/m(2)/d in protected reef habitats to more than 640 g/m(2)/d in higher-energy settings. Mean sedimentation rates, calculated using data from four sites across these reefs, of less than 122 g/m(2)/d are considerably lower than published rates estimated for nearby coral reefs, largely because sediment traps limit sediment resuspension. At each tray installation, sediments were collected every 4 to 6 weeks to measure variations in net sedimentation through the year, and resuspension rates were calculated by comparing 100 g of preanalysed sediments placed on trays at deployment to sediments recovered 2 weeks later. These data demonstrate that despite high sediment delivery rates, net sedimentation may still be relatively low and potentially less of a threat to benthic communities on turbid reefs than previously assumed. Sediment trays provide a comprehensive assessment of sediment regimes that, together with ecological assessments of coral cover, improve our understanding of the sedimentary pressures affecting inshore turbid reefs and their ability to tolerate sedimentation.

AB  - Previous studies exploring the effects of climate on the nasal region have largely focused on external craniofacial linear parameters, using dry crania of modern human populations. This investigation augments traditional craniofacial morphometrics with internal linear and volumetric measures of the anatomic units comprising the nasal complex (i.e., internal nasal cavity depth, maxillary sinus volumes). The study focuses on macaques (i.e., Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis) living at high and low altitudes, rather than on humans, since the short residency of migratory human populations may preclude using them as reliable models to test the long-term relationship of climate to nasal morphology. It is hypothesized that there will be significant differences in nasal complex morphology among macaques inhabiting different climates. This study integrated three different approaches: CT imaging, comparative anatomy, and morphometrics-in an effort to better understand the morphological structure and adaptive nature of the nasal complex. Results showed statistically significant differences when subsets of splanchnocranial and neurocranial variables were regressed against total maxillary sinus volume for particular taxa. For example, basion-hormion was significant for M. fascicularis, whereas choanal dimensions were significant only for M. mulatta. Both taxa revealed strong correlation between sinus volume and prosthion to staphylion distance, which essentially represents the length of the nasal cavity floor-and is by extension an indicator of the air conditioning capacity of the nasal region. These results clearly show that climatic effects play a major role in shaping the anatomy of the nasal complex in closely related species. The major influence upon these differing structures appears to be related to respiratory-related adaptations subserving differing climatic factors. In addition, the interdependence of the paranasal sinuses with other parts of the complex strongly indicates a functional role for them in nasal complex/upper respiratory functions.

AB  - Assisted by the development of light excitation and measuring techniques and the commercial availability of highly sensitive equipment, luminescent labels are sensitive detection tools for life sciences research. By contrast to a wide variety of well established chromogenic techniques, fluorescent labels for detecting peroxidase (PO) have been confined to only a few substrates. We describe here novel fluorescent substrates of PO derived from heterocyclic 4-hydroxy styrenes as useful tools for detecting endogenous and exogenous targets in fixed cells and tissues. Excellent localization, high staining sensitivity, outstanding photostability, and exceptionally low background staining were achieved by optimizing the substrate through chemical synthesis. Structure/staining behavior relationships are discussed. By contrast to tyramine-fluorochrome conjugates employed in the catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) technique, reporting and anchoring functions are no longer separated. Consequently, enzymatic cross-linking of the substrate yields an altered fluorochrome with different properties. Spectral properties and anchoring capability are interdependent and influenced by environmental effects and pH. We screened overall staining capability of 4-hydroxy styryl derivatives using an iterative semi-empirical approach, and ascertained optimal substitution patterns for high PO staining specificity and high fluorescence response. Reliable staining performance was achieved with alkyl chains of short or medium length at the positively charged nitrogen, whereas introducing polar groups often impaired the staining specificity of PO. Catalytic cross-linking of heterocyclic 4-hydroxystyryl derivatives is a promising approach for permanent fluorescent staining of PO in fixed cells and tissues, and complements the CARD technique. Histochemical and immunohistochemical applications are presented using conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopes with different excitation sources. Spectral properties of selected stains are discussed. Novel stains also are of potential interest as "reactive-tracers" for living cells under multi-photon laser excitation conditions, because they exhibit pronounced nonlinear optical properties.

AB  - A high resolution calcareous nannofossil study associated with a geochemical analysis (major, trace elements, and carbon and oxygen isotope stratigraphies) was carried out in the Angles section (hemipelagic setting of the Vocontian basin, SE France) during the Valanginian positive carbon isotope excursion. The behaviour of calcareous nannofossil taxa in relation to fertility conditions was studied to elaborate new nutrient indices in this environment: a high nutrient index based on Biscutum spp., Discorhabdus rotatorius, Zerigrhabdotus fissus, (high fertility indicators) and Watznaueria barnesae (low fertility indicator); and a medium nutrient index based on Lithraphidites carniolensis (medium fertility indicator) and W barnesae (low fertility indicator). These two indices show a major fertilization from the Stephanophorus ammonite Zone to the Trinodosum ammonite Zone, with a maximum during the positive carbon isotope excursion.
   Since high values of the nutrient indices are in phase with high values of chemical elements related to terrigenous material and low values of the coccolith total abundance, it is proposed that pulses of detrital inputs into the basin triggered the nutrification which, in turn, caused a biocalcification crisis of the calcareous nannofossils. Nutrification is also responsible for the reef demise in the surrounded platforms, as indicated by the increased Sr/Ca seawater ratio at that time.
   The intensification of the Parana-Etendeka volcanic activity, triggering CO2 excess in the atmosphere, is probably responsible for an acceleration of the hydrological cycle, the increased weathering, and the subsequent higher terrigenous and nutrient transfer from continents to the Vocontian basin. In such a scenario, nutrification is a dominant factor controlling neritic and hemipelagic biocalcification. However, one cannot exclude that the global increase of atmospheric CO, could generate chemical changes of the sea-surface waters, acting with the nutrification, to modify the biocalcification of the carbonate producers.

AB  - Aim To investigate how local, regional and historical factors shape the herbaceous plant communities in fragmented riverine forests, and how the community composition and species richness of these fragments is related to the interplay between the environmental factors and specific plant life-trait combinations.
   Location Riverine forest fragments in the Grand-duche de Luxembourg.
   Methods Forest fragments were surveyed for their abundance in herbaceous plant species. All plant species where clustered into Emergent Groups (EG) by means of a formal classification based on 14 life-history traits. Within each EG, the local, regional and historical factors were related to the community composition using partial Canonical Correspondence Analyses (pCCA) and to the species richness using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). The EG colonization ability was characterized by means of logistic regressions.
   Results We defined and characterized seven EGs, among which three consisted of forest specialist species (barochorous perennials, short geophytes and zoochorous perennials), which exhibited specific life-trait combinations: large and short-lived seeds and/or vernal phenology. Differences in EG composition between forest fragments were mainly explained by local environmental factors such as soil productivity and pH. The richness of barochorous perennials and short geophytes was well predicted by the historical and regional factors. The colonization ability appeared very low for barochorous perennials and short geophytes.
   Main conclusions Local environmental conditions appear to drive the differentiation of the riverine forest plant communities owing to the specific habitat requirements of many forest species. Spatial and temporal forest discontinuities affect the richness of forest specialist species, due to dispersal and/or recruitment limitations. The emergent group approach enhances the understanding of the relative influence of local, regional and historical factors by distinguishing between forest specialists from generalists or 'matrix' species, which have a masking effect.

AB  - The Cordaitales, an extinct order of plants closely related to the conifers, occupied a wide range of environments during Pennsylvanian times including wetlands, drylands, and uplands. However, claims that some species of cordaitalean grew on marine-influenced coastal margins, and therefore represented the earliest known mangrove communities, have been met with scepticism. Based on new data from the Joggins Formation of Nova Scotia, the 'cordaitalean mangrove hypothesis' is reassessed. Small fossil trees in growth position are described from micro-tidal deposits, a sedimentary association inferred to have formed on the margins of a brackish epicontinental sea. The autochthonous trees, which are morphologically different from lycopsid and calamitean trees commonly observed with the Joggins Formation, are probably cordaitalean. This affinity is indicated. in part, by facies-associated parautochthonous remains, which comprise Cordaites leaves, Cordaicladus branches, Cardiocarpus seeds, Cordaianthus reproductive organs, and Dadoxylon wood, a distinctively cordaitalean assemblage. Scour-and-mound structures in beds surrounding the upright trunks show that cordaitalean trees were, at times, submerged in shallow, flowing water. However, Limnopus tetrapod trackways at other horizons demonstrate periodic emergence, indicating that water depths fluctuated in these coastal forests. Analysis of rooting patterns shows that trees persisted through flooding events, despite partial burial by sheets of very fine sandstone and siltstone, survival being facilitated through the development of an adventitious rooting system. However, two key adaptations to growth in marine-influenced soils commonly seen in modem mangrove trees (low shoot:root ratios and small leaves) are not present in the cordaitalean trees. Further-more, although the trees probably grew in close proximity to the brackish seacoast, direct evidence for marine influence in the fossil forest interval itself is lacking. Consequently, although the cordaitaleans were probably adapted to periodically submerged conditions, and additionally may have tolerated occasional brackish incursions, it is inappropriate to describe them as mangroves in the strict sense.

AB  - First and last occurrences of several Maastrichtian calcareous nannofossil species are shown to be diachronous across paleodepth and paleoenvironment using the graphic correlation method. Calcareous nannofossil assemblages examined from eleven cores from a deep- to shallow-water transect along the eastern United States Atlantic margin document that the first occurrence of Micula murus (Martini 1961) Bukry 1973 is diachronous, appearing 2.0 million years earlier in open ocean sites than in shallow marine sites. The first occurrence (170) of Lithraphidites kennethii Perch-Nielsen 1984 is also nonsynchronous, appearing in the deep ocean before its FO in neritic waters, The last occurrence (LO) of L. praequadratus Roth 1978 is diachronous across paleodepth, going locally extinct first in deeper water. The LO of Watznaueria bybelliae Self-Trail 1999 is also diachronous, going locally extinct first in shallow-water settings. Ceratolithoides amplector Burnett 1997, C. pricei Burnett 1997, C. self-trailiae Burnett 1997, C. ultimus Burnett 1997, Cribrocorona gallica (Stradner 1963) Pereli-Nielsen 1973, Micula praemurus (Bukry 1973) Stradner and Steinmetz 1984, Pseudomicula quadratus Perch-Nielsen et al. 1978, and Semihololithus spp. are present consistently in common to frequent abundances in ODP holes 1050C and 1052E on the Blake Nose, but they are rare or absent from neritic sections in Coastal Plain cores. It is apparent that these species flourished in an open ocean setting, suggesting that differences in assemblage abundance and diversity between deep ocean and nearshore areas were controlled by paleoceanographic factors. These species are not used for biostratigraphy, but may be useful indicators of open ocean conditions. The line of correlation (LOC) for nine Coastal Plain cores clearly defines the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) boundary unconformity at the top of the Maastrichtian section (Peedee Formation) and the Campanian-Maastrichtian (C/M) unconformity at the babe of the Maastrichtian section (Peedee/Donoho Creek formational contact). The K/T boundary unconformity is undulatory in nature; updip Maastrichtian sections have been stripped to a greater depth than the downdip sections. The uppermost Campanian, all of the lowermost Maastrichtian, and the basal upper Maastrichtian sediments are missing from the study area.

AB  - Under the influence of natural and sexual selection, males and females will often differ in the costs and benefits of achieving some particular body size; we might therefore expect to find them growing at different rates for different times, and dying on different schedules. The analysis of sexual dimorphism presented here assumes that life histories are optimized over three key variables: activity level (or "effort") during the juvenile stage, duration of the juvenile stage, and size at maturation. Reproduction is taken to be semelparous (or monocarpic), reproductive success is size dependent, and females are demographically dominant. Juvenile male and female life histories are assumed to be "structurally identical" (i.e., governed by identical functions of activity, size, and development time). Under these conditions, sexually dimorphic life histories readily arise when features of juvenile behavior and development are adjusted to maximize r in response to gender-specific selection pressures on adults.
   Some conclusions from the analysis are as follows:
   1) Seasonal constraints that force males and females to have equal development times cause differences between the sexes in other characteristics.
   2) The survival cost of greater body size generates a sex ratio at maturation favoring the smaller sex, consistent with much empirical evidence.
   3) The relationships among size, growth rate, and development time can be represented graphically in a way that permits sexually dimorphic life histories to be depicted and compared. Cases considered here indicate considerable diversity among these patterns.
   4) An allometric growth function is derived to facilitate graphical and mathematical analysis of body size.
   5) The reproductive size quotient, an indicator of reproductive potential relative to body size, is defined and shown to be a significant life history characteristic. Except when mortality rate is strongly related to size at maturation, or when generation time is fixed, the reproductive size quotient should be maximized, and these maxima should be the same for males and females.

LA  - Slovak
AB  - In the last quarter of the 20 th century the terms of disequilibrium and adaptation may be regarded as the most frequently used socio-economic categories. nt the same time the two categories are the basic categories that interpret and grasp all the economic phenomena in the most complex way.
   The inevitability of the study and application of adaptation processes has never been so urgent as in the 70s, 80s and 90s of this century, that is to say in times of deep disequilibriums, deformations and shocks.
   In the developed countries the business sphere is the basic subject of adaptation processes and mechanisms. If the firms ate adaptable and efficient, the whole economy is adaptable and efficient to the same extent.
   The paper presented describes the genesis of economic activities and motive powers of business development in the developed countries and presents an outline of selected indicators and business diagnosis techniques and some adaptation measures taken on the level of an enterprise as well.
   The main part of the paper is formed by the section devoted to adaptation Of the business sphere in the Slovak economy transformation.
   Under the conditions of restructuring the economy of the Slovak republic, of reprofiling its institutions, of renesance of economic tools and re-qualification of its man-power, which form basic problems raised by enormous social move in this country, the study of disequilibrium and adaptation mechanisms is very actual. St seems to he a pity that neither in our theory nor irt practice the indicated basic economic categories are given an appropriate attention and are ''superimposed'' by transformation problems and which is even the Norse case often by various pseudo-problems and ''child's diseased''.
   After the economic reform, started in 1989, it seemed to be clear that all the barriers opposing and damping the immediate impact of stimulations, both negative and positive, coming from outside of the economy, will sease soon.
   In the conclusion of the paper the author indicate; the barriers and reserves in formation of business environment in the Slovak republic.

AB  - Diet and nutrition are essential factors in promoting good health throughout life. Their role as determinants of chronic non-communicable diseases is widely recognized. Additionally, the demand for food involves relevant environmental burdens that have to be taken into account on the way to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. As an important part of nutrition policy, food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) have been revised. The key question is: Are environmental considerations being incorporated into them? To address this issue, we modeled and compared both the main environmental indicators in terms of carbon footprint (CF) and water footprint (WF), and nutritional quality (according to the Nutrient Rich Diet index, NRD9.3 and a health gain score) of dietary guidelines from Northern and Southern Europe and America. Particularly, the FBDGs compared were Dutch Dietary Guidelines (DDG), New Nordic Diet (NND), Spanish Strategy for Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity Prevention (NAOS), Mediterranean Diet (MD), Italian Dietary Guidelines (IDG) and American Dietary Guidelines (DGA).
   The IDG and MD offered the best profiles from a climate change perspective (2.04 and 2.21 kgCO(2)eq.day(-1)). Overall, DGA had the highest CF (2.98 kgCO(2)eq.day(-1)). WF presented greater fluctuations, not only due to daily-recommended amounts, but also because of different climate conditions and production systems of the reference countries. Hence, WF ranged from 1760 L.person(-1).day(-1) in IDG to 3181 L.person(-1).day(-1) in NAOS. Finally, the nutritional value of MD, which had the highest NRD9.3 (477) and health gain score (178), has been demonstrated when the comparison was made with DDG, the one with the lowest health gain score (97) and DGA, the worst in terms of NRD9.3 (391).
   To go ahead of the FBDGs that bet on all dimensions of sustainability, multi-criteria analysis is needed. Nutrition and environmental performance are not the only aspects of the problem; economy and sociocultural variables should be considered. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Y The selection of the appropriate harvest time and moisture content (MC) is very important for maize (Zea Mays L.) production, and selection is an essential step that balances the yield and comprehensive benefits. In this study, the process and final MC following a grain dry-down of sixteen maize hybrids was observed in 2017 and 2018. The Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model, which is commonly used to describe the equilibrium moisture content (M-eq) under controlled conditions, was used to evaluate the relationship between the field M-eq and the final MC. The results showed that the MC reached a stable level after a long dry-down period in the field, indicating that an equilibrium was present between the grain and the atmosphere. The MC at the equilibrium state represented two characteristics, a "hysteresis effect" and a "convergence effect", which were as follows: the change in MC always lagged behind the M-eq in the atmosphere; and the MC fluctuated continuously with the M-eq but could not reach its limit. The time of the "hysteresis effect" was estimated to be approximately 2-4 days. The time to reach equilibrium varied greatly in different maize hybrids, and it was related to the growth period and dry-down characteristics. Moreover, the various climatic types contributed to diverse M-eq values, and the humid climate had a higher Meq than the dry-cold climate. The distribution of M-eq values and the drying days on which the maize grain moisture content decreased from 30% to 25% (and 20%), guided the threshold for the delayed harvest of maize, as also estimated in various maize ecological areas in China. The optimal harvest time were significantly different in various regions due to different M-eq values. Therefore, we suggest that the estimation of the M-eq could be an important indicator for predicting the grain dry-down and harvest management strategies for a region.

AB  - Hydro-meteorological conditions facilitate transport of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to the nearshore environment, affecting recreational water quality. North Beach (Racine, Wisconsin, United States), is an exemplar public beach site along Lake Michigan, where precipitation-mediated surface runoff, wave encroachment, stormwater and tributary outflow were demonstrated to contribute to beach advisories. Multiple restoration actions, including installation of a stormwater retention wetland, were successfully deployed to improve recreational water quality. Implementation of molecular methods (e.g. human microbial source tracking markers and Escherichia coli (E. coli) qPCR) assisted in identifying potential pollution sources and improving public health response time. However, periodic water quality failures still occur. As local beach managers reassess restoration measures in response to climatic changes, use of expanded microbial methods (including bacterial community profiling) may contribute to a better understanding of these dynamic environments. In this 2-year study (2015 and 2019), nearshore/offshore Lake Michigan, stormwater, and tributary samples were collected to determine if, 1) the constructed wetland (similar to 50 m from the shoreline) continued to provide stormwater separation/retention and 2) mixing between onshore sources, Root River and Lake Michigan, was increasing due to rising precipitation/lake levels. Monthly rainfall totals were 1.5x higher in 2019 than 2015, coinciding with a 0.63 m lake-level rise. The prevalence of more intense, onshore winds also increased, facilitating interaction between potential reservoirs of FIB with nearshore water through wind driven waves and lake intrusion, e.g. beach sands and the adjacent Root River. While a strong relationship existed between wet weather wetland and North Beach nearshore E. coli concentrations (all sites), bacterial communities were strikingly different. Conversely, bacterial community overlap existed between the Root River mouth and nearshore/offshore sites. These results suggest the constructed wetland can accommodate the climate-related changes observed in this study. Future restoration activities could be directed towards upstream tributary sources in order to minimize microbial contaminants en tering Lake Michigan.

AB  - Vegetation degradation resulting from climate change and human activities in wet meadows is an important issue worldwide. This phenomenon is known to influence soil labile organic carbon (LOC) and enzyme activities due to changes in environmental conditions. However, little is known about the response of LOC and enzyme activities to vegetation degradation in high-altitude wet meadows. In this study, we examined the response of LOC and carbon-cycle enzyme activities to different intensities of vegetation degradation (i.e., non-degraded (ND), slightly degraded (SD) moderately degraded (MD), and heavily degraded (HD)) in a Tibetan wet meadow. The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities (i.e., cellulase, amylase and beta-glucosidase) were investigated in two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found that the content of soil SOC and LOC fractions declined with increasing soil depth in each degraded level except for HD. Vegetation degradation significantly decreased the amount of SOC at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, and this decrease was attributed to the relative reduction of carbon source input and higher carbon decomposition. Vegetation degradation also significantly reduced the contents of SWC, DOC, MBC, LFOC, amylase and beta-glucosidase in the topsoil layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm). However, the corresponding contents in deeper soil layers had no significant differences. In addition, the SWC, DOC, LFOC and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities were higher in 2016 than in 2017. Significant correlations were obtained between SWC, SOC, LOC fractions and enzyme activities. Soil moisture was found to be the main abiotic driver for variation of soil carbon and enzyme activities. Our results indicate that vegetation degradation in the Tibetan wet meadows decreased the quantity of topsoil labile carbon fractions and enzyme activities and heavily degraded vegetation may lead to a change of profile distribution in soil carbon pool.

AB  - Most studies on the health effects of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m) use indirect indicators, such as mortality and number of hospital visits. Recent research shows that biomarkers can also be used to evaluate the health effects of PM2.5; however, these biomarkers are not very common. Clinical laboratories can provide a significant amount of test data that have been proven to have important diagnostic value. Therefore, we use big data analysis methods to find the associations between clinical laboratory common test items and PM2.5 exposure. Data related to air pollution and meteorological information between 2014 and 2016 were obtained from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre and the China National Meteorological Information Center. Additionally, data of 27 common test items from the same period were collected from Changsha Central Hospital. Primary analyses included a generalized additive model to analyze the associations between PM2.5 concentration and common test items; the model was adjusted for time trends, weather conditions (temperature and humidity), and days of the week. Furthermore, we adjusted the effects of other air pollutants, such as PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3. 17 items such as TP, ALB, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, UREA, CREA, UA, GLU, LDL, WBC, K, Cl, Ca, TT, and FIB were significantly positively associated with PM2.5 concentration (P< 0.05) and have concentration-response relationship. After adjusting the effect of PM10+SO2+NO2+CO+O-3, TP, ALB, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, UREA, CREA, UA, GLU, WBC, Cl, and Ca were still significantly associated with PM2.5 concentration (P< 0.05). This current study suggested that clinical laboratory common test items may be used to assess and predict the health effects of PM2.5 on the population. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The evaluation of climate change impact on lakes typically relies on statistical methods like the reorganisation of organism communities (beta diversity) or transfer functions. A new method uses the silicification of diatoms that correlates with temperature and nutrients. The so-called silicification value (SiVa) overcomes problems of descriptive statistics or absent indicator species. Averaged over diatom communities, it related inversely to lake surface temperatures in mountain lakes. Hence, its change over time (delta SiVa) in a lake was hypothesised to reflect global change-driven lake warming quantitatively, which supposedly climaxes in shallow lakes. Sixteen different delta SiVa calculation approaches were tested. They (1) included or excluded planktic diatoms, (2) integrated fixed or variable time series referring to climate data or changes in diatom assemblages, (3) employed a top-bottom or regression approach and (4) expressed the delta SiVa as relative or absolute values. Subfossil diatom assemblages from 24 sediment cores from Bavarian and north Tyrolian mountain lakes served as sample set. All possible approaches were evaluated for their explanatory power for lake characteristics using GLMs. The top-bottom benthic approach with fixed climate data-based time series appeared to be the best model based on AIC and the extent of variable integration. In line with the hypothesis, the strongest decrease of delta SiVa was evident in most shallow lakes. Segmented regression further highlighted a positive correlation with depth if shallower than 10 m. By referring to the negative SiVa-summer temperature relation, delta SiVa also enabled the quantification of lake warming within the last decades, which ranged mainly between 0.1 degrees C and 1.1 degrees C per decade, consistent with existing literature. Additionally, a 100 year temperature reconstruction from a varved sediment core successfully validated the approach. Further studies may focus and extend its application to deeper lakes, but it can already serve as a powerful tool in palaeolimnological studies of shallow lakes like hard-water mountain lakes.

AB  - Phragmites australis litters were incubated in three waterlogged anoxic wetland soils of different nutrient status for 75 d, and litter nitrogen (N) dynamics were analyzed by elemental analyses and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). At the end of the incubation time, the N content in the remaining litter tissue had increased in most samples. Yet, the increase in N content was less pronounced when litters had been decomposed in a more-N-poor environment. FTIR was used to quantify the relative content of proteins in litter tissue and revealed a highly linear relationship between bulk N content and protein content. Changes in bulk N content thus paralleled and probably were governed by changes in litter protein content. Such changes are the result of two competing processes within decomposing litter: enzymatic protein depolymerization as a part of the litter breakdown process and microbial protein synthesis as a part of microbial biomass growth within the litter. Assuming microbial homeostasis, DNA signals in FTIR spectra were used to calculate the amount of microbial N in decomposed litter which ranged from 14% to 42% of the total litter N for all leaf samples. Microbial carbon (C) content and resultant calculated carbon use efficiencies (CUEs) indicate that microbial N in litter accumulated according to predictions of the stoichiometric decomposition theory. Subtracting microbial C and N contributions from litter, however, revealed site-dependent variations in the percentual amount of the remaining still-unprocessed plant N in litter compared to remaining plant C, an indicator for preferential protein depolymerization. For all leaf litters, the coefficient of preferential protein depolymerization (alpha), which relates N-compound depolymerization to C-compound depolymerization, ranged from 0.74-0.88 in a nutrient-rich detritus mud to 1.38-1.82 in Sphagnum peat, the most nutrient-poor substrate in this experiment. Preferential protein depolymerization from litter decomposing in Sphagnum peat leads to a gradual N depletion in the early phase of litter decomposition, which we propose as a preservation mechanism for vascular litter in Sphagnum peatlands.

AB  - Biodiagnostics of soil in a settlement with low technogenic impact was performed by the example of the urban settlement of Stepnoe. The number of microorganisms was evaluated in 30 soil samples by inoculation on solid nutrition media: on meat peptone agar for the calculation of the total heterotrophic microorganisms and on the corresponding selective media for hydrocarbon-oxidizing and iron-oxidizing microorganisms. We also analyzed the activity of several soil redox and hydrolytic enzymes (dehydrogenases, catalases, peroxidases, and invertases). The content of the mobile forms of copper, zinc, lead, cadmium, chromium, and nickel was determined to assess the anthropogenic impact on the soil, and the total soil contamination coefficient (Z(c)) was calculated. The excess of the MPC of mobile forms of Ni, Cu, and Pb was revealed in the area studied. In general, the total soil contamination coefficient did not exceed 16, indicating favorable environmental and geochemical conditions in the settlement. The analysis of the total number of heterotrophic microorganisms and the amounts of hydrocarbon-oxidizing and iron-oxidizing microorganisms showed deviations from the norm in some regions of the area surveyed, which pointed to anthropogenic transformation of the soil biocenoses. The maximum deviations were typical for the index of hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms, which pointed to soil contamination by hydrocarbons. Our data on the evaluation of the activity of indicator soil enzymes did not exclude possible functional disturbances in the soil. It was found that the activity of soil dehydrogenases and invertases corresponded to low and very low levels of soil enrichment with these enzymes. The activity of soil catalases and peroxidases corresponded to the moderate and high levels of the enzymes, which indicated the absence of pathological changes in the soil. It has been shown that the studied soil microbiological and biochemical parameters are promising for soil health biodiagnostics in areas with low anthropogenic impact.

AB  - We investigated deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) and slow mass movements in the southern Tien Shan Mountains front using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series data obtained by the ALOS/PALSAR satellite. DSGSD evolves with a variety of geomorphological changes (e.g. valley erosion, incision of slope drainage networks) over time that affect earth surfaces and, therefore, often remain unexplored. We analysed 118 interferograms generated from 20 SAR images that covered about 900 km(2). To understand the spatial pattern of the slope movements and to identify triggering parameters, we correlated surface dynamics with the tectono-geomorphic processes and lithologic conditions of the active front of the Alai Range. We observed spatially continuous, constant hillslope movements with a downslope speed of approximately 71 mm year(-1) velocity. Our findings suggest that the lithological and structural framework defined by protracted deformation was the main controlling factor for sustained relief and, consequently, downslope mass movements. The analysed structures revealed integration of a geological/structural setting with the superposition of Cretaceous-Paleogene alternating carbonatic and clastic sedimentary structures as the substratum for younger, less consolidated sediments. This type of structural setting causes the development of large-scale, gravity-driven DSGSD and slow mass movement. Surface deformations with clear scarps and multiple crest lines triggered planes for large-scale deep mass creeps, and these were related directly to active faults and folds in the geologic structures. Our study offers a new combination of InSAR techniques and structural field observations, along with morphometric and seismologic correlations, to identify and quantify slope instability phenomena along a tectonically active mountain front. These results contribute to an improved natural risk assessment in these structures. (c) 2019 The Authors. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Different strategies of reproductive mode, either oviparity (egg-laying) or viviparity (live-bearing), will be associated with a range of other life-history differences that are expected to affect patterns of ageing and longevity. It is usually difficult to compare the effects of alternative reproductive modes because of evolutionary and ecological divergence. However, the very rare exemplars of reproductive bimodality, in which different modes exist within a single species, offer an opportunity for robust and controlled comparisons. One trait of interest that could be associated with life history, ageing and longevity is the length of the telomeres, which form protective caps at the chromosome ends and are generally considered a good indicator of cellular health. The shortening of these telomeres has been linked to stressful conditions; therefore, it is possible that differing reproductive costs will influence patterns of telomere loss. This is important because a number of studies have linked a shorter telomere length to reduced survival. Here, we have studied maternal and offspring telomere dynamics in the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara). Our study has focused on a population where oviparous and viviparous individuals co-occur in the same habitat and occasionally interbreed to form admixed individuals. While viviparity confers many advantages for offspring, it might also incur substantial costs for the mother, for example require more energy. Therefore, we predicted that viviparous mothers would have relatively shorter telomeres than oviparous mothers, with admixed mothers having intermediate telomere lengths. There is thought to be a heritable component to telomere length; therefore, we also hypothesized that offspring would follow the same pattern as the mothers. Contrary to our predictions, the viviparous mothers and offspring had the longest telomeres, and the oviparous mothers and offspring had the shortest telomeres. The differing telomere lengths may have evolved as an effect of the life-history divergence between the reproductive modes, for example due to the increased growth rate that viviparous individuals may undergo to reach a similar size at reproduction.

AB  - Support practices (SPs) influence the magnitude of soil loss and can be readily influenced by human interventions to mitigate soil loss. The SPs factor is expressed as the P-factor in the widely used soil erosion model - the universal soil loss equation (USLE) - and its revised version. Although the effects of SPs on soil erosion are well recognized, the quantification of the P-factor for soil loss modeling remains challenging. This limitation of the P-factor particularly restricts the applicability of USLE-based models at large scales. Here, we analyzed the P-factor values in USLE-based models from 196 published articles. The results were as follows: (a) an increasing trend in the number of studies has been observed in recent years, especially at large scales; (b) the P-factor values for paddy fields, orchards, and croplands were 0.16 +/- 0.15, 0.47 +/- 0.12, and 0.49 +/- 0.21, respectively, and in terms of different types of SPs, the P-factor values for terracing, contouring, and strip-cropping were 0.28 +/- 0.18, 0.52 +/- 0.24, and 0.49 +/- 0.28, respectively; (c) various methods have been developed for P-factor qualification, although the methods that consider SP conditions were most frequently used in studies with relatively smaller areas (< 100 km(2)), suggesting that USLE-based models are in need of improvement via the quantification of the P-factor, particularly with respect to the regional and global scale; and (d) further improvements of the P-factor for soil erosion modeling should concentrate on building P-factor datasets at the regional level according to data on the effectiveness of SPs on soil loss control based on field experiments in published articles, using advanced image processing techniques based on higher-resolution satellite imagery and developing proxy indicators for P-factors at large scales.

AB  - Because of extensive Pleistocenic glaciations, which erased most of the previously existing soils, slope steepness and climatic conditions favoring soil erosion, most soils observed in the Alps (and in other mid-latitude mountain ranges) have developed during the Holocene or Late Glacial period. However, in few sites, particularly in the outermost sections of the Alpine range, Pleistocene glaciers covered only small and scattered surfaces, and ancient soils could be preserved for long periods on stable surfaces. In many cases, these soils retain good memories of Quaternary periglacial activity, which have never been characterized on the Alpine range. Based on both geomorphological and pedological interpretations, this work aims to investigate these environments, providing, therefore, new evidences to support paleoclimate reconstructions on the Alps.
   We described and sampled soils on stable surfaces in the Upper Tanaro valley, Ligurian Alps (Southwestern Piemonte, Italy). The sampling sites were between 600 and 1600 m a.s.l., under present day lower montane Ostrya carpinifolia, montane Fagus sylvatica forests or montane heath/grazed grassland, on quartz-rich substrata.
   The surface morphology often showed strongly developed fossil periglacial morphologies such as large-scale patterned ground, blockfields/blockstreams or solifluction sheets.
   The soils preserved in such Quaternary periglacial landforms normally showed stratification of different layers (units), separated by structural discontinuities, evidencing different depositional settings and different pedogenic development degree. A strong cryogenic granulometric sorting characterized all the observed soils/paleosols, with silt-enriched horizons and lateral differentiation of sand- and stone-rich parts and fine enriched ones; organic matter was irregularly distributed at depth as a result of past cryoturbation. Compact and dense layers with strong platy/lenticular structural aggregation, wedge casts and large-scale cryoturbations were described below fixed depths in all soil profiles.
   Thus, surface morphology and soil properties suggest the presence of permafrost during cold Pleistocene phases, with two main active layer thicknesses at 60-120 and 100-160 cm depths respectively.

AB  - In the conditions of the active development of the market of logistic services, the growth of the cost of fuel and lubricants, as well as the increase of environmental requirements for the operation of the motor transport park an important reserve for improving the efficiency of enterprises and reducing the anthropogenic impact on the environment is to optimize their commodity flows. The purpose of the article is to develop a model of optimization of commodity flows of enterprises of the bakery industry, which allows to ensure timely delivery of raw materials and products with minimization of economic and environmental costs. Methodology. The methodological basis of investigation was a linear programming method adapting the transport task to the specifics of the baking industry. Authors developed the model of optimization the commodity flows of the enterprises is based on the criteria of the efficiency of the logistic using the system of indicators: economic (costs for distribution and delivery of products) and environmental (costs for reducing the anthropogenic load on the environment). It is proposed to determine the optimal sales channels of products based on the integral indicator of the efficiency of organization of commodity flows, which includes economic and environmental efficiency, weighted by the factors of importance established by expert way. Results. The developed logistic model of optimization of commodity flow has been tested on a number of bakery enterprises. As a result, an optimal plan for delivering products has been formed taking into account the economic and environmental factors. The advantage of the model is the ability to apply it to the initial flow of material flows and reverse flow (reversible logistics, or logistics of bread, bakery and flour products). The practical application of the developed model at the enterprises of the bakery industry will reduce the logistical and environmental costs, ensure the reliability of deliveries, reduce the human impact from mobile sources, meet demand, taking into account the requirements of consumers regarding the quality and environmental friendliness of products and increase its competitiveness.

AB  - In silico methods are typically underrated in the current risk assessment paradigm, as evidenced by the recent document from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on animal alternatives, in which quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were practically used only as a last resort. Their primary use is still to provide supporting evidence for read-across strategies or to add credence to experimental results of unknown or limited validity (old studies, studies without good laboratory practices [GLPs], limited information reported, etc.) in hazard assessment, but under the pressure of increasing burdens of testing, industry and regulators alike are at last warming to them. Nevertheless, their true potential for data-gap filling and for resolving sticking points in risk assessment methodology and beyond has yet to be recognized. We postulate that it is possible to go beyond the level of simply increasing confidence to the point of using in silico approaches to accurately predict results that cannot be resolved analytically. For example, under certain conditions it is possible to obtain meaningful results by in silico extrapolation for tests that would be technically impossible to conduct in the laboratory or at least extremely challenging to obtain reliable results. The following and other concepts are explored in this article: the mechanism of action (MechoA) of the substance should be determined, as an aid verifying that the QSAR model is applicable to the substance under review; accurate QSARs should be built with high-quality data that were not only curated but also validated with expert judgment; although a rule of thumb for acute to chronic ratios appears applicable for nonpolar narcotics, it seems unlikely that a "one-value-fits-all" answer exists for other MechoAs; a holistic approach to QSARs can be employed (via reverse engineering) to help validate or invalidate an experimental endpoint value on the basis of multiple experimental studies.

AB  - The need for organic recycling is justified in the case of poultry waste because after ensuring hygienization there is a chance of obtaining a compost with substantial fertilizer value. Organic recycling of slaughter waste has its justification in sustainable development and retardation of resources. In the research being described, composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste with maize straw was carried out. Combinations with fodder yeast and postcellulose lime were also introduced in order to modify chemical and physicochemical properties of the mixtures. The experiment was carried out within 110 days in 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 m laboratory reactors. Temperature of the biomass was recorded during composting, and the biomass was actively aerated through a perforated bottom.
   Composting of substrates selected in such a way caused losses of some elements in gaseous form, an increase in concentration of other elements, and changes in relationships between elements. The ability to select substrates influences compost quality. This ability is determined by chemical indicators. Among other things, compost evaluation based on carbon to nitrogen ratio shows the intensity of the composting process and possible nitrogen losses. The addition of slaughter waste to maize straw reduced the content of individual fractions of carbon in the composts, whereas the addition of postcellulose lime intensified that process. The addition of fodder yeast significantly increased the phosphorus content in the compost. Since iron compounds were used in the processing of poultry carcasses, composts that were based on this material had an elevated iron content. The applied postcellulose lime significantly increased the copper, zinc, chromium, nickel, and lead contents. Proper selection of substrates for composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste allows to obtain a compost with chemical properties that create favorable conditions for natural application of that compost. Addition of large quantities of postcellulose lime to the composting process leads to obtaining an organic-mineral substratum for cultivation or to obtaining an agent that improves soil properties.

AB  - Introduction
   Projected temperature rise in the upcoming years due to climate change has increased interest in studying the effects of heat stress in dairy cows. Environmental indices are commonly used for detecting heat stress, but have been used mainly in studies focused on the productivity-related effects of heat stress. The welfare approach involves identifying physiological and behavioural measurements so as to start heat stress mitigation protocols before the appearance of impending severe health or production issues. Therefore, there is growing interest in studying the effects of heat stress on welfare. This systematic review seeks to summarise the animal-based responses to heat stress (physiological and behavioural, excluding productivity) that have been used in scientific literature.
   Methods
   Using systematic review guidelines set by PRISMA, research articles were identified, screened and summarised based on inclusion criteria for physiology and behaviour, excluding productivity, for animal-based resilience indicators. 129 published articles were reviewed to determine which animal-based indicators for heat stress were most frequently used in dairy cows.
   Results
   The articles considered report at least 212 different animal-based indicators that can be aggregated into body temperature, feeding, physiological response, resting, drinking, grazing and pasture-related behaviour, reactions to heat management and others. The most common physiological animal-based indicators are rectal temperature, respiration rate and dry matter intake, while the most common behavioural indicators are time spent lying, standing and feeding.
   Conclusion
   Although body temperature and respiration rate are the animal-based indicators most frequently used to assess heat stress in dairy cattle, when choosing an animal-based indicator for detecting heat stress using scientific literature to establish thresholds, characteristics that influence the scale of the response and the definition of heat stress must be taken into account, e.g. breed, lactation stage, milk yield, system type, climate region, bedding type, diet and cooling management strategies.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist, is a promising treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Its mechanism of action in this condition is unknown. GABA-B receptors interact with many biological systems potentially involved in AUD, including transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems. Preclinical studies have shown that GABA-B receptors are involved in memory storage and retrieval, reward, motivation, mood and anxiety; neuroimaging studies in humans show that baclofen produces region-specific alterations in cerebral activity; GABA-B receptor activation may have neuroprotective effects; baclofen also has anti-inflammatory properties that may be of interest in the context of addiction. However, none of these biological effects fully explain the mechanism of action of baclofen in AUD. Data from clinical studies have provided a certain number of elements which may be useful for the comprehension of its mechanism of action: baclofen typically induces a state of indifference toward alcohol; the effective dose of baclofen in AUD is extremely variable from one patient to another; higher treatment doses correlate with the severity of the addiction; many of the side effects of baclofen resemble those of alcohol, raising the possibility that baclofen acts as a substitution drug; usually, however, there is no tolerance to the effects of baclofen during long-term AUD treatment. In the present article, the biological effects of baclofen are reviewed in the light of its clinical effects in AUD, assuming that, in many instances, clinical effects can be reliable indicators of underlying biological processes. In conclusion, it is proposed that baclofen may suppress the Pavlovian association between cues and rewards through an action in a critical part of the dopaminergic network (the amygdala), thereby normalizing the functional connectivity in the reward network. It is also proposed that this action of baclofen is made possible by the fact that baclofen and alcohol act on similar brain systems in certain regions of the brain.

AB  - The maintenance of biodiversity in forestlands has become one of the major concerns of global forestry. Regarding the situation of Italy, the Mediterranean forests belong to the less studied in Europe. There is an urgent need to individuate reliable indicators that help to assess forest features important for their future management and biodiversity. We focused our study on the largest forest hotspot of Southern Italy, the Sila National Park in Calabria, an upland covered by 130,000 ha of forest dominated by Calabrian black pine (Pinus nigra calabrica).
   We chose to test saproxylic beetle species as possible indicators of biodiversity and management. The main condition was the use of method and species useful also for forest managers. Data on the occurrence of 75 wood inhabiting beetle species of body size approx. 1 cm and larger have been collected in 2010-2015 at 96 forest sites by multiple methods finally simplified in standardized visual census.
   For the suitability of individual species for indication, we used a novel hierarchical approach: starting from a model for the whole community. Target species were selected if they occupied more than 20% of the sites and non-obligate saproxylics were eliminated. These species' responses were compared with that of the whole community and only concordant species were maintained as possible indicators. Species whose presence marked significantly species-rich habitats have evaluated as biodiversity indicators. Finally, conservation value model was used for validation.
   Two saproxylics met all the stepwise criteria used: Cucujus cinnaberinus and Clinidium canaliculatum. They provide a simple and useful tool for periodic diversity monitoring in nature reserve networks. Choosing easily identifiable species, rapidly detectable in a visual census as biodiversity indicators may greatly facilitate less expensive forest monitoring also by unspecialized forest managers.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the adverse effects of wastewater effluents on freshwater crucian carp, Carassius auratus, inhabiting Sincheon stream using the integrated biomarker response (IBR) at the genotoxic (micronucleus [MN] test), oxidative stress (activity of catalase [CAT] and glutathione S-transferase [GST], and level of lipid peroxidation [LPO]), histopathological (degree of tissue changes [DTC]), and physiological (condition factor [CF] and liver somatic index [LSI]) levels. The CF and LSI were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced in fish from downstream sites (DS1 and DS2) as compared to that of upstream (US) fish samples. Moreover, a significant increase in morphometric indices (DTC) was observed in C. auratus collected from downstream sites (p < 0.05) and histopathological responses showed the degree of pathogenicity in the order of liver > kidney > gills. The activities of CAT, GST, and LPO in fish from the DS1 and DS2 sites were notably increased in gills, liver, and kidney compared to that of fish from the US site. Additionally, the MN test level in C auratus from the DS1 and DS2 were significantly increased (p < 0.05) when compared with that of the US site. Considering the higher bio-accumulation of Cd, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Pb in gills, liver, and kidney of C. auratus collected from down-stream sites compared to that of the upstream site (p < 0.05), the observed toxicity was likely attributable to metal accumulation. The multi-level IBR index was higher at the DS1 site (15.08) than at the DS2 (1.02) and the reference US (0.00) sites. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that wastewater effluent discharge induces significant DNA damage, oxidative stress, and tissue injuries in C. auratus and suggested that the multi-level IBR approach should be used to quantify these effects on fish in streams and rivers.

AB  - Lake Gjerstadvann is a dimictic. oligotrophia, slightly acidified boreal lake in southern Noway (northwest Europe). The planktonic rotifer community of this lake was studied quantitatively during one year hr order to investigate the impacts of the local environment and biotic interactions on seasonal succession and habitat selection. Pure suspension feeders (mainly Kemtella spp., Conochilus spp., and Kellicottia longispina) together with raptorial graspers or specialised feeders (mainly Poharthra spp., and Collotheca spp,) dominated the rotifer community over prolonged periods, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous species (mainly Asplanchnapriodonta) were extremely uncommon. Low bicarbonate buffering capacity resulted in a distinctive seasonal oscillating pH between 5.0 and 5.6, defining a special acid-transition lake category. The pH values were highest in the productive period during summer, and lowest during ice break-up coinciding with the peak reactive aluminium concentrations of 250-300 mu g L-1. As in typical Norwegian boreal perch lakes, the most abundant cladoceran was Bosmina longispina due to perch predation on the genus Daphnia. Rotifer community structure was significantly related to temperature and oxygen (P=0.001 and P=0.022), illustrating the important effects of the seasonal cycle and vertical density stratification. The most significant competition indicator species were B, longispina and Eudiapiomus gracilis (both with P=0.001). A variance partitioning indicated that 14% of the total community composition variance could only he explained by biotic interactions, while 19% of the variance could be attributed to environmental gradients. Of the variance, 23% could not be resolved between biotic interactions and environmental gradients, while a residual of 44% was not explainable by any of the variables. Acid conditions alone cannot account for all the observed changes in the rotifer community of this lake with low humic content, since resource limitation and food competition are also important factors shaping rotifer population dynamics and the community structure.

AB  - Fresh and freeze-dried sample sections of the coastal macroalgae, Fucus serratus and F. vesiculosus, and the brackish water macroalga, F. ceranoides, have been analysed for trace elements by field-portable-X-ray fluorescence (FP-XRF) spectrometry using a Niton XL3t in a low density mode with thickness correction. When analysed fresh in a laboratory accessory stand for a period of 200 seconds, As, Br, Fe and Zn were registered in the apex, mid-frond and lower stipe of all species, with detection limits of a few mu g g(-1) (As) or a few tens of mu g g(-1), (Br, Fe, Zn); when analysed dry under the same conditions, concentrations returned were systematically higher and Cu and Pb were detected in a number of F. ceranoides sections. Concentrations arising from both approaches on a dry weight basis were highly correlated, with deviations from unit slope attributed to the absorption of fluorescent X-rays by internal and surficial water when analysed fresh. With algorithms correcting for the effects. of water on mass and X-ray absorption, sections of E vesiculosus and F. ceranoides were analysed in situ with the XRF connected to a mobile stand and laptop. Dry weight concentrations returned for As and Zn were significantly correlated with respective concentrations subsequently determined by ICP-MS following acid digestion and with a slope close to unity; lower concentrations of Fe returned by ICP were attributed to the incomplete acid digestion of silt particles that evaded an initial cleaning step, while Br concentrations could not be verified independently because of loss of volatile forms during digestion. The in situ determination of trace elements in fucoids by FP-XRF provides a rapid and non-destructive means of monitoring environmental quality and identifying hot-spots of contamination, and enables a research strategy to be developed iteratively that is informed by immediate results.

AB  - We used the marine bivalve (Mytilus galloprovincialis) to assess a range of biological or biomarker responses following exposure to a model-engineered nanoparticle, C-60 fullerene, either alone or in combination with a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo(alpha) pyrene [B(alpha) P]. An integrated biomarker approach was used that included: (i) determination of 'clearance rates' (a physiological indicator at individual level), (ii) histopathological alterations (at tissue level), (iii) DNA strand breaks using the comet assay (at cellular level) and (iv) transcriptional alterations of p53 (anti-oncogene) and ras (oncogene) determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (at the molecular/genetic level). In addition, total glutathione in the digestive gland was measured as a proxy for oxidative stress. Here, we report that mussels showed no significant changes in 'clearance rates' after 1 day exposure, however significant increases in 'clearance rates' were found following exposure for 3 days. Histopathology on selected organs (i. e. gills, digestive glands, adductor muscles and mantles) showed increased occurrence of abnormalities in all tissues types, although not all the exposed organisms showed these abnormalities. Significantly, increased levels of DNA strand breaks were found after exposure for 3-days in most individuals tested. In addition, a significant induction for p53 and ras expression was observed in a tissue and chemical-specific pattern, although large amounts of inter-individual variability, compared with other biomarkers, were clearly apparent. Overall, biological responses at different levels showed variable sensitivity, with DNA strand breaks and gene expression alterations exhibiting higher sensitivities. Furthermore, the observed genotoxic responses were reversible after a recovery period, suggesting the ability of mussels to cope with the toxicants C-60 and/or B(alpha) P under our experimental conditions. Overall, in this comprehensive study, we have demonstrated mussels as a suitable model marine invertebrate species to study the potential detrimental effects induced by possible genotoxicants and toxicants, either alone or in combinations at different levels of biological organisation (i. e. molecular to individual levels).

AB  - While investigation of the microbiome on natural oral surfaces has generated a wealth of information, few studies have examined the microbial communities colonizing dentures and their relationship to oral health. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the bacterial community associated with dentures and remaining teeth in healthy individuals and patients with denture stomatitis. The microbiome compositions of matched denture and tooth plaque samples of 10 healthy individuals and 9 stomatitis patients were determined by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The microbial communities colonizing dentures and remaining teeth in health and disease were very similar to each other. Matched denture and tooth samples from the same individuals shared a significantly higher percentage of identical phylotypes than random pairs of samples from different study participants. Despite these overall similarities, several bacterial phylotypes displayed discrete healthand stomatitis-associated denture colonization, while others were distinct in health and disease independently of the surface. Certain phylotypes exhibited differential colonization of dentures and teeth independently of denture health status. In conclusion, denture and natural tooth surfaces in health and stomatitis harbor similar bacterial communities. Individual-related rather than surface-specific factors play a significant role in the bacterial phylotype composition colonizing dentures and teeth. This individual-specific mutual influence on denture and tooth surface colonization could be an important factor in maintaining oral health in denture wearers. Discrete differences in colonization patterns for distinct genera and phylotypes warrant further studies regarding their potential involvement or utility as specific indicators of health and disease development in denture-wearing individuals.
   IMPORTANCE Denture stomatitis is a prevalent inflammatory condition of the mucosal tissue in denture wearers that is triggered by microorganisms. While Candida has been extensively studied for its role in stomatitis etiology, the bacterial component largely remains to be investigated. Our data show that certain types of bacteria are significantly associated with denture health and disease. Furthermore, the bacterial communities residing on the teeth and dentures of the same person are similar to each other independently of the surface, and thus, denture health could impact the maintenance of remaining teeth and vice versa.

AB  - The Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary extinction event is inextricably linked to the Chicxulub impact. Environmental changes like sea level changes and changes in food supply prior to or after the impact could however have contributed to the biotic turnover. In this study, benthic foraminifera from two cores from the Brazos River area in Texas are quantitatively analyzed in order to reconstruct environmental changes across the K/Pg boundary. Cluster analysis as well as non-metric multidimensional scaling reveals three distinct benthic foraminiferal assemblages: an upper Maastrichtian assemblage, a post-impact assemblage, and a lower Danian assemblage. The rather uniform upper Maastrichtian assemblage at Brazos River, composed of e.g. Clavulinoides midwayensis, Gavelinella dumblei, Cibicidoides harperi, Gyroidinoides aequilateralis and Bulimina kickapooensis, indicates a stable paleodepth of about 75-100 m up to the K/Pg boundary. Food supply indicators such as percentage Buliminaceae and foraminiferal numbers suggest a relatively low and stable food supply during this interval. Environmental disruption caused by the Chicxulub impact led to the settlement of a typical pioneer assemblage, characterized by endobenthic morphotypes such as Ammobaculites spp. and Pseudouvigerina naheolensis. During the early Danian, the typical Midway-type benthic foraminiferal shelf fauna (e.g. Alabamina midwayensis, Anomalinoides acutus, Gyroidinoides subangulatus, Praebulimina carseyae and Cibicidoides alleni) developed, indicating a paleodepth of 75-100 m. No clear water depth changes can be derived from the benthic foraminiferal record during this interval, although the sedimentary record suggests a shallowing followed by a transgressive pulse in Zone P1a. Food supply indicators suggest a lower food supply in the early Danian than during the upper Maastrichtian. Because of the stability of the late Maastrichtian environment we conclude that environmental disruption caused by the impact was most likely the principal cause of the benthic foraminiferal turnover across the K/Pg boundary observed at Brazos River.

AB  - Phytotoxic ozone (O-3) levels have been recorded in the Metropolitan Region of So Paulo (MRSP). Flux-based critical levels for O-3 through stomata have been adopted for some northern hemisphere species, showing better accuracy than with accumulated ozone exposure above a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40). In Brazil, critical levels for vegetation protection against O-3 adverse effects do not exist. The study aimed to investigate the applicability of O-3 deposition model (Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange (DO3SE)) to an O-3-sensitive tropical tree species (Psidium guajava L. 'Paluma') under the MRSP environmental conditions, which are very unstable, and to assess the performance of O-3 flux and AOT40 in relation to O-3-induced leaf injuries. Stomatal conductance (g (s)) parameterization for 'Paluma' was carried out and used to calculate different rate thresholds (from 0 to 5 nmol O-3 m(-2) projected leaf area (PLA) s(-1)) for the phytotoxic ozone dose (POD). The model performance was assessed through the relationship between the measured and modeled g (sto). Leaf injuries were analyzed and associated with POD and AOT40. The model performance was satisfactory and significant (R (2) = 0.56; P < 0.0001; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 116). As already expected, high AOT40 values did not result in high POD values. Although high POD values do not always account for more injuries, POD0 showed better performance than did AOT40 and other different rate thresholds for POD. Further investigation is necessary to improve our model and also to check if there is a critical level of ozone in which leaf injuries arise. The conclusion is that the DO3SE model for 'Paluma' is applicable in the MRSP as well as in temperate regions and may contribute to future directives.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a key concern of the mining industry due to its impact on the quality of water and soils surrounding mine waste deposits. Acid mine drainage derives from the oxidation of metal sulphides, e.g. pyrite (FeS2), exposed to oxygen and water. The leachate acidity is capable of releasing heavy metals contained in the mining waste rock, which can affect water quality and lead to metal enrichment in sediments and potentially resulting in ecosystem degradation. Predicting tailings leachate pH is key to the management of sulfide-bearing mine wastes and is an emerging remote sensing application with limited studies having been realized. Such a capability would supplement traditional methods (i.e. ground surveys) that are challenging to implement due to the extent and large volume of mine waste.
   This study reports regional scale tailings mineral maps generated from airborne hyperspectral information of the Sotiel-Migollas complex in Spain and pinpoints sources of AMD. The extraction of spectral endmembers from imagery revealed twenty six endmembers for tailings material that represent mostly mineral mixtures. From these, eleven spectral groups were defined, each encompassing minor variations in mineral mixtures. The mineral maps resulting from the use of these endmembers for the detailed investigation of four tailings serve as indicators of the metal, sulphate, and pH levels of the AMD solution at the time of mineral precipitation. Predicted mineralogy was assessed using spectra from samples collected in the field and associated X-ray diffraction measurements.
   We also discuss the relative merits of the minerals maps of this study and soil leachate pH maps that we previously reported for the same locality using the same airborne data. The pH maps tend to provide predictions consistent with the mineralogy predicted from the mineral maps and the field and laboratory evidence. The pH maps offer information on the pH conditions of the tailings thus giving an insight on the different types of oxidation reactions that may occur. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Glass transition temperature is a main indicator for amorphous polymers and biological macromolecules as materials, and would be a key for understanding the role of trehalose in protecting proteins and cells against desiccation. In this study, we measured the glass transition temperature by differential scanning calorimetry of dried lens tissues as a model of a whole biological tissue to know the effect of pretreatment by trehalose and other sugars.
   Methods: Isolated porcine lenses were incubated with saline, 100 or 1000 mM concentration of trehalose, maltose, or cyclic tetrasaccharide dissolved in saline at room temperature for 150 minutes. The solutions were removed and all samples were dried at room temperature in a desiccator until no weight change. The dried tissues were ground into powder and placed in a measuring pan for differential scanning calorimetry.
   Results: The glass transition temperature of the dried lens tissues, as a mean and standard deviation, was 63.0 +/- 6.4 degrees C (n = 3) with saline pretreatment; 53.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C and 56.3 +/- 2.7 degrees C (n = 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000 mM trehalose pretreatment; 56.0 +/- 1.6 degrees C and 55.8 +/- 1.1 degrees C (n = 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000 mM maltose pretreatment; 60.0 +/- 8.8 degrees C and 59.2 +/- 6.3 degrees C (n = 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000 mM cyclic tetrasaccharide pretreatment. The glass transition temperature appeared lower, although not significantly, with trehalose and maltose pretreatments than with saline and cyclic tetrasaccharide pretreatments (P > 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). The glass transition temperature of the dried lens tissues with trehalose pretreatment appeared more noticeable on the thermogram, compared with other pretreatments.
   Conclusions: The glass transition temperature was measured for the first time in the dried lens tissues as an example of a whole biological tissue and might provide a basis for tissue preservation in the dried condition.

AB  - Carbon storage in forest aboveground biomass is a critical, yet difficult, component of the global carbon cycle to estimate. Canopy height, a key indicator of carbon storage, can be estimated from Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) waveforms collected by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Although globally distributed, GLAS does not provide spatially exhaustive coverage. Therefore, accurate methods of extrapolation are necessary to produce wall-to-wall global canopy height maps from these data. In this analysis, we compare two of these global GLAS-derived height products to canopy height estimates derived from 25 000 km of discrete return airborne Lidar data over Canada's boreal forests. We selected the 95th percentile of first return height from airborne Lidar as a measure of canopy height to relate against estimates from the global GLAS-derived products. The agreement between the global GLAS-derived products and airborne Lidar-derived height estimates varied between the two products (average ecozone RMSE = 3.9 and 7.4 m), demonstrating that differences in data selection, processing, and extrapolation can influence height estimates derived from GLAS data. Where large differences existed between the global GLAS-derived products and the airborne Lidar-derived height estimates, the GLAS-derived products tended to predict taller canopies. Removing GLAS waveforms on steep terrain appeared to be a superior approach to reducing errors in height estimates, as the global GLAS-derived product that filtered these waveforms was in closer agreement with airborne Lidar-derived height estimates in regions of rough terrain (RMSE = 3.2-8.5 m compared with 8.1-13.8 m). Differences in the spatial resolution of canopy height estimates, coupled with varying definitions of canopy height within each product, should be considered when interpreting the results of this analysis. Investigating the relationship between small-footprint Lidar data and published canopy height products can identify the approaches that lead to the most accurate estimates of aboveground biomass and can help determine why discrepancies in height estimates exist between various model approaches, data and underlying environmental conditions.

AB  - The application of ostracod shell chemistry as a paleoenvironmental tool has grown within the past decades. Most studies have investigated Mg and Sr in ostracod shells as proxies for temperature and salinity, and the use of a wide range of trace elements as prospective paleoenvironmental indicators has yet to be developed for lacustrine systems. Only a few preliminary studies have used trace metals in paleolimnological studies such as Cd, Ba and Zn as paleonutrient indicators, or Mn, Fe and U as redox and oxygenation indicators. This paper reviews the state of the art of geochemical analyses in microfossils such as ostracods, foraminifera, and corals, and provides insights in new trace element proxies with the goal to promote the use of trace elements in ostracod shells as paleoenvironmental proxies.
   In paleoceanography, foraminifera and corals are most prominently used to reconstruct past climate conditions. Well-established proxies such as delta O-18, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca provide information about changes in sea surface temperatures. In addition, a great number of new proxies have been developed recently, such as radiogenic isotopes and redox sensitive trace elements. In paleolimnology, ostracod shell chemistry is widely used to assess paleohydrological changes. Reconstruction of temperature and salinity changes in lake environments is often achieved by oxygen isotopes as well as Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios, but depending on the hydrological and geological settings of the lake system, local calibrations are needed to assess which proxy is suited to reflect which processes.
   New proxies need to be tested by novel techniques that recently have become available. Compared to conventional instrumentation used in ostracod shell chemistry, methods such as Laser Ablation ICP-MS and NanoSIMS allow single shell analysis and provide high-resolution data. The potential of ostracods in paleolimnology is not yet fully assessed, but can be developed by learning from paleoceanographic studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused significant declines in biodiversity. Agri-environmental schemes (AES), including organic farming, are thought to benefit biodiversity. However, under similar production conditions and in comparable locations and schemes, farms are not managed in the same way, with variable consequences for production and the environment. Understanding farmer attitude, behaviour and knowledge of the environment and their impacts on biodiversity may help us understand the variable impacts of AES on biodiversity. We combined a sociological survey of nine organic and eight conventional dairy farmers (measuring environmental and achievement attitudes; environmental and production-orientated behaviours and environmental knowledge), in Ireland, witha biodiversity (using plant richness as an indicator) assessment of their farms. We found higher plant richness on organic farms than conventional. Organic and conventional farmers had similar attitudes to farming achievement and the environment but organic farmers were better informed about environmental issues and carried out more environmentally orientated behaviours. Biodiversity was positively related to the amount of environmentally orientated behaviours and negatively related to production-orientated behaviours carried out on farms. Organic farmers who had more positive attitudes to the environment and were better informed about it had higher biodiversity on their farms compared to less positively inclined, less informed organic farmers. We show disparities between attitude and actual behaviour in relation to the environment, with organic farmers sharing similar attitudes to conventional farmers, but more prepared to inform themselves about and carry out environmentally friendly farming. Results indicate that organic farming and environmentally orientated behaviours benefit biodiversity and that there is an important link between farmer environmental attitudes and knowledge and the beneficial effects of organic farming on biodiversity. We encourage conservation orientated thinking and better environmental education among farmers, including those who already participate in an AES. This way, the benefits of the AES for the environment maybe maximised. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phytoplankton abundance, composition and size-fractionated chlorophyll a (micro-, nano- and pico-chl. a) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), South China were assessed in three surveys (Aug. 2010, Jan. 2011 and Aug. 2011) to identify key environmental indicators that shape their distribution patterns. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) showed that the PRE formed three regional clusters that were characterized by a transition from dominant freshwater species to estuarine diatoms in normal summer flow conditions (Aug. 2010). With a reduced river flow in winter (Jan. 2011), the inner estuary was categorized as one group marked by the predominance of the nanoflagellate, Plagioselmis prolonga. This small-sized cryptophyte was first recorded in the PRE and was likely to outcompete other phytoplankton species in turbid or well-mixed waters. During the extreme drought of summer of 2011 (Aug. 2011), the estuarine plume was limited and regional division by MDS was similar to winter patterns, as some marine species were observed in the upper estuary. We considered that the higher phytoplankton density in the summer of 2011 was presumably a combined effect of longer residence time and higher phosphate concentration. With respect to the size-fractionated phytoplankton composition, our results showed that almost half of the chl. a in the estuary was contained in microplankton particles, while the proportion of pico-chl. a increased from the upstream of the PRE towards the estuary boundary (Wanshan Islands). Furthermore, phytoplankton abundance, three size classes of chl. a and environmental factors were explored by principal component regression (PCR) analysis. In three surveys, pico-chl. a was negatively correlated with the first principal component (PCL, positively loaded with salinity and inversely with inorganic nutrients), which indicated a negative influence of the riverine and coastal waters on picophytoplankton and the specific oligotrophic niche of picophytoplankton. Similarly, PC1 was also considered as the key environmental variable basis controlling micro-chl. a in summer of 2010, while in the summer of 2011, zooplankton and copepods were positively associated with phytoplankton abundance, suggesting a resource effect of phytoplankton on zooplankton development.

AB  - The scope of the present investigation was to detect maturation processes in wheat seed non-destructively with special respect to changes in moisture, carbohydrate and protein content and natural hydration/dehydration processes. During seed development, many biochemical, enzymatic and morphological changes occur under highly hydrated conditions.
   The ratio of different water species (high density water (HDW) with weaker hydrogen bonding and low density water (LDW) with stronger hydrogen bonding) changed drastically during maturation and their transitions could be followed with high sensitivity in specific regions of NIR spectra. In the maturing seed, two combination bands (Water I and Water III) were strong indicators of changes in water content while a first overtone (Water II) band gave a weaker response to change in moisture content.
   Three carbohydrate absorption bands showed different dynamics of carbohydrate (starch, fructan) accumulation and breakdown. Carbohydrate I represents starch accumulation during maturation based on the vibrations of intermolecular hydrogen-bonded O-H groups in polysaccharides. Carbohydrate II peak represents the of O-H stretching and C-C stretching vibrations in water-soluble carbohydrates while Carbohydrate III peak describes the changes in C-H stretching and deformation bands of poly-and mono-/oligosaccharides.
   Two protein absorption bands were identified (at 2055-2065 nm identified as amide A/II and at 2175-2180 nm identified as amide I/III). These showed characteristic changes related to the accumulation of proteins and formation of the gluten network. The Amide A/II peak represents protein network formation during maturation based on the vibrations of inter-chain hydrogen-bonded N-H groups in polypeptides. The Amide I/III absorption band describes protein accumulation and the interactions of gliadins and glutenins that form the gluten network. NIR spectroscopy is shown to be effective in monitoring plant physiological processes both qualitatively and quantitatively, while the spectra also contain hidden information that can be used to define the stage of development of the wheat seed.

AB  - To investigate the mechanisms involved in metal stress in wild fish, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were collected in eight lakes of the Rouyn-Noranda and Sudbury regions (Canada). Due to mining and smelting activities, these two regions indeed present a broad contamination gradient in metal concentrations (Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni; water, sediment and prey) and offer a unique research opportunity to investigate relationships between metal bioaccumulation and resulting deleterious effects in indigenous biota chronically exposed to metal mixtures. The expression level of genes encoding for proteins involved in metal detoxification (metallothioneins, mts), protein protection (heat shock protein-70, hsp-70), growth (insulin-like growth factor-1, igf-1), aerobic energy metabolism (cytochrome c oxydase, cco-1) and protection against oxidative stress (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, sod-1) were assessed in fish liver and muscle in association with protein and enzymatic assays for cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). Bioaccumulation of both Cd and Cu increased in response to higher ambient metal concentrations, but the two metals clearly have different modes of action. For Cd, changes in gene expression levels were more marked in the liver than in the dorsal muscle, whereas for Cu the opposite trend was observed. Hepatic Cd accumulation was linked to decreased cco-1 and sod-1 gene expression, whereas Cu accumulation was associated with a decrease in CCO enzymatic activity and an increase in total protein concentration and in cco-1, mts and hsp-70 gene expression levels. For Ni, no significant correlations were observed at the transcriptional level, but increasing hepatic Ni concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with protein concentrations and CCO activity. By coupling gene expression to biochemical and physiological endpoints, this work provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in metal stress and the adaptive response of fish chronically exposed to metal mixtures.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment of peatlands may alter patterns of heterotrophic microbial activity (HMA) and organic matter cycling. The utilization of C-substrates by heterotrophic microbial communities in response to changes in environmental conditions may serve as sensitive indicators of changes in the trophic state of wetlands. The objective of this study was to measure the response of heterotrophic microbial communities to added C-substrates in the plant detritus layer and underlying soil (0-10 cm) for eutrophic, transitional, and oligotrophic sites along a nutrient enrichment gradient in the Florida Everglades, USA. The short-term response to C-substrates (alcohols, amino acids, carboxylic acids, and polysaccharides) was measured as CO2 production. The nutrient gradient was characterized by decreasing P concentrations and microbial biomass from eutrophic to oligotrophic sites. Basal respiration was 73% higher at eutrophic than oligotrophic sites, and 41% higher in detritus than underlying soil. Heterotrophic microbial activity varied along the gradient with greater C-substrate utilization at the eutrophic site resulting from higher levels of microbial biomass and inorganic nutrients compared to the oligotrophic site. The C-substrates enhanced CO2 production at all sites suggesting that labile organic C was a limiting factor to HMA in these peatlands. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) of detritus was 25, 45, and 42% greater for polysaccharides than other C-substrates at the eutrophic, transitional, and oligotrophic sites, respectively. Likewise, SIR at the eutrophic, transitional, and oligotrophic sites was 0, 40, and 39%, respectively, greater for detritus amended with carboxylic acids than with amino acids and alcohols. Polysaccharides dominated HMA profiles at all sites along the nutrient gradient in detritus. The transitional site was characterized by carboxylic acids and alcohols, while the HMA profile at the oligotrophic site was dominated by carboxylic acids. Patterns of HMA along the nutrient gradient provided insight into the microbial response to changes in tropic status, indicating the heterotrophic microbial community was more sensitive with increasing eutrophication.

AB  - An experiment with mustard (Brassica campestris L.) cv T 59 was conducted in a glasshouse under controlled culture conditions to determine the effect of variable zinc (Zn) on biomass, reproductive yield, seed oil, and some aspects of metabolism. Plants were raised in refined sand, and Zn was administered at variable levels ranging from acute deficiency to excess (0.00065 to 65 mg Zn L-1). At 0.00065 mg Zn L-1, symptoms of Zn deficiency were depression in growth, short internodes, chlorosis and necrosis of mature leaves, along with development of purple pigmentation at leaf margins, which later covered the entire lamina. Biomass, economic yield, and seed oil content were highest at 0.065 mg Zn L-1. Zinc at less and more than 0.065 mg Zn L-1 reduced vegetative yield, pod and seed weight, concentration of chlorophyll (a and b), sugars, starch, and protein and elevated the concentration of phenols and activity of acid phosphatase and peroxidase in mustard leaves. The activity of carbonic anhydrase (except at 65 mg Zn L-1), aldolase, and leaf Zn increased with an increase in Zn from deficiency to excess whereas ribonuclease activity was related inversely to Zn supply. In addition to various changes in metabolism of mustard, Zn at higher levels (6.5 and 65 mg Zn L-1) induced symptoms of toxicity on old leaves as interveinal chlorosis, necrosis, and reduction in growth and leaf size. Phosphorus (P) content in leaves decreased concomitantly with an increase in Zn supply from 0.00065 to 65 mg Zn L-1. The values of deficiency, threshold of deficiency, threshold of toxicity, and toxicity in leaves were respectively 18, 25, 200, and 380 mu g Zn g(-1) dry matter. The activity of aldolase and carbonic anhydrase appear to be reliable biological indicators for evaluating the Zn status of mustard.

AB  - The finite element method, one of the most advanced simulation techniques in solid mechanics, is used for orthopedic biomechanics. It is used as a tool for the design and analysis of total joint replacement and other orthopedic devices. The design of hip joint prostheses is a complex process that requires close co-operation between engineers and surgeons. To design highly durable prostheses one has to take into account the natural processes occurring in the bone. One of the most important factors in the implant design is to reduce stress on the femur and the bone-cement. The purpose of this study is to investigate the behavior of newly designed implants under body weight load during stumbling by parametric modeling. Two different implant materials have been selected to study appropriate material and fatigue life resistant. In the parametric design, the prosthesis functional requirement is that the locking of stem to the femur head using cement should be strong enough to preclude unlocking during the life time of a patient and to prevent sliding of the implant into the bone-cement.
   In the finite element analysis, physical interactions among joints are simulated by contact algorithms. The femur-bone-cement interface and the bone-cement-implant interface surface to surface contact algorithms of ANSYS were used for implicit static analysis. Three stem-cement interface conditions are considered: completely bonded, debonded with coefficient of friction 0, and debonded with coefficient of friction 0.2. In the analysis, a viscoelastic material model is utilized for bone-cement. Numerical shape optimization is applied to the prosthesis.
   The results of finite element simulations are compared with Charnley's implant results and appropriate material for the implant is proposed. The best stem shapes fulfilling the desired functional requirements are chosen for the design. These findings can form a base for further research such as the optimum design of bone-implant hip prosthesis. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In many species, neurons with highly selective stimulus-response properties characterize higher order sensory areas and/or sensory motor areas of the CNS. In the songbird nuclei, the responses of HVC (used as a proper name) neurons during playback of the bird's own song (BOS) are probably one of the most striking examples of selectivity for natural stimuli. We examined here to what extent spike-timing carries information about natural and time-reversed versions of the BOS. From a heterogenous population of 107 HVC neurons recorded in long-day or short-day conditions, a standard indicator of stimulus preference based on spike-count (the d' index) indicates that a limited proportion of cells can be classified as selective for the BOS (20% with a vertical bar d vertical bar > 1). In contrast, quantifying the information conveyed by spike trains with the metric-space of J. D. Victor & K. P Purpura [(1996) J. Neurophysiol., 76, 1310 - 1326] indicates that 62% of the cells display significant amounts of transmitted information, among which 77% are 'temporal cells'. 'Temporal cells' correspond to cells transmitting significant amounts of information when spike-timing is considered, whereas no information, or lower amounts of transmitted information, is obtained when only spike-count is considered. Computing a correlation index between spike trains [S. Schreiber et al. (2003) Neurocomputing, 52-54,925-931] revealed that spike-timing reliability is higher for the forward than for the reverse BOS, whatever the day length and the cell type are. Cells classified as selective in terms of spike-counts (d' index) had greater amounts of transmitted information, but cells classified as non-selective (d' < 0.5) can also transmit significant amounts of information. Thus, information theory methods demonstrate that a much larger proportion of neurons than expected based on spike-count only participate in the discrimination between stimuli.

AB  - We studied the efficiency and effects of the multiple sensory cues of tiger moths on echolocating bats. We used the northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, a purported moth specialist that takes surface-bound prey (gleaning) and airborne prey (aerial hawking), and the dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, an eared species unpalatable to bats that possesses conspicuous colouration and sound-producing organs (tymbals). This is the first study to investigate the interaction of tiger moths and wild-caught bats under conditions mimicking those found in nature and to demand the use of both aerial hawking and gleaning strategies by bats. Further, it is the first to report spectrograms of the sounds produced by tiger moths while under aerial attack by echolocating bats. During both aerial hawking and gleaning trials, all muted C tenera and perched intact C tenera were attacked by M. septentrionalis, indicating that M. septentrionalis did not discriminate C tenera from palatable moths based on potential echoic and/or non-auditory cues. Intact C. tenera were attacked significantly less often than muted C tenera during aerial hawking attacks: tymbal clicks were therefore an effective deterrent in an aerial hawking context. During gleaning attacks, intact and muted C tenera were always attacked and suffered similar mortality rates, suggesting that while handling prey this bat uses primarily chemical signals. Our results also show that C tenera temporally matches the onset of click production to the 'approach phase' echolocation calls produced by aerial hawking attacking bats and that clicks themselves influence the echolocation behaviour of attacking bats. In the context of past research, these findings support the hypotheses that the clicks of arctiid moths are both an active defence (through echolocation disruption) and a reliable indicator of chemical defence against aerial-hawking bats. We suggest these signals are specialized for an aerial context.

AB  - The objectives of the study, were to evaluate severity of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) using age at time of death as its indicator and to look for factors associated with the severity. Retrospective study of consecutive cardiovascular deaths in the medical wards of Tikur Anbassa Teaching Hospital (TA H) from January 1995 to December 2001 was carried out. Information on age at the time of death, sex, type of valve lesions, status of secondary prophylaxis, presence or absence of arrhythmia, infective endocarditis, embolic phenomena, co-morbid illness, immediate cause(s) of death and duration of follow lip at health institutions were obtained. There were a total of 457 cardiovascular deaths including cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). 121(26.5%) were due to RHD. Charts of 115 RHD patients were available for detailed analysis. The overall mean age at the time of death was 25.89+/-11.05 years. The median age for males was lower than that of females (19 years, I.Q. 16-32 versus 25 years, IQ 15 - 30 years), but not statistically significantly different (p = 0.10). There were more female deaths accounting for 57.4%. About 70% of RHD patients died from congestive heart failure. Eleven per cent (13 patients) each died from systemic embolism and co-morbid conditions. Combined mitral and aortic valve disease within a patient accounted for majority (42.6%) of the lesions followed by combined mitral regurgitation and stenosis (24.4%). Isolated mitral stenosis, or regurgitation was a relatively less common cause of death. Aortic valve lesion without mitral valve involvement was a rare cause (3.5%) of death. In conclusion RHD in our patients ran more aggressive course as indicated by death occurring at much younger age than in even the preprophylaxis era in western world. The more frequent combined valve lesions and infrequent secondary prophylaxis may significantly contribute to the rapid course, but cannot fully explain the very low, mean age. Factors responsible for rapid course in an Ethiopian need to be addressed urgently.

AB  - 1. Optimal clutch size theory predicts that individuals will oviposit the number of eggs that increases their fitness. In Anastrepha ludens Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae), females oviposit larger clutches in unripe (firm) fruits than in ripe (soft) fruits. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Using fruit firmness as an indicator of fruit quality, A . ludens females vary the number of eggs per clutch every time they reach an oviposition decision. (2) Maximising offspring survival with respect to either unripe or ripe fruit requires placing large clutches in firm fruit and smaller clutches in soft fruit.
   2. Agar spheres were used as artificial hosts. Three agar concentrations resulted in three degrees of firmness. Mango fruits Mangifera indica L. served as natural hosts. Ripe and unripe fruits were used to test soft and firm host conditions respectively. Females laid significantly larger clutches in the firmer artificial hosts than in the softer hosts. They also laid significantly more eggs in artificial hosts without sugar than in hosts with sugar. Firm (unripe) mangoes also received significantly larger clutches than soft (ripe) mangoes.
   3. When an individual female was first presented with a firm artificial host, it laid a large clutch. If subsequently offered a soft host, the female laid a significantly smaller clutch. Finally, if again offered a firm host, clutch size was increased significantly.
   4. Possible trade-offs in offspring fitness were explored in ripe and unripe mangoes by measuring offspring egg-to-adult survival, pupal weight, mean adult longevity, and fecundity. Despite the fact that larval survival was greater in soft fruit than in firm fruit, parameters such as pupal weight, mean longevity, and fecundity of adults stemming from both fruit types did not differ significantly.
   5. A probable trade-off between high offspring mortality caused by host unsuitability and low offspring and adult mortality caused by parasitism and predation is discussed as the reason for the exploitation of sub-optimal hosts.

AB  - Having studied the definitions of niche proposed by different ecologists, I have proposed a quantitative method of niche which can be applied to plants. Accordingly, the niche of an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) has been described by a mapping from its environmental set to the unit interval [0, 1], which enables a model of niche to be mathematically operational. The concepts of fundamental niche, realized niche, time niche, etc., may be described by using mathematical models related to each other, and the geometrical relationships between them can be revealed by a multi-dimensional surface. The uni-factor models are built upon the condition that the other factors are optimal for OTU, which are particular cases of the multi-factor models. The establishment of the quantitative relationship between these two kinds of models makes it possible to find out the plants' fundamental niche by doing uni-factor experiments. This may simplify the experiments in which the parameters in a practically applied model are to be estimated. The niche index introduced in this paper is related to average level and aftereffect of plant responses to the effects of its environment (i.e. ''inertia''), thus it should be the basis of the simulation of plant seed yield and of its environmental evaluation. Accordingly, models of niche index, of plant seed yield, of plant growth and of environmental evaluation have been built which can be applied to the environmental evaluation or the prediction and management of plant (crop) production, etc.
   As an example of application, the models of wheat yield and its environmental assessment have been established and practically tested. The results of testing the model of wheat yield showed that the relative errors are 8% and 7.2%, respectively, in 1984 and 1986. The results of the environmental assessment of wheat reveal the fact that the insufficiency of the soil moisture at the 2th and 3th stages is the main restriction of the production of the wheat in Dinxi, Gansu Province, China.

AB  - The question was addressed whether the risk of cancer of an individual in a heterogeneous population can be predicted on the basis of measurable biochemical and biological variables postulated to be associated with the process of chemical carcinogenesis. Using the skin tumor model with outbred male NMRI mice, the latency time for the appearance of a papilloma was used as an indicator of the individual cancer risk, Starting at 8 weeks of age, a group of 29 mice was treated twice weekly with 20 nmol of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) applied to the back skin. The individual papilloma latency time ranged from 13.5 to 25 weeks of treatment. Two weeks after the appearance of the first papilloma in each mouse, an osmotic minipump delivering 5-bromo-2'-deoxymridine was s.c. implanted and the mouse was killed 24 hr later. Levels of DMBA-DNA adducts, of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and various measures of the kinetics of cell division were determined in the epidermis of the treated skin area. The levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and the fraction of cells in DNA replication (labeling index for the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) were significantly higher in those mice that showed short latency times. On the other hand, the levels of DMBA-DNA adducts were lowest in animals with short latency times. The latter finding was rather unexpected but can be explained as a consequence of the inverse correlation seen for the labeling index: with each round of cell division, the adduct concentration is reduced to 50% because the new DNA strand is free of DMBA adducts until the next treatment. Under the conditions of this bioassay, therefore, oxygen radical-related genotoxicity and the rate of cell division, rather than levels of carcinogen-DNA adducts, were found to be of predictive value as indicators of an individual cancer risk.

AB  - Cacao production systems in Colombia are of high importance due to their direct impact in the social and economic development of smallholder farmers. Although Colombian cacao has the potential to be in the high value markets for fine flavour, the lack of expert support as well as the use of traditional, and often times sub-optimal technologies makes cacao production negligible. Traditionally, cacao harvest takes place at exactly the same time regardless of the geographic and climatic region where it is grown, the problem with this strategy is that cacao beans are often unripe or over matured and a combination of both will negatively affect the quality of the final cacao product. Since cacao fruit development can be considered as the result of a number of physiological and morphological processes that can be described by mathematical relationships even under uncontrolled environments. Environmental parameters that have more association with pod maturation speed should be taken into account to decide the appropriate time to harvest. In this context, crop models are useful tools to simulate and predict crop development over time and under multiple environmental conditions. Since harvesting at the right time can yield high quality cacao, we parameterised a crop model to predict the best time for harvest cacao fruits in Colombia. The cacao model uses weather variables such as temperature and solar radiation to simulate the growth rate of cocoa fruits from flowering to maturity. The model uses thermal time as an indicator of optimal maturity. This model can be used as a practical tool that supports cacao farmers in the production of high quality cacao which is usually paid at a higher price. When comparing simulated and observed data, our results showed an RRMSE of 7.2% for the yield prediction, while the simulated harvest date varied between +/-2 to 20 days depending on the temperature variations of the year between regions. This crop model contributed to understanding and predicting the phenology of cacao fruits for two key cultivars ICS95 y CCN51.

AB  - Heterophylly, or leaf morphological changes along plant shoot axes, is an important indicator of plant eco-adaptation to heterogeneous microenvironments. Despite extensive studies on the genetic control of leaf shape, the genetic architecture of heterophylly remains elusive. To identify genes related to heterophylly and their associations with plant saline tolerance, we conducted a leaf shape mapping experiment using leaves from a natural population of Populus euphratica. We included 106 genotypes grown under salt stress and salt-free (control) conditions using clonal seedling replicates. We developed a shape tracking method to monitor and analyze the leaf shape using principal component (PC) analysis. PC1 explained 42.18% of the shape variation, indicating that shape variation is mainly determined by the leaf length. Using leaf length along shoot axes as a dynamic trait, we implemented a functional mapping-assisted genome-wide association study (GWAS) for heterophylly. We identified 171 and 134 significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in control and stressed plants, respectively, which were annotated as candidate genes for stress resistance, auxin, shape, and disease resistance. Functions of the stress resistance genes ABSCISIC ACIS-INSENSITIVE 5-like (ABI5), WRKY72, and MAPK3 were found to be related to many tolerance responses. The detection of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR17-LIKE (ARF17) suggests a balance between auxin-regulated leaf growth and stress resistance within the genome, which led to the development of heterophylly via evolution. Differentially expressed genes between control and stressed plants included several factors with similar functions affecting stress-mediated heterophylly, such as the stress-related genes ABC transporter C family member 2 (ABCC2) and ABC transporter F family member (ABCF), and the stomata-regulating and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling gene RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG (RBOH). A comparison of the genetic architecture of control and salt-stressed plants revealed a potential link between heterophylly and saline tolerance in P. euphratica, which will provide new avenues for research on saline resistance-related genetic mechanisms.

AB  - Recent legislative measures restricting the sale of sunscreens containing certain ultraviolet light filtering ingredients (UVFs) have been based on a perception of risk to aquatic life despite the lack of a robust data set to support these decisions. Concerns were focused on the potential for recreational swimmers' and divers' sunscreen use to result in exposures to coral already stressed due to climate change, disease, and other local conditions. In published environmental risk assessments for UVFs, exposure estimates were based on episodic environmental monitoring or estimates of typical sunscreen use, arbitrarily assuming the portion rinsed off from skin in seawater. To improve the accuracy of exposure estimates and thereby develop more robust risk assessments, we measured the amount of the UVFs, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone released to seawater from four sunscreen products (two lotions, one spray, one stick) in a novel porcine skin model of typical human sunscreen use. Sunscreen was applied to porcine skin, allowed to briefly dry, then exposed to four rinse cycles in artificial seawater. The mass of each UVF in seawater, partitioned from seawater onto glassware, and extractable from skin after rinsing were determined. The proportion rinsed from skin varied by UVF, by formula type, and by application rate. Less than 1.4% of applied octisalate, homosalate, and octocrylene was detected in seawater samples (independent of formula) increasing to an average of 4% and 8% for avobenzone in stick and lotion forms, and to 24% for oxybenzone in lotions. The initial data show substantial differences in rinse-off among formulation types and sunscreen application rates, and stress the importance of using UVF-specific rinse-off values rather than a single value for all UVFs. This new method provides a tool for more robust exposure estimates, with initial data supporting lower rinse-off values than adopted in published risk assessments.

AB  - Mixing gestating sows implies hierarchy formation and has detrimental consequences on welfare. The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups. We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order on 20 groups of 46-91 animals. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P = 0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P = 0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions.

AB  - The rhizosphere microbiome is considered to play a key role in determining crop health. However, current understanding of the factors which shape assembly and composition of the microbiome is heavily biased toward bacterial communities, and the relevance for other microbial groups is unclear. Furthermore, community assembly is determined by a variety of factors, including host genotype, environment and agricultural management practices, and their relative importance and interactions remain to be elucidated. We investigated the impact of nitrogen fertilization on rhizosphere bacterial, fungal, nematode and protist communities of 10 contrasting oilseed rape genotypes in a field experiment. We found significant differences in the composition of bacteria, fungi, protist and nematode communities between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. Nitrogen application had a significant but weak effect on fungal, bacterial, and protist community composition, and this was associated with increased relative abundance of a complex of fungal pathogens in the rhizosphere and soil, including Mycosphaerella sp. and Leptosphaeria sp. Network analysis showed that nitrogen application had different effects on microbial community connectivity in the soil and rhizosphere. Crop genotype significantly affected fungal community composition, with evidence for a degree of genotype specificity for a number of pathogens, including L. maculans, Alternaria sp., Pyrenopeziza brassicae, Olpidium brassicae, and L. biglobosa, and also potentially beneficial Heliotales root endophytes. Crop genotype had no significant effect on assembly of bacteria, protist or nematode communities. There was no relationship between genetic distance of crop genotypes and the extent of dissimilarity of rhizosphere microbial communities. Field disease assessment confirmed infection of crops by Leptosphaeria sp., P. brassicae, and Alternaria sp., indicating that rhizosphere microbiome sequencing was an effective indicator of plant health. We conclude that under field conditions soil and rhizosphere nutrient stoichiometry and crop genotype are key factors determining crop health by influencing the infection of roots by pathogenic and mutualistic fungal communities, and the connectivity and stability of rhizosphere microbiome interaction networks.

AB  - Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have been identified as a method to reduce the aviation sector's environmental impact through carbon mitigation. Current certification processes of potential, viable SAFs require labor cost intensive assessments with investigation into combustor performance parameters related to fuel effects such as lean blowoff (LBO) where there exists the competition between multiphase physics and chemical kinetics of the fuel. Recent efforts show LBO effectively scales with the evaporative, mixing, and chemical time scales of a given combustor. Here, a toroidal jet-stirred reactor (TJSR), an experimental configuration meant to emulate perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) studies, is used to study the effects of fuel chemistry physical time scales on LBO while mitigating and minimizing the effects of evaporation mixing, respectively. For this investigation, six fuels/fuel mixtures spanning a range of derived cetane number (DCN) were evaluated in a lean premixed, prevaporized environment with engine relevant characteristics such as recirculation inlet temperature residence times (P = similar to 1 atm, T = 460 K, r = 5.5-6.5 ms). Gas phase emissions sampled within the reactor were measured with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer to gain insight into relevant trends in species production for varying fuels as leaner conditions were approached. LBO in the TJSR was correlated with the parameters of the DCN and radical index, an indicator of OH production, signifying competition between the chemical processes of autoignition and extinction, respectively; these observations deviate from the established PSR theory for ignition extinction physics. However, the emergence of these correlations in the TJSR experiment support the importance of low temperature chemistry and flame robustness. A physical time scale approach to LBO is applied to the current experiment to elucidate the competition of autoignition and extinction phenomena. Knowledge of the physical LBO time scales and their relationship to chemical fuel properties suggest that the holistic LBO time scale may be viable as a preliminary screening metric for SAF certification.

AB  - Coral tissue thickness (CTT) is an effective indicator of the adaptability of corals to environmental stress, but the relationships between the spatial and intergeneric variation of coral tissue across latitudes and tolerance to environmental stress are not well understood. To investigate this, the CTT of 768 specimens of 10 typical coral genera and surrounding seawater parameters were measured in six coral reef regions (CRRs) across the 9-22 degrees N latitudes in the South China Sea (SCS). Results showed significant differences in CH' between different genera of corals and CRRs. CTTs were significantly higher in the northern SCS than in the southern SCS. There was also notable intergeneric variation, with the abundance of branching Acropora and foliaceous Pavona being significantly lower than that of massive Porites, Galaxea, Favia, Favites, Hydnophora, Platygyra, and encrusting Montipora, Psammocora across these CRRs. Redundancy analysis showed that dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), sea surface temperature (SST), turbidity, and transparency were the main factors affecting CTT. Overall CTT, irrespective of genus, was significantly positively correlated with DIN, SRP, and latitude, but was significantly negatively correlated with transparency and SST. Further analysis suggested that corals in the southern SCS are mainly threatened by thermal stress, whereas in the northern SCS, corals have often suffered from destructive anthropogenic disturbance. Although seawater conditions were normal during on-site investigation, a large number of branching corals (e.g., Acropora corals) have been lost in the last several decades due to destructive human activity. In contrast, massive and encrusting corals may have higher energy reserves and photo-protective capacities due to their thicker tissues, and consequently have higher tolerance to environmental stress. Therefore, the coral communities of the SCS have gradually been transformed from branching corals to massive/encrusting corals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Question Functional leaf traits are used to classify plants into ecological strategies according to the leaf economic spectrum. Geological substrate has an important effect on functional trait variation; however, interspecific and intraspecific trait variation on contrasting substrates needs to be documented for tropical humid forests. We hypothesized that a conservative resource strategy is prevalent in forests on rocky outcrops (FOR) and an acquisitive strategy is prevalent in forests on volcanic substrate (FOV). Our aim was to determine interspecific and intraspecific variation in functional traits of tree species on FOR and FOV. Location Tropical cloud forests on limestone outcrops and deep volcanic soil close to each other, Veracruz, Mexico. Methods At four sites in FOR and four sites in FOV, we selected 16 native tree species: five occurring only in FOR, five occurring only in FOV, six common to both. We determined leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), stomatal density (SD), and foliar C, N and P content. Functional trait differences between FOR and FOV were determined using linear mixed models. Results Leaf traits differed between substrates and interspecifically. LA, SLA and foliar C content were higher in FOV than in FOR. Tree species common to both substrates displayed significant substrate x species interaction, but LA, SLA, SD and foliar C showed different trends in each substrate. Our results indicate that tree species on different substrates within the same vegetation type display different functional strategies. Conclusions Leaf trait variation supports the hypothesis that tree species use strategies congruent with resource conservation in FOR and resource acquisition in FOV. Intraspecific variation of LA, SLA and SD in tree species growing on both substrates suggests plasticity to adapt locally to changes in substrate conditions. LA and SLA are critical indicator traits of the use and allocation of resources in FOR and FOV.

AB  - Centralisation of activities and developments around metro station areas is a key transit-oriented development (TOD) policy to encourage more public transport travel through providing maximum access to passengers, thereby enhancing economic efficiency, health, well-being and social inclusion. The node-place-design model is an analytical approach, which investigates the interaction between land use, transportation and the walking friendliness around station areas. Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node-place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification-diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high node place-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension design into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment. Overall, the paper provides a platform for further studies integrating strategic network and node-place-design attributes.

AB  - (1) Background: Contemporary enterprises are putting more and more emphasis on shaping lasting and effective relationships with clients. This is not an easy task, especially in the conditions of Marketing 4.0, which imposes on enterprises the need to holistically consider the needs as well as the skills and inventiveness of customers. It can be assumed that Clients 4.0 require both changes in the scope of business processes and shaping communication with their environment. That is why it is important today to skillfully and correctly determine the complexity of communication with Clients 4.0, as well as to determine the importance of communication with clients for the development of enterprises-especially those operating in innovative industries. (2) Methods: Empirical research was carried out on a sample of 100 innovative enterprises listed on the NewConnect market in Poland. The respondents were managers at various levels. Two indicators were constructed based on these assessments: Customer Relationships Importance Index (CRII) and Customer Communication Complexity Index (CCCI). (3) Results: It was determined that the complexity of communication of innovative enterprises with customers is at a high level. What is more, the importance of relationships with Customers 4.0 for the development of innovative enterprises is at a high level. It was also indicated that there is no correlation between the level of complexity of relationships with Customers 4.0 and the importance of these relationships for the development of innovative enterprises. (4) Conclusions: Based on the survey, it can be assumed that the relations with Clients 4.0 have the greatest share in shaping the development of innovative enterprises in the areas of minimizing the number of complaints, financial liquidity and efficiency of core business processes. It is also important that, in shaping the complexity of communication with Clients 4.0, enterprises mainly consider traditional phone calls and email account.

AB  - Core 2011804-0010 from easternmost Lancaster Sound provides important insights into deglacial timing and style at the marine margin of the NE Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). Spanning 13.2-11.0cal. ka BP and investigated for ice-rafted debris (IRD), foraminifera, biogenic silica and total organic carbon, the stratigraphy comprises a lithofacies progression from proximal grounding line and sub-ice shelf environments to open glaciomarine deposition; a sequence similar to deposits from Antarctic ice shelves. These results are the first marine evidence of a former ice shelf in the eastern Northwest Passage and are consistent with a preceding phase of ice streaming in eastern Lancaster Sound. Initial glacial float-off and retreat occurred >13.2cal. ka BP, followed by formation of an extensive deglacial ice shelf during the Younger Dryas, which acted to stabilize the retreating margin of the NE LIS until 12.5cal. ka BP. IRD analyses of sub-ice shelf facies indicate initial high input from source areas on northern Baffin Island delivered to Lancaster Sound by a tributary ice stream in Admiralty Inlet. After ice shelf break-up, Bylot Island became the dominant source area. Foraminifera are dominated by characteristic ice-proximal glaciomarine benthics (Cassidulina reniforme, Elphidium excavatum f. clavata), complemented by advected Atlantic water (Cassidulina neoteretis, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma) and enhanced current indicators (Lobatula lobatula). The biostratigraphy further supports the ice shelf model, with advection of sparse faunas beneath the ice shelf, followed by increased productivity under open water glaciomarine conditions. The absence of Holocene sediments in the core suggests that the uppermost deposits were removed, most likely due to mass transport resulting from the site's proximity to modern tidewater glacier margins. Collectively, this study presents important new constraints on the deglacial behaviour of the NE Laurentide Ice Sheet, with implications for past ice sheet stability, ice-rafted sediment delivery, and ice-ocean interactions in this complex archipelago setting.

AB  - Piglet mortality is a continuing problem in modern pig production. It is high especially during the first few days after birth and can be reduced by supervision of farrowing.
   There is currently a trend to move towards housing without crates due to animal welfare concerns. Thus, automatic systems that can predict farrowing equally well in different housing systems would have wider applicability than ones developed for crated systems only. A method that works with same parameters in different housing systems would be easier to maintain and reuse in different conditions. The aim of this study was to develop a new accelerometer based system to measure sow activity before farrowing. This data was then used to build a model to predict the approach of farrowing, based on increased activity, within 24 h before the start of farrowing.
   We used a wireless 3D accelerometer to measure the activity of sows in order to detect farrowing. The accelerometer collars were attached to neck collars of 29 sows farrowing in crates and 33 sows farrowing in pens. We expected sows in pens to show higher activity, but a similar rise in the level.
   We used a single model to detect farrowing in both crates and pens. A dynamic linear model was used to model the activity of the sows before farrowing and to extract trend component from seasonal components and a CUSUM chart was used to detect activity increase.
   The model detected a rise in activity on average 13 +/- 4.8 h (mean +/- standard deviation) before farrowing in sows housed in crates and pens with sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 100%. The fact that we were able to use a single model with a constant set of parameters gives indication that the method has potential to become a robust indicator of farrowing in different housing systems, even though pre-farrowing activity was higher in sows housed in pens than in crates.

AB  - Coastal states of the United States (US) routinely monitor shellfish harvest waters for types of bacteria that indicate the potential presence of fecal pollution. The densities of these indicator bacteria in natural waters may be related to climate in several ways, including through runoff from precipitation and survival related to water temperatures. The relationship between interannual precipitation and air temperature patterns and the densities of fecal indicator bacteria in shellfish harvest waters in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay was quantified using 34 years of data (1979-2013). Annual and seasonal precipitation totals had a strong positive relationship with average fecal coliform levels (R-2 = 0.69) and the proportion of samples with bacterial densities above the FDA regulatory criteria (R-2 = 0.77). Fecal coliform levels were also significantly and negatively related to average annual air temperature (R-2 = 0.43) and the average air temperature of the warmest month (R-2 = 0.57), while average seasonal air temperature was only significantly related to fecal coliform levels in the summer. River and regional fecal coliform levels displayed a wide range of relationships with precipitation and air temperature patterns, with stronger relationships in rural areas and mainstem Bay stations. Fecal coliform levels tended to be higher in years when the bulk of precipitation occurred throughout the summer and/or fall (August to September). Fecal coliform levels often peaked in late fall and winter, with precipitation peaking in summer and early fall. Continental-scale sea level pressure (SLP) analysis revealed an association between atmospheric patterns that influence both extratropical and tropical storm tracks and very high fecal coliform years, while regional precipitation was found to be significantly correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacific North American Pattern. These findings indicate that management of shellfish harvest waters should account for changes in climate conditions and that SLP patterns may be particularly important for predicting years with extremely high levels of fecal coliforms.

AB  - With the emergence of areas degraded by human activities, the chemical soil properties and silvicultural characters became important in understanding the succession process of tree species and planning of landscape restoration. This study aimed to evaluate the distribution of tree species in areas with different levels of human disturbance, relating silvicultural aspects to the soil chemical properties and characterizing the type of vegetation, for integration of genetic conservation program in situ. The study was conducted in the area of Research and Extension Experimental Farm (FEPE) from UNESP, Ilha Solteira, in Selviria - MS. Through transect, 64 plots were marked 50 m equidistant with dimensions of 10 x 10 m, where: 29 plots were in an highly disturbed area (HDA), five in moderately disturbed area (MDA), 15 in lowly disturbed area (LDA), six in riparian stream of Vestia river (Riparian Forest) and nine in the legal reserve. Soil samples were collected at two depths (0.0 to 0.20 and 0.20 to 0.40 m) for the chemical analysis and the assessment of silvicultural characters, such as height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and shape. The study of the natural distribution of tree species and edaphic condition in the different evaluated areas showed that: the soil chemical properties associated with the level of human disturbance and conservation of the areas are influencing the natural occurrence, species diversity and development of the trees. Height, DBH and shape are good indicators to assess the growth of the tree community and relate them to soil chemical properties; LDA and legal reserve presented higher natural occurrence, number of individuals and number of species. In the riparian forest, basal area values, height, shape and chemical soil properties were higher. From the 97 species found, six have the potential to be used in a program of genetic conservation in situ. They are: Astronium fraxinifolium, Terminalia argentea, Curatella americana, Cupania vernalis, Qualea jundiahy and Andira cuyabensis.

AB  - In this article, using the Hawkesbury-Nepean River as a case study, the spatial and temporal trends of water quality variables over three sampling surveys in a peri-urban situation are examined for their effect on benthic macroinvertebrate communities and phytoplankton communities and whether phytoplankton and benthic macroinvertebrate species can be used as indicators for river health assessment. For this, the authors monitored the spatial and temporal difference of 10 water quality parameters: temperature, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, oxidation reduction potential, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, manganese, and suspended solids. The variability in water quality parameters clearly indicated a complex pattern, depending on the season (interaction p = 0.001), which highlighted how the river condition is stressed at multiple points as a result of anthropogenic effects. In particular, the downstream locations indicated an accumulation of nutrients, the presence of increased sediments, and phytoplankton related variables such as total counts, bio-volumes, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus. The patterns of phytoplankton communities varied in a complex way depending on the season (interaction p = 0.001). Abundances of phytoplankton were also found in low concentrations where the water column is not severely disturbed by flow and tide. However, when the water clarity drops resulting from tidal cycles, inflows from tributaries, and intense boating activities, the phytoplankton abundances also increased considerably. On the other hand, benthic macroinvertebrates compositions were significantly different between locations (p = 0.001) with increased abundances associated with upstream sites. Aphanocapsa holsatica and chironomid larvae appeared as the important indicators for upstream and downstream site differences in water quality. Water temperature influenced the phytoplankton community pattern (rho(w) = 0.408), whereas pH influenced the benthic macroinvertebrate community pattern (rho(w) = 0.437). The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the interactions of water quality parameters on biotic assemblages and to the extent that benthic macroinvertebrates and phytoplankton assemblages are suitable as indicators for monitoring and assessing peri-urban river health.

AB  - Aim We tested the energy and metabolic theories for explaining diversity patterns of crustacean zooplankton in Canadian lakes, and evaluated the influence of regional and local environments on community structure. Location The 1665 studied lakes are distributed across Canada in 47 ecoprovinces. Methods Our database included the occurrence of 83 pelagic crustacean species. The regional species richness in each ecoprovince was estimated using the average local species richness per lake and the first-order jackknife diversity index. Using a principal component plot and forward selection in a multiple regression we identified the most important predictors of regional species richness estimates. We tested the predictions of the species richness-energy hypothesis using climatic variables at regional scale, and of the metabolic theory using the inverse of air temperature. To evaluate the influence of regional and local environmental drivers, we carried out a redundancy analysis between crustacean species occurrences and regional climate and lake environmental factors on a subset of 458 lakes. Results Estimates of pelagic crustacean species richness in Canadian ecoprovinces varied from 3 to 10 species per lake (average local species richness) or 8 to 52 species per ecoprovince (Jackknife diversity index). Our study fully supports the species richness-energy hypothesis and partially the metabolic theory. Mean daily global solar radiation was the most important regional predictor, explaining 51% of the variation in the regional species richness among ecoprovinces. Together, regional climate and local lake environment accounted for 31% of the total variation in community structure. Regional-scale energy variables accounted for 24% of the total explained variation, whereas local-scale lake conditions had less influence (2%). Main conclusions The richness-energy theory explains diversity patterns of freshwater crustacean zooplankton in Canadian ecoprovinces. Solar radiation is the best predictor explaining regional species richness in ecoprovinces and community structure of pelagic crustaceans in Canadian lakes.

AB  - The levels of maternal androgens in egg yolk vary considerably within and among clutches. In most species studied to date, high levels have been found to increase offspring competitive ability. We measured yolk testosterone in two populations of Redpolls (Carduelis flammea/hornemanni) nesting around Toolik Lake Field Station and in Barrow, Alaska to test three predictions about the patterns of yolk testosterone concentrations. First, we predicted yolk testosterone to increase with laying sequence so as to minimize the deleterious effects of hatching asynchrony on chicks from later hatched eggs in a species without delayed incubation. Second, we predicted yolk testosterone to be higher in Barrow where food is more abundant and Redpoll body condition is higher. Third, we predicted yolk testosterone to correlate positively with egg mass and yolk mass, which are two other indicators of maternal investment. An initial analysis that did not consider egg and yolk mass lent support to the first of these predictions. However, more thorough statistical analysis revealed that relationships between yolk testosterone and laying sequence and between yolk testosterone and site were not direct but rather driven by associations among yolk testosterone, egg mass, and yolk mass. While yolk testosterone concentration itself did not differ between sites, the relationship between yolk testosterone and egg and yolk mass did. Yolk testosterone correlated positively with egg mass at Barrow and showed a significant quadratic association with yolk mass in Toolik. While laying sequence and yolk testosterone appeared to be correlated when egg and yolk mass were not considered, the full statistical model suggests that egg and yolk mass are directly associated with laying sequence while yolk testosterone concentrations are not. These results suggest complicated relationships among egg mass, yolk mass, yolk testosterone, site, and laying sequence that should be taken into account in future studies. They also suggest that deposition of yolk testosterone may be a regulated rather than being a purely passive process.

AB  - Body composition is a useful marker for assessing the adiposity of an individual. The amount of body fat (BF) differs with age, sex, environmental conditions and genotype, and is a good indicator of the health and nutritional status of a community. As the subcutaneous fat serves as a reservoir for energy during nutritional deprivation, lower BF in comparison with other studies indicates a lower energy intake by those children, who are affected by their lower socio-economic status. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of socio-economic class, after allowing for sex and age, on body fatness among rural pre-school children of Bengalee Hindu ethnicity of Arambagh, West Bengal, India. The present study was undertaken at 20 Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme centers in Bali Gram Panchayat, Arambagh, Hooghly District of West Bengal, India. A total of 1012 boys and girls (aged 2-6 years) living in these areas were studied. The children were classified into two groups based on their social class: Schedule Castes (SC) and Non-Schedule Castes (NSC). In general, SC comprise socio-economically and educationally deprived individuals. Three-way analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of ethnicity on mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and sum of skinfolds (SS), allowing for age and sex. There was an increasing age trend in both these variables in both sexes in the two groups. All three factors had a significant effect on MUAC, whereas only age and social class had a significant impact on SS. In the case of MUAC, only one second order interaction (sex-age) was significant. In conclusion, we found that after controlling for age and sex, children belonging to the SC group had lower body fatness. These results implied that they were under more nutritional stress. There was also some evidence that at the early ages, girls belonging to the SC group probably received inadequate nutrition and as a result had lower body fat. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Assessment of sustainability - common requirements and comparative evaluation of the systems RISE, KSNL and the "DLG certification system for sustainable agriculture"
T2  - BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - The assessment methods that are especially helpful in the assessment of farm business sustainability are those offering information to the farmer on the economic, ecological and social sustainability of his farm.
   On the basis of a previously developed requirement profile, a KTBL working group tested three farm business assessment systems: Criteria System Sustainable Agriculture (known in Germany by the acronym KSNL), Response Inducing Sustainability Evaluation (RISE) and the DLG (German Agricultural Society) certification system for sustainable agriculture.
   Indicators for assessing ecological sustainability should cover the areas soil, water, air/climate, resources and also biodiversity/habitat and landscape. The economic indicators should offer information on profitability, stability and liquidity and the social ones on the issues "individual work situation", "employment situation including career and social security" as well as "social integration". Alongside technical content, the three systems were also tested for further characteristics of practicability, usefulness and acceptance.
   The Swiss system RISE is globally available as a tool for a first internal sustainability screening for identification of strengths and weaknesses. But it is less suitable for identifying differences between farms with similar local conditions and business structures in countries where the special legal requirements are high. Through the analysis of exemplary farm groups RISE can be used for assessing the sustainability of production across numbers of farms in different countries or regions.
   For well-organised German farm businesses KSNL is appreciated as being an effective tool for identification of avoidable problems (weakness analysis) with sufficient selectivity to meet advisory requirements for precise management optimisation and strategic decision-making. However, an evaluation for animal welfare standards is still missing so far.
   The DLG certification system for sustainable agriculture is also suitable as an instrument for creating a differentiated strengths-weaknesses analysis for well-organised German farming businesses. However, its usefulness for fine-tuning management decisions is limited and the animal production aspect is currently still incomplete.
   For contact outside practical farming, both the latter systems offer a good prerequisite as a basis for communication of farm business sustainability with trade, banks, landlords or the authorities.

AB  - Aim
   Epiphytic bryophyte communities of tropical forests show a gradient in species composition from the base to the top of the host trees, indicating a strong role of niche assembly. This pattern, however, has never been tested at a regional scale. The aim of this study was to test whether niche assembly, rather than dispersal limitation, predominantly drives species composition of bryophyte communities across large spatial scales.
   Location
   Three lowland forests in the Guianas: one near Saul, French Guiana; and two near Mabura Hill, Guyana.
   Methods
   Communities of epiphytic bryophytes were sampled from six different height zones of several trees in three lowland forests. We analysed the composition of these communities using detrended correspondence analysis in order to find the best explanatory variable for the variation in community composition. A multi-response permutation procedure was used to test the significance of grouping communities by height zone. We conducted an indicator species analysis to classify species as specialists or generalists and then tested, through weighted averaging, if specialists would indeed maintain their preferred height zone across the Guianas.
   Results
   Community composition was explained mainly by height zone. The similarity among communities inhabiting the same height zone of trees, across a distance of up to 640 km, was higher than the similarity among communities established along the vertical gradient of a single standing tree (30-50 m). More than half (57%) of the species had a preferred height zone, and the preference was consistent: species occupied roughly the same height zone on host trees in the different localities. The three local communities investigated were found to belong to the same regional species pool.
   Main conclusions
   Throughout the Guianas, epiphytic bryophyte communities are drawn from the same regional species pool, and their composition is shaped by micro-environmental conditions. The predominance of niche assembly over dispersal assembly rules is consistently found at both local and regional scales.

AB  - The structure of the Philippine Sea Plate in the offshore region adjacent to the Boso Peninsula in central Japan is resolved by comparison of recent oceanic seismic survey data with natural repeating earthquake data. This region is characterized by a range of seismic and aseismic phenomena associated with subduction motion of the Philippine Sea Plate, including slow slip events (SSEs), large backslip events, and repeating earthquakes. This offshore region is also the site of the largest aftershock of the 1923 Kanto earthquake (M7.9). The detailed structure of the Philippine Sea Plate is successfully resolved, and the upper boundary of plate is clearly traceable to depths of 20 km. The reflection intensity of the upper boundary varies spatially in accordance with the depth of the reflector. The upper boundary continues smoothly with a line of repeating earthquake hypocenters regarded as an indicator of subduction shear. A continuous model extending into the offshore region can thus be proposed. The variation in reflection intensity on the upper boundary of the Philippine Sea Plate also correlates well with variation in event types. A weak reflection zone overlaps the area of large backslip, while a moderately strong reflection zone encroaches into the large slip area of the Boso SSE. The reflectivity of the upper boundary is thus considered to be dependent on the physical properties and conditions of the reflector, which in turn affect the event types on the plate boundary. A source fault model is proposed for the largest aftershock of the 1923 Kanto earthquake. Based on geodetic data, the source fault is located eastward of the mainshock, with dimensions of 40 x 50 km and moment magnitude of 7.5. The source fault lies within the region of large backslip and the large slip area of the Boso SSE. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A typical question in climate change analysis is whether a certain observed climate characteristic, like a pronounced anomaly or an interdecadal trend, is an indicator of anthropogenic climate change or still in the range of natural variability. Many climatic features are described by one-dimensional index time series, like for instance the global mean temperature or circulation indices. Here, we present a Bayesian classification approach applied to the time series of the northern annular mode (NAM), which is the leading mode of Northern Hemisphere climate variability. After a pronounced negative phase during the 1950s and 1960s, the observed NAM index reveals a distinct positive trend, which is also simulated by various climate model simulations under enhanced greenhouse conditions. The objective of this study is to decide whether the observed temporal evolution of the NAM may be an indicator of global warming. Given a set of prior probabilities for disturbed and undisturbed climate scenarios, the Bayesian decision theorem decides whether the observed NAM trend is classified in a control climate, a greenhouse-gas plus sulphate aerosol climate or a purely greenhouse-gas induced climate as derived from multi-model ensemble simulations.
   The three climate scenarios are well separated from each other in terms of the 30-year NAM trends. The multi-model ensembles contain a weak but statistically significant climate change signal in the form of an intensification of the NAM. The Bayesian classification suggests that the greenhouse-gas scenario is the most probable explanation for the observed NAM trend since 1960, even if a high prior probability is assigned to the control climate. However, there are still large uncertainties in this classification result because some periods at the end of the 19th century and during the "warm" 1920s are also classified in an anthropogenic climate, although natural forcings are likely responsible for this early NAM intensification. This demonstrates a basic shortcoming of the Bayesian decision theorem when it is based on one-dimensional index time series like the NAM index. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim and Location Our aim is to develop pollen-climate inference models for southern Europe and to test their performance and inference power by cross-validation with modern climate data. Surface sediments collected from lakes along a climate gradient from the winter-cold/summer-wet Alps to winter-wet/summer-dry Sicily were analysed for modern pollen assemblages.
   Methods For each lake, mean monthly temperatures, seasonal precipitation and site-specific climate uncertainties have been estimated. Pollen-climate relationships were studied using numerical analyses, and inference models were derived by partial least squares (PLS) and weighted-averaging PLS (WA-PLS) regressions for January and July temperatures (T), and for winter, spring and summer precipitation (P). In order to assess whether these variables are also of ecological importance for vegetation in the subregions, we split the data set into an Alpine and a Mediterranean subset.
   Results Low bootstrap cross-validated root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for January T (1.7 degrees C), July T (2.1 degrees C) and summer P (38 mm), as well as low RMSEPs expressed as a percentage of the gradient length (8-9%), indicate a good inference power. Models revealed excellent to good performance statistics for January T, July T and summer P (r(2)= 0.8), and for winter and spring P (r(2) =c. 0.5). We show that the variables with the highest explanatory power differ between the two subregions. These are summer T and P for the Alpine set, and January T, winter P and July T for the Mediterranean set.
   Main conclusions The study reveals the influence of climatic conditions during the growing season on modern pollen assemblages and indicates the potential of pollen data for long-term climate reconstructions of parameters such as winter precipitation and temperature, which seem to be the main factors having an influence on the variability of Mediterranean climate. These models may therefore provide important information on past regional climate variability in southern Europe.

AB  - Models of the solar nebula are constructed to investigate the hypothesis that surviving planetary objects began to form as the nebula cooled from an early, hot epoch. The imprint of such an epoch might be retained in the spatial distribution of planetary material, the systematic deviations of its elemental composition from that of the Sun, chemical indicators of primordial oxidation state, and variations in oxygen and other isotopic compositions. Our method of investigation is to calculate the time-dependent, two-dimensional temperature distributions within model nebulas of prescribed dynamical evolution, and to deduce the consequences of the calculated thermal histories for coagulated solid material. The models are defined by parameters which characterize nebular initial states (mass and angular momentum), mass accretion histories, and coagulation rates and efficiencies. It is demonstrated that coagulation during the cooling of the nebula from a hot state is expected to produce systematic heterogeneities which affect the chemical and isotopic compositions of planetary material. The radial thermal gradient at the midplane results in delayed coagulation of the more volatile elements. Vertical thermal gradients isolate the most refractory material and concentrate evaporated heavy elements in the gas phase. It is concluded that these effects could be responsible for the distribution of terrestrial planetary masses, the systematic depletion patterns of the moderately volatile elements in chondritic meteorites and the Earth, the range of oxygen isotopic compositions exhibited by calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and other refractory inclusions, and some geochemical evidence for a moderately enhanced oxidation state. However, nebular fractionations on a global scale are unlikely to account for the more oxidizing conditions inferred for some CAIs and chondritic silicates, which require dust enhancements greater than a few hundred. This conclusion, along with the well-established evidence from studies of chondrules and CAIs for thermal excursions of short duration, make it likely that local environments, unrelated to nebular thermal evolution, were also important.

AB  - A non-spectral model is described that can be used to calculate N-2-fixation rate from remote estimates of Trichodestmium biomass. This model, which is similar to formulations that have been developed for estimating primary production from satellite-derived phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, is parameterized using measured Trichodesmium N-2-fixation vs. irradiance (I) data and observed subsurface Trichodesmium biomass profiles from the Tropical Atlantic Ocean. These data reveal that the N2-fixation vs. I responses and subsurface distributions of Trichodesmium vary substantially in tropical waters. The calculated rates are sensitive to only one of three forcing variables: the remotely sensed Trichodesmium chlorophyll concentration, B-T(sat), and two of the model parameters: the maximum N-2-fixation rate, P-max(BT) and the depth of the subsurface Trichodesmium biomass maximum, Z(m). The model is particularly sensitive to the latter. These results suggest that in order to generate N-2-fixation rate estimates with reasonable confidence limits with this model, means must be sought to account for in situ variablity in P-max(BT) and Z(m). A series of correlation analyses reveal statistically significant correlations between the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-par, and P-max(BT), and between wind speed and Z(m). These relationships are suggested as potential means of accounting for natural variability in P-max(BT) and Z(m). An example remote sensing-based rate calculation is made using SeaWiFS-derived Trichodesmium chlorophyll concentration in the South Atlantic Bight described in Subramaniam et al., 2002 (Deep-Sea Research, 2002). Although the optical conditions in the Bight were not all within the range used to derive the model parameters, the model gives rates that are consistent with direct rate measurements in Trichodesmium blooms. Because Trichodesmium biomass can only be detected remotely at relatively high concentrations, efforts to estimate global rates with this model will require the use of both shipboard and satellite data.

AB  - The response of walnut trees to nitrogen (N) availability was studied on 3-year-old pot-grown trees (Juglans major MJ209 L. x Juglans regia L.) in a greenhouse and on 10-year-old field grown trees. The greenhouse pot trial included 5 N levels (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5 and 5 g N per plant), and the field trial compared walnut trees with or without N-2-fixing intercrops. In the greenhouse trial, the growth of both root and aerial parts was found to be significantly dependent on N availability. The deficiency treatment (0.25 g N/plant) reduced leaf and root dry weights to 30 and 54% of those of the sufficiency treatment (5 g N/plant) values. The analysis of the youngest fully expanded leaf after the end of shoot elongation period was a good indicator of the tree N nutrition level. Severe deficiency corresponded to leaf N contents below 17 g N kg(-1) DM (mean dry matter), light deficiency between 17 and 24, and maximum growth was obtained with 26 g N kg(-1) DM contents. Terminal leaflet chlorophyll measurements were linearly correlated with N concentration expressed on a leaf area basis (gN m(-2), r(2)=0.73 for greenhouse trees and r(2)=0.86 for field trees). The chlorophyll meter readings divided by the specific leaf weight were also correlated with N expressed on a weight basis (g N kg(-1) DM, r(2) = 0.73 for greenhouse trees and r(2)=0.89 for field trees). However, these relationships were found to be dependent of environmental conditions and were different between greenhouse and field grown trees. Relative indices of chlorophyll measurements and of N concentrations were however consistent over the two sites. Chlorophyll meter measurements could therefore be a useful method to assess the N nutrition status of walnut trees at a low cost, provided that some reference trees with sufficient N nutrition are locally available.

AB  - A frontal squall line that passed over the central United States on 14-15 June 1985 consisted of several primary mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) with a prominent gap (several hundred kilometers wide) between two of them over central Kansas and Oklahoma. An upper-level jet sneak crossed the front at right angles, with the jet exit region centered in the gap. Surface, upper-air, radar, and satellite data are used to examine conditions contributing to this squall-line gap.
   All surface indicators (e.g., a sharp wind shift line and strong low-level moisture convergence) pointed toward the development of new deep convection in the gap. Computations of vertical velocity using sounding data showed that the low-level vertical motion was indeed upward there; however, strong subsidence existed aloft. The demarcation between subsidence aloft and ascent at low levels was near the 0 degrees C level, where there was a concurrent inflow into the MCSs. A strong inversion existed near this level, which effectively capped vigorous congestus clouds that formed in the gap.
   The circulations in the gap appeared to be first influenced by the upper-level jet and then the convection itself Initial convection with the first MCS developed in the left-exit region of the jet. The second MCS evolved from initial cells that formed over strongly heated, higher terrain approximately 500 km to the southwest. The subsequent circulations between the MCSs-converging outflows aloft and at the surface, and diverging how near the 0 degrees C level-resemble those generated by gravity waves emanating from an MCS-like convective heat source. The gravity wave-induced subsidence aloft acted in opposition to the jet streak forcing, maintaining a strong cap and preventing deep convection in the squall-line gap. The distinction between highly broken squall lines (such as this one) and those with a nearly contiguous band of cells in the presence of strong low-level convergence appears to be related to the degree of convective inhibition in the environment and how it is modulated by a variety of processes including the convection itself.

AB  - Molecular compositions extracted from source rocks offer direct indicator of the organic matter input, depositional redox conditions and thermal maturity levels that source rock has experienced, however, the application of such technique commonly encounters difficulty in highly mature system. A suite of twenty-eight organic-rich lacustrine shale samples from the Eocene Shahejie Formation in the Dongying Depression, East China were geochemically investigated, aiming to obtain a comprehensive thermal stability sequence of hopanes and the validity of various molecular parameters. By means of systematic comparisons on compound ratios and concentrations, the thermal stability of hopanes is presented as follows: [C35 hopane (H) < (C33H, C32H) < C34H < C30H < C31H < C29H < 17 alpha(H)-22,29,30-trisnorhopane (Tm) < 18 alpha (H)-30-norneohopane (C29Ts) < C30 diahopane (D) < 18 alpha(H)-22,29,30-trisnorneohopane (Ts), from the least stable to the most stable]. Limited validity of the paleoenvironment and organic matter input parameters such as C35H/C34H and C31 22R/C30H ratios in mature source rocks is caused by the preferential decomposition of C35H and C30H compounds during thermal maturation. Therefore, application of molecular parameters derived from hopanes need to be exercised with extra caution. Their validity varies with maturity levels and most hopane related parameters will lose their effectiveness at peak oil generation stage. Meanwhile, a novel maturity parameter (Ts/C29Ts ratio) derived from thermal stability difference of hopanes was proposed herein, supported by strong correlations with vitrinite reflectance and other two reliable maturity parameters. Upon further calibration, this novel maturity parameter can be deemed as a reliably alternative indicator and is expected to have wide application in highly mature source-rock/oil maturity assessment, especially for the shale oil system. The findings of this study may help for better understanding of limited validities of molecular indicators during thermal evolution.

AB  - High-resolution foraminiferal stable isotopes and benthic foraminiferal faunal records of IODP Site U1391 drilled off the western Iberian margin were adopted to reconstruct intermediate water variability of the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic during the late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 13 and MIS 12. Five faunal turnovers were recognized based on multivariate statistical analyses of benthic foraminiferal census data from the size fraction >125 mu m. The dominance of Uvigerina peregrina parva and Melonis barleeanum coincides with high benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates (BFAR), high benthic delta 13C and the presence of dark-colour sediments during the final stage of MIS 13, also accompanied by frequent occurrences of Planulina ariminensis, an indicator of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), which indicates MOW-related high oxic and mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic bottom water environments. MIS 12c and MIS 12b are characterized by Bulimina mexicana assemblage, together with low BFAR, high benthic delta 13C and the presence of light-colour sediments, revealing mesotrophic and well-oxygenated seafloor conditions associated with the possible advection of Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) to the studied site. A prominent increase in organic matter supply and a slight decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration during MIS 12a were reflected by more abundant Bulimina aculeata, higher BFAR, lower benthic delta 13C and the darker-colour sediments relative to MIS 12c-b. A shift in the dominant species and significantly decreased benthic delta 13C, suggest an increased influence of southern-sourced waters (SSW) and a decreased influence of GNAIW during MIS 12a. During the early Termination V (TV), infaunal taxa mainly composed of B. aculeata, Bulimina exilis, Nonionella turgida, Brizalina sp. and Uvigerina proboscidea dominate the benthic foraminiferal population, which may be attributed to eutrophic and poorly-oxygenated bottom water environment strongly influenced by SSW. During the late TV, N. turgida rapidly became the predominant taxa, and its predominance was probably the result of further reduction in dissolved oxygen concentration.

AB  - Veterinary medicines are routinely used in animal husbandry and the environment may consequently be exposed to them via manure applications. This presents potential environmental and societal risks such as toxicological effects to aquatic/terrestrial organisms and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Regulatory studies that assess the degradability of veterinary antibiotics during manure storage currently permit the use of just one manure per animal type although we speculate that heterogenic properties such as pH could be driving significant variability within degradation rates. To bridge this knowledge gap and assess degradation variability with pH, laboratory degradation studies were performed on a broad range of antibiotics (ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and tylosin) at three different environmentally relevant pH levels (5.5, 7, and 8.5). The effect of pig slurry pH on degradation rates was found to be significant and compound specific. Usually, acidic slurries were found to inhibit degradation when compared to neutral pH, for florfenicol, tylosin, and ceftiofur; the associated changes in DT50 (half-life) values were 2-209 h, 35.28-234 h, and 0.98-2.13 h, respectively. In some circumstances alkaline slurries were observed to enhance the degradation rate when compared to those for neutral pH, for tylosin, the respective changes in DT50 values were from 3.52 to 35.28 h. Comparatively, the degradation of sulfamethoxazole was enhanced by acidic conditions compared to neutral (DT50 20.6-31.6 h).Tentative identification of unknown transformation products (TPs) was achieved for sulfamethoxazole and florfenicol for the first time in pig slurries. These results reveal the importance of considering slurry pH when assessing the degradation of antibiotic compounds, which has implications for the acidification of manures and the environmental risk assessment for veterinary medicines.
   Environmental relevance and significance: Given the significant effect of pig slurry pH on degradation rates, manure degradation studies need to be harmonised and standardized, taking into account the influence of pH.

AB  - Background Cyanobacterial blooms are of increasing concern for drinking water supply. In Sweden, a survey among drinking water producers showed that the sense of urgency was little. At 60% of the Swedish drinking water treatment plants, operators lacked monitoring strategies. To get a picture of the size of the problem the presence of cyanobacterial risk in 108 Swedish lakes was evaluated from 23 years of environmental monitoring data. The drivers and indicators for cyanobacterial growth were investigated by analyzing water quality in 9 lakes that have more frequent cyanobacteria bio-volume above the WHO drinking water alert level 1: 0.2 mm(3)L(-1). Results The study shows that the most common species in those lakes are Anabaena/Dolichospermum and Aphanizomenon followed by Microcystis, Woronichinia and Planktothrix, which can produce a variety of toxins such as anatoxins, cylindrospermopsins, microcystins and saxitoxins, supported by literature study. Our results show that cyanobacterial risk in those problematic 9 lakes are mainly nutrients driven with possibly contribution of increased organic matter. By applying non-linear quantile regression with total phosphorus (TP) as an example, we demonstrated that certain drivers such as TP can be useful for cyanobacterial risk assessment and provide control measures by setting nutrients targets. We also evidenced that cyanobacterial peaks presented at low TN:TP ratio while not necessarily vice versa. We also further evaluated that chlorophyll-a and transparency might be suitable as indicators for cyanobacterial blooms in certain lakes, while for most of the lakes, their connection is low. Conclusion Nutrients are main drivers for higher cyanobacterial occurrence in the 9 lakes. We suggest TP concentrations should be investigated thoroughly to provide important knowledge which can be used to set nutrient targets to sustain safe drinking water supply and recreational services. The complexity of indicating cyanobacterial risk in a local condition was also highlighted in this study and future study is suggested. To classify different types of lake and identify their drivers and the similarities of species composition changes in those lakes will be future studied.

AB  - With the development of human society, mega engineering projects of removing the tops of hills to infill valleys began to appear in the loess region. The thickness of the manual filling compacted loess can reach tens of meters. For such large-scale construction projects, studying the properties of compacted loess is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of land creation and artificial infrastructure. In this paper, the specimens from two exploration well profiles were carried out to study the physical properties of natural loess and compacted loess from the Loess Plateau. Here the natural loess selected was deposited in old ages (Q(2) and Q(1)) and had strong stability. The natural water content, dry density, specific gravity, liquid limit, plastic limit, plasticity index, clay fraction, silt fraction, sand fraction, compression modulus, and permeability coefficient have been determined. Statistical theories such as t test and correlation coefficient checks were used to describe the difference between the two kinds of loess, and the degree of correlation among various indicators. Besides, 14 groups of exploration well data in 8 studies were collected. The variation of natural water content and dry density with well depth was analyzed to supplement the existing data. Results have shown that the manual filling compacted loess is significantly different from the natural loess. On the whole, the liquid limit, plastic limit, plasticity index, clay fraction, silt fraction, sand fraction and compression modulus of the compacted loess are smaller. In addition, compared with the natural sedimentary loess with strong stability, it deforms more easily. The difference of compression modulus between the compacted loess and natural loess is mainly controlled by the dry density and the particle composition. Moreover, the heterogeneous level of the manual filling compacted loess is greater than that of the natural loess in the horizontal direction and smaller than that of the natural loess in the vertical direction. Under a combination of external hydrologic conditions and dead weight, the compacted loess will become more stable.

AB  - The release of metal particles and ions due to wear and corrosion is one of the main underlying reasons for the long-term complications of implantable metallic implants. The rather short-term focus of the established in-vitro biocompatibility tests cannot take into account such effects. Corrosion behavior of metallic implants mostly investigated in in-vitro body-like environments for long time periods and their coupling with long-term in-vitro experiments are not practical. Mathematical modeling and modeling the corrosion mechanisms of metals and alloys is receiving a considerable attention to make predictions in particular for long term applications by decreasing the required experimental duration. By using such in-silico approaches, the corrosion conditions for later stages can be mimicked immediately in in-vitro experiments. For this end, we have developed a mathematical model for multi-pit corrosion based on Cellular Automata (CA). The model consists of two sub-models, corrosion initialization and corrosion progression, each driven by a set of rules. The model takes into account several environmental factors (pH, temperature, potential difference, etc.), as well as stochastic component, present in phenomena such as corrosion. The selection of NiTi was based on the risk of Ni release from the implant surface as it leads to immune reactions. We have also performed experiments with Nickel Titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloys. The images both from simulation and experiments can be analyzed using a set of statistical methods, also investigated in this paper (mean corrosion, standard deviation, entropy etc.). For more widespread implementation, both simulation model, as well as analysis of output images are implemented as a web tool. Described methodology could be applied to any metal provided that the parameters for the model are available. Such tool can help biomedical researchers to test their new metallic implant systems at different time points with respect to ion release and corrosion and couple the obtained information directly with in-vitro tests.

AB  - Insights into microbiota adaptation to increased ammonia stress, and identification of indicator microorganisms can help to optimize the operation of anaerobic digesters. To identify microbial indicators and investigate their metabolic contribution to acetoclastic methanogenesis (AM), syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) or hydro-genotrophic methanogenesis (HM), 40 anaerobic batch reactors fed with acetate of 110 mmol/L were set up at NH4+-N concentrations of 0.14 g/L, 5.00 g/L or 7.00 g/L, inoculated with thermophilic or mesophilic microbiota with or without pre-exposure to ammonia stress. Four stable carbon isotope probing approaches were applied in parallel, with [1,2(13)C] -CH3COOH, [2-C-13]-CH3COOH, [C-13]NaHCO3 or non-labeled CH3COOH used individually. The last three approaches were used to quantify the methanogenic pathways by tracking labeled C-13 or natural C-13 signatures in the resulting CH4 and CO2, and consistently detected the dynamic transition of dominant pathways from AM to SAO-HM under ammonia stress. Results of quantitative PCR and fluorescence in-situ hybridization illustrated the procedure, acetotrophic methanogens being outcompeted by acetate-oxidizing syntrophs. The first and last isotope-labeling approaches were designed to probe the active acetate-mineralizing microbes with DNA-SIP. Known acetate-oxidizing bacteria like Syntrophaceticus and Tepidanaerobacter, as well as novel members of Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Symbiobacteraceae were detected, with Methanoculleus as the predominant H-2/CO2 -utilizing partner. Using NanoSIMS, some bacterial cells were observed to be fixing CO2 from [C-13]NaHCO3. In this study, Methanosaeta was only active with ammonia < 200 mg-N/L; the syntrophs catalyzing SAO-HM started to compete with AM-conducting Methanosarcina at intermediate concentrations of ammonia, i.e. 200-500 mg-N/L, and outcompeted the acetotrophic methanogens with ammonia > 500 mg-N/L. Under ammonia stress, diverse known and novel microbial taxa were involved in acetate mineralization, comparable with those identified in previous studies.

AB  - As concerns field work, bathymetric measurements as well as measurements of physical and chemical parameters of water were conducted, and samples were collected for laboratory tests, which included quantitative and qualitative hydrobiological analyses concerning e.g. the abundance, biomass and species composition of phytoplankton, seston and chlorophyll. Six water bodies (situated in flooded chalk pits) with different morphometric parameters (areas ranging from 2.22 to 37.67 ha, depths ranging from 5.1 to 23.0 m and nearshore shallow areas ranging from 0.39 to 2.64 ha) and with different bioproductive characteristics of water mass (eg. transparency - 1.2-6.8 m, phosphates - 0.002-0.110 mg/dm3, nitrates - 0.040-0.600 mg NO-3/dm3, biomass of phytoplankton - 0.075-1.801 mg/dm3, seston - 0.73-5.56 mg/dm3) were selected for the study of the phytomediation mechanism. The specificity of structural and functional relationships between the abiotic and biotic components of productive-macrophyte and productive-phytoplankton reservoirs is determined. It was established that macrophyte water bodies in flooded chalk pits are able to maintain their basic production and trophic characteristics in the long term under anthropogenic influence conditions. An algorithm is proposed for calculating the level (E - 89.58-115.13), productivity index (K - 11.16-54.15) and gradient (E - 2.1-9.8) of eutrophication of chalk (limestone) quarry reservoirs using the morphometric specificity indicator of the trophogenic epilimnial layer (S tau - 0.05-0.270). The revealed dependence of the productive and functional organization and trophic status of a quarry reservoir on the morphometric features of a technogenic basin is proposed to be used in the design of sustainably functioning macrophyte-type aquatic systems at the stage of mining and engineering reclamation. The possibility of creating ecologically sustainable lake-type aquatic systems on the site of resource depleted chalk quarries in the process of phytomediation of productive processes is substantiated. Research on innovative methods of reclamation of flooded chalk pits is in line with several sustainable development goals.

AB  - Background Diminished visual monitoring of faces and activities of others is an early feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is uncertain whether deficits in activity monitoring, identified using a homogeneous set of stimuli, persist throughout the lifespan in ASD, and thus, whether they could serve as a biological indicator ("biomarker") of ASD. We investigated differences in visual attention during activity monitoring in children and adult participants with autism compared to a control group of participants without autism. Methods Eye movements of participants with autism (n = 122; mean age [SD] = 14.5 [8.0] years) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 40, age = 16.4 [13.3] years) were recorded while they viewed a series of videos depicting two female actors conversing while interacting with their hands over a shared task. Actors either continuously focused their gaze on each other's face (mutual gaze) or on the shared activity area (shared focus). Mean percentage looking time was computed for the activity area, actors' heads, and their bodies. Results Compared to TD participants, participants with ASD looked longer at the activity area (mean % looking time: 58.5% vs. 53.8%,p < 0.005) but less at the heads (15.2% vs. 23.7%,p < 0.0001). Additionally, within-group differences in looking time were observed between the mutual gaze and shared focus conditions in both participants without ASD (activity:Delta = - 6.4%,p < 0.004; heads:Delta = + 3.5%,p < 0.02) and participants with ASD (bodies:Delta = + 1.6%,p < 0.002). Limitations The TD participants were not as well characterized as the participants with ASD. Inclusion criteria regarding the cognitive ability [intelligence quotient (IQ) > 60] limited the ability to include individuals with substantial intellectual disability. Conclusions Differences in attention to faces could constitute a feature discriminative between individuals with and without ASD across the lifespan, whereas between-group differences in looking at activities may shift with development. These findings may have applications in the search for underlying biological indicators specific to ASD. Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02668991.

AB  - Climate change projections for Southern Europe reveal warming and drying trends for the upcoming decades, bringing important challenges to Portuguese olive orchards in particular. We analyzed irrigation as an adaptation measure to ensure the future sustainability of olive tree yields in Alentejo, the main olive producing area in Portugal. A dynamic crop model was used to simulate olive tree yields over the baseline (1981-2005) and two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, 2021-2080), using a 4 member-ensemble of state-of-the-art climate model chains. Climate change projections point to an increase in mean temperature (of up to 2 degrees C by 2080) and potential evapotranspiration (40 - 50 mm), while a decrease in precipitation (-80 to -90 mm) and actual evapotranspiration (-50 to - 70 mm), under both future scenarios. Future yield decreases 15-20% (for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and accumulated losses can reach -8 t/ha to -10 t/ha by 2080. This decrease is due to enhanced heat and water stress under future climate conditions. As an adaptation measure, irrigation was simulated, but only applied at a certain water stress level. The results indicate higher yields due to this adaptation strategy, in range with the present values (+/- 1%), thus alleviating the projected yield decreases in the future. The amount of water required for irrigation ranges from 60 to 85 mm, depending on the RCP, which corresponds to 0.6-1 times the projected decrease in precipitation. However, this value can reach up to 2 times for one climate model chain. We conclude that while irrigation is a feasible adaptation measure against the threats of climate change in Alentejo olive orchards, this strategy may be threatened by the scarcity of water resources. Outlining appropriate, timely and cost-effective adaptation measures is critical for the sustainability of both the environment and the Alentejo olive sector.

AB  - Plantain needs to accomplish different quality conditions to be exported. Nevertheless, organoleptic aspects contribute to rejecting more than 20% of the plantain production gener-ating environmental problems. Therefore, this study aims to perform the techno-economic analysis of the bioethanol and plantain flour production using unripe plantain as raw mate-rial. For this, different scenarios were proposed and simulated. The first scenario comprises the production of bioethanol and plantain flour using whole plantain flour (with peel), while the second scenario uses separately the peel and pulp. Then, an overall analysis of the mass and energy performance of the processes as well as an economic assessment in Colombia, and Mexico was done. The starch content of peel (39.4%) and pulp (84.2%) in the unripe plan-tain fruits allows proposing this raw material to produce flour and bioethanol. Moreover, the calorific value obtained for the peel and pulp flours (15.32 MJ/kg and 15.12 MJ/kg, respectively) allows elucidating a high potential of this raw material to be upgraded in biotechnological processes. The simulation results suggest that plantain flour with peel has a better process performance than the use of separately the peel and pulp in the flour and bioethanol pro-duction. Moreover, flour with peel has greater potential, especially to produce foodstuffs due to the nutritional content, commercial value and, defined market. Instead, the lower annual operating costs in Mexico make a difference to obtain a more profitable project compared with the Colombian case. Finally, the rejected plantain has the potential to be used as a raw material to obtain flour. However, other energy vectors such as biogas could be better than bioethanol as an option to increase the number of products from this raw material at low scales. Therefore, rejected plantain represents an entrepreneurship opportunity to obtain marketable products at a local and regional level.

AB  - Molecular and biochemical markers are used to analyze the intraspecific genetic diversity of crops. Prolamin--coding loci are highly effective for assessing this indicator. On the basis of the Laboratory of Varietal Seed Identification of the State Agrarian University of the Northern Trans-Urals, 18 varieties of common oat included in the State Register of Selection Achievements in the Tyumen Region from the 1930s to 2019 were -studied by electrophoresis in 2018-2019. The aim of the work was to study the dynamics of the genetic diversity of oat va-rieties at avenin-coding loci. For the analysis, 100 grains of each variety were used. Electrophoresis was carried out in vertical plates of 13.2 % polyacrylamide gel at a constant vol-tage of 500 V for 4.0-4.5 h. It was found that 44.4 % of the varieties are heterogeneous, each consisting of two biotypes. For three loci, 20 alleles were identified, 10 of which were detected for the first time. The allele frequency of avenin-coding loci varied with time. In the process of variety exchange, alleles that are characteristic of varieties of non-Russian origin were replaced by alleles present in domestic varieties and then in the varieties developed by local breeding institutions. The following alleles had the highest frequency in Tyumen varieties: Avn A4 (50.0 %), A2 (25.0 %), Avn B4 (50.0 %), Bnew6 (37.5 %), Avn C1 (37.5 %), C2 and C5 (25.0 %). These alleles are of great value as markers of agronomically and adaptively important characters for the region in question. The amount of genetic diversity of oats varied with time from 0.33 in 1929-1950 to up to 0.75 in 2019. The high value of genetic diversity in modern breeding varieties of the Scientific Research Institute of Agriculture of the Northern Trans-Urals and an increase in this indicator over the past 20 years are associated with the use of genetically heterogeneous source material in the breeding process. This allowed obtaining varieties with high adaptive potentials in the natural climatic conditions of the region.

AB  - Our understanding of food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been hampered by limitations in the temporal and spatial representativeness of data. Food balance sheets provide scalable estimates of per capita food availability, but fail to represent food access, stability and their causal linkages. In contrast, rural household surveys represent detailed conditions for one or multiple points in time, but are influenced by survey timing and are often limited in geographical coverage. This study draws on a large sample of rural land-holding households in SSA (n = 6,353) to identify household level food access deficiencies and to understand the associations with rural livelihoods and food sourcing behavior throughout the year. Food access deficiencies were identified using food security of access and diet diversity indicators. Dietary diversity and channel of access (farm or purchased) were enumerated for the "flush" and "lean" periods and food security of access was enumerated for the lean period only - making the results of this study independent of survey timing. As many as 39% of households were classified as severely food insecure (in terms of food access) and as many as 49% of households were likely to be deficient in micronutrients in the lean period. Vulnerability to food insecurity and micronutrient deficiencies differed by household composition, agricultural livelihood characteristics and agro-ecological zone. Dairy, fruit and vitamin A-rich produce were predominantly accessed through the farm channel. Households with a livestock component to their farm had a lower prevalence of severe food insecurity and higher diet diversity scores. These findings have implications for the development of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions. Interventions need to be tailored to agro-ecological zone, household composition, scale of operation and production mix. Increasing income will not necessarily result in improved diet diversity or healthy dietary choices. Interventions focused on income generation should monitor and promote crop and livestock production diversity and provide nutrition education.

AB  - Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) was evaluated as a tool for managing the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and clubroot disease, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, in mustard greens (Brassica juncea) produced on Ohio muck soils in Huron and Stark Counties. In two consecutive years of field trials, wheat bran (20.2 Mg ha(-1)), molasses (10.1 Mg ha(-1)), and wheat bran (20.2 Mg ha(-1)) plus molasses (10.1 Mg ha(-1)) were assessed as ASD carbon sources and compared with nonamended controls. Data were collected from plants grown in the field and from plants grown in field-treated soils in growth chamber-based post-ASD bioassays. Anaerobic conditions developed in ASD-treated soils in both trial years, as indicated by polyvinyl chloride pipes painted with an iron oxide paint. Soil pH did not decrease during ASD at the Huron County site of the mustard greens clubroot trials in either trial year but soil pH decreased significantly during ASD in Stark County soils treated with ASD with either wheat bran or wheat bran plus molasses compared with control soils in both trial years. Impacts of ASD on plant biomass were inconsistent in direct field measurements; however, significantly higher biomasses were observed in lettuce and mustard greens grown in bioassay soils collected from plots treated with ASD with wheat bran-based amendments compared with plants grown in soils from control plots. Based on direct field measurements and bioassays, the use of ASD with any carbon source led to significant reductions in root-knot nematode galling on lettuce compared with controls. Reductions in clubroot severity in mustard greens following ASD were less consistent; however, significant reductions in clubroot severity were observed in the field in one trial year and in both years of bioassays. The results of these studies indicate that ASD is a promising tool for managing soilborne diseases in muck soil vegetable production systems.

AB  - Uninhabited islands are important for providing isolated habitats for unique biological resources, and revealing the spatial pattern of plant diversity is of great significance for the island biodiversity conservation. A total of 15 uninhabited islands in Miaodao Archipelago, a group of typical uninhabited islands in North China, were selected as the study area. The multiple gradients at island and site scales were identified and quantified based on field investigation and remote sensing methods, and seven "from macro to micro" aspects, including morphology, proximity, landscape, terrain, atmosphere, soil, and vegetation, were selected to cover all aspects of factors influencing the plant diversity. Then, the single and comprehensive effects of the multiple gradients on the spatial pattern of plant diversity at the dual scales were analyzed using methods of regression analysis and canonical correspondence analysis ordination. Results indicated that 130 plant species were recorded. The species accumulation curves proved the sufficiency of the numbers of sampling sires and islands to represent the overall characteristics of plant diversity. The species composition on the uninhabited islands possessed common characteristics with the neighboring inhabited islands and mainland, meanwhile, showed unique features on the dominant species. The alpha diversity showed distinct spatial heterogeneities at the dual scales; the beta diversity indicated the great difference of species composition within an island and among different islands. Al island scale, island area, vegetation condition, and terrain complexity contributed the most to the spatial pattern of plant diversity. At site scale, biodiversity indices changed irregularly along the multiple gradient factors, yet all aspects of gradients showed significant effects on the species composition and distribution. The island area played a fundamental role in determining the et diversity at island scale and generating the beta diversity within an island, however, was not significantly correlated with the diversity at site scale.

AB  - Little is known about how introducing recycled water intended for direct potable reuse (DPR) into distribution systems and premise plumbing will affect water quality at the point of use, particularly with respect to effects on microbial communities and regrowth. The examination of potential growth of opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), each representing serious and growing public health concerns, by introducing DPR water has not previously been evaluated. In this study, the impact of blending purified DPR water with traditional drinking water sources was investigated with respect to treatment techniques, blending location, and blending ratio. Water from four U.S. utility partners was treated in bench- and pilot-scale treatment trains to simulate DPR with blending. Water was incubated in simulated premise plumbing rigs made of PVC pipe containing brass coupons to measure regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes, heterotrophic plate count), OPs (Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ARGs (qnrA, vanA), and an indicator of horizontal gene transfer and multi-drug resistance (intl1). The microbial community composition was profiled and the resistome (i.e., all ARGs present) was characterized in select samples using next generation sequencing. While regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes) from the start of the incubation through week eight consistently occurred across tested scenarios (Wilcoxon, p <= 0.0001), total bacteria were not more abundant in the water or biofilm of any DPR scenario than in the corresponding conventional potable condition (p >= 0.0748). Regrowth of OP marker genes, qnrA, vanA, and intl1 were not significantly greater in water or biofilm for any DPR blends treated with advanced oxidation compared to corresponding potable water (p >= 0.1047). This study of initial bacteria colonizing pipes after introduction of blended DPR water revealed little evidence (i.e., one target in one water type) of exacerbated regrowth of total bacteria, OPs, or ARGs in premise plumbing.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to report upon the further development of a hybrid application programming interface (API) plug-in to building information modelling (BIM) entitled confined spaces safety monitoring system "CoSMoS". Originally designed to engineer-out environmental hazards associated with working in a building's confined spaces (during the construction phase of a building's life-cycle), this second generation version is expanded upon to use archival records to proactively learn from data generated within a sensor network during the building's operations and maintenance (O&M) phase of asset management (AM). Design/methodology/approach An applied research methodological approach adopted used a two-phase process. In phase one, a conceptual model was created to provide a "blueprint map" to integrate BIM, sensor-based networks and data analytics (DA) into one integral system. A literature review provided the basis for the conceptual model's further development. In phase two, the conceptual model was transposed into the prototype's development environment as a proof of concept using primary data accrued from a large educational building. Findings An amalgamation of BIM, historical sensor data accrued and the application of DA demonstrate that CoSMoS provides an opportunity for the facilities management (FM) team to monitor pertinent environmental conditions and human behaviour within buildings that may impact upon occupant/worker safety. Although working in confined spaces is used to demonstrate the inherent potential of CoSMoS, the system could readily be expanded to analyse sensor-based network's historical data of other areas of building performance, maintenance and safety. Originality/value This novel prototype has automated safety applications for FM during the asset lifecycle and maintenance phase of a building's O&M phase of AM. Future work is proposed in several key areas, namely, develop instantaneous indicators of current safety performance within a building; and develop lead indicators of future safety performance of buildings.

AB  - Metals are indicators of contamination by anthropic activities, such as road traffic. To assess the extent of the metal contamination, more comprehensive studies analyzing different environmental matrices, such as soils, dust, and plants, collected in different sites that are potential sources of these pollutants along the highways, must be prioritized. Samples of soils, dust, and plants were collected alongside the highways of Brazil at 20 sites selected in strategic locations of metal accumulation (Cr, Pb, Zn, As, and Sb) or different situations of the high ways during two rain conditions (wet and dry weeks of sampling): nearby gutters and water supplies, tolls, petrol stations, a federal road police station, and areas associated with agriculture (yearly culture planting upstream of the highway). The geoaccumulation index (metal concentration in the sample of interest/background) varied from 0 to 6, and the decreasing order of contamination by metals during the wet and dry periods were, respectively: Zn > As > Pb = Sb > Cr and Zn > As > Pb > Cr > Sb. In the soils near the highways, the highest concentrations of metals were as follows (mg kg(-1)): As = 15.6, Cr = 81.9, Pb = 39.7, Sb = 5.0, and Zn = 379.3. The highest amounts of these elements in the most superficial layer in soils indicated their addition through atmospheric emissions. The most prominent metal was Sb, whose concentration was greater than the quality limits for soils. The concentration of Sb in soils was higher in the wet week than in the dry week. The emissions from road traffic promoted the increase in metals in the dust on the track, especially Zn and Pb. The highest metal concentrations in grasses (Brachiaria) were found in the roots, except for Sb and Zn, which suggests leaf absorption of atmospheric deposition. Metal contamination was widespread in all studied matrices along the highways.

AB  - Background: A heterocyclic compound containing Nitrogen linkage attracts interest in its synthesis in which cyclization reaction is conducted using suitable linear compounds. These compounds reported having biological effects such as anti-tumor, antibacterial, antidepressant, analgesic and antiviral activities. An efficient One-Pot protocol for the synthesis of 5-amino-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile and its derivative using aromatic aldehyde, malononitrile, phenylhydrazine and Mg-Fe hydrotalcite as a heterogeneous catalyst at ambient temperature. Hydrotalcite also known as layer double hydroxide has a layer structure in which anionic species such as carbonate and hydroxide located in the interlayer region, has been reported as drug delivery agent, ion - exchanger and catalyst.
   Methods: Catalyst synthesized by co-precipitation method and characterization of catalyst carried out using an analytical technique such as XRD, TGA and SEM. The catalyst is used for the synthesis of substituted 5-amino-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile heterocyclic moieties. Molecules are characterized using H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR.
   Results: Hydrotalcite of the various molar ratio of Mg/Fe was synthesize and screen for reaction. Catalyst characterization was done using XRD and TGA matched with the reported literature. Solvent, catalyst quantity and catalyst reusability also screen for reaction. Basicity study was done as per literature survey (Hammet indicator method). One pot methodology of synthesis applies for all substituted organic molecules.
   Conclusion: The calcined Mg-Fe hydrotalcite with a molar ratio of 3: 1 derived from calcinations was found to be the suitable catalyst that gives the highest basicity and best catalytic activity. This procedure offers several advantages over reported methods including shorter reaction time, high yield and simple work-up procedure. Calcined hydrotalcite was found to be an effective catalyst for the synthesis of 5-amino-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile and its derivatives at room temperature conditions. The catalytic activities of the calcined hydrotalcite show a striking correlation with their corresponding basic properties. This process has an advantage over the other reported methodology such as Non-toxic, reusable catalyst, convenient and cost-effective.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) over-exposure in occupational settings is associated with basal ganglia toxicity and a movement disorder characterized by parkinsonism (i.e., the signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease). A simple test to help non-neurologists identify workers with clinical Mn neurotoxicity represents an unmet need. In a cohort of Mn-exposed workers from welding worksites, with extensive clinical data, we developed a linear regression model to predict the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor subsection part 3 (UPDRS3) score. We primarily considered factors easily obtained in a primary care or occupational medicine clinic, specifically easily assessed signs of parkinsonism and factors likely to be associated with UPDRS3 such as age, timed motor task results, and selected symptoms/conditions. Secondarily we considered other demographic variables and welding exposure. We based the model on 596 examined workers age <= 65 years and with timed motor task data. We selected the model based on simplicity for clinical application, biologic plausibility, and statistical significance and magnitude of regression coefficients. The model contained age, timed motor task scores for each hand, and indicators of action tremor, speech difficulty, anxiety, depression, loneliness, pain and current cigarette smoking. When we examined how well the model identified workers with clinically significant parkinsonism (UPDRS3 >= 15) the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67, 0.77). With a cut point that provided 80% sensitivity, specificity was 52%, the positive predictive value in our cohort was 29%, and the negative predictive value was 92%. Using the same cut point for predicted UPDRS3, the AUC was nearly identical for UPDRS3 >= 10, and was 0.83 (95% Cl 0.76, 0.90) for UPDRS3 >= 20. Since welding exposure data was not required after including its putative effects, this model may help identify workers with clinically significant Mn neurotoxicity in a variety of settings, as a first step in a tiered occupational screening program.

AB  - Since 2002, the abundance of larvae of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) has been monitored in July in coastal nurseries (Anse Ste.-Anne (ASA) and Banc de RiviSre-du-Loup (BRL)) in the Middle St. Lawrence Estuary (MSLE), Canada. The two species are spatiotemporally segregated, with smelt larvae being more abundant at the upstream, less saline site (ASA) and having an earlier hatching date. Despite these differences, the abundances of both species from 2002 to 2013 were strongly and positively related to the early spring flow of tributaries at the time of larval smelt emergence and weakly and negatively related to sea-surface temperatures in the nurseries. Larval herring abundance was weakly associated with the upstream bottom residual transport flow of the MSLE's estuarine circulation in June, at the time of their emergence. Larval herring lengths in BRL were positively related to the sum of degree days (SDD) from hatching to sampling, with the greatest length but lowest condition in 2012. The relationship between body lengths of ASA smelt larvae and SDD was dome-shaped, suggesting lower growth than expected in the warmest years, 2006 and 2012. The highest larval abundances were observed in 2008 and 2011, both years with late tributary freshets, high tributary flows in the early spring and moderately warm summer temperatures. In contrast, low abundances occurred in 2006 and 2012, which were years with low spring tributary flows and high summer temperatures. These results suggest that the dynamics of local tributary freshets is a key driver of larval recruitment success for two key forage species in coastal nurseries until summer and support the use of fish larvae as indicators of environmental changes in the MSLE.

AB  - Effective management strategies for nitrogen (N) fertiliser are important to ensure optimum seed yields and seed quality of canola (Brassier" napus L.) crop production. A field experiment was conducted for 3 years in Ontario, Canada to determine the (i) impact of different rates and timing of application of N fertiliser on canola yield and quality; and (ii) fertiliser-N economy, including agronomic N-use efficiency (aN GE), N-uptake efficiency (NupE), N-utilisation efficiency, partial N balance and N harvest index. Treatments included factorial combinations of six (2011) or eight (2012 and 2013) rates of N as urea (46% N) and timing of application (pre-plant only or preplant plus side-dressed applications at the 6-leaf stage). Side-dressed N application resulted in significant improvements in seed yield and protein concentrations (up to 16%) over equivalent preplant only applications. The highest seed yield (2700 kg ha(-1) in 2011 and 3500 kg ha(-1) in 2013) was produced by the treatments including side-dressing: 50 + 50 kg N ha(-1) or 50 + 100 kg N ha(-1) (preplant + side dressing). Seed protein concentrations varied from 21% to 23% in 2011 and 2013 and up to 28% in 2012. On average, the sum of protein and oil concentrations was 65 68%. Oil yield increased with increasing N rates in 2011 and 2013, but significant increases were recorded only when N was side-dressed at the 6-leaf stage. Drought conditions in 2012 negated responses to N fertiliser regardless of when it was applied. In general, aNUE and N-utilisation efficiency were decreased with increasing N fertiliser rates, but NupE varied among environments with increasing preplant and side-dressed N application. Side-dressed N applications after preplant application resulted in higher partial N balance, aNUE and/or higher NupE than comparative preplant-only N applications. Overall, side-dressed N application led to improved crop N uptake and better N economy of canola production in eastern Canada.

AB  - The continental margin off the northeastern United States (NEUS) contains numerous, topographically complex features that increase habitat heterogeneity across the region. However, the majority of these rugged features have never been surveyed, particularly using direct observations. During summer 2013, 31 Remotely-Operated Vehicle (ROV) dives were conducted from 494 to 3271 m depth across a variety of seafloor features to document communities and to infer geological processes that produced such features. The ROV surveyed six broad-scale habitat features, consisting of shelf-breaching canyons, slope-sourced canyons, inter-canyon areas, open-slope/landslide-scar areas, hydrocarbon seeps, and Mytilus Seamount. Four previously unknown chemosynthetic communities dominated by Bathymodiolus mussels were documented. Seafloor methane hydrate was observed at two seep sites. Multivariate analyses indicated that depth and broad-scale habitat significantly influenced megafaunal coral (58 taxa), demersal fish (69 taxa), and decapod crustacean (34 taxa) assemblages. Species richness of fishes and crustaceans significantly declined with depth, while there was no relationship between coral richness and depth. Turnover in assemblage structure occurred on the middle to lower slope at the approximate boundaries of water masses found previously in the region. Coral species richness was also an important variable explaining variation in fish and crustacean assemblages. Coral diversity may serve as an indicator of habitat suitability and variation in available niche diversity for these taxonomic groups. Our surveys added 24 putative coral species and three fishes to the known regional fauna, including the black coral Telopathes magna, the octocoral Metallogorgia melanotrichos and the fishes Gaidropsarus argentatus, Guttigadus latifrons, and Lepidion guentheri. Marine litter was observed on 81% of the dives, with at least 12 coral colonies entangled in debris. While initial exploration revealed the NEUS region to be both geologically dynamic and biologically diverse, further research into the abiotic conditions and the biotic interactions that influence species abundance and distribution is needed.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation is a key objective for sustainable forest management, but the multi-dimensional and multi-scale character of biodiversity renders full assessment difficult at large scale. Therefore, indicators are often used to monitor biodiversity. Important cost-benefit synergies can be achieved if indicators are derived from existing data. In this study, a model for classifying forest stand structures was developed and tested as an indicator of overall plant species diversity at stand level. The model combines four stand structure parameters: canopy coverage, age of canopy trees, tree species composition and canopy stratification. Using data from the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden and General Linear Mixed Model, plant species diversity (Shannon diversity index, SHDI) and composition (Sorensen-Dice index, SDI) were tested between 26 different stand structure types and nine soil classes. The results showed that mature stands with a stratified canopy had the highest plant species diversity across the soil classes, particularly if they comprised mixed coniferous and broadleaved species with a semi-open canopy. In contrast, young (<30 years) single-layered stands had consistently low species diversity. Of the four stand structure parameters in the model, age of canopy trees was most influential for SHDI value, followed by canopy stratification, tree species composition and canopy coverage. According to the SDI values, different stand structure types represented different species composition regardless of soil class and species diversity (SHDI value). However, most SDI values were higher than 0.5, indicating that fewer than 50% of the species changed between stand structure types. The stand parameters included in the model can probably be extracted from national forest inventories in many countries and understood without specialist taxonomic knowledge, making the model applicable in practice to support forest management decision-making on enhancing forest biodiversity at stand level.

AB  - Understanding the relationships among soil properties and, in turn, their relationships with landform, land use and soil type is essential for assessing soil quality and soil productivity. In this study, we examined the differences in the chemical properties and enzymatic activities of soils in a variety of landforms (plateau land, sloping land, terraced land and gully bottoms), land uses (woodland, grassland, cropland and orchard) and soil types (Chernozems, Cambisols and Regosols) in a gully watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. In total, 202 samples of surface soil (0-20 cm) were collected from different representative landscape units of the watershed. The chemical properties and enzymatic activities of the soils were measured. The results showed that chemical properties and enzymatic activities of the soils were all significantly influenced by landform, land use and soil type. There were interactive effects between landform and soil type. Soil pH varied the least, while invertase activity varied the most with landscape conditions. Soil pH, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, and enzymatic activities were all highest on plateau land and lowest on terraced land. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents and alkaline phosphatase and invertase activities were higher in Chernozems than in Regosols, but the opposite trend was noted for pH, cation exchange capacity and catalase activity. Significantly higher values for most soil properties or enzymatic activities occurred in combinations including plateau land, Chernozems or Regosols. Soil pH was significantly lower in woodland soils than for other land uses, whereas the other properties had higher values in grassland and woodland soils than in orchard soils. The results from this study indicate the roles of landform, land use and soil type on the spatial patterns of chemical properties and enzymatic activities of soils and suggest that crops and orchards should be arranged on plateau land, and grasses and woodland on terraced and sloping land, respectively, for better economic and ecological efficiency in the area.

AB  - Phase compositions and microtextures of ore minerals in intrusive traps of the western part of the Siberian Platform have been studied using scanning electron microscopy. Oxide and sulfide solid solutions crystallize at the magmatic stage; their grain and aggregate shapes are determined by the cooling rate of magmatic bodies. We have revealed a gradual transition of oxides from fine-grained texture in the quenching zone, through skeleton, case, and frame forms, to isometric aggregates of mixed crystals in the holocrystalline silicate matrix. Sulfide spheroids (either associated with oxides or separated from them) are changed by dissemination and nests. The chemical compositions of both oxides and sulfides are correlated with the petrochemical types of rocks. Chrome-spinels or chrome-enriched ulvospinels crystallize first in the most magnesian dolerites. Iron and titanium oxides with Mn, V, Mg, and Al impurities prevail in the rest rock varieties. As temperature decreases, ilmenite, ulvospinel, and titanomagnetite crystallize after chrome-spinels. Exsolution structures are very intricate for titanium and iron oxides and depend on the oxidation conditions and on the assemblage of impurities and their quantities. The first exsolution particles of ilmenite are more magnesian, while the following ones are more manganese. Subsolvus exsolution is accompanied by the release of impurities, grain stripping, and rearrangement and natural enrichment of ore material. Conjugate transformation of silicates and ore minerals results in aggregate pseudomorphs and minerals, such as titanite, zircon, and baddeleyite. Nickel-containing sulfides formed at the magmatic stage prevail in more magnesian rocks. Copper minerals are more diverse. These are polymorphic modifications of chalcopyrite and cubanite in ore solid solutions formed at the magmatic stage, chalcopyrite in paragenesis with monoclinic pyrrhotite in zones of hydrothermal metasomatites, and chalcopyrite in solid solutions with bornite and chalcosine and in assemblage with low-temperature sulfides. The obtained data on mineral structures and assemblages can be used as indicators to classify the genesis and formation types of ores. (C) 2014, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS.

AB  - In this study multivariate and geostatistical methods are jointly applied to model the spatial and temporal distribution of arsenic (As) concentrations in shallow groundwater as a function of physicochemical, hydrogeological and land use parameters, as well as to assess the related uncertainty. The study site is located in the Mondego River alluvial body in Central Portugal, where maize, rice and some vegetable crops dominate. In a first analysis scatter plots are used, followed by the application of principal component analysis to two different data matrices, of 112 and 200 samples, with the aim of detecting associations between As levels and other quantitative parameters. In the following phase explanatory models of As are created through factorial regression based on correspondence analysis, integrating both quantitative and qualitative parameters. Finally, these are combined with indicator-geostatistical techniques to create maps indicating the predicted probability of As concentrations in groundwater exceeding the current global drinking water guideline of 10 mu g/l. These maps further allow assessing the uncertainty and representativeness of the monitoring network. A clear effect of the redox state on the presence of As is observed, and together with significant correlations with dissolved oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, iron, manganese and alkalinity, points towards the reductive dissolution of Fe (hydr)oxides as the essential mechanism of As release. The association of high As values with rice crop, known to promote reduced environments due to ponding, further corroborates this hypothesis. An additional source of As from fertilizers cannot be excluded, as the correlation with As is higher where rice is associated with vegetables, normally associated with higher fertilization rates. The best explanatory model of As occurrence integrates the parameters season, crop type, well and water depth, nitrate and Eh, though a model without the last two parameters also gives quite satisfactory results.

AB  - Measures of climate change adaptation often involve modification of land use and land use planning practices. Such changes in land use affect the provision of various ecosystem goods and services. Therefore, it is likely that adaptation measures may result in synergies and trade-offs between a range of ecosystems goods and services. An integrative land use modelling approach is presented to assess such impacts for the European Union. A reference scenario accounts for current trends in global drivers and includes a number of important policy developments that correspond to on-going changes in European policies. The reference scenario is compared to a policy scenario in which a range of measures is implemented to regulate flood risk and protect soils under conditions of climate change. The impacts of the simulated land use dynamics are assessed for four key indicators of ecosystem service provision: flood risk, carbon sequestration, habitat connectivity and biodiversity. The results indicate a large spatial variation in the consequences of the adaptation measures on the provisioning of ecosystem services. Synergies are frequently observed at the location of the measures itself, whereas trade-offs are found at other locations. Reducing land use intensity in specific parts of the catchment may lead to increased pressure in other regions, resulting in trade-offs. Consequently, when aggregating the results to larger spatial scales the positive and negative impacts may be off-set, indicating the need for detailed spatial assessments. The modelled results indicate that for a careful planning and evaluation of adaptation measures it is needed to consider the trade-offs accounting for the negative effects of a measure at locations distant from the actual measure. Integrated land use modelling can help land use planning in such complex trade-off evaluation by providing evidence on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, different policy fields and societal demands.

AB  - The diagnostic efficacy of rectal palpation (RP) was compared to ecography (EG) in a natural mating program of Zebu cattle under Costa Rican tropical conditions. Grazing and lactating Bos indicus females, 98 each year (2005 and 2006) were divided in two groups, early (EP) and late (LP) postpartum. Two couples of bulls with proven reproductive ability were used in a rotation program. Each couple was with the cows for 21 day periods. At 23, 30, 37, 44, 51 and 60 days since the entry of the bulls, a transrectal EG was practiced to all cows; progesterone level was assessed by radioimmunoassay. At 35(th) day since the entry of the bulls, a RP by an expert veterinary practitioner was performed and repeated each week until 45 d after the last couple of bulls left. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and predictive values (+PV and -PV) of the PR were determined using the EG as gold standard test; besides, these indicators were calculated to EG for each day of the pregnancy from the 20(th). The LP became pregnant earlier than EP. The average percentage of pregnancies for both years was 86.0%; in addition, the embryo mortality rate was 6.0%, there were not significant differences by year or postpartum group. RP at 30 days of pregnancy indicated a Se 94.0%, Sp 72.0%, +PV 93.2% and -PV 74.6%. The earlier day of higher diagnostic exactitude by EG was the 27(th) day (Se 93.2%, Sp 95.1%, +PV 95.1%). This study shows that the EG is a highly exact test to the early diagnosis of pregnancy (< 27 d) in Zebu cattle under natural matting programs, over of the RP. Cost-effectiveness studies should have to be done to assess its usefulness in a routine way in farms of zebu cattle.

AB  - Effective monitoring programs are designed to track changes in the distribution, occurrence, and abundance of species. We developed an extension of Royle and Kery's (2007) single species model to estimate simultaneously temporal changes in probabilities of detection, occupancy, colonization, extinction, and species turnover using data on calling anuran amphibians, collected from 2002 to 2006 in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley of Louisiana, USA. During our 5-year study, estimates of occurrence probabilities declined for all 12 species detected. These declines occurred primarily in conjunction with variation in estimates of local extinction probabilities (cajun chorus frog [Pseudacris fouquettei], spring peeper [P. crucifer], northern cricket frog [Acris crepitans], Cope's gray treefrog [Hyla chrysoscelis], green treefrog [H. cinerea], squirrel treefrog [H. squirella], southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus], bronze frog [L. clamitans], American bullfrog [L. catesbeianus], and Fowler's toad [Anaxyrus fowleri]). For 2 species (eastern narrow-mouthed toad [Gastrophryne carolinensis] and Gulf Coast toad [Incilius nebulifer]), declines in occupancy appeared to be a consequence of both increased local extinction and decreased colonization events. The eastern narrow-mouthed toad experienced a 2.5-fold increase in estimates of occupancy in 2004, possibly because of the high amount of rainfall received during that year, along with a decrease in extinction and increase in colonization of new sites between 2003 and 2004. Our model can be incorporated into monitoring programs to estimate simultaneously the occupancy dynamics for multiple species that show similar responses to ecological conditions. It will likely be an important asset for those monitoring programs that employ the same methods to sample assemblages of ecologically similar species, including those that are rare. By combining information from multiple species to decrease the variance on estimates of individual species, our results are advantageous compared to single-species models. This feature enables managers and researchers to use an entire community, rather than just one species, as an ecological indicator in monitoring programs. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Forest health monitoring schemes were set Lip across Europe in the 1980s in response to concerns about air pollution-related forest dieback (Waldsterben) and have continued since then. Recent threats to forest health are climatic extremes likely due to global climate change and increased ground ozone levels and nitrogen deposition. We model yearly data on tree crown defoliation, an indicator of tree health, from a monitoring survey carried Out in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany since 1983. On a changing irregular grid, defoliation and other sue-specific variables are recorded, In Baden-Wurttemberg, the temporal trend of defoliation differs among areas because of site characteristics and pollution levels, making it necessary to allow for space-time interaction in the model. For this purpose, we propose using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) incorporating scale-invariant tensor product smooths of the space-time dimensions. The space-time smoother allows separate smoothing parameters and penalties for the space and time dimensions and thus avoids the need to make arbitrary or ad hoc choices about the relative scaling of space and time. The approach of using a space-time smoother has intuitive appeal, making it easy to explain and interpret when communicating the results to nonstaticians, such as environmental policy makers. The model incorporates a nonlinear effect for mean tree age. the most important predictor. allowing the separation of trends in time. which may be pollution-related, from trends that relate purely to the aging of the survey population. In addition to a temporal trend due to site characteristics and other conditions modeled with the space-time Smooth, We account for random temporal correlation at site level by an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. Model selection is carried Out using the Bayes information criterion (BIC). and the adequacy of the assumed spatial and temporal error Structure is investigated with the empirical semivariogram and the empirical autocorrelation function.

AB  - The effect of diet quality on reproduction and energy storage in bivalves has not been widely investigated. Food quality and quantity influences reproductive success in many bivalve species,and the timing and rate of reproductive Maturation is adominant influence on natural population dynamics, where as understanding and controlling reproduction is vital for the reliable production of juvenile mussels for aquaculture. In this study, adult mussels were fed for six weeks on 1 of 4 diets: (1) raw seawater: and raw seawater plus equivalent dry weights of (2) Chaetoceros calcitrans (3) Pavlova lutheri, and (4) a 1: 1 combination of the 2 species. Chaetoceros calcitrans has a higher proportion Of simple sugars and sterols compared with P. lutheri, whereas P. lutheri has greater proportions of DHA, Diet composition had a significant effect on the glycogen concentration and reproductive indicators at the end of six weeks. The combined C. calcitrans and P. lutheri supplement showed no change in glycogen stores after 6 wk, however a greater percentage of animals spawned, and a greater proportion of vitellogenic and atretic mussels were produced. Mussels Supplemented with C. calcitrans increased glycogen stores and produced greater proportions of mussels with vitellogenic oocytes. Those supplemented with P. lutheri produced a greater proportion Of Mussels with atretic oocytes, and a lower proportion of D-veliger larvae produced from the eggs. Mussels fed with raw seawater produced a greater proportion of resting mussels, and a lower percentage Of mussels spawned Lit the end of the conditioning period. Oocyte diameter and fecundity showed no significant difference among, diets. These results show that diet quality directly influences the allocation of energy to glycogen storage and gametogenesis, however, the mechanism by which this Occurs is unclear. Investigation into the allocation of individual biochemical components to each of these processes Would further illuminate the process by which diet quality influences the allocation of energy to glycogen storage versus gametogenesis.

AB  - Combinatorial enumeration of alkanes as three-dimensional structures has been investigated, where the degrees of internal branching have been taken into consideration by introducing branching indicators (BIs, i.e., q, t, s, and p). After generating functions for counting preformed alkyl moieties (PAMs) were calculated by following Fujita's proligand method (S. Fujita, Theor. Chem. Acc. 2005, 1137 73; 2005, 113, 80; 2006, 115, 37), they have been introduced into functional equations for counting alkanes so as to give the corresponding generating functions, where such alkanes Of carbon content k have been categorized into four cases in terms of centroidal/bicentroidal nature and achirality/chirality. Thereby, the generating functions of the respective cases have given the numbers of alkanes, where each number appears as the coefficient of the term called a branching monomial (BM) q(nq)t(nt)s(ns)p(np)x(k), when such an alkane contains n(q) quaternary, n(t) tertiary, n(s) secondary, and n(q) quaternary carbons (k = n(q) + n(t) + n(s) + n(p)). The results of the enumeration have been verified by drawing alkanes of several representative cases, where a mode of divergence, i.e., [n(q), n(t), n(s), and n(p)], has been used for the purpose of qualitative discussions. Previous approaches without considering BIs have been derived by disregarding the effect of internal branching. Moreover, the functional equations for counting 3D structures have been systematically reduced into those for counting graphs, where graph-reduction conditions have been formulated to rationalize the reduction processes. Thereby, Polya's theorem for Counting graphs has been shown to be a special case of Fujita's proligand method for counting 3D structures. As a result, difference between stereoisomers (3D Structures) and constitutional isomers (graphs) has been discussed by the common criterion due to BMs (or modes of divergence), which provides more detailed enumerations that) previous enumerations due to Carbon contents (or constitutions).

AB  - This paper describes a computer vision approach to automated rapid-throughput taxonomic identification of stonefly larvae. The long-term objective of this research is to develop a cost-effective method for environmental monitoring based on automated identification of indicator species. Recognition of stonefly larvae is challenging because they are highly articulated, they exhibit a high degree of intraspecies variation in size and color, and some species are difficult to distinguish visually, despite prominent dorsal patterning. The stoneflies are imaged via an apparatus that manipulates the specimens into the field of view of a microscope so that images are obtained under highly repeatable conditions. The images are then classified through a process that involves (a) identification of regions of interest, (b) representation of those regions as SIFT vectors (Lowe, in Int J Comput Vis 60(2):91-110, 2004) (c) classification of the SIFT vectors into learned "features" to form a histogram of detected features, and (d) classification of the feature histogram via state-of-the-art ensemble classification algorithms. The steps (a) to (c) compose the concatenated feature histogram (CFH) method. We apply three region detectors for part (a) above, including a newly developed principal curvature-based region (PCBR) detector. This detector finds stable regions of high curvature via a watershed segmentation algorithm. We compute a separate dictionary of learned features for each region detector, and then concatenate the histograms prior to the final classification step. We evaluate this classification methodology on a task of discriminating among four stonefly taxa, two of which, Calineuria and Doroneuria, are difficult even for experts to discriminate. The results show that the combination of all three detectors gives four-class accuracy of 82% and three-class accuracy (pooling Calineuria and Doro-neuria) of 95%. Each region detector makes a valuable contribution. In particular, our new PCBR detector is able to discriminate Calineuria and Doroneuria much better than the other detectors.

AB  - Amino acids are considered organic molecular indicators in the search for extant and extinct life in the Solar System. Extraction of these molecules from a particulate solid matrix, such as Martian regolith, will be critical to their in situ detection and analysis. The goals of this study were to optimize a laboratory amino acid extraction protocol by quantitatively measuring the yields of extracted amino acids as a function of liquid water temperature and sample extraction time and to compare the results to the standard HCl vapor- phase hydrolysis yields for the same soil samples. Soil samples from the Yungay region of the Atacama Desert ( Martian regolith analog) were collected during a field study in the summer of 2005. The amino acids ( alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, serine, and valine) chosen for analysis were present in the samples at concentrations of 1 - 70 parts- per- billion. Subcritical water extraction efficiency was examined over the temperature range of 30 - 325 degrees C, at pressures of 17.2 or 20.0 MPa, and for water- sample contact equilibration times of 0 - 30 min. None of the amino acids were extracted in detectable amounts at 30 degrees C ( at 17.2 MPa), suggesting that amino acids are too strongly bound by the soil matrix to be extracted at such a low temperature. Between 150 degrees C and 250 degrees C ( at 17.2 MPa), the extraction efficiencies of glycine, alanine, and valine were observed to increase with increasing water temperature, consistent with higher solubility at higher temperatures, perhaps due to the decreasing dielectric constant of water. Amino acids were not detected in extracts collected at 325 degrees C ( at 20.0 MPa), probably due to amino acid decomposition at this temperature. The optimal subcritical water extraction conditions for these amino acids from Atacama Desert soils were achieved at 200 degrees C, 17.2 MPa, and a water- sample contact equilibration time of 10 min.

AB  - Temporal oceanographic changes based on mid- and late Holocene marine diatom floras from the Faeroe Islands region have been studied. The four studied coring sites are located in the Skalafjord and a more open-ocean environment, the mouth of the Kaldbaksfjord, at water depths ranging between 50 and 70 m. Comparison of the diatom records in the fjord sediments with those from the outer part of the fjord shows that the fjord provides a more optimum potential for paleoceanographic reconstructions. The concentrations of marine taxa and relative abundance of freshwater diatom species in the marine environment were analyzed with the aim of relating them to environmental conditions. Estimated diatom concentrations were very low and ranged from a maximum of 14.4 x 10(6) valves per gram dry sediment in the inner part of the fjord to a minimum of 0.1 x 10(6) outside the fjord. The freshwater diatom flora that occurred between 1200 and 700 cal. yr. BP in the inner part of the fjord suggests much higher precipitation during this time and increased freshwater discharge into the fjord. Presence of Actinocyclus normanii, which is an indicator of increasing trophy, is related to the first human settlement on the Faeroe Islands. Maximum-likelihood factor analysis (MLFA) was used to describe the most essential relationship among the diatom species, and to employ these relationships for inferring Holocene environmental changes in the Faeroe Islands. The first two MLFA factors are related to oceanic influences in the region. Factor 1 is represented by a warmer water diatom assemblage and is suggested to correspond to inflow of the Norwegian-Atlantic Current to the Skalafjord, whereas Factor 2 is an indicator of a colder-water diatom assemblage that corresponds to inflow of Arctic-Nonvegian Water Mixing (ANWM) during the 4900-3200 cal. yr. BP time interval. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This is the first report on fecal pollution using molecular markers in Southeast Asia where serious sewage pollution has occurred. A simple and sensitive analytical method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 10 sterols in various, environmental samples was developed to monitor extensive areas of tropical Asia. First,the method was applied to wastewater to confirm that >95% of sterols existed in the particulate phase. Then the approach was applied to a tropical Asian region, Malaysia and Vietnam, with a selection of 59 sampling stations in total. River water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed for chemical markers (coprostanol and. other sterols) and microbiological markers (fecal coliforms and fecal, streptococci). Particulate coprostanol concentrations ranged from <0.0001 to 13.47 mug/L in tropical river and estuarine waters, indicating severe fecal pollution in populous areas. Coprostanol concentrations in the. sediments ranged from 0.005 to 15.5 mug/g-dry. The sedimentary coprostanol concentrations were lower than those reported in some urban areas of industrialized countries. This is probably because frequent heavy rain induces intensive input of eroded. soil, which dilutes fecal material in river sediments. The relationship between the concentrations of fecal sterols and bacterial indicators was examined in an attempt to develop public health criteria for coprostanol levels applicable to the tropical region. Coprostanol concentrations of 30-100 ng/L or percent coprostanol levels of 2% corresponded to similar to1000 fecal coliforms per 100 mL, which is set for secondary contact limit in many countries. These coprostanol concentrations were lower than those proposed as criteria in temperate countries, probably owing to greater survival of bacteria in warmer tropical waters. On the basis of these criteria, extensive monitoring of sediments suggests that poor sanitary conditions exist in most of the urbanized area of Malaysia and in several urban and rural sites in Vietnam.

AB  - Massive nauplii production in Litopenaeus setiferus by means of natural matings has not been reported. The main reason is the low spermatophore attachment rate that has been associated with male sterilization because of male reproductive tract degenerative and the male reproductive melanization syndromes (MRTDS and MRMS). This information indicated both syndromes could be related to the captivity and management stress that affects the immune system and the physiological state of shrimp. We used some blood metabolic variables, sperm quality, and immune response as indicators of captivity stress in adult males of L. setiferus. A comparison between freshly captured shrimp with shrimp maintained in the laboratory for 7 days at two temperatures were examined. Glucose and calcium were not different between fresh and acclimated shrimp at either temperature (P > 0.05). A reduction in triacylglycerol, proteins, and cholesterol was observed in acclimated shrimp in comparison with base line shrimp (P < 0.05). Lactate was reduced only in shrimp acclimated at the lower temperature. Sperm quality was not significantly different between base line samples and acclimated shrimp. The immune system was altered in acclimated shrimp at both temperatures. A reduction in total haemocytes, granular cells, and semigranullar cells was measured in acclimated shrimp in comparison with base-line shrimp. In contrast, a higher phenoloxidase activity (proPO) was observed in acclimated shrimp, indicating that regulatory mechanisms of immune system of those shrimp were altered by captivity conditions. The blood metabolic variables indicated that captive shrimp were affected nutritionally more than physiologically. The immune response showed the nutritional effect or another management factor reduced the cellular defenses and altered the molecular mechanisms associated with melanin production. This could be related to the melanization syndrome observed in previous studies. A new sequence to explain the appearance of the male reproductive shrimp syndromes of L. setiferus was proposed.

AB  - The cation transport selectivities of the Ca2+ ionophores A23187, Ionomycin, and 4-BrA23187 have been determined using a model system comprised of phospholipid vesicles loaded with the chelator/indicator Quin-2. At pH 7.00 and a 100 mu M concentration of the cations, A23187 displays the transport selectivity sequence Zn2+ > Mn2+ > Ca2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ > Sr2+, With the absolute rates of transport spanning similar to 3 orders of magnitude. Similar data are obtained with Ionomycin, although the relative transport rates of Zn2+ and Mn2+ are equivalent, and the range of absolute rates is decreased by a factor of similar to 3. When values are normalized to those of Ca2+, transport selectivity is seen to be only weakly related to complexation or extraction selectivity. It is also seen that, when used to manipulate Ca2+ (or Mg2+), both ionophores can be expected to alter the distribution of additional divalent cations which have known biological activities. 4-BrA23187 is a low-activity ionophore for Ca2+, compared to A23187 and Ionomycin, while retaining comparable activities as an ionophore for the other cations. As a consequence, 4-BrA23187 is highly selective for the transport of Zn2+ and Mn2+, compared to Ca2+, with selectivity ratios approaching that of valinomycin for K+ over Naf when conditions are optimal. Plots of the log of the rate of cation transport vs the log of the ionophore concentration indicate that Ca2+ is transported primarily as a 2:1 complex by A23187 and 4-BrA23187, but Zn2+ and Mn2+ are transported, in part, as 1:1 complexes. These findings, together with a postulated low stability of 2:1, compared to 1:1 complexes between 4-BrA23187 and divalent cations, partially explain the novel transport selectivity of this compound. Unlike A23187 or Ionomycin, 4-BrA23187 may be useful for investigating cell regulation by Zn2+ and Mn2+, without interference by regulatory mechanisms which respond to Ca2+.

AB  - Validation is a crucial technique used to strengthen the application capabilities of earthobservation satellite data and solve the quality problems of remote-sensing products. Observing land-surface parameters in the field is one of the key steps of validation. Therefore, the demand for long-term stable validation stations has gradually increased. However, the current location-selection procedure of validation stations lacks a systematic and objective evaluation system. In this research, a data-driven selection of a land product validation station (DSS-LPV) based on Machine Learning is proposed. Firstly, we construct an evaluation indicator system in which all factors affecting the location of validation stations are divided into surface characteristics, atmospheric conditions and the social environment. Then, multi-scale evaluation grids are constructed and indicators are allocated for spatial evaluation. Finally, four Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to learn the established reliable stations, and different data-driven scoring models are constructed to explore the intrinsic relationship between evaluation indicators and station locations. In this article, the reliability of DSS-LPV is effectively validated by the example of China using the national-level land product validation station that has been established. After a comparison between the four ML models, the random forest (RF) with the highest accuracy was selected as the modeling method of DSS-LPV. The correlation between the regression value of test stations and the target value is 0.9133. The average score of test stations is 0.8304. The test stations are generally located within the calculated hot-spot area of the score density map, which means that it is highly consistent with the location of the built stations. Research results indicate that DSS-LPV is an effective method that can provide a reasonable geographical distribution of the stations. The location-selection results can provide scientific decision-making support for the construction of land product validation stations.

AB  - Carbon fluxes (CO2 and CH4) are important indicators of the response of alpine meadow ecosystems to global climate change. Alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are sensitive to climate change. Although the temporal allocation of precipitation can vary, its intensity is expected to increase, and its frequency is expected to decrease in the future. In this study, a manipulative field experiment was conducted to investigate how carbon fluxes are altered in response to moderate and severe changes in the precipitation regime. Fluctuations in CH4 flux were large under a severely altered precipitation regime (range of -0.048-0.038 mg m-2 h-1). Severe changes in the precipitation regime significantly reduced soil CH4 uptake by approximately 54.3%. This was probably affected by the decrease in the dissolved organic carbon concentration and changes in the microbial community (mainly Gammaproteobacteria), which were induced by variation in soil water conditions under various precipitation regimes. Under moderate changes in the precipitation regime, the average value of CO2 fluxes (ecosystem respiration) was 698.21 +/- 35.19 mg m-2 h-1, which was significantly decreased by 20.7% compared with the control. This likely stems from the suppression of enzyme activity (particularly alpha-1,4-glucosidase and beta-1,4-glucosidase) and the alteration of microbial community structure in this treatment, which led to a decrease in organic matter breakdown and a reduction in the release of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, CO2 fluxes were slightly (i.e., not significantly) decreased under the severely altered precipitation regime. Such different responses of CO2 flux are probably driven by differences in microbial strategies. This study not only increases our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adaptation of alpine meadow ecosystems to global climate change but also provides new insight into the carbon source/sink functions of alpine meadows.

AB  - Animal proteins are widely used because of their good techno-functional (e.g. emulsification) properties. However, the large ecological impact of animal-derived proteins is often debated and therefore alternatives are evaluated in which animal proteins with increased functionality are employed. Amyloid fibrils are a distinct type of protein fibrils characterized by an intermolecular cross beta-sheet structure, mostly studied because of concerns regarding their role in certain human diseases. However, they have also been detected in processed food proteins such as heated ovalbumin (OVA) and other egg proteins. Previous work also mentioned superior emulsification properties of amyloid-like fibrils. Here, the effect of different shear conditions during the emulsification of oil in water emulsions stabilized by heated OVA was investigated. Emulsification with intensive shear treatment (using both an ultra-turrax and a microfluidizer) resulted in submicron sized droplets, whilst ultra-turrax only gave rise to rapidly creaming emulsions (>10 mu m). Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, used as an indicator of cross beta-sheets, did significantly increase for submicron emulsions, whereas supermicron emulsions showed a similar fluorescence as the aqueous phase used for emulsification. The increase in ThT fluorescence in submicron emulsions was in line with a higher amount of larger fibrillar structures, which showed high ThT fluorescence, measured using size exclusion-HPLC and transmission electron microscopy images. Similar observations were also made for unheated OVA, suggesting that high-shear emulsification induced amyloid-like fibril formation. In contrast, shearing of aqueous solutions without the creation of interfaces did not show increased fibril formation. Therefore, it is claimed that the large specific surface area induced amyloid-like fibril formation or maturation as a result of a better interaction between hydrophobic amyloid-like fibril fragments. In this work, we were able to characterize the protein fibrillar structures present in emulsions by considering commonly used techniques for the study of fibril formation. This creates opportunities towards the implementation of these protein mixtures in food applications.

AB  - Background Left displaced abomasum (LDA) occurs at high frequency in the early postpartum period and can affect production performance of dairy cows. Clinical diagnosis of LDA is usually done by abdominal auscultation and percussion. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential applicability of blood biomarkers for early warning and diagnosis of LDA in dairy cows. Results Twenty early postpartum healthy cows and thirty early postpartum LDA cows of similar parity were used. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) method was used to analyze the sensitivity of hematological biomarkers to LDA including energy balance metabolic biomarkers, liver/kidney function biomarkers, and minerals. A cut-off point was defined for each of the selected hematological biomarkers deemed sensitive markers of LDA. Compared with healthy cows, body condition score (BCS), dry matter intake (DMI) and milk production were lower in LDA cows. Among energy metabolism markers, serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA), insulin (INS), and revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (RQUICKI) levels were lower while serum glucagon (GC) was greater in LDA cows. Among the liver/kidney function biomarkers, activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the ratio of AST/ALT and levels of total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), albumin (ALB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and total protein (TP) were greater in LDA cows. Among minerals analyzed, serum Cl, Ca, and K were lower in LDA cows. After ROC analysis, it was determined that serum Ca, INS, RQUICKI, ALT, GGT, and creatinine are potential indicators for early warning and diagnosis of LDA for early postpartum dairy cows. Conclusions Dairy cows with LDA were under severe negative energy balance (NEB), had signs of liver damage and potentially lower insulin sensitivity. A combination of multi-hematological biomarkers including Ca, INS, RQUICKI, ALT, GGT and creatinine has the potential to help identify cows at risk of LDA in the early postpartum period.

AB  - Aims We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of seasonal suicide patterns among multiple geographically, demographically and socioeconomically diverse populations. Methods Weekly time-series data of suicide counts for 354 communities in 12 countries during 1986-2016 were analysed. Two-stage analysis was performed. In the first stage, a generalised linear model, including cyclic splines, was used to estimate seasonal patterns of suicide for each community. In the second stage, the community-specific seasonal patterns were combined for each country using meta-regression. In addition, the community-specific seasonal patterns were regressed onto community-level socioeconomic, demographic and environmental indicators using meta-regression. Results We observed seasonal patterns in suicide, with the counts peaking in spring and declining to a trough in winter in most of the countries. However, the shape of seasonal patterns varied among countries from bimodal to unimodal seasonality. The amplitude of seasonal patterns (i.e. the peak/trough relative risk) also varied from 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-1.62) to 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.1) among 12 countries. The subgroup difference in the seasonal pattern also varied over countries. In some countries, larger amplitude was shown for females and for the elderly population (>= 65 years of age) than for males and for younger people, respectively. The subperiod difference also varied; some countries showed increasing seasonality while others showed a decrease or little change. Finally, the amplitude was larger for communities with colder climates, higher proportions of elderly people and lower unemployment rates (p-values < 0.05). Conclusions Despite the common features of a spring peak and a winter trough, seasonal suicide patterns were largely heterogeneous in shape, amplitude, subgroup differences and temporal changes among different populations, as influenced by climate, demographic and socioeconomic conditions. Our findings may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of seasonal suicide patterns and aid in improving the design of population-specific suicide prevention programmes based on these patterns.

AB  - Today, food security has a critical place in the government agendas of developing countries. In Latin American case, urban contexts have been subject to radical transformations in the last decades, most apparently through the expansion of social housing, which may limit or condition access to food for the neediest population. Nowadays, in Latin America, there are numerous cases of urban agriculture. Quito (Ecuador) stands out for the development of urban agriculture through the Participatory Urban Agriculture Project - AGRUPAR; initiative that has led to the implementation of orchards with organic production, raising of small animals, food processing and marketing of surpluses for food-nutrition security. Above all, it has transcended its urban and peri-urban intervention to rural areas, favoring the urban-rural connection. Also, worldwide the urban agriculture is developed in different forms, one of which is through crops protected by a greenhouse on the roofs: Rooftop greenhouse (RTG). This form of UA uses specific substrates for hydroponic crops and has modern irrigation systems often combined with rainwater harvesting and provides a unique opportunity to improve urban agriculture in Quito.
   The purpose of this study is to identify the implementation potential of rooftop greenhouses in social neighborhoods in Quito. Standard methods to assess the potential use of rooftop greenhouses were adapted to a social neighborhood. The guidelines follow three steps: Step 1: Characterization based on criteria; Step 2: Available surface determination and Step 3: Production, self-sufficiency and self-supply. "La Comuna Santa Clara de San Milian" was selected as study area. The results showed that 33.2% (7.70 ha) of the neighborhood rooftops had a short-term feasibility to install rooftop greenhouses, with the potential to produce 1,579,140 and 56,720 kg/year of tomato and lettuce respectively. The research has developed reliable guidelines that prove the feasibility to install rooftop greenhouses in similar large Latin-American cities area.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare is gaining attention regarding the conservation of species not only due to ethical and legal reasons but also because optimal welfare can ensure stable and healthy populations. Currently, there is a lack of protocols that help to objectively assess welfare of wild animals in captivity. In this study, we have developed and applied a protocol for the assessment of welfare in captive dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas). We have gathered information from existing literature about the biology of this species in wild conditions, as well as in zoo husbandry, breeding, management and care guidelines developed for this species. We took a protocol developed for the on-farm welfare assessment in cattle as a reference and suggested 23 indicators that we considered useful to assess welfare in captive dorcas gazelles. To test the utility of this protocol, we then applied it in five groups of dorcas gazelles from three different zoos and we detected areas for improvement in all of the groups assessed.
   There is a lack of protocols specifically developed for the assessment of welfare of wild animals in captivity, even when it is known that providing good standards of welfare is important. The aim of this study was the development and the application of a protocol for the assessment of welfare in captive dorcas gazelles. The protocol was mainly developed taking into account the protocol for the assessment of welfare in cattle from the Welfare Quality((R)) project, the available literature of the biology of this species and the Husbandry Guidelines developed for captive breeding and management of this species. The protocol was specifically developed for dorcas gazelles and included four principles, 10 criteria and 23 animal and environmental-based indicators. To test its utility, this protocol was applied to five different groups of gazelles from three different zoos. Its application made possible to detect areas for improvement in all groups assessed.

AB  - Drought is a main water-related natural hazard due to its features, sensitivities and effects to all sectors. According to climate change scenarios, drought hazards are expected to be more devastating, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Drought characterization is essential to be aware of expected negative effects of droughts as well as to devise water management plans including possible mitigation measures. To this end, many drought indices have been developed for drought analysis, one of which is the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) that is widely used worldwide. In this study, a new drought index is proposed, namely the Drought Power Index (DPI), based on the SPI with orientation by reliability-resilience-vulnerability (RRV) concept. The use of the RRV approach with the SPI time series empowers the drought characterization by considering the frequency of drought event, drought recovery period as well as the severity of droughts-once a drought has occurred. Since the drought is identified as an unfavorable phenomenon, the DPI ranges from 0 to 1 where the higher values indicate higher drought devastating features (probability, duration and extremity of drought) and vice versa. The proposed approach is illustrated with reference to the Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey. The long-term (1970-2017) monthly precipitation data of eight meteorological stations under the operation of General Directorate of Meteorological Services of Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs are used in the study. The 12-month SPI time series, which were later used for calculations of DPI, were obtained by the use of SPI_SL_6 software. The study revealed that there has been an increasing trend in DPI values in the basin, especially after 1993. It is concluded that the DPI is a valuable indicator for (i) spatially and temporally evaluating the drought characteristics, (ii) analysing meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought severity with its coherent capability with SPI, (iii) ranking the regions in accordance with the drought vulnerability conditions.

AB  - This study investigated the impacts of successive simulated droughts and floods on two plant species (Carex lurida and Liriope muscari) commonly installed in green-infrastructure (GI) sites built in the urban northeast USA. The instantaneous stomatal conductance, and belowground biomass growth (in a second drought experiment only) were used as metrics, since they are indicators of the ability of plants to provide ecosystem functions such as transpiration and carbon uptake. The results indicate that both species have greater tolerance for floods than for droughts. Signs of stress were only evident after a simulated flood exceeding the duration of 95% of all storms that occurred in this geographic region between 1950 and 2000. By contrast, simulated droughts had a more pronounced effect on both the instantaneous conductance measures during drought and the recovery following the cessation of drought in both species. Liriope subjected to drought treatments were all able to recover and to re-establish stomatal conductance levels similar to those displayed by a control group even after repeated drought treatments. By contrast, Carex showed reduced recovery after multiple droughts, in two separate rounds of experiments. However, regardless of moisture conditions and treatment, Carex generally displayed higher stomatal conductance than Liriope, indicating greater transpiration, and CO2 uptake than Liriope. The belowground biomass results supported this finding, i.e. Carex gained more belowground biomass than Liriope during all experiments. At the end of the experiment, the Carex subjected to drought had less than one sixth the belowground biomass of the control treatment, whereas for Liriope this ratio was only 50% (drought to control). The drought treatments, therefore, reduced the biomass of Carex more than it did Liriope, when compared to the respective control plants. Nonetheless, both species survived repeated cycles of droughts and floods, suggesting that these particular species are both likely suitable for use in GI facilities, despite projected future increases in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts in this geographic region. From a practical perspective, the results suggest no need for irrigation or potential replacement of plants in GI systems in a changed climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Elevated pressure, elevated oxygen tension (DOT) and elevated carbon dioxide tension (DCT) are readily encountered at the bottom of large industrial bioreactors and during bioprocesses where pressure is applied for enhancing the oxygen transfer. Yet information about their effect on bacteria and on the gene expression thereof is scarce. To shed light on the cellular functions affected by these specific environmental conditions, the transcriptome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a bacterium of great relevance for the production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates, was thoroughly investigated using DNA microarrays.
   Results: Very well defined chemostat cultivations were carried out with P. putida to produce high quality RNA samples and ensure that differential gene expression was caused exclusively by changes of pressure, DOT and/or DCT. Cellular stress was detected at 7 bar and elevated DCT in the form of heat shock and oxidative stress-like responses, and indicators of cell envelope perturbations were identified as well.
   Globally, gene transcription was not considerably altered when DOT was increased from 40 +/- 5 to 235 +/- 20% at 7 bar and elevated DCT. Nevertheless, differential transcription was observed for a few genes linked to iron-sulfur cluster assembly, terminal oxidases, glutamate metabolism and arginine deiminase pathway, which shows their particular sensitivity to variations of DOT.
   Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive overview on the changes occurring in the transcriptome of P. putida upon mild variations of pressure, DOT and DCT. Interestingly, whereas the changes of gene transcription were widespread, the cell physiology was hardly affected, which illustrates how efficient reorganization of the gene transcription is for dealing with environmental changes that may otherwise be harmful. Several particularly sensitive cellular functions were identified, which will certainly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in stress sensing/response and to finding ways of enhancing the stress tolerance of microorganisms.

AB  - Pathogen contamination of waterbodies, which is often identified by the presence of pathogen indicators such as Escherichia coli, is a major water quality concern in the United States. Reducing in-stream pathogen contamination requires an understanding of the combined impacts of land cover, climatic conditions, and anthropogenic activities at the watershed scale. In this study these factors are considered by assessing linear relationships between in-stream E. coli water quality data, watershed indexes, and rainfall for the Squaw Creek Watershed, IA, USA. The watershed indexes consider the undisturbed land cover which encompasses the natural land cover area, wetlands, and vegetated stream corridors, and the disturbed land cover extent which includes areas receiving manure from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), tile-drained areas, and areas in cropped and urban land. In addition to disturbed and undisturbed land, we also calculated indexes for barren land and slope. Bivariate analysis was used to assess the linkage between E. coli concentrations, watershed indexes and the cumulative rainfall 15, 30, 45, and 60 days prior to water sample collection. To predict in-stream E. coli concentrations, we developed multivariate regression models, and predictions were compared with observed E. coli concentrations at 46 sampling locations over four sampling periods in two years. Results show that areas receiving manure, wetlands, drained land, and cropped land all influence in-stream E. coli concentrations significantly (p < 0.001). The coefficient of determination was higher when indexes were corrected using the cumulative rainfall 30 days prior to the sampling event. Model skill varied from 0.29 to 0.55. More than 95% of the predictions across all spatial locations fall within one order of magnitude of the observed values. This Geographic Information System (GIS) based approach for predicting in-stream E. coli concentrations appears to be a useful technique for assessing the impacts of land management on water quality.

AB  - Objective: The teat canal of lactating dairy cattle is the first barrier, against mastitis pathogens invading the teat cistern and the udder lumen. However, in several studies it could be shown that the teat skin, and the teat canal epithelium are colonized by mainly staphylococci as well as by other pathogenic or facultative pathogenic micro-organisms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pathogen pressure on the bovine mammary gland and to establish data on the prevalence of relevant micro-organisms. Material and methods: In 32 randomly selected German dairy farms the colonization of the teat skin and the teat canal by S. aureus (Baird Parker agar), Sc. uberis (modified Rambach agar according to Watts et al. [1993]), enterococci (kanamycin esculin azide agar) and coliforms (ChromoCult Coliform agar) was investigated by the wet/dry swab technique DIN 10113-1: 1997-07. Results: In total 84.5% of all 1358 investigated teat canals of clinically healthy cattle were colonized by at least one of the four pathogen groups. S. aureus was isolated from 72.2% of the teat canals. For S. aureus, Sc uberis and E. coli maximum bacterial counts of > 10(6) cfu/swab and for other coliform bacteria > 10(7) cfu/swab were detected. Correlations could be found between the bacterial counts on the teat skin and in the teat canal within the pathogen groups S. aureus, Sc. uberis, E. coli and other coliforms (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r >= 0.30, p < 0.001) as well as between the environmental udder pathogens Sc. uberis and coliforms (r >= 0.25, p < 0.01). Conclusion and clinical relevance: The variation of the bacterial counts on teat epithelia could be an indicator that the microflora of the teat canal epithelium can be affected by management practices in dairy farms. The results of this study point out that under field conditions the efficiency of hygienic practices (husbandry, milking) can be assessed by sampling of the bovine teat canal by the wet/dry swab technique.

AB  - The biochemical aspects of the tepetates (hardened volcanic layers) and soils coming from volcanic materials have been little studied. The flow of CO2 (FC) and the biochemical properties of volcanic soils representative of Mexico were evaluated in this work. Five soils were chosen in a transect of the Tlaloc volcano with different uses: cuminal grassland (PC), pine-oak (PE), reforested pine (PR), bare tepetate (TD), and halophytic formations of the former Lake of Texcoco (LT), located at 2950, 3010, 2700, 2650, and 2220 m altitude. The soils of the transect correspond to the sequence: Phaeozems (PC), Luvisols (PE and PR), tepetates (TD) and Solonchacks (LT). In each zone soil samples were taken (0-15 cm deep) and FC and soil moisture (HS) were periodically measured in situ from August 2005 to July 2006. The variables determined were: soil organic C (SOC), total N (Nt), microbial biomass C and N, basal respiration (RS), ammonification of arginine, and enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, phosphatase, urease and protease). The most degraded areas (TD and LT) recorded lower values in all variables, whereas the best preserved (PE and PC) showed higher values (especially in SOC, Nt, microbial biomass and enzyme activities). The RS and FC were low in TD (8.1 ug C-CO2 g(-1) d(-1) and 0.05-0.07 g m(-2) ha(-1)), since this is a hardened substrate without a plant cover and low content of SOC and Nt (0.8 mg C g(-1) and 0.13 mg N g(-1)). The higher content of SOC in PE and PC (55.2 and 32.7 mg C g(-1)) and HS during the rainfall period promote soil microbial activity and thus FC (1.22 and 1.05 g m(-2) ha(-1) in August). The biochemical variables selected, of easy measurement and interpretation, are suitable indicators to assess the quality of Mexican volcanic soils under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Soil management systems may negatively affect the quality of the soil. Policymakers and farmers need scientific information to make appropriate land management decisions. Conventional (CT)and zero tillage (ZT) are two common soil management systems. Comparative field studies under controlled conditions are required to determine the impact of these systems on soil quality and yields. The research presented studied plant and soil physical and chemical characteristics as affected by different agricultural management practices. i.e. ZT and CT, cropped with continuous wheat or maize in monoculture (M) or in a yearly rotation (R) of these two crops, either with residue retention (+r) or without residues retention (-r), in an experimental field in the Transvolcanic Belt of Mexico after 14 years. The dominant factors defining soil quality were organic C, total N, moisture, aggregate stability, mechanical resistance, pH and EC. The principal component combining the variables organic C, total N, aggregate stability and moisture content showed the highest correlations with final yield (R = 0.85 for wheat and 0.87 for maize). After 14 years of continuous practice. ZTM+r and ZTR+r had the best soil quality and produced the highest wheat and maize yields of average 2001-2004 (6683 and 7672 kg ha(-1) and 5085 and 5667 kg ha(-1), respectively). Removing the residues. i.e. treatments ZTM-r with maize (average 2001-2004: 1388 kg ha(-1)) and ZTR-r and C7R-r with wheat (average 2001-2004: 3949 and 5121 kg ha(-1)), gave the lowest yields and less favourable soil physical and chemical characteristics compared to the other practices. It Was found that zero tillage with residue retention is a feasible management technology for farmers producing maize and wheat in the agro-ecological zone studied, resulting in a better soil quality and higher yields than with the conventional farmer practice (maize monoculture, conventional tillage and residue removal).

AB  - The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) has had significant impact on wheat production in rainfed regions of the developing world. During the last decade, yield potential has increased in drought-prone areas partly due to the use of synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW), produced through interspecific hybridisation of Triticum turgidum spp. and Aegilops tauschii, followed by chromosome doubling. The objectives of this study were to document the use of SHW in wheat breeding at CIMMYT and quantify its potential effect on global wheat adaptation. The first SHW-derived lines targetted at rainfed conditions appeared in the 5th Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trial (SAWYT) representing8% of the lines, increasing to 46% by the 15th SAWYT. During the same period the average coefficient of parentage of SHW in all synthetically derived crosses decreased from 75 to 19%. Average yield rank of genotypes across locations and years was used as a performance indicator of the SHW-derived lines in SAWYT 5-12. In the 5th SAWYT the average rank of the SHW-derived lines was 30 ( out of 50) increasing to 25 by the 12th SAWYT. SAWYT11 was the first trial to include SHW-derived lines bred exclusively for rainfed environments, using directed selection for drought tolerance. International trial data from SAWYT 11 and 12 showed that the SHW-derived line Vorobey was a top-performing line. Vorobey performed well across all environments compared with the best locally adapted check cultivar at each location; trial means ranged from 1 to 8 t/ha. To further exploit genetic diversity for adaptation to drought, SHW has been produced using emmer wheat ( T. turgidum L. subsp. dicoccon) as the tetraploid parent. Yield trial data from Mexico show that SHW derivatives based on emmer wheat improved yield performance under drought compared with their drought-tolerant recurrent parents. The use of SHW in wheat breeding for rainfed environments at CIMMYT has increased significantly over the past 10-15 years and the performance and effect of the derived lines have improved with time.

AB  - Design- and model-based approaches provide 2 distinct frameworks in which to analyse environmental impacts. While both approaches have been criticized to some extent, the possibility of modeling environmental variability with covariates in the analysis of structured sampling designs seems to have eluded the attention of environmental ecologists. We applied a beyond-BACI (before, after, control, impact) sampling design to a post-impact study on the effects of marinas on assemblages of algae and invertebrates on rocky seashores at 2 locations in the NW Mediterranean. The 2 locations were on the opposite (northern and southern) sides of a promontory, about 30 km apart. A shore next to the marina and 3 reference shores were sampled at each location to obtain independent estimates of differences between disturbed and undisturbed conditions. An additional set of 3 shores were sampled at a location on the western coast to test whether structured spatial patterns around the promontory might confound the analysis of impact. Midshore and lowshore habitats were sampled on all shores. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed differences between disturbed and reference assemblages mostly at one location in the midshore habitat. Analyses conducted on the lowshore data indicated that assemblages of marinas followed different temporal trajectories than reference shores consistently at the 2 locations. Spatial variability around the promontory was large, as indicated by significant linear and quadratic contrasts among all locations. When impacts were examined using either the geographic position of shores or their rank position around the promontory as a covariate, results did not differ from those of the original analyses. The present study highlights possible ways to overcome the dichotomy between design- and model-based approaches, namely that studies of impact can and should be examined at replicated locations whenever possible and that covariables can be included in the analysis of structured sampling designs to increase precision and accuracy in assessment of environmental impacts.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the influence of different phases of the hydrological cycle on the abundance of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria in the Kopacki Rit floodplain and to assess temporal and spatial variations in the proportion of eutrophic and oligotrophic bacteria (r- and K-strategists) as a biological indicator of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) availability. Determination of bacterial abundance was performed with abiotic variables (water temperature, depth, Secchi disc transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, ammonia, nitrates+nitrites, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and one biotic (chl-a) variable, and dimensionality reduced with principal component analysis (PCA). The component scores were used as independent variables in a multiple regression and the relationship between scores (indirect variables) and bacterial abundance was examined. An elevated bacterial abundance was observed during the limnophase (floodplain isolated from the river) and potamophase (flood). During the limnophase also the highest chl-a concentrations were found and in Sakadas Lake during September 2003 significantly higher numbers of eutrophic than oligotrophic bacteria emerged (p = 0.026). During potamophase the opposite state was established. Elevated bacterial abundance occurred in parallel with minimal chl-a concentrations and during July 2004 in the Conakut Channel a significantly higher number of oligotrophic than eutrophic bacteria emerged (p < 0.001). Differentiation in the number of eutrophic and oligotrophic bacteria suggests the existence of a higher concentration of labile DOC during September 2003 than during July 2004. Multiple regression analysis explains 13.6% of the variation in abundance of eutrophic bacteria. The regression model for oligotrophic bacteria is not significant. The results suggest two different mechanisms control bacterioplankton numbers to some extent in the Kopacki Rit floodplain. In addition, two sources of DOC differentiating the quality of organic matter predominate under totally different hydrological regimes. Under these conditions, eutrophic bacteria may be partially bottom-up controlled, whereas it is not clear how the abundance of oligotrophs is controlled.

AB  - Soil microbial properties. such as microbial biomass and microbial activity, are suitable indicators to predict soil biological status as a part of soil fertility after transition from high-input agricultural systems to low-input systems. These criteria were applied to evaluate how agricultural de-intensification as practiced by the integrated farming system (IFS) of Germany differ from the conventional agricultural system (CFS) over long-term investigation. The study was multi-factorial, covering agricultural management, spatial as well as temporal variability. Therefore, the research included nine different locations with a wide range of soil types, soil textures of the top horizons, parent materials, climatic conditions, along with the individual impact of farmers over a ten year period. In sum, the mean pH values, the mean amounts of microbial biomass (estimated from maximal initial responses) and soil organic matter, mean C-mic-to-C-org ratio, and mean dehydrogenase activity of the nine locations were almost identical in both systems. The amounts of soil organic matter, microbial biomass and C-mic-to-C-org ratio increased 10-15% in the integrated management treatment compared with the conventional management system starting from the fifth year of investigation. Conversely, during the first 4 years of the investigation the examined parameters were slightly increased in the conventional management system. The differences in dehydrogenase activity between both systems changed from year to year. No differences between both systems were found for the pH values of the investigated soils. Beyond that, the factor soil texture of the top horizon (expressed as the clay content) was highly significant for the amounts of the investigated parameters, During the 10 year investigation period, differences between both management systems in particular years were related to the cultivation of intermediate crops and conservation tillage practices.

AB  - Cladoceran microfossil remains were analysed from a sediment core taken from a lake basin at Krakenes, western Norway. The sequence included immediate post-glacial conditions (ca. 12,300 C-14 BP), the Allerod, Younger Dryas, and early Holocene to approximately 8,500 C-14 BP. The interpretation of changes in the cladoceran assemblages is based on the known ecology of the taxa, the documented environmental history of the study sequence, the variations in the organic content of the sediment, the radiocarbon dates, and the results of analyses of other biotic groups, including diatoms, macrophytes, and chironomids. In addition, a quantitative reconstruction of changes in air temperature is presented for the study period. This reconstruction is based on transfer functions developed from a separate Swiss surface-sediment cladoceran data set.
   The cladoceran assemblages throughout the sequence are dominated by littoral chydorid taxa. Bosmina, Daphnia, and Simocephalus represent the open-water component of the zooplankton. Chydorus piger and Daphnia were the only immediate post-glacial pioneer taxa. A rapid proliferation of the open-water and littoral cladoceran taxa began with the onset of the Allerod and persisted for approximately 1,000 yrs. At the start of the Younger Dryas a local glacier formed and drained into the lake, causing a sudden decline in chydorid diversity, with only Chydorus sphaericus and Acroperus harpae persisting throughout this period. Chydorid diversity started to recover in the upper Younger Dryas and continued in the early Holocene. Progressive acidification and oligotrophication are also discernible from the cladoceran assemblages present in the Holocene.
   The reconstructed mean summer air temperature was from 8-21 degrees C, with prediction errors of 1.8-2.5 degrees C. The Allerod was only slightly warmer than the Younger Dryas period, but a progressive increase in temperature is apparent during the early Holocene. In conclusion, the results of this study provide a further demonstration of the value of cladocera as indicators of a variety of palaeoenvironmental parameters, including temperature.

AB  - This work presents detailed chemical kinetic computations and experimental measurements of a premixed stoichiometric N-2-diluted methane-air flame in two-dimensional unsteady vortical Bow, which are used to investigate the utility of several experimental observables as measurements of local burning and heat release rates. The computed mole fraction of HCO is found to have excellent correlation with flame heat release rate over the whale range of unsteady curvature and strain-rate investigated, for the flame under consideration. HCO planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging is discussed and demonstrated in a V-flame experiment. On the other hand, we find the utility of peak dilatation rate as an indicator of heat release rate to he dependent on the unsteady strain-rate and flame curvature environment, and the associated modification in diffusional thermal fluxes within the flame. The integrated dilatation rate is found to be more robust under unsteady strain-rate, but still questionable in regions of high flame curvature. We also study the utility of a particular formulation for CO2* chemiluminescence, OH, and CH PLIF imaging, as well as OH*, C-2*, and CH* chemiluminescence, as measurements of flame burning and heat release rates. We generally find these measures to be inferior to HCO. Experimental results suggest that CH, OH*, C-2*, and CH* are not adequate indicators of local extinction; rather they provide signals of subtle shifts of hydrocarbon consumption among different chemical pathways. Moreover, numerical results suggest that both OH mole fraction and an existing CO2* chemiluminescence model do not correlate with burning or heat release rate variations in regions of high unsteady flame curvature. The present numerical investigation uses a single flame/vortex condition and a specific 46-step C-(1) chemical mechanism. The conclusions reached herein may be generalized with further studies using more detailed mechanisms over ranges of stoichiometry, dilution, and flow time and spatial scales.

AB  - The road transport sector has been studied with a life-cycle perspective. Transport activities and products used for road transportation have been analysed in order to identify those with significant contribution to the total environmental impact. Detailed data on the environmental burdens caused by different transportation activities such as fuel production, fuel combustion at driving, maintenance of the vehicle and production and after use treatment of the vehicle have been collected and transformed into a form usable in life cycle assessment (LCA). A comprehensive and flexible system model for description of road transportation systems has been developed. A software program, KRABAT, has been developed from the system model. The program has been used for calculation of the environmental burdens of road transportation. The use of non-renewable energy is sometimes used as an indicator of the environmental impact of activities. In this study the consumption of non-renewable fuels, electricity and air emissions have been considered. The production, maintenance and after use treatment of the vehicle have shown to contribute significantly to the total environmental impact of road transportation, measured per vehicle kilometer. This is especially valid for passenger cars, for which the amount of fossile fuel used for production of the vehicle is about 10% of the total amount used during the whole life time of the car. This share is generally much smaller for trucks, since they are used more frequently than passenger cars. The treatment of the different materials of the car after use is of importance for the possibilities of minimization of the environmental impact from road transport. In a case study, the environmental burdens from all processes and transports in the life cycle of newspapers have been analysed. Two after use treatment scenarios were studied. one with 70% recycling and the other with 100% incineration with heat recovery. The total contribution of environmental burdens from transportation to the total of the whole life cycle were studied. It could not be concluded that transportation increased with a higher degree of recycling. This holds true for our assumptions. The result may however be different for other geographical conditions, population densities, etc.

AB  - The bioluminescent dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra contains various indoleamines, in particular, melatonin and 5-methoxytryptamine, as well as enzymes of their biosynthetic pathway. Melatonin exhibits a high-amplitude circadian rhythm characterized by a dramatic increase shortly after the onset of darkness. The maximum of melatonin is followed by a peak of 5-methoxytryptamine. These 5-methoxylated indoleamines seem to be involved in the mediation of the information 'darkness'. G. polyedra shows a short-day response, which consists in the formation of asexual cysts. Light break experiments demonstrate the photoperiodic nature of this reaction. Cells become sensitive to short days only upon exposure to a lowered temperature ( < 16-degrees-C). Melatonin mimics the short-day effect, but only at decreased temperature. 5-Methoxytryptamine is even a better inducer of cyst formation, acting also at 20-degrees-C and in any lighting schedule, including LL. Cyst induction is associated with stimulation of bioluminescence and cytoplasmic acidification. A model on the intracellular pathway of photoperiodic information transduction assumes increased deacetylation of melatonin under cyst-inducing conditions, binding of 5-methoxytryptamine to the membrane of an acidic vacuole, proton transfer to the cytoplasm, and decreased intracellular pH as the stimulus for encystment. Melatonin shows the property of a scavenger of superoxide anions. This reaction, which is efficiently catalyzed by hemin, leads to the formation of a substituted kynuramine (AFMK). Destruction of melatonin by light-induced superoxide anions in the presence of cellular hemin may represent a property which, during evolution, has made this molecule suitable as an indicator of darkness. On the other hand, AFMK, which is formed under illumination, might have become a mediator of the information 'light'. Photoperiodism in Gonyaulax shows surprising parallels to that in mammals, but allows the analysis of this phenomenon at an entirely cellular level.

AB  - Bioremediation of fuel-contaminated soils largely depends on microbial activities, which might be stimulated using (in)organic amendments. Attenuation of a diesel-biodiesel blend (B12) was investigated in microcosms during 93 days. Soil was spiked with B12 (5%, m m-1) and, in addition to contaminated Controls (unamended), soils received compost (COB), soybean hulls (SHB), or NPK fertilizer (IB) to reach a -20:1 carbon-to-nitrogen (C: N) ratio regarding B12-carbon content. Effects of treatments on B12 attenuation, soil respiration, heterotrophic and B12-utilizing bacteria, pH, organic-C, nitrogen contents, and phytotoxicity, were evaluated. After 20 days, diesel range organics analysis indicated 58, 48, 45, and 43% attenuation in Controls, SHB, IB, and COB, respectively. Final dissipation reached 90, 86, 72, and 60% in Controls, COB, IB, and SHB. Compost and soybean hulls appeared as preferential substrates for microorganisms. Although microbial activity (soil respiration) was 39 and 22% higher than Controls in COB and SHB, amendments postponed attenuation. Amendments transiently affected bacterial numbers as compared to Controls; however, these effects were not related to attenuation levels. pH of the contaminated soils (-7.0) dropped to 6.1 in IB, whereas pH values were between 6.7 and 7.6 in other treatments. Organic-N and Kjeldahl-N decreased during incubations, indicating net N mineralization and subsequent nitrification, although N losses could occur. Organic-C, initially higher in SHB and COB, decreased in all treatments; however, more prominent losses in COB and SHB suggest amendments were preferentially used by microorganisms. Phytotoxicity was improved in Controls; however, it was not associated with attenuation levels in amended treatments, possibly owing to formation of toxic products and B12 sorption/desorption. In IB, decreased microbial activity, delayed attenuation, and remarkable phytotoxicity were due to excessive fertilization. Therefore, intrinsic soil conditions were adequate for B12 attenuation, without the need for nutritional inputs. Results also demonstrate that toxicity bioindicators are relevant to monitor remediation.

AB  - Bauxite residue exhibiting high sodicity, nutrient deficiency, and poor structure, has a very slow effect on natural vegetation. However, it presents some eco-friendly indicators through substrate improvement, which is the basis for bauxite residue to show pedogenesis and vegetation restoration. To test the effectiveness of acid organic materials toward promoting transformation into a soil-like material, bauxite residue was amended with nitrohumic acid to improve the physical and chemical properties. The pH, total alkalinity, and exchangeable sodium percentage of the treated bauxite residues decreased from 10.2, 2.7 cmol/kg, and 20.6% to 8.0, 0.4 cmol/kg, and 5.1%, respectively, whilst organic matter, available N and P increased from 1.3%, 6.7 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg to 7.2%, 69.7 mg/kg, and 2.4 mg/kg, respectively. The results obtained from excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy also indicate that the nitrohumic acid treated residues have a higher fulvic acid content and present a significant amount of humified material and soil maturation. The high alkalinity of bauxite residue promotes the release of hydroxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups from fulvic acid to combine with cations. Nitmhumic acid neutralization lowered the IEP and PZC to pH 7.83 and 7.79, and made its surface charge properties closer to the soil; the decreased zeta potential of residues resulted in the particles dispersed state tend to aggregate. And as a result, the number of 0.05-0.25 mm and > 0.25 mm aggregates in the treated bauxite residues significantly increased, the sheet-like fine particles adhere to the surface of the large particles resulted in an accumulation and a layer structure formed. Amount of Ca and Fe in the aggregates as an inorganic binder combined with organic to promote the formation of micro-aggregates; whereas the content of Na and Si, which act as a "dispersant" and "filler" decreased.

AB  - In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health-care, improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty. Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections through measuring trends of RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 gene regions are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. approximate to 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. approximate to 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 gene regions in PCS (92.7, 90.6%, n = 6) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%, n = 5). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human 18S rRNA, making PMMoV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMoV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMoV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.

AB  - Quality, authenticity and stability control of medicinal plant materials and preparations based on them is an important challenge in industries using substances and materials derived from plants. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) and sage (Salvia officinalis L.) are one of the most common and best-selling medicines in the world. They are composed of phloroglucinols and diterpenes possessing pharmacological properties. However, some of the compounds (hyperforin, carnosic acid, etc.) determining these qualities decompose under the influence of various physical and chemical factors with the formation of stable and unstable intermediates. Considering the importance of utilization of these plants, the stability of hyperforin, carnosic acid and other compounds in their extracts and preparations during extraction and storage was studied in this work. Extracts and preparations were studied by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array and mass spectrometric detection. Plant extracts were obtained by heating (HE) as well as using ultrasonic (USE), microwave (MWE) and supercritical (SSE) extraction. The stability of hyperforins, their degradation, as well as the relationship between hyperforin and furohyperforin contents in extracts and preparations based on H. perforatum L. during storage were studied. Hyperforin to furohyperforin ratio in the extracts ranged from 18 to 5 depending on the origin of the medicinal plant material. The stability and transformation of carnosic acid was evaluated, the relationship between carnosic acid and carnosol contents and conditions of sample preparation and storage as well as industrially manufactured preparations based on S. officinalis L. was revealed. The possibility of applicability of hyperforin to furohyperforin ratio in H. perforatum L. and carnosic acid to carnosol ratio in S. officinalis L. was shown to confirm the quality of extracts and preparations on their basis. Since rutin to hyperforin ratio in H. perforatum L. is constant, this indicator can be used to confirm the quality and authenticity of the feedstock, regardless of where the plant grows.

AB  - Recently, we reported the possibility of successfully inducing captive maturation and spawning in golden mahseer through photothermal manipulation. Subsequently, we felt that it was imperative to understand the impact of these environmental manipulations on immunity, stress response, antioxidant potential, and general well-being of adult mahseer to develop a healthy broodstock. For this purpose, two experiments were carried out with changes in photoperiod (experiment I) and temperature (experiment II). In experiment I, random groups of adult female and male Tor putitora were subjected to three photoperiods (8L:16D, 12L:12D and 16L:8D) for 100 days. Decreasing levels of plasma melatonin with increasing photoperiod confirmed the physiological significance of different light-dark conditions in mahseer brooders. In terms of stress, plasma cortisol levels showed a linear increase with decreasing light duration in both males and females. Similarly, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was also significantly higher in males kept at 8L:16D. Plasma concentration of total immunoglobulins was found reduced in female brooders at 8L:16D, but this was not evident in males. In females, total antioxidants were found significantly elevated at 12L:12D. On the contrary, superoxide dismutase activity was lower at 12L:12D in females. The photoperiod has substantially influenced the plasma total protein and albumin levels in males. In experiment II, random groups of adult T. putitora were reared at ambient (21.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C) or elevated temperature (23.7 +/- 1.3 degrees C) groups for 121 days. The higher temperature was found to significantly decrease lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, and anti-protease activities in female mahseer brooders. However, total immunoglobulin levels were reduced significantly at elevated temperature both in males and females. No other temperature-related significant changes were observed in antioxidant potential, anti-oxidative enzymes or well-being related indices.

   The welfare of animals in shelters draws the attention of both the scientific and general public. It is possible to assess the well-being of cats in shelters using tools that are based on indicators used to reveal problematic aspects of welfare. This review aims to provide an insight into available methods of assessment of the welfare of cats in shelters with an emphasis on behavioural, physiological and health indicators.
   At any moment, there are millions of cats housed in foster care facilities for abandoned and stray animals for various reasons worldwide. Care, management and regulation among these facilities differ. Moreover, shelters can never substitute the full comfort of a good home for the animal, and the welfare of cats in shelters is a subject of discussion in many respects. Cats are animals sensitive to changes; for most of them, placement in a shelter is a stressful experience because of changes in routine, environment and the presence of other animals. Stress is reflected in changes in behaviour, causes fluctuations in physiological values and disrupts the immune system, which is a predisposition to the development or reactivation of disease. Evaluation of the presence and intensity of negative impacts is possible through the use of evaluation tools based on indicators that help set the environment and management of keeping so as to disrupt the quality of life as little as possible. Although a comprehensive and valid welfare tool that would evaluate animal-based and at the same time resource-based (or management-based) indicators of cats in shelters is not currently available, it is possible to use partial evaluation of individual welfare indicators to assess welfare. This review aims to provide the readers with an insight into current options of assessment of the welfare of cats in shelters with an emphasis on behavioural, physiological and health indicators with an application in both practical and scientific contexts.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) in the South Pacific have a unique history that calls for a regional-scale synthesis of MPA impacts and the factors related to positive ecological and socioeconomic change. However, recommendations of best approaches to MPA implementation can be made only when evaluation techniques are sound. Impact evaluation involves quantifying the effects of an intervention over and above the counterfactual of no intervention or a different intervention. Determining the true impact of an MPA can be challenging because additional factors beyond the presence of an MPA can confound the observed results (e.g. differences in ecological or socioeconomic conditions between MPA and control sites). While impact evaluation techniques employing counterfactual thinking have been well developed in other fields, they have been embraced only slowly in the MPA evaluation literature. We conducted a structured literature search and synthesis of MPA evaluation studies from the South Pacific to determine: (i) the overall ecological and socioeconomic impacts of MPAs in the region, (ii) what factors were associated with positive, neutral, or negative impacts, and (iii) to what extent the MPA evaluation literature from the region has incorporated counterfactual thinking and robust impact evaluation techniques. Based on 52 identified studies, 42% of measured ecological impacts were positive. While 72% of socioeconomic impacts were positive, these were from only eight studies. The proportion of positive impacts was comparable between community-based and centrally governed MPAs, suggesting that both governance approaches are viable options in the region. No-take MPAs had a greater number of positive ecological impacts than periodic closures and there was little evidence of any long-term ecological recovery within periodic closures following harvesting. Importantly, more than half of the studies examined (59%) did not provide any clear consideration of factors beyond the presence of the MPA that might have confounded their results. We conclude that counterfactual thinking has yet to be fully embraced in impact evaluation studies in the region and recommend pathways by which progress can be made.

AB  - Background. The bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758), is the most common sparid fish in the Tunisian waters. Despite its economic importance, the stock discrimination of this species is poorly understood up to date. As the otolith shape has long been known to be species-specific and recent studies have shown its value as an indicator of stock identity, the presently reported study was carried out for the first time to investigate the discrimination of the stock structure of B. boops samples collected from two sampling sites at the marine stations of Monastir and Zarzis located in Tunisia using the otolith shape descriptors analysis.
   Materials and methods. A total of 183 adult samples of B. boops were collected between January and August 2019 from two sampling sites at the Monastir and Zarzis marine stations. The outlines of sagittal otolith pairs from fish samples collected from the two sites were digitized and analyzed for shape variation by elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA).
   Results. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) showed statistically significant differences in otolith shape within and between fish samples in the two sites, i.e., there was an asymmetry. This asymmetry was found between the left and right otoliths within each site, as well as between the same sides (left-left) and (right-right) otoliths between the Monastir and Zarzis stations.
   Conclusion. Fish stock samples at the two stations represent two groups or populations of the Tunisian bogue stock and should be managed separately. In addition, the asymmetry in the otolith shape between fish samples from the two stations can be attributed to differences in the rate of growth resulting from local environmental factors such as water temperature, salinity, habitat, and diet. However, the inter-individual or even the intra-population asymmetry between the right and left otoliths can be explained by the possibility of having intraindividual stress that led to abnormalities in the development of the individuals or by the presence of poor living conditions for the larvae, resulting from unfavorable environments.

AB  - Water security is a major concern in recent years, especially, in semi-arid and arid regions, which are adversely impacted due to extensive anthropogenic and climatic changes across the globe. Present study investigates the long-term changes in streamflows, their quantitative attribution and socio-environmental implications for a climatically sensitive Tapi basin in west central India. The abrupt and gradual changes in streamflows have been detected over the period 1973-2013 using non-parametric Pettit's and Mann-Whitney U tests; and Modified Mann-Kendall, Spearman's Rho and Sen's slope estimator tests respectively. The stream flow analyses revealed heterogeneity across the basin, wherein the tributaries exhibited higher variability in annual runoff compared to the Tapi River. The spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS has been used to graphically demonstrate the spatial variability in rainfall and streamflow trends across the basin. The streamflows exhibited predominantly decreasing trends across the basin, except in the upper reaches of the Tapi River. The decreasing trends in streamflow are largely attributed to anthropogenic activities such as changes in the land use patterns viz., increase in agriculture area, construction of minor and medium hydraulic structures, decrease in forest cover, rapid urbanization, excessive groundwater extraction and streamflow regulations. The anthropogenic activities played a major role in declining streamflow trends in the Tapi basin, contributing about 68%-99% (average 85%) decline in total runoff, compared to rainfall variability, which contributed around 1%-32% (average 15%) decrease in total runoff. The analysis of water stress levels at sub-catchment scale exhibited significant rise in percentage of population living in the basin facing chronic water shortage (i.e., <1000 m(3)/capita/year), from 34.0% in year 1981 to 63.2% in year 2011, mostly in semi-arid regions. The reduction in water availability clearly highlighted the deteriorating water quality and stream ecology of the Lower Tapi River in Surat city, India. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most important signs of decreasing quality of life in urban environments is the reduction of thermal comfort. Heat discomfort has a negative impact on physical and mental performance of humans. Hence, it is of outmost importance to monitor thermal comfort patterns in cities and study its effect on people. The main objective of this study is to present a spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model for modeling thermal comfort for Tehran as a case study. For doing so, the reflectance and thermal information extracted from Landsat-8 satellite images, ASTER digital elevation model, MOD07 water vapor, and meteorological/climatic datasets were used. Several indicators including the downward shortwave radiation (SWD) and longwave radiation (LWD) to surface, upward longwave radiation (LWU) from the surface, brightness, greenness and wetness of the surface were derived. An Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) method was adapted considering different mental circumstances e.g., extremely pessimistic, pessimistic, neutral, optimistic and extremely optimistic. Our findings determine the geographical variation of thermal comfort across our study area e.g., the cold periods of the year are spread in the west and north-west side and the warm periods of the year on the west and north-west, while the central, northern, and eastern regions have a more favorable thermal comfort than other regions. The areal percentage of very suitable thermal comfort category for very pessimistic, pessimistic, neutral, optimistic, and very optimistic during the warm period of the year was 2.7, 5.1, 4.4, 13.4 and 1.18, respectively and in the cold period of the year was 9.1, 13.3, 18.3, 28.9 and 33.9, respectively. In both warm and cold periods with increasing degree of optimism, the area of favorable thermal comfort classes increases, while the area of unfavorable thermal comfort categories decreases. Our results and conclusions drawn from our proposed approach are useful for urban planners and public health researcher for monitoring quality of life in cities.

AB  - PurposeIn Italy, composting olive mill waste has become a common practice, since it mitigates the environmental problems associated with spreading the waste on land. Compost can be used to prepare growth media for plant nursery cultivation as a substitute for peat, a non-renewable resource whose extraction has long raised environmental concerns. Here, we investigate two common composting proceduresopen windrow and static-pile in gas-permeable bagsand compare them to evaluate their environmental impact.MethodsWe perform a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) in accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044. The LCA considers carbon storage in the soil after 100years, fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the impacts avoided by substituting for peat. We use cumulative energy demand, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, and eutrophication potential indicators in a contribution analysis and explore how the re-use of olive pits for energy production and reduction of commercial fertilizers improves the environmental balance. We also present a scenario analysis that indicates how parameter fluctuations affect the results.Results and discussionOur study shows that peat's impacts can be significantly reduced from 1162.3 to96.3kg CO2-eq/Mg for open windrow compost or 43.1kg CO2-eq/Mg for static-pile compost in gas-permeable bags. For static-pile composting, the lack of volatile organic compound and ammonia emissions and the detection of oxygen concentrations above 12% vol. suggest fully aerobic conditions. Fugitive greenhouse gas emissions were the most important contributions to the GWP. In the contribution analysis for static-pile composting, the avoidance of compost spreading and the carbon storage effect (due to compost usage) contributed 54% of the overall impacts to GWP and between 21 and 45% to the other indicators.ConclusionsThis LCA study illustrates how horticulturists can improve their resource management practices by recycling olive mill waste materials. Proper management of composting unit aeration can reduce fugitive GHG emissions.

AB  - Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and rain-use efficiency (RUE) are important indicators in assessing the response of ecosystems to climate change. In this paper, the Changtang Plateau in the Tibetan Autonomous Region was selected as the study area to analyze the spatial and temporal changes of ANPP and RUE in grassland communities and their response to climate change. The results showed the following:(1) The spatial pattern of ANPP was closely related to rainfall on the Changtang Plateau. The average ANPP over the past 15 years increased gradually from the arid west to the humid east. A consistent pattern was exhibited in different grassland types and climate zones. (2) The RUE was higher at the east and west edges of the Changtang Plateau, especially in the arid west, but was lower in the center. From the perspective of different climatic zones, the average RUE in the southern Tibetan semiarid climate zone and the Ngari arid climate zone was significantly higher than that in other climate zones. However, the average RUE in different grassland types only varied from 0.07 to 0.09 gm(-2)mm(-1). The spatial variation in RUE was more distinct in different climatic zones than in different grassland types. (3) Climate change influenced the interannual variation of ANPP and RUE, but the response of ANPP to rainfall showed a significant lag. The interannual change in RUE was negatively correlated with changes in precipitation. (4) In general, a greater area showed a significant increase rather than a decrease in ANPP on the Changtang Plateau, which meant that the grassland condition is improving. The temporal variation patterns of ANPP and RUE in different climate zones were consistent with the overall patterns on the Changtang Plateau, while the variation was not significant in different grassland types.

AB  - Purpose. To study basic principles and conditions of the efficiency of the system to redistribute mineral extraction revenue including the countries with lower levels of welfare.
   Methods. The research applies a method of qualitative and quantitative analysis of the scientific literature, data by the Natural Resource Governance Institute, national reports according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and open Internet sources. Taxation schemes for mineral extraction revenue as well as the most important tendencies in the schemes changes over the recent years were considered. Distributions of the resource taxes in terms of the state administration levels as well as vertical distribution of budget receipts from the development of natural resources were analyzed. The countries distributing tax receipts from the mineral extraction in favour of the local authorities were selected as the object of the research.
   Findings. It has been determined that in the majority of countries. payments from mineral extraction are sent to the national-level institutions being distributed back to the mining areas or neighbouring territories. It has been pointed out that certain countries send a share of the mining income to the local budgets automatically using the formulas based on the objective indicators such as amount of population, amount of budget receipts from the area, poverty rate or geographical position. It has been identified that the basic principle of the system of resource use taxation to provide social welfare is represented by the optimal taxation scheme stimulating the production and maximizing the income which share is redistributed in favour of the society to cover all the local administration levels.
   Originality. The comparative analysis and determination of the recent data of distribution of budget receipts from mineral resources in terms of the developing countries.
   Practical implications. The obtained results may favour the scientific substantiation of the strategy to distribute mineral extraction revenue, planning of the development of mineral and raw material complex of the Central Asian countries; moreover, they may be useful while assessing the efficiency of investment projects of the field development.

AB  - An analysis of the taxonomic diversity of benthic diatoms was carried out for near-shore biotopes of Crimea with different content of trace metals and organic pollutants (PCBs, PAHs, DDTs). Taxonomic distinctness indices such as average taxonomic distinctness, AvTD (Delta(+)) and variation in taxonomic distinctness, VarTD (Lambda(+)) were used for evaluation of the hierarchical structure of diatom taxocenes of two intact sites (Dvuyakornaya Bay and Cape Fiolent) and two heavily polluted water areas (Sevastopol Bay and Balaklava Bay). The highest similarity of species was revealed between healthy biotopes, in spite of their differences in hydrological and hydrochemical conditions. AvTD values for Dvuyakornaya Bay and Cape Piolent (Delta(+) = 79.0 and 76.7, respectively) were lower in comparison with expected average levels (Delta(+)= 82.2) evaluated for the flora of benthic Bacillariophyta (1094 species) registered for the Northern part of the Black Sea (NPBS). As established, the taxonomic trees of the diatom taxocenes at pristine water areas are characterized by a moderate degree of vertical evenness and high variability of distances between neighboring clusters of species; they are mainly formed by polyspecific branches close on the genus level. The AvTD values for diatom taxocenes of the heavily polluted Sevastopol Bay (Delta(+) = 83.6) and Balaklava Bay (Delta(+) = 84.1) were significantly higher than the corresponding indices for undisturbed biotopes and exceeded the expected average level for the entire list of Bacillariophyta for NPBS. The upward trend of AvTD along the increasing technogenic impact can be caused by the disappearance of taxonomically close species with low tolerance from the same genus and prevalence of oligo- and monospecies branches in architectonics of the hierarchical tree. The present study shows that the application of TaxD indices can be considered an additional appropriate indicator tool for quantifying changes in the hierarchical structure of diatom taxocenes under persistent anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Berberis microphylla G. Forst. (calafate) is an evergreen and spiny shrub considered as a non-timber patagonian forest product, that is relevant for diversification of agrifood production, particularly interesting since its black-blue fruits are rich in phenolic compounds. The objective of this research is to analyze the variability in floral traits and reproductive success of Berberis microphylla G. Forst. among and within three populations of Tierra del Fuego along three growing seasons. The presence of variability in some floral traits as well as in the reproductive success of B. microphylla among and within three Tierra del Fuego populations was observed, in agreement with the environmental conditions i.e. mean daily temperatures and accumulated rainfall for the three populations and the three growing seasons. Flower dry weight and gynoecium area are good indicators of flower quality (i.e. ovule number), with positive and significant correlations between them (flower dry weight with gynoecium area, r = 0.551; p = < 0.001, and flower dry weight with ovule number, r = 0.407, p < 0.001). Pollen/ovule, seed/ovule, fruit/flower and fecundity indices are also good indicators not only of flower quality but also of the reproductive success. The multivariate analysis allowed to analyze jointly the whole measured variables, and explored the influence of annual climatic variability in the response of plants and populations. The variables with great changes among years were those representing quantities (the numbers of ovules and pollen grains) as well as some of the related with size (gynoecium elongation and pollen grain size). Likewise, the influence of each variable in the population split was highlighted at each growing season, which helps to understand the drivers of the differences among them. Plants with a highlight performance were detected and could be selected for their clonal propagation and ex-situ evaluation for the beginning of a breeding program.

AB  - Sustainable soil management requires reliable and accurate monitoring of changes in soil organic matter (SOM). However, despite the development of improved analytical techniques during the last decades, there are still limits in the detection of small changes in soil organic carbon content and SOM composition. This study focused on the detection of such changes under laboratory conditions by adding different organic amendments to soils. The model experiments consisted of artificially mixing soil samples from non-fertilized plots of three German long-term agricultural experiments in Bad Lauchstadt (silty loam), Grossbeeren (silty sand), and Muncheberg (loamy sand) with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal in quantities from 3 to 180 t ha(-1) each. In these mixtures we determined the organic carbon contents by elemental analysis and by thermal mass losses (TML) determined by thermogravimetry. The results confirmed the higher reliability of elemental analysis compared to TML for organic carbon content determination. The sensitivity of both methods was not sufficient to detect the changes in organic carbon content caused by small quantities of organic amendments (3 t ha(-1) or 0.1-0.4 g C kg(-1) soil). In the case of elemental analysis, the detectability of changes in carbon content increased with quantities of added amendments, but the method could not distinguish different types of organic amendments. On the contrary, the based on analysis of degradation temperatures, the TML allowed this discrimination together with their quantitative analysis. For example, added charcoal was not visible in TML from 320 to 330 degrees C, which is used for carbon content determination. However, increasing quantities of charcoal were reflected in a higher TML around 520 degrees C. Furthermore, differences between measured (with TML110-550) and predicted mass loss on ignition using both organic carbon (with TML330) and clay contents (with TML140) were confirmed as a suitable indicator for detection of organic amendments in different types of soils. We conclude that thermogravimetry enables the sensitive detection of organic fertilizers and organic amendments in soils under arable land use.

AB  - In this study, we synthesized covalently functionalized graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) aqueous suspensions that are highly stable and environmentally friendly for use as coolants in heat transfer systems. We evaluated the heat transfer and hydrodynamic properties of these nano-coolants flowing through a horizontal stainless steel tube subjected to a uniform heat flux at its outer surface. The GNPs functionalized with clove buds using the one-pot technique. We characterized the clove-treated GNPs (CGNPs) using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We then dispersed the CGNPs in distilled water at three particle concentrations (0.025, 0.075 and 0.1 wt%) in order to prepare the CGNP-water nanofluids (nano-coolants). We used ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to examine the stability and solubility of the CGNPs in the distilled water. There is significant enhancement in thermo-physical properties of CGNPs nanofluids relative those for distilled water. We validated our experimental set-up by comparing the friction factor and Nusselt number for distilled water obtained from experiments with those determined from empirical correlations, indeed, our experimental set-up is reliable and produces results with reasonable accuracy. We conducted heat transfer experiments for the CGNP-water nano-coolants flowing through the horizontal heated tube in fully developed turbulent condition. Our results are indeed promising since there is a significant enhancement in the Nusselt number and convective heat transfer coefficient for the CGNP-water nanofluids, with only a negligible increase in the friction factor and pumping power. More importantly, we found that there is a significant increase in the performance index, which is a positive indicator that our nanofluids have potential to substitute conventional coolants in heat transfer systems because of their overall thermal performance and energy savings benefits.

AB  - Tree roots contribute to the resistance of riparian sediments to physical deformation and disintegration. Understanding reinforcement by roots requires information on root distributions within riparian soils and sediments. Continuous-depth models or curves have been proposed to describe vertical root density variations, providing useful indicators of the types of function that may be appropriate to riparian trees, but have generally been estimated for terrestrial species or broad vegetation types rather than riparian species or environments. We investigated vertical distributions of roots >0.1mm diameter of a single riparian tree species (Populus nigra L.) along the middle reaches of a single river (Tagliamento River, Italy), where Populus nigra dominates the riparian woodland. Root density (hundreds m(-2)) and root area ratio (RAR in cm(2) m(-2)) were measured within 10cm depth increments of 24 excavated bank profiles across nine sites. Sediment samples, extracted from distinct strata within the profiles, were analysed for moisture content, organic matter content and particle size. Statistical analyses identified two groups of wetter and drier profiles and five sediment types. Following log(e)-transformation of root density and RAR, linear regression analysis explored their variation with depth and, using dummy variables, any additional influence of moisture and sediment type. Significant linear regression relationships were estimated between both root density and RAR and depth which explained only 15% and 8% of the variance in the data. Incorporating moisture and then sediment characteristics into the analysis increased the variance explained in root density to 29% and 36% and in RAR to 14% and 26%. We conclude that riparian tree root density and RAR are highly spatially variable and are poorly explained by depth alone. Complex riparian sedimentary structures and moisture conditions are important influences on root distributions and so need to be incorporated into assessments of the contribution of roots to river bank reinforcement.

AB  - We applied a diatom-based thermal stratification index to sediment cores from three lakes in the northeast USA to evaluate the influence of lake morphometry and within-lake processes on diatom responses to climate change. The three lakes all had surface area > 5 km(2) and experienced the same regional declines in wind speed and progressively earlier ice-out dates, but differed in morphometry, particularly surface area and mean depth. We coupled this paleolimnological approach with contemporary ecological measurements to validate the use of two indicator species (Aulacoseira subarctica (O. Muller) Haworth and Discostella stelligera (Cleve & Grunow) Houk & Klee) in the stratification index. D. stelligera was abundant during stratified conditions in Tunk Lake and Sebago Lake, but not in Lobster Lake. Diatom-inferred stratification shifted to shallower and/or longer duration in Tunk Lake starting in the late nineteenth century, and continued to become shallower over much of the twentieth century. A shift to shallower and/or longer duration was also apparent in Sebago Lake starting around 1850, after which the index suggested little change, even though ice-out occurred 30 days earlier in 2000 than in 1807 and wind speed began to decline in the 1960s. This lake has very slow sedimentation rates, experiences regular seiches, and has D. stelligera present during circulation and stratified periods. These factors may smooth stratification-driven diatom responses. Contemporary ecological measurements did not support the application of the stratification index in Lobster Lake because D. stelligera bloomed only during spring turnover. In Lobster Lake, the relative abundances of D. stelligera in the sediment record showed some variation over time, were generally lower in periods with earlier ice-out in the region, and have been lower since the 1980s. Our results highlight the different responses recorded in the sediments of three large lakes in the same region to climate-driven changes and support the use of indicator species in reconstructing lake thermal stratification patterns when paired with site-specific morphometric and ecological data.

AB  - Lateral surface/subsurface flow and their connectivity play a significant role in redistributing soil water, which has a direct effect on biological, chemical, and geomorphological processes in the root zone (similar to 1m). However, most of the land surface models neglect the horizontal exchanges of water at the grid or subgrid scales, focusing only on the vertical exchanges of water as one-dimensional process. To develop better hydrologic understanding and modeling capability in complex landscapes, in this study we added connectivity-based lateral subsurface flow algorithms in the Community Land Model. To demonstrate the impact of lateral flow and connectivity on soil water storage we designed three cases including the following: (1) with complex surface topography only, (2) with complex surface topography in upper soil layers and soil hydraulic properties with uniform anisotropy. and (3) with complex surface topography and soil hydraulic properties with spatially varying anisotropy. The connectivity was considered as an indicator for the variation of anisotropy in the case 3, which was created by wetness conditions or geophysical controls (e.g., soil type, normalized difference vegetation index, and topographic index). These cases were tested in two study sites (ER 5 field and ER-sub watershed in Oklahoma) comparing to the field (gravimetric and remote sensing) soil moisture observations. Through the analysis of spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of soil moisture predictions from the study cases, surface topography was found to be a crucial control in demonstrating the variation of near surface soil moisture, but not significantly affected the subsurface flow in deeper soil layers. In addition, we observed the best performance in case 3 representing that the lateral connectivity can contribute effectively to quantify the anisotropy and redistributing soil water in the root zone. Hence, the approach with connectivity-based lateral subsurface flow was able to better characterize the spatially distributed patterns of subsurface flow and improve the simulation of the hydrologic cycle.

AB  - Large carnivore populations are recovering in many parts of the world and this generates conflicts with humans, notably in terms of livestock depredation. Governmental programs of mitigation measures and compensation for losses are often implemented to reduce conflicts, but the factors affecting losses are poorly understood. We used 11 years of data on domestic sheep (Ovis aries) claimed, and confirmed, to have been killed by predators in Norway to evaluate how predator density, flock management, and other environmental or habitat-related variables are related to losses. The percentage of animals claimed as lost that was found and confirmed to have been killed by large predators (i.e., the detection rate) was low, especially for sheep claimed as killed by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), wolverine (Gulo gulo) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). Still, we generally found that similar factors predicted the number of claims and number of carcasses found across predator species. Predator density was strongly associated with losses, especially for sheep claimed as killed by brown bears (Ursus arctos), lynx and wolverines. Percentage of forest in the pastures, average slaughter weight of the lambs (an indicator of the forage conditions during summer) and vegetation characteristics in the spring also predicted the number of sheep claimed and found killed by lynx, wolverines and eagles. Factors related to losses due to wolves (Canis lupus) were harder to ascertain, possibly because of the severity of mitigation measures (e.g., electric fences) taken to protect sheep in wolf territories, a factor we were not able to include in our large scale analyses. Patrolling of the grazing area and early gathering of sheep in the autumn were not associated with a substantial reduction in losses. However, our dataset was not well suited to evaluate the efficiency of those mitigation strategies. Our findings could help develop new mitigation strategies as alternatives to predator removal where large carnivore conservation is a concern.

AB  - Over the last several decades, the distribution of cropland in China changed as a result of nationwide urbanization, continuous economic development and rapid population growth. Patterns of cropland and the driving factors that have caused changes in those patterns differ substantially among regions. Therefore, landscape classification should be combined with an analysis of the factors that cause land-use change, especially in large areas with complex natural and socio-economic conditions. The study described here was performed in Xinjiang, a typical arid region in northwestern China. After considering the percentage of cropland, the population density and the proportion of the population that practice animal husbandry in 2008, six types of cropland patterns and attributes (TCPAs) were identified using hierarchical clustering analysis. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were then developed to determine the main socio-economic indicators for cropland change from 1988 to 2008 within each TCPA. The results indicated that all selected factors were significantly strong drivers of cropland change in the study area. The total power of agricultural machinery, the gross output value of agricultural products and the consumption of chemical fertilizer occurred most frequently in the six PLSR models. However, the population density of minority nationalities, the agricultural population density, the gross output value of forestry and animal husbandry products, and the oil-bearing crops yield were each identified as strong factors only once in the six models. Each variable also had different effects in each of the six groups, and significant differences existed in the composition of the main factors between the groups. The PLSR model partially eliminated co-dependency between variables and facilitated a more unbiased view of the relationships between socio-economic factors and changes in cropland. The approach used here, which combined landscape classification based on related attributes with PLSR models, has important applications in sustainable land-use management, biodiversity conservation, and agricultural land protection.

AB  - Saltmarsh restoration, through de-embankment, is implemented across Europe and North America with the aims of restoring habitat, sustainably protecting coastlines, and improving water quality. Yet, there is very little understanding of the effects of de-embankment on sediment physico-chemical characteristics and how these characteristics may influence the behaviour of redox-sensitive contaminant metals such as mercury (Hg). The overall aim of this study was to provide baseline data on Hg biogeochemistry in restored coastal saltmarshes and in particular: 1) to assess the spatial variability of sediment total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations over three spatial scales, 2) to examine the association between Hg speciation and indicators of saltnarsh development (loss on ignition, sediment bulk density and moisture content) and 3) to explore how these sediment characteristics and Hg biogeochemistry change with time following de-embankment and hence saltmarsh development.
   Total Hg and MeHg concentrations at all sites are moderate to high and THg variation is controlled by proximity to external Hg sources. MeHg concentrations and physico-chemical sediment characteristics are variable at different spatial scales in natural and restored sites. MeHg concentrations and physico-chemical parameters varied predominantly at the intermediate (similar to 15-50 m) spatial scale in natural saltmarshes, whilst restored sites were less heterogeneous indicative of lower habitat and topographic heterogeneity suggesting that physico-chemical sediment characteristics exert a strong control on Hg methylation.
   In restored sites, physico-chemical sediment characteristics and MeHg concentrations reflect saltmarsh development and MeHg concentrations increase with time following de-embankment. In the first few decades following de-embankment previous land-use has a significant impact on physical sediment characteristics and MeHg concentrations are lower in restored saltmarshes probably due to poor drainage and/or limited vegetation development. However, with time both physico-chemical characteristics and MeHg concentrations in the restored and natural sites converge, suggesting that it may take decades or even centuries before restored sites have similar physical and biogeochemical conditions to their natural counterparts.

AB  - The impact of eight household micropollutants (erythromycin, ofloxacin, ibuprofen, 4-nonylphenol, triclosan, sucralose, PFOA and PFOS (PFAAs)) on the laboratory bacterial strain Escherichia coli MG1655 and on activated sludge from an urban wastewater treatment plant was studied.
   Growth-based toxicity tests on E. coli were performed for each micropollutants. The effect of micropollutants on activated sludge (at concentrations usually measured in wastewater up to concentrations disturbing the bacterial growth of E. coli) was examined in batch reactors and by comparison to a control reactor (without micropollutants). The bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by the sludge were measured by size exclusion chromatography and their overexpression was considered as an indicator of bacteria sensitivity to environmental changes. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the ammonium concentration were monitored to evaluate the biomass ability to remove the macropollution.
   Some micropollutants induced an increase of bound EPS in activated sludge flocs at concentrations depending on the micropollutant: erythromycin from 100 mu g/L, ofloxacin from 10 mu g/L, triclosan from 0.5 mu g/L, 4-nonylphenol from 5000 mu g/L and PFAAs from 0.1 mu g/L. This suggests that the biomass had to cope with new conditions. Moreover, at high concentrations of erythromycin (10 mg/L) and ibuprofen (5 mg/L) bacterial populations were no longer able to carry out the removal of macropollution.
   Ibuprofen induced a decrease of bound EPS at all the studied concentrations, probably reflecting a decrease of general bacterial activity. The biomass was not sensitive to sucralose in terms of EPS production, however at very high concentration (1 g/L) it inhibited the COD decrease.
   Micropollution removal was also assessed. Ibuprofen, erythromycin, ofloxacin, 4-nonylphenol and triclosan were removed from wastewater, mainly by biodegradation. Sucralose and PFOA were not removed from wastewater at all, and PFOS was slightly eliminated by adsorption on sludge. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Components of (co)variance and genetic parameters were estimated for adjusted weights at ages 120 (W120), 240 (W240), 365 (W365) and 450 (W450) days of Polled Nellore cattle raised on pasture and born between 1987 and 2010. Analyses were performed using an animal model, considering fixed effects: herd-year-season of birth and calf sex as contemporary groups and the age of cow as a covariate. Gibbs Samplers were used to estimate (co) variance components, genetic parameters and additive genetic effects, which accounted for great proportion of total variation in these traits. High direct heritability estimates for the growth traits were revealed and presented mean 0.43, 0.61, 0.72 and 0.67 for W120, W240, W365 and W450, respectively. Maternal heritabilities were 0.07 and 0.08 for W120 and W240, respectively. Direct additive genetic correlations between the weight at 120, 240, 365 and 450 days old were strong and positive. These estimates ranged from 0.68 to 0.98. Direct-maternal genetic correlations were negative for W120 and W240. The estimates ranged from -0.31 to -0.54. Estimates of maternal heritability ranged from 0.056 to 0.092 for W120 and from 0.064 to 0.096 for W240. This study showed that genetic progress is possible for the growth traits we studied, which is a novel and favorable indicator for an upcoming and promising Polled Zebu breed in Tropical regions. Maternal effects influenced the performance of weight at 120 and 240 days old. These effects should be taken into account in genetic analyses of growth traits by fitting them as a genetic or a permanent environmental effect, or even both. In general, due to a medium-high estimate of environmental (co) variance components, management and feeding conditions for Polled Nellore raised at pasture in tropical regions of Brazil needs improvement and growth performance can be enhanced.

AB  - Spreading of waste organic matter on agricultural lands is considered to enhance soil microbial activities and physical properties and improves soil nutrient status. However, organic wastes have also been shown to be a source of microbial contaminants including pathogens. Related risks are governed by pathogens' survival and transport particularities. We evaluated the significance of high levels of CaCO3, common in arid and semi-arid soils, on survival of Escherichia call NAR at different temperatures. Amendments of 0, 5, 10, 15 or 25 g CaCO3 were mixed into variable soil amounts to obtain 100 g soil-CaCO3 mixtures. Both sterile and non-sterile soil mixtures were tested. Suspensions of a nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli strain (E. coli NAR) were added to the mixtures at a rate of 10(6) cell g(-1) soil. Mixtures were incubated at 4, 15, or 37 degrees C at the soil's field capacity for water (i.e. 0.13 g g(-1)). Each treatment was tested in triplicate. Persistence of culturable E. coli NAR was verified throughout the incubation period. The recovery rates of culturable E. coli NAR were significantly correlated to CaCO3 concentrations (P < 0.05). Incubation temperature (T) was the most significant factor (P < 0.01). In non-sterile mixtures the largest decline in survival rates of E. coli NAR was measured for treatments with larger CaCO3 content (i.e. 15 and 25%). Interaction of temperature and CaCO3 was significant for E. coli NAR die-off. Sterilization of soil caused nonuniform fluctuations in the effect of treatments. The maximum calculated decay rate for E. coli NAR was 0.83 d(-1) for the 15 g CaCO3 non-sterile mixture incubated at 37 degrees C while the minimum was 0.09 d(-1) for the control unamended sterile soil incubated at 15 degrees C. A combination of high temperature, large CaCO3 concentrations and a non-sterile, biologically active soil created the least favorable conditions for E. coli survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A molecular imprinted electrochemical sensor for the determination of the residue of chlortoluron (CH) in environment was prepared with melamine (MA) as functional monomer. The electropolymerization of poly-melamine-moleculady-imprinted-polymer (PMA-MIP) on the GC electrode was conducted in a 1.0 mol/L H2SO4 by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at room temperature (25 degrees C). Then the template molecule (CH) on the PMA-MIP film was removed by nitric acid. The experimental conditions (including electrocatalysis of the MA film, pH effects, incubation and competition times) were optimized. The incubation time chosen for the subsequent experiments was 12 min and 12-min was also recommended as the optimized competition time. The Amperometric i-t curves were recorded during the determination. The detection of CH relied on a competition reaction between CH and horseradish peroxidase labeled chlortoluron (HRP-CH) coupled with the subsequent catalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide by the poly-MA film. Highly sensitive detection of CH was achieved by the double amplification derived from the electro-catalysis of H2O2 on MA film and the enzymatic effect of HRP. There was linear relationship between the current changes and CH concentration in the range of 0.01 similar to 0.8 mu mol/L with a detect limit of 2.64 nmol/L by chronoamperometric method. The proposed PMA-MIP sensor displayed excellent analytical performance (e.g., high sensitivity, good selectivity, and good reproducibility). Some analogues (difenoxuron, neburon, isoproturon and fluometuron) were also used as interferences to examine the selectivity. The changes in the current response of 94-time difenoxuron, 62-time neburon, 38-time fluometuron and 20-time isoproturon are negligible compared with chlortoluron. In addition, the feasibility of its practical applications has been demonstrated in the analysis of samples of tap water and soil extract solution. Recoveries were ranged from 97.0% to 107.0%, and the RSDs were less than 2%, which can be indicators of good recovery and practicability.

AB  - CO2 fluxes were measured continuously for three years (2003-2005) using the eddy covariance technique for the canopy layer with a height of 27 m above the ground in a dominant subtropical evergreen forest in Dinghushan, South China. By applying gapfilling methods, we quantified the different components of the carbon fluxes (net ecosystem exchange (NEE)), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) in order to assess the effects of meteorological variables on these fluxes and the atmospherecanopy interactions on the forest carbon cycle. Our results showed that monthly average daily maximum net CO2 exchange of the whole ecosystem varied from -3.79 to -14.24 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and was linearly related to photosynthetic active radiation. The Dinghushan forest acted as a net carbon sink of -488 g C m(-2) y(-1), with a GPP of 1448 g Cm-2 y(-1), and a R-eco of 961 g C m(-2) y(-1). Using a carboxylase-based model, we compared the predicted fluxes of CO2 with measurements. GPP was modelled as 1443 g C m(-2) y(-1), and the model inversion results helped to explain ca. 90% of temporal variability of the measured ecosystem fluxes. Contribution of CO2 fluxes in the subtropical forest in the dry season (October-March) was 62.2% of the annual total from the whole forest ecosystem. On average, 43.3% of the net annual carbon sink occurred between October and December, indicating that this time period is an important stage for uptake of CO2 by the forest ecosystem from the atmosphere. Carbon uptake in the evergreen forest ecosystem is an indicator of the interaction of between the atmosphere and the canopy, especially in terms of driving climate factors such as temperature and rainfall events. We found that the Dinghushan evergreen forest is acting as a carbon sink almost year-round. The study can improve the evaluation of the net carbon uptake of tropical monsoon evergreen forest ecosystem in south China region under climate change conditions.

AB  - Crops grown from non-genetically modified seed should contain no more than 0.9% GM material. The very diverse nature of EU landscapes implies that coexistence measures must be adapted to regional conditions. Rigid rules, such as the requirement of large isolation distances everywhere, may raise the cost of coexistence measures, particularly in densely planted areas, without necessarily meeting the objectives of the European Commission.
   One of the objectives of the SIGMEA programme (Sustainable Introduction of GM Crops into European Agriculture is a Specific Targeted Research Project in the EC), within which this work was conducted, was to provide tools for the management of coexistence at the landscape level.
   We compared four contrasting maize production zones (in Alsace and Aragon) using MAPOD (R), a spatially-explicit model of gene flow, and randomly allocating GM crops to maize plots. We calculated two indicators of potential interest to different stakeholders (not only farmers and regulators, but also collecting firms and industry): (1) the proportion of the non-GM maize area not complying with a given threshold and (2) the mean cross pollination rate obtained if the harvests of all the conventional plots were to be mixed in a silo.
   Our results suggest that it is possible to classify the regional landscapes in terms of the level of risk (for different thresholds depending on market standards-e.g. 0.1%; 0.4%; 0.9%) with few structural characteristics easily calculated from GIS and agricultural statistics data (Mean field area; proportion of the Agricultural Used Area (AUA) devoted to maize, GM maize proportion, maize flowering dynamics and wind characteristics). The mean cross pollination rate increases with GM maize proportion in all the landscapes but the effect of this factor is modulated by structural variables of the landscapes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ponds are among the most diverse and yet threatened components of freshwater biodiversity. The conservation of ponds would greatly benefit from the identification of surrogate taxa in preliminary assessments aimed at detecting ponds of potentially high biodiversity value. Here, we used predictive co-correspondence analysis (Co-CA) to quantify the strength of plant species composition and plant community types in predicting multivariate patterns in water beetle assemblages, based on data from 54 farmland ponds in Ireland. The predictive accuracy of a number of environmental variables as well as that of plant diversity (species richness and evenness) was calculated using predictive canonical correspondence analysis (CCA-PLS). The study ponds supported over 30% of the Irish water beetle fauna (76 species), with five species having some form of IUCN Red List Status in Ireland, as well as 67 wetland plant species, including a nationally rare one. Co-CA showed that plant species composition had a positive predictive accuracy, which was significantly higher compared to that of data at the plant community type level. Although environmental variables showed a higher predictive capacity compared to that of plant species composition, the difference was not significant. Explanatory CCA analyses showed that plants and beetles both responded to the same subset of environmental conditions, which explained approximately 18% of the variation in both plant and beetle species composition. Regional differences as well as permanency, substratum, and grazing intensity affected the composition of both plant and beetle assemblages. These findings have important implications in conservation planning. First, wetland plants can be effectively used as a surrogate taxon in the identification of conservation-priority ponds. Second, conservation strategies aimed at maintaining and enhancing pond biodiversity should be based on considerations on plant species composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence that many protein regions and even entire proteins lacking stable tertiary and/or secondary structure in solution (i.e., intrinsically disordered proteins) might be involved in protein-protein interactions, regulation, recognition, and signal transduction is rapidly accumulating. These signaling proteins play a crucial role in the development of several pathological conditions, including cancer. To test a hypothesis that intrinsic disorder is also abundant in cardiovascular disease (CVD), a data set of 487 CVD-related proteins was extracted from SWISS-PROT. CVD-related proteins are depleted in major order-promoting residues (Trp, Phe, Tyr, Ile, and Val) and enriched in some disorder-promoting residues (Arg, Gln, Ser, Pro, and Glu). The application of a neural network predictor of natural disordered regions (PONDR VL-XT) together with cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis, charge-hydropathy plot (CH plot) analysis, and alpha-helical molecular recognition feature (alpha-MoRF) indicator revealed that CVD-related proteins are enriched in intrinsic disorder. In fact, the percentage of proteins with 30 or more consecutive residues predicted by PONDR VL-XT to be disordered was 57 +/- 4% for CVD-associated proteins. This value is close that described earlier for signaling proteins (66 +/- 6%) and is significantly larger than the content of intrinsic disorder in eukaryotic proteins from SWISS-PROT (47 +/- 4%) and in nonhomologous protein segments with a well-defined three-dimensional structure (13 +/- 4%). Furthermore, CDF and CH-plot analyses revealed that 120 and 36 CVD-related proteins, respectively, are wholly disordered. This high level of intrinsic disorder could be important for the function of CVD-related proteins and for the control and regulation of processes associated with cardiovascular disease. In agreement with this hypothesis, 198 R-MoRFs were predicted in 101 proteins from the CVD data set. A comparison of disorder predictions with the experimental structural and functional data for a subset of the CVD-associated proteins indicated good agreement between predictions and observations. Thus, our data suggest that intrinsically disordered proteins might play key roles in cardiovascular disease.

AB  - The imbalance of C, N, and P caused by the spilled oil could be regulated by the addition of nitrogen and phosphorous. Moreover, different kinds of N and P sources were used in order to stimulate oil biodearadation under laboratory and field conditions, but the results were conflicting. To evaluate the effectiveness of nutrient supplementation, N sources (NO3-N and NH4-N) and P sources (PO4-P) were applied to the simulated diesel-polluted seawater in the N/P ratio of 10:1 and 20:1, respectively. The results showed that the addition of nutrients increased the oil biodegradation rate and the counts of petroleum degrading bacteria (PDB) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB). A strongly positive correlation existed (the interrelated coefficient was nearly 0.9) between the percentage ratio of PDB/HB and the oil biodegradation rates, and therefore the percentage ratio of PDB/HB could be used as a good indicator to predict oil biodegradation. Among the four samples treated with nutrients, the biodegradation efficiency of the group amended with NO3-N and PO4-P in the ratio of 10:1 (10NO(3)-P group) was as much as 75.8 %. while in the 10NH(4)-P, 20NO(3)-P and 20NH(4)-P groups this value was 61.3 %, 52.4 % and 40.5, respectively. It would take natural degradation without nutrient supplementation about 78 days to achieve the result obtained within 14 days with 10NO(3)-P amendment. Chemical and microbiological analyses confirmed that the addition of nutrients in the same N/P ratio remarkably enhanced the biodegradation rate and the counts of microorganisms in the NO3-N treated groups, indicating that the microorganisms tend to utilize NO3-N rather than NH4-N as their growth N source. When the same kind of N source was added to the system, the promoted efficiency in the 10:1 (N/P ratio) groups was notable compared to the 20:1 groups, i.e., adding nutrients in the ratio of 10:1 is superior in the stimulation of oil biodegradation to the ratio of 20:1.

AB  - Antioxidative efficiency of extracts of rosemary, green tea, coffee and grape skin in precooked pork patties was investigated during storage under retail conditions (10 days, 4 degreesC, atmospheric air), using descriptive sensory profiling following reheating and quantitative measurements of hexanal, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and vitamin E as indicators of lipid oxidation. The initial oxidative status of pork patties (evaluated by ANOVA) showed a significant lower level of secondary oxidation products and higher levels of vitamin E in patties with extracts incorporated, indicating that the extracts retarded lipid oxidation during processing of the meat. Data analysis for the storage study was based on qualitative overview of sensory/chemical variation by principal component analysis (PCA) and quantitative ANOVA-PLSR for determination of the relationship between design variables (days of chill-storage, extract treatment) versus sensory-chemical variables and PLSR for elucidating the predictive ability of the chemical methods for sensory terms. Lipid oxidation was seen to involve a decrease in perception of meat flavour/odour and a concomitant increase in the off-flavour/odours linseed, rancid. TBARS, hexanal and vitamin E were all significant predictive indices (P < 0.05) for the majority of the sensory terms, while vitamin E through negative correlation with TBARS and hexanal displayed its antioxidative effect and thus, its ability to preserve sensory fresh meat flavour/odour. The effect of the various extracts incorporated in the product was clearly related to the degree of lipid oxidation and an overall ranking of the antioxidative efficiency of extracts in declining order became apparent: Rosemary > Grape skin > Tea > Coffee > Reference. Furthermore, the relation between extracts and vitamin E indicated that the extracts, to some extent, interacted with the vitamin and prevented it from degrading. In conclusion, the rosemary extract displayed potential for maintaining sensory eating quality in processed pork products. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Relic carbonate deposits along the western margin of India occur as dolomite crusts, aragonite sands (pelletal / oolitic) and aragonite-cemented limestones, oyster shells, corals, encrusted coralline algal and foraminiferal-dominated nodules. The petrology and mineralogy of the deposits indicate that except for aragonite sands and foraminiferal nodules, the others were formed in shallow marine conditions and serve as sea level indicators. Radiocarbon dates were measured for 62 relic deposits covering the entire margin. The age of these deposits on the continental shelf off Cape Comorin and Mangalore, between 110 and 18 m depth, ranges between 12, 610 C-14 yr BP and 6,390 C-14 yr BP. On the northwestern margin of India, especially on the carbonate platform (between 64 and 100 m), the age ranges from 17,250 to 6,730 C-14 yr BP. The relic deposits of the Gulf of Kachchh at depths between 35 and 25 m are dated at 12,550 - 9,630 C-14 yr BP. The age vs. depth plot of the relic deposits further indicates that the Gulf of Kachchh was inundated much early, atleast by 15 ka, after the Last Glacial Maximum, and was subjected to uplift and subsidence during the Holocene. The carbonate platform subsided during the early Holocene. Some of the relic deposits between Cape Comorin and Mangalore plot on or, closely follow the glacio-eustatic sea level curve. Despite abundant siliciclastic flux discharged by the Narmada and Tapti during the early Holocene, the platform off these rivers is largely devoid of this flux and carbonate sedimentation continued until 6,700 C-14 yr BR We suggest that the river-derived sediment flux diverted southwards under the influence of the SW monsoon current and, thereby, increased the turbidity on the shelf and slope southeast of the carbonate platform and facilitated the formation of deeper water foraminiferal nodules off Vengurla-Goa.

AB  - The ability to tolerate hypoxia in some haplochromine cichlid fishes contributes to the richness of habitats occupied by the lineage and may be important in interlacustrine dispersal through swampy channels. Lacustrine members of the genus Astatotilapia tend to be ecologically plastic but are rarely encountered in the interior of dense swamps. A notable exception is seen in the swamp corridor that joins Lake Kabaleka with Lake George, Uganda, where one species (Astatotilapia 'wrought-iron') is abundant, and a second species, A. aeneocolor, is rare. Both species are abundant in the open waters of the main lake. In this paper, we compare physiological (oxygen consumption) and behavioral indicators of hypoxia tolerance between A. 'wrought-iron' from swamp and open-water habitats and between the two species of Astatotilapia. When exposed to progressive hypoxia, all fish used aquatic surface respiration (ASR); however, swamp-dwelling A. 'wrought-iron' showed lower gill ventilation rates prior to the initiation of ASR, higher pre-ASR aggression rates, higher swimming speed during ASR, and a higher rate of bubble exchange than both the open-water group of A. 'wrought-iron' and A. aeneocolor. These differences may reflect interpopulational variation in selection pressure for low-oxygen tolerance between swamp and open-water habitats. Several lines of evidence suggest that A. 'wrought-iron' was in general more hypoxia tolerant than A. aeneocolor. These include a lower ASR(9)0 threshold, a drop in gill ventilation rate with the onset of ASR, and lower rate of equilibrium loss under extreme hypoxia in A. 'wrought-iron'. The routine metabolic rate and critical oxygen tension did not differ between swamp-dwelling and open-water A. 'wrought-iron', or between A. 'wrought-iron' and A. aeneocolor. Comparative data on the ASR thresholds and critical oxygen tensions of the Astatotilapia species from Lake Kabaleka and other East African cichlids suggest intermediate hypoxia tolerance. Nevertheless, our study suggests that some generalized lacustrine haplochromines may 'leak' through swamp corridors even under relatively extreme conditions.

AB  - Objective To obtain information on tick paralysis in dogs, including the nature of disease, host signalment, tick-host relationship, treatment, disease progression and recovery, and preventive measures.
   Design A prospective survey of 577 dogs affected by tick paralysis was conducted during 1998. Forty-two veterinary clinics along the eastern coast of Australia were instructed to complete survey forms for the first 15 dogs that presented with tick paralysis during September to November.
   Results Five percent of dogs died from tick paralysis. Younger dogs were more likely to survive. Long coat length was associated with a greater tick burden but not greater tick size, whereas coat thickness had no bearing on either. Dogs with mild disease recovered more quickly from tick paralysis. Respiratory and gait scores reflected disease severity and were good prognostic indicators. The size of the tick did not reflect the severity of the clinical condition it induced in the host. No method of tick removal or in situ treatment improved recovery time or reduced mortality. However, the time spent in hospital was significantly less for dogs from which the live tick was manually removed. Inspiratory strider. evident in some dogs with tick paralysis, was not related to tick attachment on the neck. The use of acepromazine maleate or dexamethasone did not reduce recovery time or mortality. Increasing the dose of tick antitoxin serum (TAS) above 0.1 mL/kg had no effect on mortality or recovery time. Dogs with severe disease that received an additional dose of TAS were significantly less likely to survive. Subcutaneous use of TAS at the site of tick attachment was of no benefit in reducing mortality or time to initial clinical improvement. A registered preventative product had not been used on the majority of dogs. Clipping the coat to search for ticks did not reduce mortality.
   Conclusions Therapy needs to address cardiopulmonary dysfunction that may be due directly to the effect of tick toxin and not just respiratory compromise caused by progressive respiratory muscle failure.

AB  - Initial research revealed interaction effects on health measures between exposure to neurotoxicants and age. Symptom reports of workers were conspicuously increased if high-concentration occupational exposure (e.g. to organic solvents, lead) was combined with age above 54 years. The symptom increase in elderly workers was interpreted as a possible indicator of a biological vulnerable phase or delayed response of former high exposure. A second study of the hypothesized age-exposure interaction was performed with a group of workers who had homogenous exposure to a single organic solvent using a neurobehavioral performance evaluation (the EURO-NES). Workers in the rotogravure printing industry who were exposed to toluene were examined two times with an interval of one year (n =333/278), The sample was stratified by workers with significantly different toluene exposure, printers and end-processing operators, and four age classes (< 31, 31-40, 41-50, >50). The mean lifetime weighted average exposure (LWAE) varied depending on age classes and years of employment with exposure between 7 and 17 ppm in the operators and between 35 to 62 ppm toluene in the printers. Multivariate analyses revealed a significant performance decrease with age (simple reaction time, symbol digit, switching attention, digit span). Again an interaction between age and exposure was found depending on diverging psychometric performance trends with older age. However, contrary to the hypothesis the group with higher exposures (printers) and older age revealed better performance and less symptoms than the group with lower exposure (end-processing operators). The paradoxical results are explained by differences in the intellectual capability in the oldest strata and a possible reversibility of neurobehavioral effects of former high toluene exposure under the condition of later low exposure. There are no hints of adverse delayed effects of former toluene exposure in a possible vulnerable phase in age over 50 years. The different interaction findings of the initial and present study seem to depend mainly on exposure differences in quality and quantity. (C) 2000 Inter Press, Inc.

AB  - 1. Root infection by symbiotic N-2-fixing Frankia and Rhizobium strains was quantified in relation to light and soil properties for seedlings of 12 woody species from a subtropical savanna in southern Texas, USA.
   2. None of four rhamnaceous species nodulated, despite the fact that bioassays with a known actinorhizal species yielded 13 nodules per seedling. Celtis pallida (Ulmaceae), Acacia greggii and Acacia berlandieri (Leguminosae) also failed to nodulate even though field populations of these species were characterized by high (2.7-4.2%) foliar nitrogen concentration.
   3. Infective rhizobia occurred in all soils studied regardless of soil depth, distance from a host plant or type of plant cover. Plant growth in N-free media and acetylene reduction activity suggested that all nodules were capable of N-2-fixation.
   4. The extent of nodulation varied by species. However, nodulated seedlings were taller, produced more biomass and allocated less biomass to root systems than their non-nodulated counterparts.
   5. Numbers of nodules on seedlings of Prosopis glandulosa, the dominant woody species in this subtropical savanna and throughout the south-western USA, were reduced by low light (15% full sunlight) regardless of soil N level; at medium and full sunlight nodule biomass expressed as a fraction of whole plant biomass decreased with increasing soil N. Nodulation of held-grown P. glandulosa appears to be ephemeral, apparently varying with changes in soil moisture.
   6. Nodulation and N-2 fixation among woody legumes in subtropical savannas can occur across a broad range of soil conditions and depths with significant impacts on local and regional N-cycles.
   7. Field levels of foliar N in species that failed to nodulate in the laboratory were comparable to or greater than those in species capable of nodulation, suggesting that leaf N is not a reliable indicator of N-2 fixation.

AB  - Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick. grown 24 h either in air or 1% CO2 was treated with Pb in concentrations 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 in growing solution and time of exposure 24, 48 and 72 h. The following measurements were carried out: 1. Rate of photosynthetic O-2 evolution (Pn) under saturating irradiance and dark respiratory O-2 uptake (DR), 2. Content of chlorophyll, 3. Growth as total cell count. It has been found that Pb severely inhibited Pn. The magnitudes of inhibition increased with increasing of Pb concentration and time of exposure. Pn of air-grown cells which possessed a dissolved inorganic carbon ''pump'' (DIC ''pump'') was more susceptible to Pb than 1% CO2-grown cells which lacked DIC ''pump.'' The similar pattern of inhibition was observed for biosynthesis of chlorophyll, but the magnitudes of inhibition were smaller. Growth of 1% CO2-grown cells was inhibited strongly as compared with low CO2-grown algae but these differences in inhibition disappeared after 72 h. The toxicity of Pb in order of increasing inhibition was to: Growth > biosynthesis of chlorophyll > photosynthesis. Conversely to inhibitory action of Pb on processes mentioned above, this heavy metal significantly stimulated DR. Stimulation was stronger in air-grown cells. With increasing ph concentrations ratios of DR/Pn increased from about 0.1 to about 0.3-0.4. The results demonstrate that C. pyrenoidosa is able of substantial growth over range of Pb in growing solution from 0.0-2.0 mM. It is proposed that DR play a protective role against toxicity of Pb to algal metabolism and growth. Stimulated DR is explained as an adaptive response of algal population to toxicant, by which respiratory derived ATP and reducing equivalent is used to carry out cell synthesis under conditions of reduced photosynthesis. The measurements of Pn of Chlorella can serves as an early indicator of environmental pollution and represents a good model for heavy metals toxicity investigations.

AB  - In the development of measurement facilities, taking into account the diversity of signals and factors influencing error, the selection of a method of discrete wavelet filtering of measurement signals is a timely issue. Results are given of the development of an algorithm for the selection of a method of discrete wavelet filtering, taking into account the nature of the measurement signal. The three most widespread methods of discrete wavelet filtering were studied, with subsequent comparative analysis for twenty types of measurement signals. The following methods of wavelet filtering were analyzed: with a common threshold for all levels of decomposition; without a threshold, with simple resetting to zero of the detail coefficients until reaching the minimum rms error of filtering of measurement signals; and a universal threshold for detail coefficients at each level of decomposition. The measurement signals were studied for twenty types from the PyWavelets library, to which in addition, uncorrelated normally distributed noise with zero mean and specified standard deviation is added. The criteria for comparing methods were determined for noisy signals before filtering, and for the filtered signals. The signal-to-noise ratio, the difference of entropy errors, the rms error of filtering, and the function of the measurement signal were used as the criteria. For each method of filtering, the criteria for comparison were determined from the condition of the minimum rms error introduced by noise to the measurement signal of the given type. Both the energy and the informational characteristics of the signal were considered for selection of a method. A cyclical search determined the filtering parameters for reaching the minimum rms error of filtering. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to determine the most effective methods of discrete wavelet filtering, depending on the nature of the measurement signal. In this, the designer solves two problems at the same time: selection of the filtering method and determination of the filtering parameters.

AB  - Juniperus excelsa is one of the most common tree species and has a wide geographical and altitudinal distribution in Turkey. It is also resistant to drought and frost damages and can cope with poor soils. In this study, we explore whether there are any differences among eight J. excelsa populations from a narrow geographic region grown in a common garden test site in terms of growth and contents of photosynthetic pigments, proline and nutrients of their 10-year-old saplings. Phenotypic trait differentiation (QST) at all traits, FST at neutral SSRs among six of the populations and associations of traits with environmental conditions at provenance regions were also analysed to test for pat-terns of local adaptation. Sapling traits of eight J. excelsa populations of from Lakes District in Turkey at the test site showed that populations significantly differed for growth, photosynthetic pigments, proline and nutrient contents. The mean height and diameter of 10-year-old saplings were found as 94.5 cm and 41.6 mm, respectively. Egirdir-Barla and Sutculer-Tota populations showed the highest performance for the majority of traits at age 10 compared to all other populations. Nutrient contents in leaves were generally in the suffi-ciency range reported for plant growth. Considering photosynthetic pigments and proline, it could be concluded that the populations were not exposed to severe stress. Among the environmental variables, the best predictors of growth were annual mean minimum temperature and soil texture at the popu-lations' origin, accounting for 49% of the variation in height and diameter, respectively. Also, higher phenotypic trait differentiation for most traits than genetic differentiation at neutral genetic markers suggests local adaptation at a small geographic scale. The present study revealed adaptive divergence be-tween populations at a small geographic scale. However, environmental similarity between region of origin and test site was not a good indicator of growth-related traits. The results can be used in the early selection of provenances for J. excelsa for plantation establishment.

AB  - Loranthus europaeus is one of the major plant parasites threatening the fragile ecosystems of oak forests in western Iran. The mistletoe is a hemi-parasite plant which grows on forest species, especially oaks. Carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) has been central to understand the behaviour of mistletoes in the field. This study investigated C and N isotope compositions in leaves of L. europaeus and of its host oaks (Quercus libani, Q. infectoria and Q. brantii) in western Iran. The goal was to assess the degree of heterotrophy, and to estimate the carbon partition between host and mistletoe and possible consequences of this phenomenon for the ecology of these hemiparasites. Leaf samples from mistletoe and host oaks were collected in the Mirabad forests of Sardasht, Iran. Ten adult trees of each oak species, with the hemiparasite species, were sampled for determination of leaf dry weight and area, concentration in carbon and nitrogen, and contents of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. In all three species, we found that the levels of delta C-13 of the host, were higher than those of the mistletoes. Quercus infectoria, with the highest leaf mass per area and the highest carbon and nitrogen contents on a mass basis, was the oak species with the highest degree of mistletoe heterotrophy, which was negatively related with the hostmistletoe delta C-13 difference. Our results also showed that host and mistletoe leaf masses per area can be indicators of the heterotrophic degree of the mistletoe and an easy alternative to the determination of delta C-13. In conclusion, it seems that the difference in delta C-13 between host and mistletoe is reduced when the host leaf mass per area, C-mass and N-mass increase. This condition relates to an increased heterotrophic degree of mistletoe.

AB  - Soil formation is influenced mainly by lithology, climate, organic matter, vegetation, topography, and time. Soil-forming processes have been well studied in temperate regions. However, there is little data on such processes in the tropics. In this work, we have studied the environmental magnetic properties of lateritic soils developed on gneiss and charnockite. We sampled surficial soils from different environmental settings (urban, agricultural, pristine, and gleyed) to determine the processes involved in their formation. A range of environmental magnetic parameters and inter-parametric ratios were investigated to determine the magnetic concentration, grain-size and mineralogy of the soil samples. Redness rating (RR) index was also calculated to estimate the reddening of tropical soils and to examine its relationship with magnetic properties. The pristine soils exhibit the highest average value for chi(lf) and a higher value of chi(fd%), indicating a greater amount of ultra-fine magnetic minerals. The gleyed and agricultural soils are weakly magnetic, probably be due to waterlogging, and are characterized by a coarser magnetic grain size. A high proportion of "soft" ferrimagnetic minerals like magnetite and titanomagnetite is present in the samples (average S-ratio similar to 0.90). Hematite content is the highest in unburnt soils and the least in gleyed soils (unburnt > burnt > pristine > urban > agricultural > gleyed). The high concentration of hematite in these soils could be due to transformation of maghemite, resulting from low-temperature oxidation of magnetite. We documented a distinction between the magnetic properties of burnt and unburnt soil types as fire can significantly enhance the magnetic values of unburnt soils. The concentration of hematite (indicated by HIRM) and redness rating (RR) index are fairly well correlated for all the sample types with the exception of urban (r = 0.51; p = 0.11; n = 11) and unburnt soils (r = 0.60; p = 0.28; n = 5), which show a strong correlation. Therefore, RR index can be effectively used as an indicator of reddening of tropical soils due to pedogenesis. This study demonstrates that environmental magnetism can aid in differentiating the diverse environments of soils even though they developed on a similar rock type and under similar climatic conditions.

AB  - The guidance document on risk assessment for birds and mammals (GD) provides generic residue values of pesticides on potential diet items for use in wildlife risk assessments. For most diet items, these values are based on a large number of residue studies. However, the default residues per unit dose (RUD; standardized for application of 1 kg substance per hectare) values for fruits were taken from a few literature trials of unclear relevance for regulatory purposes. These trials were conducted according to neither current European Union (EU) agricultural practice nor to recommendations given in the GD about how to conduct wildlife-relevant residue studies. Therefore, field study data on fruit residue levels from applications of pesticides in fruiting crops were compiled and evaluated. Corresponding studies had been conducted during the last 26 y in the EU. In the final data set, 291 studies provided 1002 residue values in different fruits, including grapes, berries (currants, raspberries, gooseberries), fruits from orchards (apple, peach, pear, lemon, mandarin, orange, apricot, cherry, plum), gourds (pumpkins, cucumbers, squash, melons), and strawberries. This data set provides a basis for revising registration-relevant RUD values for fruits as potential diet items for birds and mammals in environmental wildlife risk assessments. The objective of this study was to estimate the resulting residue levels in different fruits determined under field conditions following the application of pesticides across their growing areas within the EU in diverse climatic areas that can be used directly in wildlife risk assessments. The large data set of usually about more than 100 residue values per "fruit group," all evaluated at EU member state level, revealed significantly lower RUDs compared to the current default RUDs presented in the GD. These new RUD values for fruits should be considered for use as default values in future bird and mammal risk assessments and in respective guidance documents.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-10.

AB  - Maize (Zea maysL.) is one of the most versatile crops and can be grown in diverse environmental conditions and has diversified uses as human food and animal feed. Maize grains cannot be considered only as a source of energy, as they provide significant amounts of protein as well. It is also recognized that maize grains have low micronutrient concentrations, particularly Zinc. Zn(2+)is an essential nutrient that has particular physiological functions in all living systems, such as the maintenance of structural and function of protein synthesis, gene expression, enzymes structure, energy production, krebs cycle, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, auxin metabolism, pollen formation, and resistance to infection by certain pathogen, also has a positive impact on crop yield. Therefore, crops qualitative and quantitative yield is strongly dependent on Zinc in the soil. Zinc deficiency is a problem, in almost all the crops and calcareous soils, intensively cropped soils, paddy soils and poorly drained soils, sodic soils and saline soils, peat soils, soils with high available phosphorus and silicon, sandy soils, highly weathered acid, and coarse textured soils. Phosphorus and copper have an antagonistic impact on Zinc. Zinc deficiency can affect plant by stunting its growth, decreasing crop maturity period, spikelet sterility, and inferior quality of harvest products. Maize is known as an indicator plant for the evaluation of Zn deficiency of a soil. The magnitude of zinc deficiency varies widely among soil types with reduction in crop yield and quality to the tune of 25-35% and in turn questions the nutritional security of human beings in developing countries like India, where cereals are the staple food. Despite high yield potential of maize, it gives low yields and low micronutrient content because of improper fertilizer management practices. Increasing productivity per unit area through proper management is one of the important strategies to increase the production of maize as well as micronutrient enrichment in grains. Understanding the distribution of zinc (Zn) in soils is important for effective and efficient management of the fertilizer resources.

AB  - Lake Victoria, regionally important both as a source of food and income, is under pressure due to overfishing and severe pollution. Currently, the vast majority of east African aquaculture is open-pond based. The adoption of modern and sustainable aquaculture technologies and practices-in this case study recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS)-will help the region increase food security and decrease its current reliance on imported fish and stressed wild stock. To this end, VicInAqua, a project under the EU Horizon 2020 program, has developed a pilot Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) hatchery in Kisumu, Kenya using RAS adapted to local conditions. The hatchery is designed as a flexible, scalable, and modular system. An online monitoring system enables farmers to access farm data from both fish tanks and the supporting renewable energy systems, allowing around-the-clock monitoring and control. The hatchery is linked to a 14.3 kWp Photovoltaic (PV) system, including a 30 kWh Li-battery storage, to supply sustainable electricity. The water for the RAS, treated by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and certified for use in aquaculture and agriculture, comes chiefly from Kisumu's municipal sewage, which reduces the farms' reliance on an expensive and occasionally intermittent potable water supply. Combining these technologies represents an industry first and offers a working example for larger-scale future developments. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the possible technologies and practices in situ as well as provide a template for future development and investment. The hatchery is used by the Department of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, Kisumu County, Kenya, as a training and demonstration facility to promote the aquaculture sector and increase the awareness, knowledge, and skills of fish farmers, as well as provide high quality fingerlings to cage farmers within the lake.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-8.

AB  - Simple Summary Currently, due to intensive production, pigs are weaned early, which generates stress due to separation from the sow, metabolic disorders, and decreased productive performance. Thus, sub-therapeutic antibiotics have been used to alleviate these detrimental effects; however, it has been shown that these practices create microbial resistance and cross-resistance to other microorganisms. Although the European Union banned antibiotic growth promoters (AGP), many countries in the world still use them widely. In the present study, oral administration ofLactobacillus plantarumCAM6 in weaned pigs improved productive performance from the second experimental week and increased total serum levels of IgA without causing adverse effects on health indicators and acid-base balance. These results suggest this probiotic bacterium can be used as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pigs. The objective was to evaluate the effect of oral administration ofLactobacillusplantarumCAM6 strain as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pigs on productive parameters, blood biochemical profile, and IgA serum levels. Thirty-six 21-day-old weaned piglets were randomly assigned to three groups with three replicates of four piglets each. Treatments consisted of a basal diet (BD; T0) without probiotics or antibiotics; BD + antibiotics and the same basal diet used in T0 plus oral administration of 5 mL x 10(9)CFU/mL ofL. plantarumCAM-6 (T2). During the study (21 to 49 days of age) T2 obtained a similar live weight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio when compared to the T1. Both treatments were better in these variables compared to T0 (p <= 0.05). Furthermore, T2 increased serum IgA levels (p <= 0.05). Additionally, hematological parameters and acid-base balance remained similar in all groups. However, significant reductions in the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelets, and metabolic hydrogen ions were observed in T1 (p <= 0.05). The results of this study suggest that supplementation withL. plantarumCAM6 can be an alternative to antibiotics. Studies to evaluate its efficacy under commercial conditions and water administration require further evaluation.

AB  - Biocatalysis has emerged as an important tool in synthetic organic chemistry enabling the chemical industry to execute reactions with high regio- or enantioselectivity and under usually mild reaction conditions while avoiding toxic waste. Target substrates and products of reactions catalyzed by carboxylic ester hydrolases are often poorly water soluble and require organic solvents, whereas enzymes are evolved by nature to be active in cells, i.e., in aqueous rather than organic solvents. Therefore, biocatalysts that withstand organic solvents are urgently needed. Current strategies to identify such enzymes rely on laborious tests carried out by incubation in different organic solvents and determination of residual activity. Here, we describe a simple assay useful for screening large libraries of carboxylic ester hydrolases for resistance and activity in water-miscible organic solvents. We have screened a set of 26 enzymes, most of them identified in this study, with four different water-miscible organic solvents. The triglyceride tributyrin was used as a substrate, and fatty acids released by enzymatic hydrolysis were detected by a pH shift indicated by the indicator dye nitrazine yellow. With this strategy, we succeeded in identifying a novel highly organic-solvent-tolerant esterase from Pseudomonas aestusnigri. In addition, the newly identified enzymes were tested with sterically demanding substrates, which are common in pharmaceutical intermediates, and two enzymes from Alcanivorax borkumensis were identified which outcompeted the gold standard ester hydrolase CalB from Candida antarctica.
   IMPORTANCE Major challenges hampering biotechnological applications of esterases include the requirement to accept nonnatural and chemically demanding substrates and the tolerance of the enzymes toward organic solvents which are often required to solubilize such substrates. We describe here a high-throughput screening strategy to identify novel organic-solvent-tolerant carboxylic ester hydrolases (CEs). Among these enzymes, CEs active against water-insoluble bulky substrates were identified. Our results thus contribute to fostering the identification and biotechnological application of CEs.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a promising way to enhance fish welfare in aquaculture. However, the observed effects of enrichment on fish growth, behavior and physiology vary widely among studies, and few studies have focused on the quantification of enrichment. The present study aimed to investigate whether enrichment type and level significantly affect the growth performance, aggressive behavior, cortisol level and brain monoaminergic activities of juveniles of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii. Juveniles were reared for eight weeks under different combinations of enrichment type and enrichment level: no environmental enrichment (C), low-level plant enrichment (PL), medium-level plant enrichment (PM), high-level plant enrichment (PH), low-level structure enrichment (SL), medium-level structure enrichment (SM) and high-level structure enrichment (SH). Subsequently, behavioral and physiological parameters were determined. In general, the growth performance, feed intake and food conversion efficiency of C, PM, PH and SL fish were relatively higher than those of fish from the other treatments. Low-level plant treatment produced the highest levels of aggressive behavior, cortisol and brain serotonergic system activity, whereas the medium- and high-level structure treatments yielded the lowest levels of these stress-related behavioral and physiological indicators. C fish had significantly higher stress levels than PM, PH and SL fish. No significant difference among treatments was observed in the condition factor, coefficient of weight variation, locomotor activity, growth hormone level or brain dopaminergic system activity. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence to show that the type and level of environmental enrichment have interaction effects on fish growth performance, behavioral phenotype (especially aggressive behavior) and stress-related physiological processes. Since the control fish had significantly higher stress levels than the fish exposed to medium- and high-level plant enrichment and low-level structure enrichment, we suggest that enriching approximately 50% basal area coverage with objects might be optimal for enhancing fish welfare. Moreover, a possible conceptual model is presented to interpret the effects of enrichment on fish welfare.

AB  - The shelter environment may have a severe impact on the dogs' quality of life, and there is thus a need to develop valid tools to assess their welfare. These tools should be sensitive not only to the animals' physical health but also to their mental health, including the assessment of positive and negative emotions. Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) is a 'whole animal' measure that captures the expressive quality of an animal's demeanour, using descriptive terms such as 'relaxed', 'anxious', and 'playful'. In this study, for the first time, we developed and tested a fixed-list of qualitative QBA terms for application to kennelled dogs. A list of 20 QBA terms was developed based on literature search and an expert opinion survey. Inter-observer reliability was investigated by asking 11 observers to use these terms to score 13 video clips of kennelled dogs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract four main dimensions explaining 70.9% of the total variation between clips. PC1 characterised curious/playful/excitable/sociable demeanour, PC2 ranged from comfortable/relaxed to anxious/nervous/ stressed expression, PC3 described fearful demeanour, and PC4 characterised bored/depressed demeanour. Observers' agreement on the ranking of video clips on these four expressive dimensions was good (Kendall's W: 0.60-0.80). ANOVA showed a significant effect of observer on mean clip score on all PCs (p<0.05), due to few observers scoring differently from the rest of the group. Results indicate the potential of the proposed list of QBA terms for sheltered dogs to serve, in alignment with other measures, as a non-invasive assessment tool. However, the observer effect on mean PC scores points towards the need for adequate observer training, particularly in live scoring conditions. The QBA scoring tool can be integrated with existing welfare assessment protocols for shelter dogs and strengthen the power of those protocols to evaluate the animals' experience in shelters.

AB  - In the context of globalisation of tourism markets and increasing competition, there is a need of continuous improvement of the tourism product quality. This problem became especially urgent after the entry into force of the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement. This article deals with the theoretical, methodological and practical problems of assessing the quality of the tourism product of regional tour operators in Ukraine. The main attention is paid to the analysis of the quality of the tourism product standard components having latent features. To study the quality of the service components form a tourism product by their latent features, the authors used the methodology of taxonomic analysis, which combines a number of statistical methods of comparison on multivariate objects, structural units, which are determined by a set of values of several features. The analysis of the tourism product quality was carried out on the example of ten tour operators in Odessa Region, Ukraine, providing services on the bus tour Odessa -Chernivtsi - Khotyn - Kamianets-Podslsky - Ternopil-Odessa under standard conditions. Based on the tourism product structuring, seven assessment indicators for the level of the tourism product quality were determined. Upon the calculation of distances to the reference object and the taxonomic index values, tourism enterprises were ranked by the quality of their tourism product in the competitive segment of the market and reserves for improving the tourism product quality by its components were determined. The authors determined that the method of combined taxonomy allows comparing the quality of one-type standard tourism products of Ukrainian tour operators dealing in the same market segment. The experience of experimental verifying the proposed approach to the assessment of the tourism product quality levels shows that the technique under consideration can complement the modern tools for measuring the tour operators' service quality. The results can be useful in practice to improve the research of comparative evaluation of the tour operators' tourism product quality by latent characteristics in a competitive environment.

AB  - A probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) was performed to evaluate the range of potential baseline and postremedy health risks to fish consumers at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the Site). The analysis focused on risks of consuming fish resident to the Site containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), given that this exposure scenario and contaminant are the primary basis for US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) selected remedy per the January 2017 Record of Decision (ROD). The PRA used probability distributions fit to the same data sets used in the deterministic baseline human health risk assessment (BHHRA) as well as recent sediment and fish tissue data to evaluate the range and likelihood of current baseline cancer risks and noncancer hazards for anglers. Areas of elevated PCBs in sediment were identified on the basis of a geospatial evaluation of the surface sediment data, and the ranges of risks and hazards associated with pre- and postremedy conditions were calculated. The analysis showed that less active remediation (targeted to areas with the highest concentrations) compared to the remedial alternative selected by USEPA in the ROD can achieve USEPA's interim risk management benchmarks (cancer risk of 10(-4) and noncancer hazard index [HI] of 10) immediately postremediation for the vast majority of subsistence anglers that consume smallmouth bass (SMB) fillet tissue. In addition, the same targeted remedy achieves USEPA's long-term benchmarks (10(-5) and HI of 1) for the majority of recreational anglers. Additional sediment remediation would result in negligible additional risk reduction due to the influence of background. The PRA approach applied here provides a simple but adaptive framework for analysis of risks and remedial options focused on variability in exposures. It can be updated and refined with new data to evaluate and reduce uncertainty, improve understanding of the Site and target populations, and foster informed remedial decision making.

AB  - Periodic assessments of population trends and changes in spatial distribution are valuable for managing marine birds and their breeding habitats, particularly when evaluating long-term response to threats such as oil spills, predation pressure. and changing ocean conditions. We evaluated recent trends in abundance and distribution of the Common Murre Uria aalge within Copalis, Quillayute Needles, and Flattery Rocks National Wildlife Refuges, which include all murre colonies in Washington except one, off-refuge, on Tatoosh Island. In 1996-2001 and 2010-2015, aerial photographic surveys were conducted during the incubation phase (mid-June through mid-July) each year. Using images from film (1996-2001) and digital (2010-2015) cameras that included all parts of each colony, we manually counted murres. We estimated population trend as annual percent change in whole-colony counts using an overdispersed Poisson regression model. Overall, numbers of murres counted at breeding colonies in Washington increased by 8.8% per year (95% CI 3.0%-14.9%) during 1996-2015. The overall statewide increase was driven by an increase at colonies in northern Washington of approximately 11% per year (95% CI 4.5%-17.8%). Despite an increasing trend, abundance remains lower than levels in the late 1970s, and the spatial distribution has changed. Colonies in southern Washington - where murres were historically the most abundant - are no longer active, or only minimally so. whereas colonies in the north - which were rarely active in the early 1970s - are now the largest. There was high variability in spatial distribution among years, a pattern that indicates a need for coordinated monitoring and movement studies throughout the California Current System to understand dispersal and colonization. Our results indicate that future management of refuge islands could protect both current and historic colony locations, given the patterns of colony dynamics and the uncertainty about long-term effects of a changing ocean ecosystem and predation pressure on the status of murres.

AB  - Deteriorated aerobic response to moderate exercise might precede the manifestation of clinical symptoms of non-communicable diseases. The purpose of the current study was to verify that the use of current wearable technologies for analysis of pulmonary oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2)) dynamics during a pseudorandom ternary sequence (PRTS) over-ground walking protocol is a suitable procedure for the investigation of the aerobic response in more realistic settings. A wearable accelerometer located at the hip assessed the magnitude of the input changes delivered to the aerobic system. Eight adults (24 +/- 4 yr old, 174 +/- 7 cm, and 71.4 +/- 7.4 kg) performed two identical PRTS over-ground walking protocols. In addition, they performed on the cycle ergometer two identical pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) protocols and one incremental protocol for maximal ((V) over dotO(2)) determination. In the frequency domain, mean normalized gain amplitude (MNG in %) quantified ((V) over dotO(2)) dynamics. The MNG during PRTS was correlated (r = -0.80, P = 0.01) with the ((V) over dotO(2)) time constant (tau) obtained during cycling. The MNG estimated during PRBS was similar to the MNG estimated during PRTS (r = 0.80, P = 0.01). The maximal ((V) over dotO(2)) correlated with the MNG obtained during the PRBS (r = 0.79, P = 0.01) and PRTS (r = 0.78, P = 0.02) protocols. In conclusion, PRTS over-ground walking protocol can be used to evaluate the aerobic system dynamics by the simultaneous measurement of ((V) over dotO(2)) and hip acceleration. In addition, the aerobic response dynamics from PRBS and PRTS were correlated to maximal ((V) over dotO(2)). This study has shown that wearable technologies in combination with assessment of MNG, a novel indicator of system dynamics, open new possibilities to monitor cardiorespiratory health under conditions that better simulate activities of daily living than cardiopulmonary exercise testing performed in a medical environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of a wide battery of biomarkers in two native species, the freshwater shrimp Palaemonetes argentinus and the macrophyte Potamogeton pusillus, experimentally exposed to zinc in order to establish the potential use of selected species as bioindicators of aquatic pollution. For this purpose, we propose the use of integrated biomarker index (IBR) with a previous selection of biomarkers using boosted regression trees (BRTs) as a new tool in ecotoxicology. Organisms were collected from a reference site, acclimated and exposed at relevant environmental zinc levels (control, 5, 50 and 500 mu g Zn L-1) for 96 h. Biomarkers were measured in cephalothorax and abdomen of shrimp as well as in leaf, stem and root of plants.
   Significant zinc accumulation was observed in cephalothorax of P. argentinus from 50 mu g Zn L-1 and from 5 mu g Zn L-1 in stem and root of P. pusillus, when compared with control condition. Those effect biomarkers with significant differences among treatments were pre-selected to run out the BRTs model for each species. InP. argentinus, microsomal acetylcholinesterase activity, metallothioneins and superoxide dismutase activity measured in cephalothorax, as well as glutathione reductase activity in abdomen, showed the higher capacity to explain or predict the zinc exposure concentration. On the contrary, in P. pusillus, only chlorophyll a measured in leaf and H2O2 measured in root were the more representative of exposure concentrations, at least, within the biomarkers tested in the present study. Thereafter, IBR was calculated with the selected biomarkers in P. argentinus and showed in a sole value the organism stress, which also correlates with zinc exposure and accumulation.
   Natives species tested displayed a sensitive response to metal exposure, which represents an important characteristic for biomonitoring programs. Our findings suggest that the BRTs and IBR are useful and robust run tools to select the better biomarkers in toxicological studies and indicate the organism stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess and analyze the dynamic changes and current problems of Chinese forest resources based on the National Forest Inventory. (NFI). In this study, a hierarchical model was established using the analytic hierarchy process to assess forest resources quality (FRQ) at the provincial level. Four criteria were used, including forest quantity, forest productivity, forest structure, and forest health and each criterion was further composed of multiple factors. Among these assessment factors, stock volume per unit area was the most important, while canopy structure was the least important. The ranges of FRQ Indies across China during the 6th NFI (1999-2003), 7th NFI (2004-2008), and 8th NFI (2009-2013) were 0.3031-0.6366, 0.3499-0.7186, and 0.3534-0.7555, respectively. From the 6th to 8th NFI forest quality improved by different degrees for all provinces, whereas the other three criteria presented an increasing or decreasing trend. In general, the implementation of ecological projects has significantly improved the FRQ at provincial and national levels. During the 8th NFI the FRQ levels were excellent for 3 provinces, good for 15 provinces, medium for 12 provinces, and only one province exhibited an inferior level of FRQ. Based on cluster analysis, Chinese forest resources during the 8th NFI could be grouped into four clusters according to the provincial administrative region, and each cluster had its own advantages and disadvantages. Stock volume increment and forest calamity were in a very good state, while canopy structure was the key factor limiting the FQR for all the clusters. Some relevant measures were proposed to improve the existing conditions of Chinese forest resources. The results of this study are significant in that they can provide theoretical and technical references for future adjustment and sustainable management of forest resources in China.

AB  - In this report, we refer to pharmaceuticals that are widespread in the urban aquatic environment and that mainly originate from wastewater treatment plants or non-point source sewage as "wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals" (WWMPs). To some extent, they reflect the condition or trend of water contamination and also contribute to aquatic environmental risk assessment. The method reported here for screening typical WWMPs was proposed based on academic concerns about them and their concentrations present in the urban aquatic environment, as well as their properties of accumulation, persistence, eco-toxicity and related environmental risks caused by them. The screening system consisted of an initial screening system and a further screening system. In the former, pharmaceuticals were categorised into different evaluation levels, and in the latter, each pharmaceutical was given a normalised final evaluation score, which was the sum of every score for its properties of accumulation, persistence, eco-toxicity and environmental risk in the aquatic environment. The system was applied to 126 pharmaceuticals frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In the initial screening procedure, five pharmaceuticals were classified into the "high" category, 16 pharmaceuticals into the "medium" category, 15 pharmaceuticals into the "low" category and 90 pharmaceuticals into the "very low" category. Subsequently, further screening were conducted on 36 pharmaceuticals considered as being of "high", "medium" and "low" categories in the former system. We identified 7 pharmaceuticals with final evaluation scores of 1-10, 10 pharmaceuticals with scores of 11-15, 15 pharmaceuticals with scores from 16 to 20 and 4 pharmaceuticals with scores above 21. The results showed that this screening system could contribute to the effective selection of target WWMPs, which would be important for spatial-temporal dynamics, transference and pollution control of pharmaceuticals in the urban aquatic environment. However, there remains a number of pharmaceutical parameters with measured data gaps, such as organic carbon adsorption coefficients and bioconcentration factors, which, if filled, would improve the accuracy of the screening system.

AB  - Climate variability and weather extremes are principal sources of fluctuations of annual productivity of many crops in arid and semi-arid environments. Temperature and precipitation are the major weather variables that determine the variability of crop yields. In this study, the relationship between weather descriptors and major irrigated crops yield were assessed for Khorasan province in northeast of Iran. Long term daily weather (1984-2007) and crop yield (wheat, barley, sugarbeet, cotton, potato, chickpea, alfalfa) data were analyzed with simple correlation analysis and also the iterative chi-square analysis identified relationships of low and high wheat yield years to maximum and minimum air temperatures within each region. Our results indicated that association between various crop yield and descriptors varied in different study location. As in Bojnourd located in the north of Khorasan yields of the crops studied did not correlate with temperature indicators, whereas in Birjand the relationship between temperature descriptors and crop yields were strong. Correlation between growing season precipitation and wheat, barley, chickpea and sugarbeet yields was positive while cotton yield decreased with increasing precipitation during the growing season. The results of chi-square analysis for wheat yield demonstrated that the critical time in which extreme temperature led to yield loss differed among regions. In Bojnourd, in late April to early May, and excess days (high or low yield years have more days meeting a cardinal value than normal years) with maximum temperature higher than 30 degrees C, wheat yield decreased while in Birjand, cooler maximum temperature (<= 10 degrees C) and excess days with minimum temperature particularly lower than -5 degrees C in mid-December were associated with low yielding year of wheat. Determination of critical periods when wheat is most sensitive to air temperature extremes provides important information for modifying management practices, such as adjusting planting date in order to decrease the negative impacts of these climatic extremes on yield.

AB  - Betaines are well known as compatible solutes that exert protein- and membrane-stabilizing effects, including protective effects on photosynthesis in plants and free-living algae stressed by high irradiance or unusual temperatures. Betaines, however, have received minimal attention in reef-building corals. One goal of this research was to identify and quantify the betaines of reef-building corals with chemically definitive methods. Metabolite profiling was conducted on 10 species (6 genera) of Cura double dagger ao corals by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry calibrated using six stable-isotope-labeled internal standards. Glycine betaine (GlyB), proline betaine (ProB), alanine betaine (AlaB), beta-alanine betaine, hydroxyproline betaine (HProB), taurine betaine (TauB), trigonelline (Trig) and the chemically related sulfonium compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate were found in all species. Relative levels of betaines varied across species, with GlyB and ProB being most prominent. Betaines were collectively abundant; estimated total concentrations were 12 to 204 (mean = 75) mmol per liter of tissue. A second goal was to examine ecological patterns in betaine concentrations in field populations of Cura double dagger ao corals. Betaine concentrations exhibited intraspecific patterns that matched a priori predictions for molecules that defend photosynthesis against negative effects of high irradiance. In Madracis mirabilis-which occupies unshaded locations-GlyB, ProB, AlaB, HProB, and Trig were 37-94% more abundant in colonies at 5 m depth (high irradiance) than 20 m. In M. pharensis-which occupies exposed and shaded locations-GlyB, ProB, and AlaB were 30-44% more abundant in unshaded than shaded colonies at one depth. M. senaria exhibited 45-93% increases in concentrations of betaines-GlyB, AlaB, HProB, TauB, and Trig-between early and late in the day, although M. mirabilis and pharensis did not. The results indicate that multiple betaines occur commonly in reef-building coral species, and betaine concentrations are modulated in response to growth light conditions in ways consistent with betaines acting as agents of photoprotection of coral photosynthesis.

AB  - The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of carbonates and delta C-13(org) values, % C, and C/N ratios of organic matter from lacustrine and fluvial sediments were measured from two stratigraphic sections in the Linxia basin on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Diagenesis, when present, is early, limited to small spatial scales and restricted stratigraphic intervals. A strong correlation exists between dolomite content and the delta O-18 values of micritic carbonate suggesting that carbonates are primary precipitates from lake water and that delta O-18 values reflect changes in the lake environment, with more positive values derived from evaporated and more saline lake water. The first part of this record is characterized by strong oscillations between dry and wet conditions accompanied by changes in the lake system between hydrographically closed and open states (13.1-8.0 Ma). The most severe aridity occurred from 9.6 to 8.5 Ma. After similar to 8.0 Ma, a more stable and less and climate dominated the region and the drainage system was open (8.0-5.3 Ma). After 5.3 Ma, climate became gradually drier and/or cooler (5.3-4.3 Ma). The organic matter preserved in the Linxia basin is most likely a mixture of terrestrial C-3 plant matter and lake algae. A correlation between C/N and delta C-13(org), indicates that a significant percentage of the organic matter is derived from terrestrial sources. The organic matter has undergone selective degradation during which the C/N ratios and organic carbon percentage decreased. The delta C-13(org) values are relatively stable throughout the 13.1 to 4.3 Ma interval ranging from -24 to -29%o VPDB, suggesting that C-4 grasses were either absent or insignificant in the Linxia region prior to 4.3 Ma.

AB  - King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are one of the greatest consumers of marine resources. However, while their influence on the marine ecosystem is likely to be significant, only an accurate knowledge of their energy demands will indicate their true food requirements. Energy consumption has been estimated for many marine species using the heart rate-rate of oxygen consumption (f(H) - V over dot (O2)) technique, and the technique has been applied successfully to answer eco-physiological questions. However, previous studies on the energetics of king penguins, based on developing or applying this technique, have raised a number of issues about the degree of validity of the technique for this species. These include the predictive validity of the present f(H) - V over dot (O2) equations across different seasons and individuals and during different modes of locomotion. In many cases, these issues also apply to other species for which the f(H) - V over dot (O2) technique has been applied. In the present study, the accuracy of three prediction equations for king penguins was investigated based on validity studies and on estimates of V over dot (O2) from published, field f(H) data. The major conclusions from the present study are: (1) in contrast to that for walking, the f(H) - V over dot (O2) relationship for swimming king penguins is not affected by body mass; (2) prediction equation (1) log(V over dot (O2)) = -0.279 + 1.24lo(f(H)) + 0.0237t - 0.0157log(f(H))t, derived in a previous study, is the most suitable equation presently available for estimating V over dot (O2) in king penguins for all locomotory and nutritional states. A number of possible problems associated with producing an f(H) - V over dot (O2) relationship are discussed in the present study. Finally, a statistical method to include easy-to-measure morphometric characteristics, which may improve the accuracy of f(H) - V over dot (O2) prediction equations, is explained.

TI  - Time-lapse seismic analysis of pressure depletion in the Southern Gas Basin
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
LA  - English
AB  - In the Southern Gas Basin (SGB) of the North Sea there are many mature gas fields where time-lapse monitoring could be very beneficial in extending production life. However, the conditions are not immediately attractive for time-lapse seismic assessment. This is primarily because the main production effect to be assessed is a pore pressure reduction and frame stiffening because of gas production in tight sandstone reservoirs that also have no real seismic direct hydrocarbon indicators. Modelling, based on laboratory measurements, has shown that such an effect would be small and difficult to detect in seismic data. This paper makes two main contributions. Firstly, this is, to our knowledge, the first time-lapse study in the SGB and involves a real-data assessment of the viability for detecting production in such an environment. Secondly, the feasibility of using markedly different legacies of data in such a study is addressed, including an assessment of the factors influencing the crossmatching. From the latter, it is found that significant, spatially varying time shifts need to be, and are successfully, resolved through 3-D warping. After the warping, the primary factors limiting the crossmatching appear to be residual local phase variations, possibly induced by the differing migration strategies, structure, reverberations and different coherencies of the volumes, caused by differences in acquisition-structure azimuth and acquisition fold. Despite these differences, a time-lapse amplitude signature is observed that is attributable to production. The character of the 4-D amplitude anomalies may also indicate variations in stress sensitivity, e.g. because of zones of fracturing. Additionally, warping-derived time attributes have been highlighted as a potential additional avenue for detection of pressure depletion in such reservoirs. Although the effects are subtle, they may indicate changes in stress/pressure in and around the reservoir because of production. However, to fully resolve the subtle time-lapse effects in such a reservoir, the data differences need to be better addressed, which may be possible by full re-processing and pre-stack analysis, but more likely dedicated 4-D acquisition would be required.

AB  - Aim The objective of this study was to describe and interpret the changes in faunal composition in the moth family Geometridae (Lepidoptera) along a small-scale elevational gradient in a tropical montane rain forest. This gradient was compared with a large-scale latitudinal gradient in Europe.
   Location Investigations were carried out in the province Zamora-Chinchipe in southern Ecuador along a gradient ranging from 1040 to 2677 m above sea level at twenty-two sites.
   Methods Moths were sampled with light-traps in three field periods in 1999 and 2000 and subsequently sorted and determined to species or morphospecies.
   Results We analysed 13,938 specimens representing 1010 species of geometrid moths. The proportional contribution of subtaxa to the local geometrid fauna changes along the elevational gradient at all systematic levels considered. While proportions of species of the subfamilies Ennominae, Sterrhinae and Geometrinae significantly decrease, the proportion of Larentiinae increases with increasing altitude. Changes also occur within the subfamilies Ennominae and Larentiinae. The host-plant specialist ennomine tribes Cassymini, Macariini and Palyadini completely vanish, and the proportion of the tribe Boarmiini decreases at high altitudes. In contrast, the remaining tribes (mostly comprising polyphagous species) either do not show proportional changes (Azelinini, Nacophorini, Nephodiini, Ourapterygini) or even increase (Caberini, 'Cratoptera group'). Within Larentiinae, the species proportion of the genus Eois decreases, whereas concomitantly the proportion of Eupithecia increases. There is a remarkable similarity between the altitudinal patterns in Ecuador and those found along the latitudinal gradient in Europe.
   Main conclusions Species of the subfamily Larentiinae seem to be particularly well-adapted to harsh environmental conditions, towards both high altitudes and latitudes. They might disproportionately profit from lower predation at higher altitudes. Many changes in the faunal composition can be explained by expected host-plant requirements of the species involved. Our results show that diversity estimates based on taxon ratios which are assumed to be constant must be regarded with caution because such ratios can change rapidly along environmental gradients.

AB  - The marine demosponge Suberites domuncula is abundantly present on muddy sand bottoms, both in the open sea and in harbors. In the present study it is shown that exposure of S. domuncula to cadmium (CdCl2) in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5.0 mu g ml(-1) for up to 5 d results in apoptotic fragmentation of DNA. Kinetics experiments revealed that after 24 h a significant increase of DNA fragmentation already occurred. Besides cadmium a second stimulus was identified to also cause apoptosis in this species, namely exposure to heat-treated Escherichia coli. In order to support the finding that both cadmium and E. coli induce apoptosis in the sponge, expression of the apoptotic gene MA-3 was studied. The cDNA, SDMA3, was isolated and found io be 2247 nucleotides long. The deduced amino acid sequence (M-r 50765) shares high similarity with the corresponding mouse molecule. Like the mouse gene, the sponge MA-3 gene undergoes increased expression in response to apoptotic stimuli. While the specimens remained alive after treatment with cadmium, the sponges treated with E. coli died after approximately 12 d. The E. coli-treated animals started to form gemmules 10 to 12 d after addition of the bacteria. Hence, the process of apoptosis in sponges is triggered by two different pathways, one which is initiated by exogenous factors, e.g. heavy metals. and a second one, caused by endogenous factors, which leads to gemmule formation and a shift of the presumably immortal cells to mortal cells. The latter assumption is supported by the finding that during the process of bacteria-induced apoptosis, which results in the death of the specimens, the activity of the telomerase drops. It is concluded that the cells which appear to be immortal and telomerase-positive undergo apoptosis during the process of gemmule formation. In consequence cells not involved in the production of gemmules become mortal. Based on these data, it is proposed that apoptosis is a suitable biomarker in the bioindicator organism S. domuncula to monitor unfavorable environmental conditions, at least in this animal phylum.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cell activity was evaluated in three groups of Macaca nemestrina that varied with respect to SAIDS D retrovirus serotype 2 (SRV-2/W) and viremic status. Target cells used were Raji and K562 cells. No significant differences (ANOVA) in mean NK activity were detected among the three groups of animals studied. Using Raji targets, mean LU(30)/10(6)+/-SEM was 6.3+/-1.6 for seronegative (V-Ab-) animals, 7.3+/-1.5 for seropositive (V-Ab+) animals, and 10.2+/-3.5 for persistently viremic (V+Ab-) animals. Using K562 targets, mean LU(30)/10(6) was 7.6+/-1.7 for seronegative (V-Ab-) animals, 6.5+/-2.5 for seropositive (V-Ab+) animals, and 5.1+/-1.9 for persistently viremic (V+Ab-) animals. Percentage blood CD16(+) and CD8(+) cells also were not different in the three groups of animals. NK activity did not always correlate with percentage of CD16(+) or CD8(+) cells in peripheral blood at the time the assays were done. In persistently viremic animals, there was a strong positive correlation between percent CD16(+) and CD8(+) cells and NK activity using K562 cells but not Raji cells. Depletion experiments indicated that lysis was mediated by both CD8(+) and CD16(+) cells with both Raji and K562 cells. However, Raji targets were a better indicator of killing mediated by CD16(+) cells. Our studies indicate that M. nemestrina may be classified as high or low responders with regard to NK activity, and there was no correlation with SRV-2/W viral or antibody status. Additionally, our results suggested that group housing of M. nemestrina was usually associated with increased NK activity. In conclusion, studies of NK activity in M. nemestrina should consider target cells used, phenotype of effecters, endogenous (high or low) levels of NK activity in individual animals, and housing conditions.

AB  - Seed priming (imbibition in water or osmotic solutions followed by redrying) generally accelerates germination rates upon subsequent re-imbibition, but the response to priming treatments can vary both within and among seed lots.  Seed maturity could influence responsiveness to priming, perhaps explaining variable priming effects among developmentally heterogeneous seed lots.  In the current study, muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) seeds at two stages of development, maturing (40 d after anthesis (DAA)) and fully mature (60 DAA), were primed in 0.3 M KNO3 for 48 h at 30-degrees-C, dried, and imbibed in polyethylene glycol 8000 solutions of 0 to -1.2 MPa at 15, 20, 25, and 30-degrees-C.  Germination sensitivities to temperature and water potential (psi) were quantified as indicators of the influence of seed maturity and priming on seed vigour.  Germination percentages of 40 and 60 DAA control seeds were similar in water at 30-degrees-C, but the mean germination rate (inverse of time to germination) of 40 DAA seeds was 50% less than that of 60 DAA seeds.  Germination percentages and rates of both 40 and 60 DAA seeds decreased at temperatures below 25-degrees-C.  Reductions in psi also delayed and inhibited germination, with the 40 DAA seeds being more sensitive to low psi than the 60 DAA seeds.  Priming significantly improved the performance of 40 DAA seeds at low temperatures and reduced psi, but had less effect on 60 DAA seeds.  Priming lowered both the minimum temperature (T(b)) and the minimum psi (psi-b) at which germination occurred.  Overall, priming of 40 DAA seeds improved their germination performance under stress conditions to equal or exceed that of control 60 DAA seeds, while 60 DAA seeds exhibited only modest improvements due to priming.  As the osmotic environment inside mature fruits approximates that of a priming solution, muskmelon seeds may be 'primed' in situ during the late stage of development after maximum dry weight accumulation.

AB  - To achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs), it is necessary to solve the problem of assessing and measuring energy sustainability performance. A popular indicator used for this purpose is the World Energy Council (WEC) energy sustainability index, or the Energy Trilemma Index, which is based on such key metrics as energy security, energy equity, environmental sustainability, and country context. Each of the four metrics, or dimensions, includes many indicators that depend on both internal and external factors. By combining a variety of indicators into integral ones, WEC ranks countries in terms of energy sustainability. However, what is not taken into account is how countries differ in terms of economic development, income, energy mix, renewables use, ownership in the energy sector, and other factors, and neither is the methodology itself disclosed by the developers. As a provider for all other sectors of the economy, the energy sector plays an important role in developing countries. Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, being members of the Andean Community, are neighbors and have similar economic conditions but lack transnational power grid interconnections, which hinders the development of a common energy market. In terms of energy sustainability, these countries' ranks range from 45 to 101, according to the Energy Trilemma Index. The aim of the study is to develop a new methodology for assessing energy sustainability performance that will factor in the specific features of developing countries with a high share of hydroelectricity generation, and to calculate energy sustainability index indicators taking into account contemporary requirements for sustainable development, which include developing green and renewable energy and fostering decarbonization. This research reveals whether the countries' energy sustainability indices correspond to their actual performance in energy development and identifies the factors influencing the values of the metrics in the Energy Trilemma Index. The methodology can be used to integrate the energy sectors of countries, as it allows for evaluating the state of the energy sector of several countries (for example, those of the Andean Community) as a whole.

AB  - The spatiotemporal change in the alpine timberline, an ecosystem ecotone, is an ideal indicator for use in climate change research. In order to gain a quantitative understanding of the response of the alpine timberline to climate change, the Hengduan Mountains region of China was selected as a study area and a series of 136 Landsat images covering this area that were acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 were collected. First, the alpine timberline was retrieved and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the timberline were explored. The effect of topography on the location of the alpine timberline was also analyzed. The results indicate that the average elevation of the timberline increased by about 55 (+/- 8.54) m from 3992.58 m in 1985 to 4047.60 m in 2015; however, there was obvious spatial heterogeneity in these changes. On the whole, the average elevation of the timberline on shaded slopes (northern, northeastern, and northwestern slopes) were found to be about 160 m higher than on sunward slopes (southern, southeastern, and southwestern slopes). It was also found that, over the period 1985-2015, there has been an obvious acceleration in the upward tendency of the alpine timberline. Finally, the climate variables that are driving this timberline shift were identified and evaluated using the partial least squares (PLS) regression method. The results indicate that the average annual temperature (TEM_Year), total precipitation during the growing season (PRE_Grow), and growing season temperature (TEM_Grow) were the significant positive factors driving the rise in the timberline elevation; the total annual precipitation (PRE_Year) was found to have an unexpected negative influence. Besides, other climatic factors (e.g., strong winds) and non-climate variables (e.g., human influence and soil properties) should be also included in future related studies to enhance the understanding of the link between forest vegetation and climate change under extreme conditions.

AB  - Associations of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) radial growth with satellite-based soil moisture (SM) during the intensive tree growth period over a 30-year time span (1980-2010) were analyzed. This study included tree-ring width (TRW) chronologies from 22 stands located in four southeastern (SE) European countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria), which were grouped into three wetness groups (WGs): dry (<650 mm), moderate (650-750 mm), and wet (>750 mm), following the annual sum of precipitation. High correlation strengths dur -ing the intensive growth period-late spring and early summer months (April to June) was noted, which was op-posite to the trend in late summer months. Variations in detrended TRW (TRWi) sensitivity to SM were also observed among the WGs. Specifically, the TRWi chronologies from the dry and wet WGs provided a greater number of significant correlations (p < 0.01) than trees from the moderate WG did. In wetter stands, TRWi cor-related more negatively in the wettest (spring) months, while the correlation was weaker in summer months; these trends were opposite to those of trees growing in drier conditions that had the strongest responses to SM. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) based on 38 variables indicated that the fit for SM and radial growth was as strong as the fits for other traditionally measured parameters (temperature, precipitation, and river water level) and calculated drought indices (standardized precipitation index and the Ellenberg index) and TRW. Additionally, radial growth chronologies from drier sites had stronger fits with surrounding environmental factors. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SM can potentially be used as a reliable remote sensing indicator of the soil wetness in oak forests, which affects tree productivity and radial growth patterns and provides a new opportunity in dendrochronology research on larger scales.

AB  - Dairy and livestock grazing operations can introduce pollutants such as fecal coliform to surface waters, posing risk to human health and ecological conditions. Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) that increase control of manure, runoff, and animal access to waterways can reduce deposition of microbial pollution into streams. Between 2000 and 2013, we monitored water quality (fecal indicator bacteria [FIB] consisting of fecal coliform [FC] and Escherichia coli [EC]) in three coastal watersheds that encompass intensively managed dairies, beef cattle grazing operations, and public use at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, California. Concurrently, approximately 30 BMPs were implemented to manage cattle and improve dairy infrastructure. We also monitored a fourth adjacent watershed without any BMPs and limited direct livestock influence. The primary FIB parameter was changed from FC to EC midway through the study in 2007, so we combined FC data from 2000 to 2006 with EC data from 2007 to 2013 using previously published EC/FC ratios and data from this study to create a continuous time series. Competing Bayesian generalized linear mixed models examined whether FIB was best explained by year, 24-h rainfall, season, or annual rainfall and compared results with numeric regulatory objectives for surface waters. FIB from 20 00 to 2013 declined at all 13 water quality stations that were downstream of BMPs implemented during the study, while there was a slight positive trend in the adjacent watershed without BMPs and limited livestock influence. There was a 54-99% reduction in FIB with a sixfold increase in the frequency of samples meeting regulatory criteria over the study period, and results were robust to varying assumptions of the relationship between FC and EC. These findings indicate that targeted BMPs can effectively reduce FIB, increasing the probability of meeting water quality objectives across varying types of livestock operations.

AB  - Ensuring the well-being of animals during transport is becoming an increasingly important societal concern. The Australian livestock export industry recognises the need for comprehensive monitoring and reporting on animal welfare during sea transport. It is predicted that pen-side assessments of sheep can be used to monitor environmental conditions, resource access, and animal health and behavioural outcomes throughout a sea voyage. Pen-side assessments by observation are non-invasive and practical to apply in an industry setting. This study monitored sheep using a pilot list of welfare indicators during two sea voyages from Australia to the Middle East, in contrasting seasons. Sheep behaviour, environment and resources were recorded three times daily via pen-side observations of six pens of Merino wethers (castrated males), repeated over three decks for each voyage. Behavioural outcomes were examined for the effect of sampling frequency on group assessments. The number of behavioural measures were reduced via Principal Component (PC) analysis. The primary three PC factors were tested against the time of sampling and pen location after accounting for the effect of environmental- and resource-based predictor variables. PC 1 (24.0 % of the total variance) described activity levels, with sheep on Voyage B being more active in the morning and resting or recumbent in the middle of the afternoon and evening. PC 2 (14.7 %) reflected heat responses with the majority of the variation in these data accounted for by changes in Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) and manure pad moisture. The heat responses described by PC 2 also varied by voyage day (p < 0.001) and time point (p < 0.001). PC 3 scores (9.5 %) reflected flight distances and feeding behaviour and strongly correlated to WBGT and pellet consumption per head per day. Feeding behaviour generally became more competitive, and flight distances reduced as both voyages progressed. Results indicate that a comprehensive welfare monitoring protocol requires repeated daily sampling throughout a voyage. The findings of this study are pertinent for developing a sampling strategy to assess sheep welfare during sea transport.

TI  - Heavy Metals Content in Great Shearwater (Ardenna Gravis): Accumulation, Distribution and Biomarkers of Effect in Different Tissues
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of Great Shearwater (Ardenna gravis) as a bioindicator for biomonitoring programs for metal pollution. Three different metals were analysed in liver, kidney, and feathers, including cadmium, lead, and zinc. Glutathione-S-transferase, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, and catalase were assessed as oxidative stress biomarkers. Sex-related trends in metal accumulation also were evaluated. In liver and kidney, the mean concentrations of Zn (146.1 +/- 5.14 and 108 +/- 2.70 mg/kg, respectively) and Pb (0.19 +/- 0.01 and 0.13 +/- 0.01 mg/kg, respectively) in A. gravis were generally comparable to values reported in other studies. However, animals presented slightly higher concentrations of Cd (9.67 +/- 0.65 in liver and 17.41 +/- 0.84 mg/kg in kidney) than those reported in the same species sampled in Southern Atlantic waters. The slightly higher levels of Cd found in this study compared with other studies are probably affected by the location in Northern Atlantic waters (with different diet intake). In feathers, levels of Zn (70.70 +/- 1.76 mg/kg) were lower than in other Ardenna shearwaters, whereas higher levels were found for Cd (0.16 +/- 0.01 mg/kg) and Pb (0.84 +/- 0.06 mg/kg). The lack of differences found between males and females could be influenced by the migration status, because both sexes stay in similar physiological conditions, with no laying eggs. Levels found in the feathers of the present study were related to concentrations in internal tissues below those which cause adverse effects in birds. Thus, feathers would appear as a potential noninvasive tool for metals biomonitoring in seabirds, because it is possible to quantify them. Baseline data of oxidative stress levels have been reported, both in liver and kidney, presenting no correlations with the levels of metals in these tissues. The low internal metal levels and the lack of correlations between oxidative stress metrics suggest a low risk of the environmental concentrations for seabirds.

AB  - Questionnaires are very useful tools when it comes to assessing zoo based animal measures and caretakers of these animals (such as keepers, trainers and veterinarians) are in the best position to provide accurate answers to these assessments. Our goal was (a) to empirically demonstrate the utility of a welfare questionnaire and (b) to examine the relationship between three constructs: personality, subjective well-being and welfare ratings, in a sample of killer whales (Orcinus orca) (n = 26). For this purpose, we applied the 4-factor personality structure previously applied to the species, a 4-item subjective well-being questionnaire, and we designed and applied a 39-item welfare questionnaire. The welfare questionnaire was composed by positive and negative welfare indicators related to social and environmental interactions, physical health condition, presence of species-typical and stereotypical behaviors, the capacity to accept situations, and relationships with conspecifics and humans, among others. Each killer whale was rated by an average of 12.5 raters. The mean interrater reliability for subjective well-being and welfare questionnaires was high, and the Principal Components Analysis and the Regularized Exploratory Factor Analysis, revealed one and six factors, respectively. We found some correlations among the three constructs, for instance, Extraversion (r = 0.62, 95% CI 0.02-0.06) and Dominance (r = 0.61, 95 % CI 0.03-0.09) were associated to the subjective well-being factor, while subjective well-being was negatively associated with the Abnormal (r =-0.73, 95 % CI-0.13 to-0.06) and Nervousness (r =-0.66, 95 % CI 0.06-0.17) welfare factors, among others. The welfare questionnaire showed reliable and valid results. Thus, our research represents the first empirical evidence of the utility of assessing the welfare of cetaceans through the use of a multi-trait questionnaire. Therefore, facilities housing cetaceans could use welfare questionnaires to gradually monitor welfare and to intervene if needed. Finally, some of the correlations found closely resembled previous correlations found in primates, which could indicate a possible evolutionary convergence between Orders.

AB  - Thermal gas meters represent a promising technology for billing customers for gaseous fuels, however, it is essential to ensure that measurement accuracy is maintained in the long term and in a broad range of operating conditions. The effect of hydrogen addition to natural gas will change the physicochemical properties of the mixture of natural gas and hydrogen. Such a mixture will be supplied through the gas system, to consumers, including households, where the amounts of received gas will be metered. The physicochemical properties of hydrogen, including the specific density or viscosity, differ significantly from those of the natural gas components, such as methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, etc. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to establish the impact of the changes in the gas composition caused by the addition of hydrogen to natural gas on the metrological properties of household gas meters, including thermal gas meters. Furthermore, since household gas meters can be installed outdoors and, taking into account the fact that household gas meters are good heat exchangers, the influence of ambient and gas temperature on the metrological properties of those meters should be investigated. This article reviews a test bench and a testing method concerning errors of thermal gas meter indicators using air and natural gas, including the type containing hydrogen. The indication errors for thermal gas meters using air, natural gas and natural gas with an addition of 2%, 4%, 5%, 10% and 15% hydrogen were determined and then subjected to metrological analysis. Moreover, the test method and test bench are discussed and the results of tests on the impact of ambient and gas temperatures (-25 degrees C and 55 degrees C, respectively) on the errors of indications of thermal gas meters are presented. Conclusions for distribution system operators in terms of gas meter selection were drawn based on the test results.

AB  - Land-use types exert a differential impact on soil quality and on the dynamics of edaphic (soil-dwelling) arthropods. This study determined the quality status of soils under different land-use categories (i.e. agricultural crop land, orchard land and natural uncultivated land) and different land-use types (i.e. sugarcane, fodder and rice-wheat fields, intercropped and non-intercropped citrus and guava orchards, natural grassland, bare land and wetland peripheries) using population abundance and dynamics of edaphic springtails (collembola) and mites (acari) as bioindicators. Using metallic soil corer (10 cm length and 10 cm diameter), extensive random soil sampling was carried out from selected localities in district Sargodha (Punjab, Pakistan) and soil microarthropods (i.e. springtails and mites) were extracted from composite soil samples using Tullgren-Berlese funnel. Impact of collection seasons (i.e. spring, summer, autumn and winter) and impact of different land-use types or categories on the population abundance of soil microartbropods was assessed. Moreover, soil physico-chemical and microbiological properties were also determined in order to find out the main edaphic drivers which can explain the population dynamics of these microarthropods. Results revealed that all major factors i.e. land-use types and categories, collection seasons and soil properties had a significant impact on the population abundance of springtails and mites. Agricultural soils harbored maximum abundance of both microarthropods followed by orchard land-use types, while minimum arthropod abundance was recorded for soils under natural land-use types. Similarly, maximum and minimum arthropod captures were recorded during spring and autumn seasons, respectively. Moreover, population dynamics of springtails and mites had a significant positive correlation with organic matter and total organic carbon contents, while had a significant negative correlation with soil bulk density. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the differential impact of land-use, season and soil conditions on the population abundance of edaphic microarthropods suggesting their suitability to be used as bioindicators of prevailing soil status.

AB  - The experience of effective forest management in the most developed forest countries proves the important role of the institutional environment in this process. Taking into account the territorial specifics is a necessary condition for its formation. In the Russian Federation, there has been a long-standing controversy about the ineffectiveness of the institutional environment existing in forest management. First of all, this applies to the institution of forest plots lease defined in the Forest code. As a rule, the discussions are based on the general indicators of forest development reducing the objectivity of individual elements evaluation. In this regard, one of the most important tasks at the moment is creating a methodology and tools allowing to obtain the estimates related to the development of individual elements of the forest management institutional environment, in particular, the elements of the forest lease system. The main purpose of the research is to develop the general approaches in order to analyze the dynamics of the environment elements formation associated with the lease of forest plots in the region of the Russian Federation and obtain the appropriate models on this basis. To achieve this goal, the system of forest lease in the Vologda region was studied and the models for the development of its main elements were formed. The methods of system approach, analysis and synthesis, generalization and comparison, classification and systematization, mathematical statistics were used. The scientific novelty of the research involves developing approaches to creating the models describing the dynamics of the forest lease system elements development in the Russian Federation using linear approximation of time series of their parameters. The theoretical significance lies in the development of a methodology for studying the dynamics of the institutional environment formation associated with the system of forest lease in the region of the Russian Federation. In practical terms, the research findings will allow to determine the main trends in the development of the forest lease system at a higher quality level for further comprehensive analysis, as well as to make short- and medium-term forecasts.

AB  - Organic matter (OM) such as organic nitrogen plays a substantial role in the global biogeochemical cycling of bio-reactive components-amino acids (AA) in aquatic environments. Spatial and temporal variations in source, diagenesis, and fate of organic nitrogen such as AA in sediments of small tropical rivers and the role of oxbow/meandering loops under changing climatic conditions are poorly investigated. This study assessed the spatial and seasonal variations in OM composition, source, and diagenesis of a tropical small mountainous river-Netravati River, India, for 1 year. Water samples were determined for suspended particulate matter, and surface sediments were examined for bulk parameters, surface area (SA), and the L- and D-enantiomers of AA. The L- and D-enantiomers of AA displayed subtle seasonal variations in composition and depicted varying degrees of diagenesis. The concentration of D-enantiomer of AA was high and showed substantial contributions from bacteria, terrestrial source, and in situ production. The D-arginine was the most abundant D-enantiomer of AA in the study area, possibly due to extracellular secretion by bacterial species and adsorption onto sediments, and thus, it was protected from degradation. Degradation index was more negative at the oxbow and meandering loop stations during the dry season suggesting that local geomorphologic settings steer the diagenesis of OM within the river. A negative relationship between gamma-aminobutyric acid and organic carbon:surface area (OC:SA) ratio and a positive correlation between tyrosine and OC:SA ratio suggested accelerated loss of OM. Furthermore, the concentrations of most bulk parameters were higher in the lower reaches during monsoon and premonsoon seasons. Taken together, changes in seasons have an operational control in distinguishing the composition, source, and diagenesis of spatial OM distribution. Moreover, oxbows and river meandering loops influence the diagenetic processes in small tropical river systems.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the economic efficiency of the forest management with particular emphasis on economic and financial indicators of the forest districts (namely Bialowieza, Browsk and Hajn6wka) constituting the 'Puszcza Bialowieska' Forest Promotional Complex (FPC). The work involved analysis of indicators reflecting the financial condition of the forest districts with reference to average values for comparison units i.e. 28 other entities from the Regional Directorate of the State Forests in Bialystok. The analysis consisted in the determination of typical values from comparative units in individual years (mean +/- standard deviation). The balance sheet, profit and loss account and basic reporting document on financial and economic activities (LPIR1). for the years 2011-2017. Data were collected from the State Forests Information System. Financial liquidity, profitability and management efficiency were analyzed in detail. The net financial result of the forest districts was used for the analyzes, after an additional adjustment, consisting in increasing the net result by the value of the write-off for the forest fund and maintenance costs of the superior units and reduced by the additional payment from the forest fund. The analyzes were based on data collected from the State Forests Information System. On the basis of the research, it was found that the rules of financial management in the State Forests do not pose a risk of deterioration or loss of financial liquidity of the FPC forest districts. However, the inability to obtain the additional payment from a forest fund by individual of FPC forest districts would result in the loss of their ability to function independently. The management efficiency clearly affects the actual financial situation of the FPC forest districts. The deteriorating profitability of the FPC forest districts is caused by negative (loss) net financial results reflects the modified net financial result, including for funds from the forest fund. Restrictions on harvesting, resulting from the implementation of tasks in the field of nature conservation, worsen the economic efficiency of the FPC forest districts.

AB  - The hippocampus, a structure essential for spatial navigation and memory undergoes anatomical and functional changes during chronic stress. Here, we investigate the effects of chronic stress on the ability of place cells to encode the neural representation of a linear track. To model physiological conditions of chronic stress on hippocampal function, transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in CA1 pyramidal neurons were chronically administered with 40 mu g/ml of cortisol for 8 weeks. Cortisol-treated mice exhibited symptoms typically observed during chronic stress, including diminished reward seeking behavior and reduced adrenal gland and spleen weights. In vivo imaging of hippocampal cellular activity during linear track running behavior revealed a reduced number of cells that could be recruited to encode spatial position, despite an unchanged overall number of active cells, in cortisol-treated mice. The properties of the remaining place cells that could be recruited to encode spatial information, however, was unperturbed. Bayesian decoders trained to estimate the mouse's position on the track using single neuron activity data demonstrated reduced performance in a cue richness-dependent fashion in cortisol-treated animals. The performance of decoders utilizing data from the entire neuronal ensemble was unaffected by cortisol treatment. Finally, to test the hypothesis that an antidepressant drug could prevent the effects of cortisol, we orally administered a group of mice with 10 mg/kg citalopram during cortisol administration. Citalopram prevented the cortisol-induced decrease in single-neuron decoder performance but failed to significantly prevent anhedonia and the cortisol-induced reduction in the proportion place cells. The dysfunction observed at the single-neuron level indicates that chronic stress may impair the ability of the hippocampus to encode individual neural representations of the mouse's spatial position, a function pivotal to forming an accurate navigational map of the mouse's external environment; however, the hippocampal ensemble as a whole is resilient to any cortisol-induced insults to single neuronal place cell function on the linear track.

AB  - This article studies the phenomenon of democracy as part of the discussion on the nature of the political system of the Roman Republic in the 3rd - 1st centuries BC, generated by the works of the British researcher Fergus Millar. The authors of the article believe that the key mistake of the opponents in this discussion is that they take Athenian democracy as the criterion. As a result, the researchers who refuse to consider the Roman Republic as a democracy place on it such demands that modern democratic states cannot meet. In this article, such criticisms of the Roman Republic have been analyzed and compared the current state of affairs.
   In the authors' view, direct democracy in the Roman Republic had the same achievements and the same problems with the implementation of the rights of the people as modern representative democracies. Summing up the conducted analysis, the authors come to the conclusion that as compared with the modern democratic states, the Roman Republic can in full measure be recognized as a democracy (with its natural peculiarities and distinctions). It had a full-fledged civil society that united citizens by mutual interests and goals, the sense of responsibility for the future of their homeland, conscientious performance of their duties to the homeland, and willingness to help an individual citizen. By these indicators Rome was not inferior to modern democracies. The consensus between the ruling elite and society was seen in the harmonious combination of form (recognition of the people as the source of power) and reality, in which this power was in the hands of the elite.
   Ancient Rome's experience proves that it is not direct rule of the people but stringent requirements to the ruling circles that are the foundation of a democratic system in the conditions when because of the size of a state the direct rule by the people (according to the Athenian model) is not possible. Such control, also on the part of most citizens, the search for its effective methods is highly relevant for today's representative democracy as well.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to evaluate the cumulative energy demand and the related environmental impact of three large-power stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) irrigation systems ranging from 40 kWp to 360 kWp. The novelty of this analysis is the large power of these systems as the literature up to now is restricted to modeled PV pumping systems scenarios or small power plants, where the size can be a critical factor for energy and environmental issues. The analysis shows that the yearly embodied energy per unit of PV power ranged from 1306 MJ/kWp to 1199 MJ/kWp depending of the PV generator size. Similarly, the related yearly carbon dioxide impacts ranged from 72.6 to 79.8 kg CO(2)e/kWp. The production of PV modules accounted for the main portion (about 80%) of the primary energy embodied into the PV irrigation system (PVIS). The outcomes of the study also show an inverse trend of the energy and carbon payback times respect to the PV power size: In fact, energy payback time increased from 1.94, to 5.25 years and carbon payback time ranged from 4.62 to 9.38 years. Also the energy return on investment depends on the PV generator dimension, ranging from 12.9 to 4.8. The environmental impact of the stand-alone PV systems was also expressed in reference to the potential amount of electricity generated during the whole PV life. As expected, the largest PVIS performs the best result, obtaining an emission rate of 45.9 g CO(2)e per kWh, while the smallest one achieves 124.1 g CO(2)e per kWh. Finally, the energy and environmental indicators obtained in this study are strongly related to the irrigation needs, which in turn are influenced by other factors as the type of cultivated crops, the weather conditions and the water availability.

AB  - On the SE African shelf, a submerged shoreline at a depth of 60 m is examined and its attributes compared between two shelf sectors with different morphologies, yet similar energy regimes. The aim is to assess the controls of antecedent conditioning on shoreline development and later preservation from transgressive ravinement. Using a combination of multibeam bathymetry and single-channel seismic profiles, the stratigraphy and morphology of the shoreline is investigated. Low-gradient bedrock examples reveal several distinctive seismic facies, including onlapping chaotic reflector packages which are interpreted as calcarenite rubble fields. These palaeo-shorelines possess planform equilibrium morphologies, including parabolic dunes and blowout forms along with relict shore platforms. They are strongly associated with incised valleys of last glacial maximum age which underlie the shoreline locations; these provide wide, back-barrier accommodation space during transgression. In contrast, palaeo-shorelines on the steeper-gradient shelf have a simpler stratigraphic arrangement. They are not as well preserved, are generally covered by thick drapes of sediment, and lack the elaborate planform morphologies of their lower-shelf gradient equivalents. Isolated incised valleys and the steep bedrock gradient limit accommodation space. The comparison indicates that antecedent bedrock slope and available accommodation are amongst the dominant controls on overstepping, and thus potential preservation, of palaeo-shorelines on the shelf. Lower-gradient shelves not only promote rapid shoreline translation but, together with wide, sandy back-barrier accommodation, also foster larger barrier volumes. In suitable climates such as in the Mediterranean and other sub-tropical areas, the ensuing shoreline stability promotes rapid and effective cementation of the barrier. In comparison, steep bedrock profiles with limited back-barrier accommodation have much lower preservation potential. Transgressive ravinement is more focussed on steep slopes, effectively removing more material during the ravinement process. The more dynamic environment may also reduce the effectiveness of diagenesis. The potential of beachrock and aeolianite palaeo-shorelines as submerged sea-level indicators may be optimal in low-gradient settings in Mediterranean to subtropical environments.

AB  - Typically, hardly-degradable lignocellulosic waste is a component or a co-component of the composted mass. The aim of the work was to present the dynamics and succession of microbial communities during small temperature changes, conditioned by the availability of lignocellulosic polymer and feather waste (the presence of N) in composts with qualitatively and quantitatively different lignocellulosic waste, but most of all, to draw attention to the previously not considered microbial strategies in the composted mass. Decomposition of lignocellulose during composting was similar to the priming effect in the soil, because it was associated with the successive occurrence of two groups of microorganisms. The first group of microorganisms, using easily accessible fraction of the lignocellulose complex, was named the first-strategist group, i.e., non-nutritionally specialized group of microorganisms. The second group, utilizing the hard-to-degrade fraction of lignocellulose, was named second-strategist microorganisms, i.e., nutritionally-specialized group of microorganisms. Biodegradation of the lignocellulose complex in compost I enriched with grass (42.86% pine bark, 34.28% grass, 20.0% sawdust and 2.86% chicken feathers) was faster than in compost II that did not contain any grass, but included more hardly degradable components (25.54% pine bark, 10.63% wheat straw, 51.07% sawdust, 12.76% chicken feathers). In compost I, a higher temperature in the thermophilic phase was recorded; larger amounts of non-specialized mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria in the first weeks of composting and a higher abundance of ligninolytic, xylanolytic fungi and cellulolytic bacteria were observed already in biothermal phase 3 with limited access to easily available C and energy sources. During this period, phosphatase, dehydrogenase and respiratory activities were higher in compost I than compost II.
   This work demonstrates that the succession of particular groups of microorganisms may help determine the start of biodegradation of recalcitrant ligninocellulosic components during composting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is recognized as a dangerous contaminant due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification within trophic levels, leading to serious health risks to aquatic biota. Therefore, there is an urgent need to unravel the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of Hg. To this aim, a metabolomics approach based on protonic nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), coupled with chemometrics, was performed on the gills of wild golden grey mullets L aurata living in an Hg-polluted area in Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). Gills were selected as target organ due to their direct and continuous interaction with the surrounding environment. As a consequence of accumulated inorganic Hg and methylmercury, severe changes in the gill metabolome were observed, indicating a compromised health status of mullets. Numerous metabolites, i.e. amino acids, osmolytes, carbohydrates, and nucleotides, were identified as potential biomarkers of Hg toxicity in fish gills. Specifically, decrease of taurine and glycerophosphocholine, along with increased creatine level, suggested Hg interference with the ion-osmoregulatory processes. The rise of lactate indicated anaerobic metabolism enhancement. Moreover, the increased levels of amino acids suggested the occurrence of protein catabolism, further supported by the augmented alanine, involved in nitrogenous waste excretion. Increased level of isobutyrate, a marker of anoxia, was suggestive of onset of hypoxic stress at the Hg contaminated site. Moreover, the concomitant reduction in glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine reflected the occurrence of membrane repair processes. Finally, perturbation in antioxidant defence system was revealed by the depletion in glutathione and its constituent amino acids. All these data were also compared to the differential Hg-induced metabolic responses previously observed in liver of the same mullets (Brandao et al., 2015). Overall, the environmental metabolomics approach demonstrated its effectiveness in the evaluation of Hg toxicity mechanisms in wild fish under realistic environmental conditions, uncovering tissue-specificities regarding Hg toxic effects namely in gills and liver.

AB  - Drought is the single greatest abiotic stress leading to yield loss of wheat worldwide. The long-term domestication and selective breeding in artificial environments may have reduced the drought resistance of wheat. Wheat alien chromosome addition lines, with chromosomes derived from wild species, may possess drought resistant genetic potential and could serve as a bridge for transferring those traits to wheat. The drought resistance of 82 wheat alien chromosome addition lines along with their common parent Chinese Spring were evaluated for 10 agronomic traits under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. Spike length was the most stable trait while biomass plant(-1) was the most sensitive trait when subjected to drought stress. Evaluation of heritability and correlations with yield plant(-1) suggested that plant height, peduncle length, distance between spike and flag leaf, grain number spike(-1) and thousand-grain weight could be used as indicators of drought resistance. The membership function value of drought resistance (MFVD) based on those traits and grain yield plant(-1), indicated 26 of the 82 wheat addition lines expressed high drought resistance. Higher MFVD was observed in the Agropyron elongatum 3E addition line in two years, and it was considered as the most drought resistant material. Analysis of the yield plant(-1) suggested that the drought resistant addition lines identified by MFVD were drought resistant but not very high-yielding, thus they could be used to improve germplasm with high-yield potential but low drought resistance. The drought resistance index (DI) based on yield plant(-1) indicated that 10 addition lines included both drought resistance and greater grain yield, which could be used in moderate stressed areas for improving drought resistance. Among them, addition lines with Aegilops peregrina 4SV and Ae. peregrine 3UV chromosome showed excellent performance and could be further investigated in drought resistance studies or breeding programs.

AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) are used as indicators or proxies for a range of geological and mineralogical processes due to their unique geochemical characteristics. Total and aqua regia-extractable concentrations of REEs and 57 other elements have been determined for 5350 soil samples as part of the high sampling density Geochemical Atlas of Cyprus. The bedrock geology of Cyprus is dominated by the sequence of ultramafic to mafic units formed at a spreading ridge and subsequently obducted to form the Troodos Ophiolite (TO), and the surrounding carbonate-rich Circum-Troodos Sedimentary Sequence (CTSS) deposited in environments ranging from deep marine to sub-aerial. Total and aqua regia-extractable REE patterns are similar for each element and are largely controlled by parent lithology. Soil-to-rock REE ratios are generally elevated in the TO units (>4 for LREEs and 1.5-3 for HREEs) due to loss of more mobile elements during weathering but are close to 1 in the CTSS units. HREEs are more elevated than LREEs in soils derived from TO units with upper continental crust-normalised patterns indicating the main source to be pyroxenes and zircon. Trace element trends indicate REEs in the CTSS were largely derived from detrital material shedding off the TO and deposited in progressively shallowing basins under largely anoxic conditions (absence of Ce4+ anomalies), with a minor contribution from seawater via adsorption onto secondary Fe+ Mn oxides or co-precipitation with carbonates. Heavy mineralassociated elements such as Zr and Th display a relative consistent ratio in the CTSS soils. Peak HREE concentrations occur in the mafic cumulates and intrusives where the median La-UCC/Yb-UCC is similar to 0.12, whereas in CTSS units the LREEs are more elevated with a median La-UCC/Yb-UCC similar to 0.7. Due to the strong lithogeochemical controls, soil REE spatial patterns reflect even subtle mineralogical variations within the various TO units, the location of major transform faults and other structures, and areas that have been affected by hydrothermal alteration.

AB  - Monitoring concentrations of bacterial pathogens and indicators of fecal contamination in coastal and estuarine ecosystems is critical to reduce adverse effects to public health. During storm events, particularly hurricanes, floods, Nor'easters, and tropical cyclones, sampling of coastal and estuarine waters is not generally possible due to safety concerns. It is particularly important to monitor waters during these periods as it is at precisely these times that pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio spp. and fecal indicator bacteria concentrations fluctuate, potentially posing significant risks to public health. Automated samplers, such as the Isco sampler, are commonly used to conduct remote sample collection. Remote sampling is employed during severe storm periods, thereby reducing risk to researchers. Water samples are then stored until conditions are safe enough to retrieve them, typically in less than 21 h, to collect the samples. Concerns exist regarding potential "bottle effects", whereby containment of sample might result in altered results. While these effects are well documented in samples being held for 24 h or more, there is little data on bottle effects occurring during the first 24 h of containment, and less still on the specific effects related to this type of sampling regime. Estuarine water samples were collected in the fall of 2013, placed into an Isco autosampler and subsampled over time to determine the effects of storage within this type of autosampling device. Vibrio spp. and fecal indicator bacteria were quantified using replicated culture-based methods, including Enterolertn" and membrane filtration. The experiments demonstrated no significant impact of storage time when comparing concentrations of total Vibrio spp., Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, or Enterococcus spp. after storage compared to original concentrations. However, the findings also suggested that increased variability and growth can occur during the middle of the day. Therefore, if at all possible, analysis schedules should be modified to account for this variability, e.g. collection of samples after overnight storage should occur as early in the morning as practicable.

AB  - The characterization of powder flow properties is often required for reliable design and proper operation of industrial processes. The effect of the state of compaction and bed voidage on bulk solids flowability is probably the most critical area of understanding. The goal of the present study is to compare traditional characterization techniques with methodologies provided by the FT4 Powder Rheometer (Freeman Technology). The data from six different methods, covering low to high stress levels, were compared to examine the hypothetical relationships between them. These techniques were also evaluated with regard to their ability to discriminate between different powders. To make a comparison of the testing methods, a range of seven materials was selected to cover the entire range of fine powders, i.e., from nanoparticles to group B powders.
   The results showed that the characterization techniques clearly have different working ranges depending on the level of cohesiveness of the powder. The powder rheometer was found to allow quick and reproducible measurements of the powder response to various environments. The different blade testing methods provided data that were in good agreement with traditional characterization techniques. However, the powder rheometer measurements were difficult to interpret because they depend on many physical properties and environmental parameters. They were particularly useful to compare similar materials but did not allow good discrimination between very different materials. A more detailed understanding of the physical phenomena involved in blade testing techniques is still needed.
   Finally, this study showed that powders and bulk materials cannot be viewed as invariant entities. Their flow properties cannot be predicted by only one indicator. The connection of several characterization methods is required to ensure a complete understanding of the powder flow properties over a wide range of conditions. This approach allows better insight into the powder/process relationship. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated spatial patterns and partitioning of fish community diversity in the Emory River basin, Tennessee, USA, which represents the best available biotic condition in a region characterized with high diversity and endemism. Fish community analyses were intended as one criterion for identifying aquatic conservation areas in a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) currently developed in the study region under the authority of the US Endangered Species Act. Spatial patterns of fish community diversity were examined at 57 stream sites located in the mainstem (13 sites) and four sub-basins (a total of 44 sites) by partitioning gamma diversity (total diversity) into alpha (within-community) and beta (among-community) components in a multiplicative manner at two spatial scales. Additional analyses were conducted to assess evidence of dispersal in structuring local communities. Mainstem sites were characterized with higher alpha diversity values relative to sub-basin sites, and gamma diversity of 13 mainstem sites was comparable with that of 44 sub-basin sites. Site-level beta diversity differed among sub-basins. Among-sub-basin beta diversity was only modest, and one sub-basin harboured the majority of total species richness found among all sub-basins. Many species had high indicator values for mainstem sites, but sub-basin sites were associated with few indicator species. Spatial autcorrelation of fish community similarity was significant within mainstem sites and sites located within two sub-basins. Catchment area explained among-site variation in species richness better than stream order, link magnitude, confluence link or downstream link. Overall, there was a lack of evidence that dispersal played an important role in shaping local fish communities in either mainstem or sub-basin sites. Aquatic conservation in the study basin should focus on protecting aquatic diversity in the mainstem habitat, while a network of stream sites in the most diverse sub-basin may also be considered as aquatic conservation areas.

AB  - The complexity of fecal microbial communities and overlap among human and other animal sources have made it difficult to identify source-specific fecal indicator bacteria. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies now provides increased sequencing power to resolve microbial community composition within and among environments. These data can be mined for information on source-specific phylotypes and/or assemblages of phylotypes (i.e., microbial signatures). We report the development of a new genetic marker for human fecal contamination identified through microbial pyrotag sequence analysis of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequence analysis of 37 sewage samples and comparison with database sequences revealed a human-associated phylotype within the Lachnospiraceae family, which was closely related to the genus Blautia. This phylotype, termed Lachno2, was on average the second most abundant fecal bacterial phylotype in sewage influent samples from Milwaukee, WI. We developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for Lachno2 and used it along with the qPCR-based assays for human Bacteroidales (based on the HF183 genetic marker), total Bacteroidales spp., and enterococci and the conventional Escherichia coli and enterococci plate count assays to examine the prevalence of fecal and human fecal pollution in Milwaukee's harbor. Both the conventional fecal indicators and the human-associated indicators revealed chronic fecal pollution in the harbor, with significant increases following heavy rain events and combined sewer overflows. The two human-associated genetic marker abundances were tightly correlated in the harbor, a strong indication they target the same source (i.e., human sewage). Human adenoviruses were routinely detected under all conditions in the harbor, and the probability of their occurrence increased by 154% for every 10-fold increase in the human indicator concentration. Both Lachno2 and human Bacteroidales increased specificity to detect sewage compared to general indicators, and the relationship to a human pathogen group suggests that the use of these alternative indicators will improve assessments for human health risks in urban waters.

AB  - Heat stress adversely affects wheat production in many regions of the world and is particularly detrimental during reproductive development and grain-filling. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with heat susceptibility index (HSI) of yield components in response to a short-term heat shock during early grain-filling in wheat. The HSI was used as an indicator of yield stability and a proxy for heat tolerance. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the heat tolerant cultivar 'Halberd' and heat sensitive cultivar 'Cutter' was evaluated for heat tolerance over 2 years in a controlled environment. The RILs and parental lines were grown in the greenhouse and at 10 days after pollination (DAP) half the plants for each RIL received a three-day heat stress treatment at 38A degrees C/18A degrees C day/night, while half were kept at control conditions of 20A degrees C/18A degrees C day/night. At maturity, the main spike was harvested and used to determine yield components. A significant treatment effect was observed for most yield components and a HSI was calculated for individual components and used for QTL mapping. QTL analysis identified 15 and 12 QTL associated with HSI in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Five QTL regions were detected in both years, including QTL on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, and 3B. These same regions were commonly associated with QTL for flag leaf length, width, and visual wax content, but not with days to flowering. Pleiotropic trade-offs between the maintenance of kernel number versus increasing single kernel weight under heat stress were present at some QTL regions. The results of this study validate the use of the main spike for detection of QTL for heat tolerance and identify genomic regions associated with improved heat tolerance that can be targeted for future studies.

AB  - During the MREA07 trial, off the NW coast of Italy in the late spring and summer of 2007, Navy Coastal Ocean Modeling (NCOM) multiple nests free-run ensembles were made available in real-time for the LASIE07 and BP07 events and a fairly complete set of observations were collected inside the inner nests domains. This note addresses the problem of predicting NCOM local unbiased 0-24 h forecast errors by perturbing a limited number of possible error sources through Monte-Carlo simulations, without local data assimilation. It discusses preliminary results using the Ensemble Transform [Bishop, C.H., and Toth. Z., 1999: Ensemble transformation and adaptive observations. journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 56,1748-1765] to calibrate the ensemble spread by adjusting its characteristics (spread-skill relationship and magnitude) to an observed or pre-estimated error field. A small (10 members) ensemble of free runs was used for water column temperature forecast Root Mean Square (RMS) error prediction. After being post-processed they were compared with observed errors and those estimated using time variability as an error proxy. The ensemble runs were generated through atmospheric forcing perturbations using the space-time deformation method as proposed by [Hong, H.X., Bishop, C., 2007. Ensemble and probabilistic forecasting. IUGG XXIV General Assembly 2007, Perugia, Italy. 2-13 July], keeping independent initial conditions. Because at the starting time all runs shared the same IC, the ensemble was run for roughly two weeks for spinning up and then used during the following 10 days for data comparisons, during which the ensemble spread did not diverge and was consistent with the observed dynamics. Comparisons of ensemble spread of temperature profiles with local observed errors and time variability (assumed as an error proxy) showed that they were consistent through this 10 day analysis period, with performances above the non-calibrated ensemble estimates and time-variability used as error proxy.

AB  - 1. Little is known about native communities in naturally fishless lakes in eastern North America, a region where fish stocking has led to a decline in these habitats.
   2. Our study objectives were to: (i) characterise and compare macroinvertebrate communities in fishless lakes found in two biophysical regions of Maine (U.S.A.): kettle lakes in the eastern lowlands and foothills and headwater lakes in the central and western mountains; (ii) identify unique attributes of fishless lake macroinvertebrate communities compared to lakes with fish and (iii) develop a method to efficiently identify fishless lakes when thorough fish surveys are not possible.
   3. We quantified macroinvertebrate community structure in the two physiographic fishless lake types (n = 8 kettle lakes; n = 8 headwater lakes) with submerged light traps and sweep nets. We also compared fishless lake macroinvertebrate communities to those in fish-containing lakes (n = 18) of similar size, location and maximum depth. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to assess differences in community structure and t-tests for taxon-specific comparisons between lakes.
   4. Few differences in macroinvertebrate communities between the two physiographic fishless lake types were apparent. Fishless and fish-containing lakes had numerous differences in macroinvertebrate community structure, abundance, taxonomic composition and species richness. Fish presence or absence was a stronger determinant of community structure in our study than differences in physical conditions relating to lake origin and physiography.
   5. Communities in fishless lakes were more speciose and abundant than in fish-containing lakes, especially taxa that are large, active and free-swimming. Families differing in abundance and taxonomic composition included Notonectidae, Corixidae, Gyrinidae, Dytiscidae, Aeshnidae, Libellulidae and Chaoboridae.
   6. We identified six taxa unique to fishless lakes that are robust indicators of fish absence: Graphoderus liberus, Hesperocorixa spp., Dineutus spp., Chaoborus americanus, Notonecta insulata and Callicorixa spp. These taxa are collected most effectively with submerged light traps.
   7. Naturally fishless lakes warrant conservation, because they provide habitat for a unique suite of organisms that thrive in the absence of fish predation.

AB  - Information on the territory density of breeding birds in the context to land use and biotope structures in the various landscapes are of particular value in the evaluation of the habitat conditions. Therefore, for the development of a farmland bird indicator, abundances and populations of breeding birds should be considered. For this purpose, a methodological approach was developed using the territory mapping method to procure information for the agrarian landscape, and representative abundances of the breeding bird species in these areas. Development and testing of the methods was done in Germany in the federal state of Brandenburg (30.000 km(2)) 2005 and 2006. Starting with a GIS supported systematization and spatial marking off of the landscape of the entire country, the agrarian landscape is defined in terms of the spatial location. Within the agrarian landscape, under particular consideration of the agricultural land use as well as the biotope structures, agrarian landscape types and agrarian landscape mosaic types are defined. In the agrarian landscape, then, equipped proportionally to the defined landscape types, 65 1 km(2) study areas were positioned and randomly distributed. On the basis of the abundance data collected over the two study years, as well as the area information drawn from the landscape systematic, the metapopulations of the breeding bird species are assessed. Form the total of 112 breeding bird species, 14 representative indicator species for the entire agrarian landscape as well as the subindicators for the agrarian landscape types were selected. Through the use of target values of the indicator species, the current level of goal achievement for each of the species were calculated. From these values the farmland bird indicator was calculated. This serves to evaluate the agrarian landscape overall as well as additionally the individual agrarian landscape types. In contrast to index based bird indicators, this indicator gives a direct feedback to the population changes in the landscapes.

AB  - To test the feasibility of using lithium isotopes in marine ferromanganese deposits as an indicator of paleoceanographic conditions and seawater composition, we analyzed samples from a variety of tectonic environments in the global ocean. Hydrogenetic, hydrothermal, mixed hydrogenetic-hydrothermal, and hydrogenctic-diagenetic samples were subjected to a two-step leaching and dissolution procedure to extract first the loosely bound Li and then the more tightly bound Li in the Mn oxide and Fe oxyhydroxide. Total leachable Li contents vary from < 1 ppm in hydrogenetic crusts to 1422 ppm (up to 1188 ppm measured here) in hydrothermal deposits. Hydrated Li ions in seawater and hydrothermal fluids are preferentially sorbed on the negatively charged surface of MnO2 by coulombic force. Hence, the abundant Li in hydrothermal deposits is mainly associated with the dominant phase, MnO2. The surface of amorphous FeOOH holds a slightly positive charge and attracts little Li, as demonstrated by data for hydrothermal Fe oxyhydroxide. Loosely sorbed Li in both hydrogenetic crusts and hydrothermal deposits exhibit Li isotopic compositions that resemble that of modern seawater. We infer that the hydrothermally derived Li scavenged onto the surface of MnO2 freely exchanged with ambient seawater, thereby losing its original isotopic signature. Li in the tightly bound sites is always isotopically lighter than that in the loosely bound fraction, suggesting that the isotopic fractionation occurred during formation of chemical bonds in the oxide and oxyhydroxide structures. Sr isotopes also show evidence of re-equilibration with seawater after deposition. Because of their mobility, Li and Sr in the ferromanganese crusts do not faithfully record secular variations in the isotopic compositions of seawater. However, Li content can be a useful proxy for the hydrothermal history of ocean basins. Based on the Li concentrations of the globally distributed hydrogenetic and hydrothermal samples, we estimate a scavenging flux of Li that is insignificant compared to the hydrothermal flux and river input to the ocean.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of detecting a hot spot primarily due to spoilage of high moisture corn in a stored grain bulk with a CO2 sensor installed in the headspace of the bill compared to detecting with temperature cables. Three experimental trials were conducted in a 12.5-t pilot-scale bill from September 2001 to March 2002. A hot spot in the grain bulk was initiated by dripping a controlled amount of water into a confined grain mass held in five layers of cylindrical mesh trays within the grain bulk. Temperature sensors in the core of the hot spot formation monitored its progress and confirmed biological activity, which paralleled the increasing CO2 concentration recorded by the CO2 sensor in the headspace of the bill. CO2 concentrations in the bin headspace rose from the initial base level of 500 to 1500 ppm for Trial 1, 1700 ppm for Trial 2, and 2300 ppm for Trial 3 and were recorded after 400, 600, and 1800 h, respectively. There was a strong positive linear correlation between the rise in headspace CO2 concentration and the parallel rise in temperature recorded by sensors in the core of the hot spot during all three trials. Field tests of spoilage detection with a CO2 sensor conducted in 33,000- to 51,000-t grain piles and a 12,500-t cylindrical steel tank with stored corn indicated that a CO2 sensor was effective in detecting the occurrence of spoilage it? the stored grain and detected spoilage earlier than temperature cables. Spoilage detection was effective either by measuring CO2 concentration of the air stream from a negative draft aeration duct with a handheld CO2 sensor, or by installing a wall-mounted CO2 sensor in the tank headspace. Our results show that temperature cables alone might not be a reliable indicator of stored grain conditions and CO2 sensors could be used as an additional complimentary tool for stored grain management.

AB  - An SO2 continuous monitor consisting of a commercially available pulsed UV fluorescence instrument with zero and span gas calibration was installed at the summit of Mt. Fuji (3776 m asl) in September 2002. The system produces data with a time resolution comparable with other trace gases. The instrumental feasibility was tested onsite, and the SO2 concentration level at the summit was thereafter routinely observed. The present detection capability of the system, expressed in terms of the critical level (L-c, definition by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and International Organization for Standardization), was estimated to be about 0.05 ppbv. Thus it was difficult to observe the temporal change of very low background SO2. However, the system is satisfactory for observing episodic transport of SO2, particularly during winter. No high SO2 episodes were observed during summer, in contrast to winter. One extraordinary episode was observed in late October 2003, the only one attributable to the Miyake-jima SO2 volcanic plume. High SO2 episodes were more evident (with longer duration and higher concentration level) in February 2003 among the winter months observed. Typical February conditions were determined using backward trajectory, a surface weather map, and other indicators. A comparison of the temporal changes in SO2, CO, and Rn-222 concentrations in the winter months suggests that these gases in the free troposphere over Japan may have been transported together in most cases from the same source regions somewhere in the Asian continent. The correlation between SO2 and Rn-222 in such episodes may also suggest a short timescale for transport from the source to Mt. Fuji of within a few days. The chemical time series data of SO2 at Mt. Fuji is important for understanding the free tropospheric chemical nature, such as the Asian outflow over the North Pacific.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the lipid class content of larval stages of the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus during development and to examine the potential effects of varying feeding regimes on larval lipid content, growth, survival, settlement behavior, and survival of postlarval stage. The potential of lipid class ratios to forecast larval growth, survival, settlement behavior, and success was examined. At the start of exogenous feeding (day 4) three diets, which differed in triacylglycerol (TAG) content, were applied. Diet A consisted of Isochrysis sp. and Pavlova lutheri, diet B was a mix of Isochrysis sp. and Chaetoceros muelleri, and diet C consisted of the same two species, but C. muelleri was grown under silicate deprivation to enhance TAG accumulation. Larvae were periodically sampled for lipid class analysis, growth measurement and survival assessment. Behavior of pediveliger larvae for each diet was recorded using an endoscopic camera during settlement. Experiments were replicated twice and repeated 1 mo later. Our study shows that TAG level in larval food was positively correlated with growth rate, larval TAG content and, as a consequence, larval "quality," as measured by TAG-sterol (ST) or TAG-phospholipid (PL) ratios, prior to settlement. A positive relation between number of competent larvae produced and larval quality at day 8 was found, suggesting that survival at competency was partly explained by the recovery efficiency of energetic reserves as TAG after embryogenesis. Higher growth rates obtained with the diet enriched with TAG reflect its high caloric content and the presence of sufficient essential fatty acids. TAG-ST ratio of competent larvae was negatively correlated with settlement success (day 40). High quality larvae explore the same period of time whatever their age, whereas low quality larvae decrease exploration time with age. Consequently, the low settlement success observed in our experiments with high quality larvae might reflect delayed metamorphosis in response to poor environmental conditions.

AB  - Today farmers have several constraints to take into account in managing their crops: (i) competitiveness: productivity must be maintained or increased whereas inputs must be decreased, (ii) the environmental consequences of cultural practices: pesticide and fertilizer use must be decreased, and (iii) product quality must be improved and nitrogen nutrition is an important factor in harvest quality. These new constraints sometimes conflict: maximum yield is often obtained with large amounts of N, increasing the risks of N leaching. The determination of rates and dates for nitrogen application must become more precise in this context. Tools are required for the forecasting of crop requirements, the diagnosis of N deficiencies during the crop cycle and breeding of new adapted varieties. Models and diagnosis indicators have been developed to meet these needs, but those relating to nitrogen are often based on empirical relationships. Moreover, the available models and indicators often fail to account for cultivar-specific responses. The improvement of agronomic tools and the breeding of new varieties adapted to new cropping systems should be based on a thorough understanding of the key metabolic processes involved, and the relative contributions of these processes to yield determination in conditions of fluctuating N supply. For both purposes, more information is required about plant and crop N economy. In this paper, the way in which N absorption and use within the plant and crop, plant responses to deficiencies and excesses of nitrogen are taken into account in major agronomic models is described first. The level of sophistication of the modules comprising these models depends on operational objectives. Secondly, the ways in which the most recent molecular plant physiology findings can, and indeed should, be integrated into models at the crop and crop cycle levels are described. The potential value of this approach for improving current agronomic models and diagnostic tools, and for breeding more efficient varieties is also discussed.

AB  - Rates of oxygen consumption are determined by fitting simulated oxygen concentrations to observations from a medium-resolution survey of the Eastern Mediterranean in 1987 (METEOR cruise M5/6). The simulations are obtained with a previously described two-dimensional kinematic model of the sea, which is newly calibrated using concurrent hydrographic and tracer data, and with oxygen consumption as a function of depth being parameterized following previous work. The consumption rate is obtained as R(z) = 22 (z/100)(-2) + 0.31 mu mol/(kg yr) for z < 1000 m, and R = 0.53 <mu>mol/(kg yr) for z greater than or equal to 1000 m. For the waters below about 700 m depth, the uncertainty in R is approximately +/- 35%. Significant error contributions arise from the oxygen concentration of the waters newly supplied to the deep waters, and from possible deviations from a steady state in circulation and in oxygen cycling. The upper ocean rates are rather more uncertain, but they are compatible with rates from the literature. The deduced deep-water oxygen consumption rate is considerably higher than the rates found in previous deep-ocean work. Such rather high rates, which possibly are related to the comparatively high temperatures of the deep waters, have repercussions in various contexts, e.g. in the assessment of environmental conditions in the past that led to the formation of sapropel layers. The updated circulation model yields a deep-water renewal rate for the Eastern Mediterranean only moderately different from a previous value. The rate actually replenishing the deep regime amounts to 5.1 x 10(5) m(3)/s (+/- 20%), of which 2.8 x 10(5) m(3)/s (+/- 30%) are recirculated deep water. Convective renewal of the deep regime (> 1200 m depth) by the combined addition of surface and intermediate waters requires 150 years (+/- 30%). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To examine the combined effects of photoperiod and body size on off-season parr-smelt transformation and post-smelt growth, groups of small and large graded potential Atlantic salmon smolts (initial size 10 and 23 g) were raised under four different photoperiods between 26 July and 14 November. Photoperiod treatments included a 10 months phase-advance of simulated natural photoperiod (SNPa, from LD12:12 to LD24:0 over 16 weeks); two square wave photoperiod regimes; which were continuously light interrupted by LD12:12 for 9 (9) or 12 (12) weeks, respectively; and continuous light (LD24:0). Photoperiod manipulation significantly influenced growth and hypo-osmoregulatory ability. Between July and November, smolts raised on SNPa and LD12:12 (9) showed an increase in seawater tolerance, concurrent with an increase in Na+, K+-ATPase activity and a decrease in condition factor (CF). No differences in plasma chloride levels were seen among the small and large graded smolts (SG and LG), whereas a higher Na+ K+-ATPase activity was recorded in the small smolts at weeks 12, 14, and 16. Higher growth rates were seen in the small smolts during the freshwater period. Continuous light increased growth in freshwater, but interfered with smolt development. Following transfer to seawater, both SG and LG previously held under SNPa and LD12:12 (9) grew better than the fish reared under LD24:0, which showed a decrease in growth. The high growth rates in seawater in the SNPa and LD12:12 (9) groups concur with the good smolt status prior to transfer. Our findings indicate that both SNPa and LD12:12 (9) can be recommended in the production of off-season salmon smolts and among the smolt parameters monitored, gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity appears to be the most reliable indicator of smolt status.

AB  - I collected data on 27 pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) populations in eastern and central Ontario and conducted a transplant experiment with one of these populations to test growth and competition-related predictions of several life history models. The predictions are that early maturity and high gonadal investment will occur: (1) in large and fast-growing juveniles; (2) in populations with low adult:juvenile growth ratios; (3) in populations with low density; and (4) in the absence of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a competing congener. Predictions 1 and 4 were fully supported and Prediction 2 was partly supported, but Prediction 3 was not. The earliest maturing juveniles within populations were significantly larger than conspecifics of the same age that did not mature. Females from a lake population that were transplanted into a fishless pond exhibited both significantly faster growth and a significantly higher gonad to body mass ratio (gonadosomatic index) than females living in the lake. At the population level, juvenile growth was significantly correlated with age at maturity (r = -0.53), but not with gonadosomatic index, whereas the Adult: Juvenile Growth Ratio showed a significant, negative correlation with gonadosomatic index (r = -0.66), but not with mean age at maturity. Mean age at maturity showed a stronger correlation with the indicator of life-span and adult survival rate (r = 0.74), suggesting that mortality is more important than growth in the shaping of reproductive life histories of pumpkinseed.
   High population density was associated with early maturity and high gonadal investment, the opposite of what was predicted. However, pumpkinseed populations that co-occurred with bluegills did mature significantly later and at a larger size and tended to have a lower gonadal investment than populations living in waterbodies without bluegills. This difference in reproductive patterns in the presence of bluegill is consistent with two-stage life history theory and may be the result of a direct effect of bluegills on pumpkinseed growth and survivorship, as well as differences in environmental conditions where the two species do or do not co-occur.

AB  - The composition, stability constants and molar absorption coefficients of the chelates of thulium, ytterbium, lutetium and thorium ions with Semi-xylenol Orange (SXO) are determined spectrophotometrically in a medium of hexamine, and chloroacetate buffer. In the thulium, ytterbium, lutetium and thorium-Semi-xylenol Orange systems, Tm(SXO), Yb(SXO), Lu(SXO) and Th(SXO) chelates are formed with logarithmic overall stability constants of 12.48+/-0.01, 12.55+/-0.01, 12.94+/-0.015 and 22.16+/-0.01 and molar absorption coefficients of 2.22x10(4) (530 nm), 2.17x10(4) (532 nm), 2.25x10(4) (530 nm) and 3.33x10(4) (535 nm) dm3 mol-1 cm-1 respectively.
   The precision and accuracy attainable in direct spectrophotometric titrations of the Tm3+, Yb3+, Lu3+ and Th4+ separately and the successive determination of each of the three rare earths and Th4+ ion with a 0.001 mol dm-3 solutions of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and PbCl2 of the same concentration using Semi-xylenol Orange (SXO) as a metallochromic indicator have been studied. Thorium (IV) is initially titrated directly at pH 2 (535 nm). At the thorium end-point the pH is adjusted to 5.6-5.8 by adding hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) buffer and an excess of DTPA is added and Tm3+ (or Yb3+ or Lu3+) is determined by back-titration with standard PbCl2 solution (490 nm). Interferences of different anions, cations and organic acids on the spectrophotometric micro-titration of Th4+ and Tm3+ Yb3+ and Lu3+ are also investigated.
   Spectrophotometric determination of Tm3+, Yb3+, LU3+ and Th4+ individually using SXO at the optimum conditions of maximum colour development have been carried out. Thorium has been determined spectrophotoMetrically in three different artificial samples with lutetium Similar to those of monazite mineral. Ytterbium (III) has been determined in three different laboratory synthesized samples with Ca2+ and Fe3+ similar to those of euxenite mineral which occurs in nature and the results were reproducible and satisfactory.

AB  - Loss of sea ice brought on by climate change affects polar bear Ursus maritimus access to prey. Here we investigated variation in feeding habits of the Baffin Bay (BB) polar bear subpopulation in relation to sea ice, habitat use, season, and demography using hair carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (delta S-34) stable isotope values and total mercury (THg) concentrations as ecological tracers. We analyzed hair samples from BB polar bears (n = 131) of all age and sex classes live-captured in West Greenland during the spring in 2009-2013. BB polar bears occupied a narrow isotopic space, suggesting limited variation in carbon sources and trophic position within the subpopulation. THg concentrations (median +/- SE: 5.1 +/- 0.2, range: 0.3-12.5 mu g g(-1) dry weight, DW) were related to age class, and nearly half exceeded the suggested threshold for neurological effects in polar bears at 5.4 mu g g(-1) DW. Although distinct coastal and offshore space-use strategies have been reported for BB polar bears, our results suggest that both strategies lead to similar carbon sources and trophic positions. We found seasonal variation in delta C-13 and delta S-34 across both space-use strategies, with delta S-34 suggesting that all BB polar bears may prey on a higher proportion of benthic-feeding bearded seals Erignathus barbatus in late summer relative to spring. Despite wide fluctuations in inter-annual sea ice conditions and differences in space-use strategies among individuals, stable isotope values and THg concentrations suggested limited variation in feeding habits among BB polar bears. The variation of habitat tracers (delta C-13 and delta S-34) was related to season, whereas trophic tracer (delta N-15 and THg) variation was driven by demographic group. The specialized BB polar bear diet suggests limited feeding plasticity under continued climate warming.

AB  - Featured Application and Simple Summary
   The work hold the wide prospect of understanding of wall rocks alteration zonation and of formation of high-grade iron ore bodies through hyperspectral mapping, which can be indicator of water-rock reaction and vector of deposit exploration.
   Research on wall rock alteration is of great importance to the understanding and exploration of ore deposits. The microscopic changes of the same mineral in different alteration zones can provide information about the migration and enrichment of ore-forming elements. In this paper, a typical profile of a high-grade iron ore body in Gongchangling iron deposit was investigated and sampled. The samples were checked by polarized microscopy, and alterations zonation were delineated according to the hydrothermal mineral assemblages and paragenesis. Moreover, hyperspectral images of wall rocks from each alteration zone were obtained by Norsk Elektro Optikk (NEO) HySpex-320 m imaging system. A customer Interactive Data Language (IDL) software package was used to process the images, and spectral features were extracted from the selected samples. The results indicate that spectral characteristics manifest obviously regular variations; i.e., from proximal to distal for the high-grade iron ore body, the wavelengths at ca. 1200 nm of chlorite and garnet, which accounts for most of the hydrothermal alteration minerals, become longer, and the absorption depths gradually smaller. The spectral features at 1200 nm of chlorite and garnet are always caused by the crystal field effect of Fe2+; therefore, the wavelength variations indicate the increase of Fe2+ and a reduced environment, which can provide more detailed information about the metallogeny and water-rock interaction. Since the hyperspectral features of the altered rocks can disclose unique mineralogical and structural information, the conventional classification of alteration zonation should be combined with the spectral feature, i.e., spectral alteration zonation, which is of great help to the understanding of the forming conditions of wall rock alteration and also the high-grade iron ore bodies.

AB  - The effects of climatic warming on tropical streams have received little attention, and field studies of such changes are generally lacking. Drifting insects from a Hong Kong forest stream were sampled for 36 months between 2013 and 2016, and compared with samples collected using identical methods in 1983-84. Mean air temperatures rose by similar to 0.5 degrees C (0.17 degrees C per decade) over this period. The stream drained an uninhabited protected area, so no climate-change effects were confounded by anthropogenic disturbance. In total, 105 taxa and >77,000 individuals were collected. Richness of samples in the historic and contemporary datasets did not differ, but true diversity of drifting insects was highest in 1983-84, and declined between 2013-14 and 2015-16. There was considerable disparity in assemblage composition between 1983-84 and 2013-16, and smaller between-year changes in the contemporary dataset. Nine indicator species of the historic dataset were identified. Most were mayflies, particularly Baetidae, which were greatly reduced in relative abundance in 2013-16. Diptera became more numerous, and tanypodine chironomids were the sole contemporary indicator taxon. Relative abundance of eight of 19 drifting species (comprising 60% of total insects) was lower in 2013-16, when the dominant baetid mayfly during 1983-84 had declined by almost 90%; only one of the 19 species occurred at higher abundance. Eight species were affected by seasonal temperature variability, but these responses were not correlated with any tendency to exhibit long-term changes in abundance. Substantial shifts in composition, including declines in mayfly relative abundance and assemblage diversity, occurred after three decades of warming, despite the broad annual range of stream temperatures (similar to 16 degrees C) in Hong Kong. This contradicts the well-known prediction that organisms from variable climates have evolved wider thermal tolerances that reflect prevailing environmental conditions. The observed compositional reorganization indicates that variability, rather than stability, may be typical of undisturbed tropical stream communities.

AB  - Soil fertility is the result of interactions between the physical and chemical soil attributes, affecting its biological component, which in turn feeds back to the physical and chemical soil attributes. The No-Till System (NTS) is the main modality of Conservation Agriculture, essential to achieving farming sustainability and conserving soil fertility. However, farmers often fail to adopt the three principles of NTS: (a) minimum mechanical soil disturbance, (b) permanent soil cover and (c) plant diversification; therefore, the system currently requires a quality measurement. The NTS Participatory Quality Index (PQI) is a tool to qualify and monitor the farm system and requires the participation of the farmers themselves. The aim of this study was to assess key soil quality attributes associated with the implementation of PQI methodology during a large-scale dissemination campaign in areas under NTS in Parana State, Brazil (Parana River Watershed 3), in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PQI as a tool to drive the improvement of farmers' management. Spearman's correlation coefficients were established between PQI scores and the chemical and physical soil attributes, as well as the indicators incorporated into the PQI. Data were obtained in the Parana River Watershed 3 from 40 areas of farmland under different farm systems. Crop rotation was the primary management approach that improved soil and agricultural management quality under Brazilian conditions, and confirmed in the study region. The NTS PQI provided a way to evaluate soil management quality in the areas assessed. The rapid soil structure diagnosis proved to be a good tool for assessing soil structure. Highlights
   Farmers often fail to adopt the principles of NTS; therefore, the system requires a quality measurement. A classification system to help farmers and agricultural professionals make good soil management decisions was proposed. The tool was trialed on 40 areas of farmland under different farm systems in the Parana River Watershed 3. The NTS Participatory Quality Index (PQI) was used to successfully evaluate soil management quality.

AB  - 'Huaxin' is a new high-yielding timber cultivar of Camellia oleifera of high economic value, and has been widely cultivated in the red soil hilly region of Hunan Province of the People's Republic of China in recent years. However, its quality and production are severely affected by low temperatures during flowering. To find genes related to cold tolerance and further explore new candidategenes for chilling-tolerance, Illumina NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) technology was used to perform transcriptomic analyses of C. oleifera 'Huaxin' leaves under long-term cold stress. Nine cDNA libraries were sequenced, and 58.31 Gb high-quality clean reads were obtained with an average of 5.92 Gb reads for each sample. A total of 191,150 transcripts were obtained after assembly. Among them, 100,703 unigenes were generated, and 44,610 unigenes were annotated. In total, 1564 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified both in the A_B and A_C gene sets. In the current study, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and revealed a group of cold-responsive genes related to hormone regulation, photosynthesis, membrane systems, and osmoregulation; these genes encoded many key proteins in plant biological processes, such as serine/threonine-protein kinase (STPK), transcription factors (TFs), fatty acid desaturase (FAD), lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs), soluble sugars synthetases, and flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes. Some physiological indicators of C. oleifera 'Huaxin' were determined under three temperature conditions, and the results were consistent with the molecular sequencing. In addition, the expression levels of 12 DEGs were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In summary, the results of DEGs analysis together with qRT-PCR tests contribute to the understanding of cold tolerance and further exploring new candidate genes for chilling-tolerance in molecular breeding programs of C. oleifera 'Huaxin'.

AB  - Heat stress causes lipid peroxidation in poultry, necessitating antioxidant administration. The experiment evaluated the modulating effects of betaine and ascorbic acid (AA) on indoor behavior and some performance parameters of broiler chickens during the hot-dry season. Experimental groups were: Group I (control) was daily given sterile water; Group II, betaine at 250 mg/kg; Group III, AA (50 mg/kg), and Group IV, betaine (250 mg/kg) + AA (50 mg/kg), orally for 42 days. The natural occurring dry-bulb temperature (28.0-37.0 degrees C), relative humidity (69.0-93.0%), and temperature-humidity index (27.9-36.1 degrees C) were predominantly outside the thermo-neutral zone for broiler chickens, indicating heat stress conditions. Scan test, used to assess the percentage of birds sitting/lying, panting, feeding, drinking and spreading wings, was performed at 06:00 h, 13:00 h and 18:00 h on each of days 35 and 42. Feed intakes (FD), water consumption (WC), body weight, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed-to-gain ratio (FGR) were obtained. Betaine + AA reduced (P < 0.05) percentage of birds panting; AA decreased (P < 0.05) percentage of birds spreading wing, compared with control. Finisher phase: betaine and/or AA, decreased FGR, increased ADG (P < 0.05); betaine reduced (P < 0.01) FD compared with control. Grower phase: betaine, either alone or with AA, lowered FGR and FD (P < 0.01); AA reduced (P < 0.01) FD, compared with control. Starter phase: betaine and/or AA decreased WC (P < 0.05); AA lowered FGR, compared with controls. Betaine administration decreased (P < 0.05) FD at 4 week-old, but its administration, either alone or with AA, reduced WC at 1 week-old, compared with control. Overall, betaine and/or AA group lowered FGR compared with controls. In conclusion, administration of betaine and/or AA to broiler chickens modulated indoor behavior, some performance indicators and water consumption during the hot-dry season.

AB  - Solar disinfection (SODIS) of urban wastewater can be a suitable technology for improving the microbiological quality of reclaimed water as a complement to other extensive and environmentally friendly technologies such as microalgae biotreatment. The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating the SODIS technology at the end of a pilot scale urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) where the processes are based on microalgae biotechnology and comprising three Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB, 20 m(3) each one) reactor, six High Rate Algal Ponds (HRAP, 32 m(2) each one), and a Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF, 1 m(3)) unit. E. coli concentration was monitored at the effluent of the different units (UASB, HRAP, DAF) of the pilot WWTP. The efficiency of the SODIS process was studied for the inactivation of three of the commonly employed indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens) using a compound parabolic collector (CPC) for five months under various conditions of irradiance and temperature.
   E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were more effectively disinfected by the SODIS unit (2.9 and 2.5 logarithms of reduction on average, respectively) than by the HRAP (2 and 1.1) or the DAF (0.9 and 0.1). On the contrary, the DAF technology achieved better reduction rates of C. perfringens (1.7) than the SODIS (0.9) and the HRAP (0.1). No re-growth of any microorganisms was detected during dark storage after the SODIS treatment.
   Incorporating a SODIS unit after the non-conventional WWTP processes substantially increases the possibilities for reuse of the treated water after receiving a cumulative UV radiation dose of 25W.h/m(2) (50 min of normalized time of solar illumination). The surface requirement of the SODIS equipment would be 3.5 times smaller than the HRAP's surface. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Development of water infrastructure benefits water security and agriculture but poses risks to habitat and aquatic fauna. Wyaralong Dam was constructed on Teviot Brook in 2010 to provide future urban water supplies for South East Queensland, Australia. Construction of the dam created a large impoundment area and environmental impact assessment predicted significant impacts upon resident freshwater turtle species and their habitats. Differences in habitat requirements, life-history characteristics and sensitivity to change between the Macquarie River turtle (Emydura macquarii macquarii) and the common saw-shelled turtle (Myuchelys latisternum) were expected to influence the impact of the dam on the spatial and temporal abundance of these species. The relative abundance of each species was monitored at sites located within, upstream and downstream of the impoundment across wet and dry seasons during the dam's first five years of operation. The results of this monitoring program indicate that spatial and temporal variability in the relative abundance of E. macquarii macquarii and M. latisternum occurred during the study but not all expected impacts were realised. Contrary to expectation, the relative abundance of E. macquarii macquarii did not increase over time within, upstream or downstream of the dam. M. latisternum showed greater temporal variability at some sites; however, no clear relationship between relative abundance and operational years was observed during the monitoring program. Spatial variability in relative abundance between sites was dependent upon season, with trends generally consistent across both turtle species. Where differences between species were observed, these are suspected to have resulted from the influence of environmental conditions on species-specific movement behaviours. The monitoring program confirmed the use of the upper limits of the impoundment and the plunge pool below the dam wall by both turtle species but relative abundance within the main body of the impoundment remained low throughout monitoring. The results of the study allow for consideration of the suitability of predefined management measures and the development of recommendations for future monitoring programs prescribed for water infrastructure developments.

AB  - One of the determining factors in the development of modern teaching is social intelligence of the teacher, his personal qualities and characteristics. The formation of student's philosophical principles during university training indicates the training quality and it is an important condition of future teacher's successful professional activity. In this regard, the authors investigated the gender peculiarities of the dynamics of personal potential indicators. Students of the Kuibyshev branch of Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University aged 1721 years (50 female and 24 male students) participated in this research.
   An empirical study of students' personal qualities that determine their personal potential was made using the following psychological tests: "Self-determination of personality", "Selforganization activity", "Vitality", "Life Satisfaction", "Differential diagnostics of reflexivity", "Quality of life and satisfaction", "Anchor career".
   As a result, in both groups the average level of performance on various scales ranges from low to medium relative to normative values, established for "University"cities. Besides, the lack of indicators dynamics on "Resilience"scale is noted in both groups. Gender differences in the dynamics of the indices are determined on "Life satisfaction", "Entrepreneurship", "Authenticity" "Soul-searching"scales. Female students showed negative dynamics of these indicators. On "Index of purpose", "Index of rationality", "Total figure of self-organization activities", "Freedom", "Expression"and "Activity"scales male students had positive dynamics of the indicators, although on "Reflexivity Index"and "Quasireverse"scales their dynamics was negative. On "Physical health", "Experience", "Index of life satisfaction and quality of life" scales female students showed negative dynamics of the indicators, while male students showed positive dynamics of the indicators.
   The results of the research demonstrate that there are significant gender differences in dynamics of personal potential indicators. So we may assume that the specific of changes in students' psychosocial well-being during the period of university studies depends not only on the educational environment of a small university, but also on social, economic and cultural development of the region as a whole.

AB  - The relevance of the topic of this article stems from the predicament of excise duties, as a form of indirect tax, applied to consumer goods affecting human health and environment while at the same dine acting as a key source of state budget revenues. Research problem is the way of assessing whether excise duties are an effective measure in view of state goals. The aim of this paper is to design the model for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals. The algorithm behind the theoretical research includes summarised and systematised criteria, indicators and methods for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals. Information contained in the databases of Eurostat, OECD and the Lithuanian Department of Statistics has been used for the research. The designed model for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals provides the possibility to generate the respective quantitative estimate. Nonetheless, the generated estimate would be difficult to interpret due to the absence of any criteria suggesting whether the indicator value should be viewed as positive vs. negative, good vs. bad.
   It would be reasonable to compare the resulting indicator of effectiveness assessment of excise duties with the effectiveness indicator of the excise tax in other countries. Accordingly, comparative assessment of the excise duties effectiveness indicator in Lithuania vs. equivalent indicator in Poland and Slovakia has been conducted. Not only the common final estimate, but also partial integrated indicators may be employed for the analysis and assessment of the effectiveness of excise duties in view of state goals. These indicators point to the quantitative estimate of the assessment criteria of a certain aspect. Variation of a certain criterion estimate over time (dynamics) and its effect on the complex integrated indicator could be analysed. Therefore, multicriteria model for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals enables adopting reasonable and equitable decisions on improvement of excise taxes. The designed multicriteria assessment model can also be adjusted for varying conditions by adding additional indicators or removing certain indicators that have already been included.

AB  - The Lower Silurian Qusaiba Hot Shales (QHS) are proven source rocks for oil within the Paleozoic, and possibly some of the Mesozoic, reservoirs in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, these shales have oil shale potential where they are immature and shallow enough for mining, as well as unconventional shale oil and shale gas potential, in areas where they are within oil-maturity and gas-maturity levels, respectively. The QHS were deposited in relatively shallow marine environments under anoxic water conditions, resulting in accumulation of amorphous kerogen, organic-walled graptolites and acritarchs. Across the Arabian Basin, organic matter quality does not show much variation for the QHS, but the maturity varies greatly as a result of varying burial history.
   Thermal maturity assessment of shale source rocks that lack vitrinite, such as the Qusaiba Hot shales, continues to be challenging, especially where conflicting measurements are obtained from different sources.
   This paper presents an integrated assessment of QHS thermal maturity parameters, based on cores from 13 carefully selected boreholes that - based on regional basin models - are believed to cover a wide maturity range (ca. 0.5 to 2.0% Ro). We conducted some analyses on kerogen (maceral petrography, graptolite reflectance, UV-fluorescence, whole rock pyrolysis, Raman spectroscopy of graptolite) and other analyses on bitumen extracts (GC and GC-MS of saturate and aromatic fractions, and FTIR spectroscopy of the asphaltene fraction). We show that using many thermal maturity parameters reduces uncertainty significantly, and we therefore recommend that graptolite reflectance analyses should be conducted in support of other maturity indicators. Proper reflectivity measurements of the graptolites set the reference for comparison of other maturity parameters obtained from petrographic, geochemical, and spectroscopic techniques. Our work provides a template by which Qusaiba thermal maturity can be more accurately estimated when only a limited set of maturity parameters is available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms are a common component of surface water reaching rivers along with sewage. If present in small quantities, they are not a threat to the health and life of humans, but in larger quantities can be a pathogenic factor causing much discomfort. The amount of pathogenic bacteria in river waters varies depending on various factors such as the size of the stream, the season, water level, degree of eutrophication of the watercourse and its tributaries, or geographical area through which the river flows and the ability of a watercourse to self-clean. In view of the risks that may be caused by microorganisms pathogenic to humans and animals, a constant monitoring of their quantity in surface waters has been carried out. As follows from studies conducted for the past several years (1999-2010), the number of coliforms and thermo-tolerant coliforms in Wisloka River water near Mielec showed a downward trend, while that of fecal enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis) a growing tendency. At that time there was no evidence of Salmonella. In almost the whole study period, pollution of human origin exerted a major impact on the sanitary conditions of tested water. Only in 2006 were they of the zoonotic nature. Analyzed sanitation parameters of surface water in the Wisloka River collected in a water intake point for the city of Mielec showed high variability, depending on the season and water pH. Coliform bacteria showed the highest number at the lowest pH (<= 7.0). There was very high, positive correlation (r(x,y) >0.7) between the number of microorganisms and selected physicochemical indicators of water quality. Count of coliform bacteria and thermo-tolerant coliform type increased along with the increase in the value of electrolytic conductivity. The largest correlation (r(x,y) = 0.85) was recorded between the number of fecal enterococci and the level of BOD5 indicator.
