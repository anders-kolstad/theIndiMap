AB  - Six benthic biotic indices (Shannon-Wiener H'log(2), W-statistics, BOPA, BENTIX, AMBI and M-AMBI), based on different ecological principles, were applied to assess the health of variously disturbed tropical intertidal habitats of the Port Blair coastline. A total of 243 replicate samples were collected during the dry period (January, February and March) of 2014-2016. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, sediment pH, total organic matter content and texture were analysed. A high mean abundance of opportunistic species (Orbinia sp. 748, Capitella singularis 237 and Armandia sp. 114 ind. m(-2)) was observed at Phoenix Bay, a gradual decline in diversity at Junglighat and a comparatively high diversity and moderate biomass at Wandoor, reflecting a human pressure gradient. Results showed an annual decline of benthic quality from 2014 to 2016 (good to moderate). Overall BOPA failed to distinguish the magnitude of disturbances, while the rest of the indices classified the benthic quality from undisturbed/high (WD), slightly disturbed/good (JG), to moderately disturbed/moderate to poor (PB). The subjective analysis demonstrated that the urban centres corresponded to disturbed benthic communities of dominant first and second order opportunistic species, while sensitive (EGI) and indifferent (EGII) were associated with the least disturbed or undisturbed site. The study successfully demonstrated the performance of temperate indices in intertidal habitats against the mild organic enrichment. However, for an effective assessment, setting natural reference conditions and sampling in stable dry periods (strong seasonality in tropics) is desirable. In order to test the performance of biotic indices, a long-term monitoring approach of taking abiotic and biotic descriptors into account is recommended.

AB  - Mediterranean streams exhibit highly variable inter-annual and seasonal discharge patterns, exerting an evolutionary pressure that constrains biological communities. Due to climate change, including a decrease in summer rainfall, and concurrent water resource pressures, stream intermittence is increasing in the Mediterranean Basin. In this context, I explored the potential of benthic invertebrate taxa and their biological traits to be used as indicators of different hydrological conditions. I characterized the flow intermittence gradient along a small Mediterranean stream into three aquatic regimes: perennial (P), intermittent with summer pools (IP), and intermittent with dry channels (ID). Then, I compared the performance of taxonomic and trait-based approaches in characterizing the effects of flow intermittence on benthic invertebrate community patterns in two sampling periods: (1) during the flowing period, when pool-riffle sequences were well-established, and (2) during the dry phase, when either isolated pools or dry channels occurred at the intermittent sites. Both the taxonomic and trait composition of communities differed among sites according to their aquatic regime, especially ID sites, which differed considerably from P and IP sites. Organisms from ID sites were characterized by life-history adaptations to flow intermittence (e.g. short life cycles, resistant forms). No significant difference in traits or taxa was observed between P and IP sites in either sampling period. The trait-based approach was a more sensitive indicator of the aquatic regime, emphasizing the need to conduct further research into the development of trait-based biomonitoring and conservation tools for intermittent streams.

AB  - This article is focused on the determination of lidocaine hydrochloride as a local anaesthetic drug. A potentiometric method based on modified screen-printed and modified carbon paste ion-selective electrodes was described for the determination of lidocaine hydrochloride in different pharmaceutical preparations and biological fluids (urine and serum). It was based on potentiometric titration of lidocaine hydrochloride using modified screen-printed and carbon paste electrodes as end point indicator sensors. The influences of the paste composition, different conditioning parameters and foreign ions on the electrodes performance were investigated and response times of the electrodes were studied. The electrodes showed Nernstian response of 58.9 and 57.5 mV decade(-1) in the concentration range of 1x10(-7)-1x10(-2) and 6.2x10(-7)-1x10(-2) mol L-1 for modified screen-printed and carbon paste electrodes, respectively. The electrodes were found to be usable within the pH range of 2.0-8.0 and 2.0-7.5, exhibited a fast response time (about 6 and 4) low detection limit (1x10(-7) and 6.2x10(-7) mol L-1), long lifetime (6 and 4 months) and good stability for modified screen-printed (Electrode VII) and carbon paste electrodes (Electrode III), respectively. The electrodes were successfully applied for the determination of lidocaine hydrochloride in pure solutions, pharmaceutical preparation and biological fluids (urine and serum) samples. The results obtained applying these potentiometric electrodes were comparable with British pharmacopeia. The method validation parameters were optimized and the method can be applied for routine analysis of lidocaine hydrochloride drug.

AB  - Analyzing the pattern and causes of phenotypic and genetic variation within and among populations might help to understand life history variability in plants, and to predict their responses to changing environmental conditions. Here we compare phenotypic variation and genetic diversity of the widespread herb Plantago coronopus across Europe, and evaluate their relationship with environmental and geographical factors. Genetic diversity was estimated in 18 populations from molecular markers with AFLP. Phenotypic variation was measured in a subset of 11 populations on six life history traits (plant size, plant growth, fecundity, seed mass, mucilage production and ratio between two functionally different seed morphs). To account for ecological and geographical correlates, we estimated variability in local temperature, precipitation and intraspecific competition, and accounted for the central vs. peripheral position of populations. Phenotypic variation and genetic diversity were not significantly correlated within populations throughout the species' range. Phenotypic variation was positively linked to precipitation variability, whereas genetic diversity was correlated with the position of populations, suggesting that both types of variation are shaped by different processes. Precipitation seems to have acted as a selective agent for variation within populations in most life history traits, whereas the species' post-glacial demographic history has likely reduced genetic diversity in northern peripheral populations with respect to central ones. The positive association between precipitation variability and phenotypic variation also suggests that plant populations may have higher adaptive potential in ecologically variable rather than stable environments. Our study offers an additional criterion when predicting the future performance of species under environmental changes.

AB  - Purpose - In a risk analysis system, different underlying indices often play different roles in identifying the risk scale of the total target in a system, so a concept of discriminatory weight is introduced first. With the help of discriminatory weight and membership functions, a new method for information security risk analysis is proposed. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the above issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, a concept of discriminatory weight is introduced. Second, with the help of fuzzy sets, risk scales are captured in terms of fuzzy sets (namely their membership functions). Third, a new risk analysis method involving discriminatory weights is proposed to realize a transformation from the membership degrees of the underlying indices to the membership degrees of the total target. At last, an example of information security risk analysis shows the effectiveness and feasibleness of the new method.
   Findings - The new method generalizes the weighted-average method. The comparative analysis done with respect to other two methods show that the proposed method exhibits higher classification accuracy. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied to other risk analysis system with a hierarchial.

AB  - Riverine wetlands are vulnerable ecotonal environments and are often threatened by human activities. A project supported by the Cariplo Foundation, called "Ecological and hydromorphological requalification of wetlands in the Ticino area around Pavia" (South-East Lombardy, Northern Italy), was started in 2010 with the aim of improving the chemical, bio-ecological and hydrological conditions of these wetlands. In line with the aim of this project, we selected two wetlands near the main course of the Ticino River for investigation, one of which is impacted by a combined sewer overflow from the sewerage networks which is always active (San Lanfranco (SL) wetland), whereas the other (Topo (TO) oxbow lake) is less directly impacted by anthropogenic activities. In this paper, we report the ecological situation of these two wetlands before the requalification process by investigating the way the zooplankton assemblages, considered as bio-indicators, respond to anthropogenic pressure. Overall, we collected 19 taxa: 4 cladocerans, 1 copepod and 14 rotifers. In the TO oxbow lake, we found a stable community, dominated by the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. By comparison, in the SL wetland we found a pioneer community, dominated by the juvenile stage of the copepod Thermocyclops dybowskii. The SL wetland was shown to be most urgently in need of improvement and is therefore first in line for requalification, whereas the TO oxbow lake needs less drastic measures to ensure the long-term ecological functioning of the aquatic environment. After these requalification activities, a systematic zooplankton survey will be carried out to monitor the evolution of the riverine wetlands.

AB  - Ungulate browsing affects many plant species, shifting patterns of relative abundance, plant community diversity, and ecosystem processes. Despite the strength and diversity of ungulate impacts, we lack comprehensive methods and a unified network for tracking and comparing ungulate impacts across the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes Network Office (GLN) of the National Park Service has identified white-tailed deer as a keystone herbivore that could threaten the health of Great Lakes forests. To supplement their permanent vegetation monitoring program, GLN monitors deer and moose browsing pressure on woody and herbaceous plants at nine national parks in the region. We used data from these surveys to investigate relationships among patterns of browsing across species and sites with the goal of inferring efficient and reliable indicators of ungulate impacts. We also investigated the relationships between patterns of browsing on woody vegetation and among-site variation in the presence and abundance of understory species. Our results showed that ungulates clearly prefer certain woody species, but these vary across the region in response to local community composition. Ungulate impacts on understory species are correlated with woody browsing impacts but also vary with local ecological conditions. To build a more efficient and accurate composite indicator of overall ungulate impacts, we combined data on woody plant browsing with data on the abundance of specific understory species to infer overall levels of threat from ungulate browsing. Such combined indicators improve our ability to monitor the impacts of ungulate browsing, particularly if such methods can be expanded and standardized across the region. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is essentially considered to be one of the most important indicators used for assessment of the urban thermal environment. It is quite evident that land-use/land-cover (LULC) and landscape patterns have ecological implications at varying spatial scales, which in turn influence the distribution of habitat and material/energy fluxes in the landscape. This article attempts to quantitatively analyse the complex interrelationships between urban LST and LULC landscape patterns with the purpose of elucidating their relation to landscape processes. The study employed an integrated approach involving remote-sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and landscape ecology techniques on bi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper images of Southwestern Sydney metropolitan region and the surrounding fringe, taken at approximately the same time of the year in July 1993 and July 2006. First, the LULC categories and LST were extracted from the bi-temporal images. The LST distribution and changes and LST of the LULC categories were then quantitatively analysed using landscape metrics and LST zones. The results show that large differences in temperature existed in even a single LULC category, except for variations between different LULC categories. In each LST zone, the regressive function of LST with fractional vegetation cover (FVC) indicated a significant relationship between LST and FVC. Landscape metrics of LULC categories in each zone in relation to the other zones showed changing patterns between 1993 and 2006. This study also illustrates that a method integrating retrieval of LST and FVC from remote-sensing images combined with landscape metrics provides a novel and feasible way to describe the spatial distribution and temporal variation in urban thermal patterns and associated LULC conditions in a quantitative manner.

AB  - Necker Island, a remote island located in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, provides a unique opportunity to investigate species-level algal and benthic invertebrate assemblages and assess temporal variation of coral reef ecosystems exposed to minimal anthropogenic impacts. This study provides a robust baseline of common benthic species at Necker Island and their relative abundances before any known ecological response to changing oceanographic conditions. Rapid ecological assessment (REA) methods using photoquadrat imagery from long-term monitoring sites coupled with towed-diver surveys conducted between 2002 and 2006 were analyzed to determine percentage cover of benthic organisms around the island, and macroalgal species lists were compiled from voucher specimens. Benthic substrates were typically dominated by turf algae at all sites for all years, and macroalgal and coral covers were found to be low. A total of 25 macroalgal and 11 anthozoan species was identified. Of these, 13 macroalgal species and one coral species represent new records for Necker Island. Analyses of community similarity found spatial differences among sites in 2006, as well as temporal differences between 2005 and 2006, an outcome primarily driven by significant increases in percentage cover of macroalgae and coral at one site. However, benthic communities observed during extensive towed-diver surveys around Necker Island did not identify significant differences among geographical sectors or years, suggesting that benthic communities are relatively homogeneous. Necker Island contains macroalgal and coral populations similar to those of neighboring reef systems within the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and this study provides a baseline of benthic assemblages for ongoing temporal monitoring.

AB  - The treatment and the valorization of polluted dredged sediments is an important issue. The main benefit is the saving of natural resources and the prevention of landfilling. The valorization of sediments into road base materials require an accurate assessment of their characteristics. This study addresses the mechanical and leaching tests. The Novosol (R) process has been used to treat the dredged sediment and consists in the stabilization of heavy metals using phosphate and the degradation of organics by calcination at 700 degrees C. The characterization (chemical, physical, thermal and environmental) carried out on the treated sediment shows that it is mainly composed with fine particles. The analyses have shown a low bulk density in comparison to that for standard sand. A significant total metal content and the absence of organic matter have been concluded. To evaluate the mechanical behaviour of the road materials, tensile strength and elasticity modulus have been measured. It has been seen that the introduction of treated sediments in materials treated with hydraulic binders improves the tensile strength. An environmental assessment has been made on these hydraulic-binder-treated materials thanks to a percolation test and the EN 12457-2 leaching test. The percolation test allows to evaluate the behaviour under accelerated conditions. The standard leaching test is used in order to assess pollution potential. Both tests show that the release of metallic elements is almost the same for mixtures with or without sediments. The results suggest that the use of treated sediments in road materials is not harmful and brings mechanical benefits.

AB  - Fire is a primary mode of natural disturbance in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Increased fuel loads following fire suppression and the occurrence of several large and severe fires have led to the perception that in many areas there is a greatly increased risk of high-severity fire compared with presettlement forests. To reconstruct the variability of the fire regime in the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon, we analyzed a 10-m, 2,000-y sediment core for charcoal, pollen, and sedimentological data. The record reveals a highly episodic pattern of fire in which 77% of the 68 charcoal peaks before Euro-American settlement cluster within nine distinct periods marked by a 15-y mean interval. The 11 largest charcoal peaks are significantly related to decadal-scale drought periods and are followed by pulses of minerogenic sediment suggestive of rapid sediment delivery. After logging in the 1950s, sediment load was increased fourfold compared with that from the most severe presettlement fire. Less severe fires, marked by smaller charcoal peaks and no sediment pulses, are not correlated significantly with drought periods. Pollen indicators of closed forests are consistent with fire-free periods of sufficient length to maintain dense forest and indicate a fire-triggered switch to more open conditions during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Our results indicate that over millennia fire was more episodic than revealed by nearby shorter tree-ring records and that recent severe fires have precedents during earlier drought episodes but also that sediment loads resulting from logging and road building have no precedent in earlier fire events.

AB  - The phenologies of plants and animals in snow-covered landscapes are expected to accelerate with global warming. However, there are few studies that have examined a range of unrelated taxa in alpine environments to determine whether there is commonality in the proximate causes, synchrony in timing, or the direction of any changes. Records for five alpine animal species and two alpine plant species, chosen primarily for their visibility, were examined to determine their temporal response to regional climate warming. Over the 30-year period studied, they showed an array of different phenological responses. Plant flowering appeared linked to date of snow melt, whereas animal responses varied. Although having accelerated phenologies, two migratory bird species exhibited contrary changes; one to low-altitude warming regardless of snow conditions in the alpine zone (flame robin) and the other to state of the snowpack regardless of low-altitude temperatures (Richard's pipit). By contrast, the migratory bogong moth arrived significantly later over the years with no apparent explanatory climatic cause. Although bogong moths are not responding to earlier snow melt, insectivorous predators on the ground are. This could lead to a serious mismatch in timing at different trophic levels, putting pressure on endangered vertebrates. Emergence of locally wintering insect species, March flies and Macleay's swallowtails, were not significantly related to measured climatic parameters over the study period. A consequence of the disparate responses to climate warming recorded here is the questionable value of 'indicator species' to examine the impact of climate warming on alpine ecosystems.

AB  - It is well-known that natural and anthropogenic emissions of ambient pollutants affect air quality, and as a consequence the public health Air pollution indices are commonly used to indicate the level of severity of air pollution to the public The objective of this study is the assessment of the air quality levels in the urban environment of Athens, Greece using the Air Quality Index (AQI), which presents advantages as an administrative tool for early warning in the context of public health protection The AQI is a complex Index and calculated by compounding appropriately the concentrations of surface ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m (PM10) For this purpose, available hourly data of the above ambient pollutants recorded by the Athens air pollution monitoring network, during the period 2001-2006, were analyzed for the development of the proposed index
   The temporal and spatial distribution of the mean annual AQI values within greater Athens area (GAA) is examined, and the results are analyzed in terms of the meteorological conditions The effect of wind speed and direction on AQI levels is found to be significant, among the other meteorological parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine and total solar radiation The analysis revealed that the higher values of AQI, during the warm period of the year, are strongly associated with sea breeze than with northern wind flow The knowledge of the sea breeze characteristics over GAA contributes to the comprehension of the local air quality formation levels

AB  - A 23-year-old road built with MSWI residue (mix of fly and bottom ashes) was investigated through the environmental assessment of the residue, soils (adjacent to and underlying the road) and seepage waters. The pH and ANC(4.3) of the material indicate a low carbonation and a high alkaline stock. The material leaches few trace elements. The underlying road soil shows significant effects with respect to K and Na, attributable to the MSWI residue. Effects regarding Cd, Cr, Cu and Ni are observed, yet pollution thresholds are not exceeded. Compared to groundwater thresholds. the MSWI residue percolate is of poor to very poor quality (French reference system - FWQAS) in terms of pH, K, Na, Cl(-), F(-), As and Cu. It lies above the intervention values of the Dutch Soil Protection Act (DSPA) for Cu, Ni and Pb. Downstream, water from the road shoulder (W(Sdr)) is of very poor quality with respect to Na and Cl(-), and fair to poor quality regarding K All other parameters comply with the best quality thresholds (FWQAS and DSPA). The high Cl(-) concentration Of W(sdr) would not fit for direct discharge in any watercourse. Toward a weakly-mineralised water, Cd and Cu would also be penalizing. The geometry of the road site creates penalizing conditions increasing the washing of the MSWI residue. The road structure does not cause downstream effect as regards trace elements, but effects exist for Cl(-), Na and K. Opposite downstream effects are observed (Ca, Mg, Mn and SO(4)(2-)) due to farming treatments and the nature of the local soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A catalytic kinetic method is described for the determination of Se(IV), Se(VI) and total inorganic selenium in water based on the catalytic effect of Se(IV) on the reduction of bromate by hydrazine dihydrochloride in acidic media. The generated bromine decolorized methyl orange (MO) and the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 507nm as a function of time. The initial rate and fixed time methods were adopted for the determination and speciation of inorganic selenium. Under two optimum conditions, the calibration graphs are linear in the range 0-126.3 and 0-789.6 mu gL(-1) of Se(IV) for the initial rate method and 0-315.8 and 0-789.6 mu gL(-1) of Se(IV) for the fixed time method. The detection limits were 1.3 and 14.7 mu gL(-1) for the initial rate and fixed time methods, respectively. The proposed methods were validated statistically and through recovery studies in environmental water samples. The relative standard deviation in the determination of 31.6-94.8 mu gL(-1) of Se(IV) and Se(VI) was less than 6%. Analyses of standard reference materials for selenium using initial rate and fixed time methods showed that the proposed methods have good accuracy. Se([V),Se(VI) and total inorganic selenium in environmental water samples have been successfully determined by this method after selective reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lake Toolibin, an ephemeral lake in the agricultural zone of Western Australia, is under threat from secondary salinity due to land clearance throughout the catchment. The lake is extensively covered with native vegetation and is a Ramsar listed wetland, being one of the few remaining significant migratory bird habitats in the region. Currently, inflow with salinity greater than 1000 mg/L TDS is diverted from the lake in an effort to protect sensitive lakebed vegetation. However, this conservative threshold compromises the frequency and extent of lake inundation, which is essential for bird breeding. It is speculated that relaxing the threshold to 5000 mg/L may pose negligible additional risk to the condition of lakebed vegetation. To characterise the magnitude of improvement in the provision of bird breeding habitat that might be generated by relaxing the threshold, a dynamic water and salt balance model of the lake was developed and implemented using Monte Carlo simulation. Results from best estimate model inputs indicate that relaxation of the threshold increases the likelihood of satisfying habitat requirements by a factor of 9.7. A second-order Monte Carlo analysis incorporating incertitude generated plausible bounds of [2.6, 37.5] around the best estimate for the relative likelihood of satisfying habitat requirements. Parameter-specific sensitivity analyses suggest the availability of habitat is most sensitive to pan evaporation, lower than expected inflow volume, and higher than expected inflow salt concentration. The characterisation of uncertainty associated with environmental variation and incertitude allows managers to make informed risk-weighted decisions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined interrelationships among natural vegetation zones, soil redox potential (Eh), and metrics of tree seedling performance (i.e survival, growth, and photosynthesis) for planted Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Acer saccharinum, Quercus palustris, and Quercus bicolor at two created perched wetlands (two years and five years old) in Michigan, USA. Vegetation zones apparently associated with hydrology were fully developed at both sites. Wetland zones always had lower mean Eh than upland zones, indicating mostly anaerobic and aerobic root environments, respectively. Eh values for transition zones were similar to aerobic upland zones at the five-year-old site, and changed from anaerobic to aerobic conditions over the growing season at the two-year-old site. At the five-year-old site, transition zone trees of all species generally had greater height growth, survival, and were less likely browsed by deer than upland trees. They also had much greater survival and endured shorter periods of anoxia stress than wetland trees. Photosynthesis was positively related to survival and Eh, suggesting that unfavorable carbon balance may help explain low survival in the anoxic wetland zone. Management implications include: (1) vegetation zonation is a good indicator of wetland hydrological factors important to planted tree performance; (2) targeting developed transition vegetation zones for tree planting could increase the success and efficiency of efforts to create forested wetlands; and (3) transition zones extended over only a 9.3 cm vertical elevation gradient, indicating the importance of precise grading when creating perched forested wetlands.

AB  - The relations between age, crown architecture, height and height increment of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) saplings were analysed using a multivariate method. Individuals from the saplings bank in mixed, unevenly aged, seminatural stands in Western Poland were investigated. Examined features were analysed with respect to light availability, which varied between 5.9 and 25.8% of full sunlight. The age of firs in the saplings bank varied from 11 up to 101 years. Under shade, growth is suspended and saplings tend to form a flat crown. Reduction of growth of a sapling did not influence its mortality, and did not diminish its ability to vigorously grow for up to 90-year-old saplings. Results of the PCA showed that age was not connected with sapling size, growth or crown morphology. Height increment is related to the relative crown length (RCL) and to the size of the sapling. In looking for an objective and quantitative indicator of growth potential, results suggest the RCL as a feature not influenced by sapling size. It should be pointed out that the vitality defined in this way reflects only the current growth, but not the potential to survive or the ability for rapid growth along with a changing light environment. The apical dominance ratio (ADR) value seems to be an indicator of light conditions in the understorey, but this trait is influenced by the height of the sapling. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diatoms (Chrysophyta) are photosynthetic microorganisms that are abundant in the natural environment and often associated with specific habitat and water quality conditions. Their significance as bioindicators and as exploitable sources of fine chemicals makes them desirable candidates for the study of stress responses. The protein expression of a thermo-intolerant (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and thermo-tolerant (Chaetoceros muelleri) diatom following exposure to elevated temperature was investigated using one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. It was determined using SDS PAGE with S-35-methionine labeled proteins and Western blot analysis using pea HSP70 antisera that higher temperatures and longer duration treatment were required to cause a noticeable stress response in C muelleri compared to R tricornutum. This may be explained by C. muelleri possessing higher amounts of constitutively expressed heat shock proteins, which allows these cells to rapidly adjust to temperature increases. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that putative small heat shock proteins (smHSPs) may appear to play a role during heat stress in both diatoms, which is similar to the response in plants. SDS PAGE data are also presented characterizing the recovery of P. tricornutum after heat shock. These results suggest that there is a lag period between heat shock and stress protein synthesis in these thermo-intolerant cells. This supports the hypothesis that cells without higher amounts of constitutively expressed stress proteins have a greater sensitivity to increased temperature. Work is underway to identify particular stress proteins responsible for conveying thermo-tolerance and to determine if overexpression of these genes in thermo-intolerant diatoms affects their temperature sensitivity.

AB  - Yeasts play a central role in the spoilage of foods and beverages, mainly those with high acidity and reduced water activity (a(w)). A few species are capable of spoiling foods produced according to good manufacturing practices (GMPs). These can survive and grow under stress conditions where other microorganisms are not competitive. However, many of the aspects determining yeast spoilage have yet to be clarified. This critical review uses the wine industry as a case study where serious microbiological problems are caused by yeasts. First, the limitations of the available tools to assess the presence of spoilage yeasts in foods are discussed. Next, yeasts and factors promoting their colonisation in grapes and wines are discussed from the ecological perspective, demonstrating that a deeper knowledge of vineyard and winery ecosystems is essential to establish the origin of wine spoilage yeasts, their routes of contamination, critical points of yeast infection, and of course, their control. Further, zymological indicators are discussed as important tools to assess the microbiological quality of wines, although they are rarely used by the wine industry.
   The concepts of the susceptibility of wine to spoilage yeasts and wine stability are addressed based on scientific knowledge and industrial practices for monitoring yeast contamination. A discussion on acceptable levels of yeasts and microbiological criteria in the wine industry is supported by data obtained from wineries, wholesalers, and the scientific literature.
   Finally, future directions for applied research are proposed, involving collaboration between scientists and industry to improve the quality of wine and methods for monitoring the presence of yeast. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Colorado River system exhibits the characteristics of a heavily over-allocated or 'closing water system'. In such systems, development of mechanisms to allow resource users to acknowledge interdependence and to engage in negotiations and agreements becomes necessary. Recently, after a decade of deliberations and environmental assessments, the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program (GCDAMP) was established to monitor and analyze the effects of dam operations on the Grand Canyon ecosystem and recommend adjustments intended to preserve and enhance downstream physical, cultural and environmental values. The Glen Canyon Dam effectively separates the Colorado into its lower and upper basins. Dam operations and adaptive management decisions are strongly influenced by variations in regional climate. This paper focuses on the management of extreme climatic events within the Glen and Grand Canyon Region of the Colorado River. It illustrates how past events (both societal and physical) condition management flexibility and receptivity to new information. The types of climatic information and their appropriate entry points in the annual cycle of information gathering and decision-making (the 'hydro-climatic decision calendar) for dam operations and the adaptive management program are identified. The study then describes how the recently implemented program, lessons from past events, and new climate information on the Colorado River Basin, facilitated responses during the major El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 1997-1998. Recommendations are made for engaging researchers and practitioners in the effective use of climatic information in similar settings where the decision stakes are complex and the system uncertainty is large.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - To minimize the risk that introduced entomophagous biological control agents may pose to native and beneficial insect species, identification of likely nontarget hosts is required before release is considered. A novel technique, in which the parasitoid acts as a vector of a bacterium pathogenic to potential hosts, has been used as an indicator of parasitoid ovipositional activity even when subsequent development of the parasitoid egg within the 'host' does not occur. In this study the application of this technique was examined in relation to container type using the facultative bacterium Serratia marcescens in association with the parasitoid Microctonus hyperodae. Two permissive host weevil species, Listronotus bonariensis and Irenimus aequalis, were exposed for 72 h to M. hyperodae treated with either distilled water or S. marcescens suspension in either Petri dishes or cages. Weevil septicaemia was significantly higher when exposed to S. marcescens-treated parasitoids than water-treated parasitoids (P < 0.001), with no difference in mortality between weevil species. Septicaemia was significantly higher in the Petri dishes than in cages (P < 0.001). This was attributed to improved survival of S. marcescens in the Petri dishes compared with cages. Total parasitoid activity (combined septicaemia and parasitism) for I. aequalis was higher in Petri dishes than in cages and far exceeded field parasitism. Petri dishes provide an environment for constant interaction between parasitoid and target host and thereby provide a conservative indication of parasitoid host range. However, cages may be more suitable to conduct host range studies because the ability to manipulate the environment. Potential refinements to the parasitoid-bacteria technique include methodology that enhances viability of the bacterium under cage conditions.

AB  - In Russia, until recently, it was considered that groundwater was protected from surface radioactive contamination by soil and rocks in the zone aeration. Groundwater was not a subject of radiation control. The accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant showed, however, that groundwater is vulnerable to radioactive contamination. In this connection, the vulnerability of groundwater to and the problems of protecting groundwater from radioactive contamination became urgent. The assessment of natural protection of groundwater from radioactive contamination is now considered a top priority. The zone of aeration is generally considered to be the zone separating groundwater from surface contamination. In respect to radioactive contamination, soils that may fix a large quantity of radionuclides serve as a protection zone of a higher order. The mapping of protectibility was done for each radionuclide taking into consideration the specific structure of the flow medium and migration properties of a radionuclide. Sr-90 and Cs-137 have different mechanisms of transport; convective transport is characteristic of the former and diffusive transfer of the latter. This is conditioned by different physico-chemical properties of the radionuclides and principally by their sorption capacities. The coefficient of distribution of Sr-90 is in many times less than the coefficient of distribution of Cs-137. The environmental protection problem in regions with nuclear power plants and in areas subjected to radioactive contamination may be solved using a monitoring, system including interrelated systems of observation and prediction of the lithosphere and the hydrosphere. The problem of mathematical modeling of migration processes is related to the complexities of modeling the processes of flow, mass transfer, and the accompanying physicochemical processes in zones of full and partial saturation, as well as difficulties in mathematical calculations.

AB  - Data on weight, toothwear, cape length, testes size, canine size, and age from wild olive baboons are presented in order to consider the nature of the growth curve, the differences between males and females in a sexually dimorphic species, and the effect of nutrition on growth parameters. Longitudinal and cross-sectional data on weight and age in three troops that lived under a variety of ecological circumstances showed a good fit to the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Male and female baboons have different growth constants (K) and different asymptotic weights and ages resulting in the observed baboon sexual dimorphism. Within sexes, growth constants and asymptotic weights varied between troops in the same year and for the same troop in different years. Improvements in nutrition increased growth rate and final weight and decreased age at asymptote in both naturally foraging and in food-enhanced wild groups. Testes and cape length follow the same growth pattern and have the same asymptotic age as body mass among naturally foraging males. Canine growth is different with full size achieved nearly 2 years earlier. Toothwear is an accurate relative age indicator for immature and adult females and for immature males but not for adult males because of the role that large canines play in occlusion and wear. The data suggest that creating a dichotomy between captive and wild primates is overly simplistic since conditions for growth in the wild can overlap those of captivity, not just for food enhanced individuals but also among naturally foraging troops. The nutritional perspective on primate growth exposes inherent problems in our present system of primate age classification which have serious implications for the use of age classes in behavioral analyses.

AB  - Peatlands are carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks that, in parallel, release methane (CH4). The peatland carbon (C) balance depends on the interplay of decomposer and CH4-cycling microbes, vegetation, and environmental conditions. These interactions are susceptible to the changes that occur along a successional gradient from vascular plant-dominated systems to Sphagnum moss-dominated systems. Changes similar to this succession are predicted to occur from climate change. Here, we investigated how microbial and plant communities are interlinked with each other and with ecosystem C cycling along a successional gradient on a boreal land uplift coast. The gradient ranged from shoreline to meadows and fens, and further to bogs. Potential microbial activity (aerobic CO2 production; CH4 production and oxidation) and biomass were greatest in the early successional meadows, although their communities of aerobic decomposers (fungi, actinobacteria), methanogens, and methanotrophs did not differ from the older fens. Instead, the functional microbial communities shifted at the fen-bog transition concurrent with a sudden decrease in C fluxes. The successional patterns of decomposer versus CH4-cycling communities diverged at the bog stage, indicating strong but distinct microbial responses to Sphagnum dominance and acidity. We highlight young meadows as dynamic sites with the greatest microbial potential for C release. These hot spots of C turnover with dense sedge cover may represent a sensitive bottleneck in succession, which is necessary for eventual long-term peat accumulation. The distinctive microbes in bogs could serve as indicators of the C sink function in restoration measures that aim to stabilize the C in the peat.

AB  - Caffeine is a well-known central nervous system stimulant, which can cause anxiety, insomnia and nervousness. Domestic wastes of caffeinated drinks, beverages and chocolates are the major sources for entry of caffeine in the environmental system. Caffeine has been widely detected in natural water resources. The current study describes a method for efficient removal of caffeine from aqueous solution by a laboratory scale dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in open air. Caffeine concentrations in various sample solutions were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the degradation products were identified by directly injecting the sample to mass spectrometer. The consequences of varied parameters such as input power, initial concentration and initial pH of the solution on the degradation of caffeine were investigated. Removal efficiency of caffeine from aqueous solution was 72.6% and 96.6% for the initial concentrations of 100 and 1 mu g/mL, respectively, at initial pH 7 after 4 min treatment in DBD plasma system with 60 W input powers. Caffeine removal efficiency was less in acidic solutions (initial pH 4), and insignificant degradation was observed in alkaline solutions (initial pH 10). Furthermore, the degradation of caffeine was also enhanced by increasing the input power in DBD system. The DBD system used in this study has been considered to be fast, effective and economical. It was operated at atmospheric condition in open air without using catalyst, expensive gases or organic solvents, and significant degradation of caffeine was achieved in a short (4 min) treatment time.

AB  - The Taylor column, a typical hydrological structure around a seamount, can help to explain the high biomass and biodiversity around the seamount. However, it is difficult to observe a Taylor column in the field because it is easy to be destroyed by the change of ocean environment. Fortunately, a Taylor column around the C4 seamount in the Tropical Western Pacific Ocean was identified during our cruise. The existence of a Taylor column was confirmed by multidisciplinary indicators: 1) the theoretical calculation values of Bl and Ro were 4.922 and 0.195, respectively, indicating the environmental conditions were sufficient for a Taylor column to form; 2) the uplifts of isotherms and isohalines indicated the existence of the upwelling around the C4 seamount summit; 3) the Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) data indicated the existence of an anticyclonic circulation at the water layers ranging from 200 to 300 m. Meanwhile, the Taylor column's ecological effects were obvious around the seamount. The isolines of the nutrients, chlorophyll a and heterotrophic bacteria had uplifts approximately consistent with isotherms and isohalines, indicating they were influenced by the upwelling in this region. Meanwhile, the planar graphs of these parameters in the water column above 200 m showing the values around the seamount were relatively high, indicating the effects of the Taylor column on the enhancement of productivity. These results further confirmed that a Taylor column indeed formed and caused ecological effects in the C4 seamount. Finally, the scope of the Taylor column was roughly estimated based on the Chl a concentrations, which centered around the station O with a radius of 6.1 km.

AB  - Anthropogenic impoundments (e.g. large dams, small reservoirs, and ponds) are expanding in number globally, influencing downstream temperature regimes in a diversity of ways that depend on their structure and position along the river continuum. Because of the manifold downstream thermal responses, there has been a paucity of studies characterizing cumulative effect sizes at the catchment scale. Here, we introduce five thermal indicators based on the stream-air temperature relationship that together can identify the altered thermal signatures of darns and ponds. We used this thermal signature approach to evaluate a regional dataset of 330 daily stream temperature time series from stations throughout the Loire River basin, France, from 2008 to 2018. This basin (10(5) km(2)) is one of the largest European catchments with contrasting natural and anthropogenic characteristics. The derived thermal signatures were cross-validated with several known catchment characteristics, which strongly supported separation into dam-like, pond-like and natural-like signatures. We characterize the thermal regime of each thermal signature and contextualize it using a set of ecologically relevant thermal metrics. Results indicate that large dams decreased summer stream temperature by 2 degrees C and delayed the annual stream temperature peak by 23 days relative to the natural regimes. In contrast, the cumulative effects of upstream ponds increased summer stream temperature by 2.3 degrees C and increased synchrony with air temperature regimes. These thermal signatures thus allow for identifying and quantifying downstream thermal and ecological influences of different types of anthropogenic infrastructures without prior information on the source of modification and upstream water temperature conditions.

AB  - Aim of the study
   Landfilling is an activity, which may threaten the destruction or contamination of the soil and water environment. Pollution can be generated both by leachate and by landfill gas. Legal conditions impose on landfill managers to monitor groundwater around the landfills. The impacted soils and groundwater show high chlorides, sulphates, heavy metal concentrations especially as compared to natural hydrochemical background values. Monitoring results can be analyzed using pollution indicators. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of groundwater in a landfill in Wojkowice (southern Poland) using the Backman index.
   Material and methods
   The novelty of the paper results from the use of a different range of parameters than initially included in the formula. The results of water quality monitoring for three piezometers from 2013-2020 were considered. The contamination index was calculated separately for each of the analysed water samples, taking into account the electrolytic conductivity and the concentration of total organic carbon (TOC), Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and the sum of N-NO3, N-NO2 and N-NH4.
   Results and conclusions
   The Backman index values range in the groundwater samples were -5.3 to 603. The value of the Backman index increases with the increase in the concentration of individual parameters in groundwater. In the case of heavily transformed areas, the water pollution index has high values, exceeding 3. The results of this index indicated that the quality of the groundwater around the landfill is bad. In the future, it is planned to expand the range of parameters for calculating the index.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems have long been affected by numerous types of human interventions that have a negative impact. Ecosystem disturbance constitutes the worst aquatic response to anthropogenic pressures. The research was initiated by identifying the human pressures on the lakes' ecosystem, the main objective being to establish, quantify and diminish the aquatic ecosystem responses. The case study was applied in the suburban area of Craiova city for a natural protected area. The chosen methodology is based on the analysis of the response of the 10 ten lakes located along Preajba Valley to human pressures from two perspectives: morphometric parameters of the lakes and indicators of the aquatic condition. For this purpose, a statistical analysis using Google Earth and GIS tools was conducted. The research was completed by field observations during 2009-2019. The results of the study draw attention to the lacustrine surface, its size decreasing from 28 ha in 2009 to 27 ha in 2019. The aquatic vegetation response was completed by determining the tendency of the vegetation extension (which has been ascending for Lakes II, III, VI and X). Following the interpretation of quantitative biocenotic indices, it can be concluded that the species Carassius gibelio is constant (Frequency-86.8% and Abundence-51.8%), being closely followed by Perca fluviatilis and Lepomis gibbosus as accessory species. Our results support the evidence that the high pH (8.2 pH unit), fixed residue (384 mg/dm(3)), NO2 (0.124 mg/dm(3)), NO3 (16.28 mg/dm(3)) and CCOCr (49.7 mg/dm(3)) confirms the high degree of eutrophication in 2019. The paper suggested the assessment of lakes responses to human pressures as a support tool for sustainable lake ecosystems management in suburban areas.

AB  - Phytoremediation is one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly ways to reduce adverse effects of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the environment. The present study was conducted to investigate the bioaccumulation factor (BF) and translocation factor (TF) of Cd and Pb in muskweed (Myagrum perfoliatum) and foxtail sophora (Sophora alopecuroides). The impact of contamination on some growth responses of plants and soil biological indicators was also evaluated. A non-contaminated soil sample was divided into several subsamples: one subsample was left as control (without contamination) and the others were separately contaminated with three levels of Cd (3, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1)) and Pb (100, 300, and 600 mg kg(-1)). Pot experiments were performed under greenhouse conditions. The BF values of Cd were greater than 1 at all contamination levels indicating the potential of muskweed and foxtail sophora for the uptake and phytostabilization of Cd. The only TF > 1 was obtained for Cd in muskweed grown at the highest Cd contamination level. The TF values of Pb were much lower than those obtained for Cd indicating that Cd was more translocated from root to aerial parts of muskweed and foxtail sophora compared to Pb. The highest contamination levels of Cd and Pb did not significantly affect growth responses of muskweed and foxtail sophora. Furthermore, the cultivation of muskweed and foxtail sophora reduced the impact of Cd and Pb contamination on biological indicators including carbon mineralization ratio (CMR), substrate-induced respiration (SIR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)).

AB  - Lichens and mosses are among the first organisms to colonize the open bedrock of eastern Georgian Bay, Ontario making them essential for primary soil formation and ecosystem succession, while also providing nesting habitat for turtle species-at-risk. However, the slow growing nature of lichen and moss makes them vulnerable to ecohydrological stresses caused by climate and land-use change. In order to better understand how lichen and moss will respond to stressors, we examined which ecohydrological factors (e.g., near-surface soil moisture and temperature) control the CO(2)exchange of lichen (Cladoniaspp.) and moss (Polytrichumspp.) on rock barrens, and the time of year growth primarily occurs. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was significantly greater in the wet period of the growing season than the dry, with an estimated difference of 0.7 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)for lichen, 2.9 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)for moss, and 2.5 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)for a moss and lichen mix. These findings indicate that the wet portions of the growing season are critical for growth, while lichen and moss have little to no productivity during the dry period. Our results indicate that near-surface soil moisture is an indicator of the CO(2)exchange of lichen and moss, and this relationship varies among cover types. For the geographical regions where warm, dry conditions are expected to increase in duration and frequency with climate change, lichen and moss NEP will likely decrease, thus limiting the long-term availability of nesting habitat for turtle species-at-risk.

KW  - Regulation and Business Law
AB  - The importance of aquaculture for feeding at the international, national and local scales have led its practice to be oriented towards productivist strategies that avoid the environmental dimension. This situation is analyzed in terms of the concessions that aquaculture farms request for the use of water and the permits for the discharge of wastewater. In this context, the objective of this article is to analyze to what extent the regulations and costs that govern the use of water in aquaculture in the central region of Veracruz have conditioned its application, both in basins and in aquifers. To meet this objective, the role of aquaculture in feeding the rural population, the legal framework of water that governs aquaculture in Mexico, the level of compliance and the causes that determine it are reviewed. The study area is the central region of Veracruz, because it can be representative of the situation faced by other regions of the state and the country in terms of lack or overregulation of the activity. The Veracruz aquaculture census, the Public Registry of Water Rights, of the National Water Commission, and the availability of water by basin and aquifer are analyzed. This availability was found to be at risk, due to lack of compliance with permits for water uses, costs and discharges from unregulated farms. This situation is exacerbated because a high percentage is located in areas with limited availability. Hence, the water policy in terms of regulations must take into account the economic and technical restrictions that producers face so that their activity is not only governed by productivist criteria, but also takes into account the environmental dimension, because water is the main input they require in quantity and quality.

AB  - Seabirds consume forage fish, which are keystone species in many marine ecosystems. The Junk Food Hypothesis proposes that high-lipid prey should produce better reproductive performance by seabirds. In the Gulf of Maine, changes in the forage fish community followed rapid warming post-2005 and included a decline in high-lipid Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. We studied 3 species of alcid (Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, razorbill Alca torda, common murre Uria aalge) over 23 yr at 3 colonies to assess changes in chick diet and its relationships with reproductive success. Puffin and razorbill chick diet changed over time; puffin diet was highly variable taxonomically, whereas razorbill diets were more consistent, showing proportional changes within fewer taxa. For puffins and razorbills, herring was replaced by sand lance Ammodytes spp. and other taxa with lower energy density. Puffins did not require high-lipid fish to breed successfully, but diet-reproduction relationships became unpredictable following extremely warm winters (2013 and 2016). Razorbills and murres provisioning with low-lipid fish showed reduced chick condition and breeding success. We concluded that razorbills and murres need higher-quality diets than puffins, which more frequently exploited lower-lipid food during food shortages. However, puffin reproductive output was much more vulnerable to ocean warming owing to their longer breeding season and more varied diet. Different responses of closely-related species to changes in prey are driven by differences in chick-development strategies with clear implications for using seabirds as environmental indicators.

AB  - The use of limpets of the genus Patella as indicators of environmental quality is a priori promising, but few data are available in relation to their sensitivity to toxicants or their ability to accumulate pollutants. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of Patella spp. as model organisms by (1) assessing the sensitivity of limpet embryos to some common pollutants, (2) validating the use of the limpet embryo-larval bioassay using natural sediment samples, and (3) analyzing the presence of pollutants by using Patella spp. as sentinel species. The obtained EC50 values ranged between 33 and 84 mu g/L for Cu, 749-1163 for Cd, 317-1103 for Zn and 813-3411 mu g/L for Pb; these sensitivity ranges were similar to those of other marine invertebrates used in ecotoxicology. It was not possible to validate the bioassay with natural samples, since the sampled sites did not cause significant toxicity. Patella spp. accumulated metals and organic pollutants in their soft tissues, showing higher concentrations than mussels for some metals (Cd, As and Cu) and lower concentrations for others (Hg, Zn, Cr), as well as for organic pollutants. Furthermore, bioaccumulation in limpets showed a spatial pattern of contamination similar to that shown by mussels and sediments, revealing limpets as a very good substitute/complement to mussels for biomonitoring marine pollution, especially in sites where mussel populations are absent or present at low numbers.

AB  - Bauxite residues (red mud) produced by digestion of bauxite ore during the production of alumina contain naturally occurring radionuclides such as U-238, Th-232 and K-40 and toxic elements such as Al, Cr, Co, Mn and Ni. In this research, red mud collected from Eti Seydisehir Aluminium Plant in Turkey was studied to determine the concentration of natural radionuclides for evaluating their radiological effects. Short-term leaching tests of radionuclides were performed by Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)-1311 method to assess in terms of their environmental impact. Furthermore, self-attenuation factors were experimentally determined using radioactive point sources with two different amounts to ascertain how gamma rays are attenuated in the residue depending on the energy and the volume of residue. The activity concentrations of U-234,U-235,U-238, Th-232 and K-40 in red mud and leachate samples were determined by neuron activation analysis and Compton suppression methods. The method was tested using NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 1632d and 2709a reference materials. It can be concluded from the results of leaching tests that natural radionuclides may not easily be mobile under environmental conditions and the mobility of the radionuclides depends on the pH value of water and contact time with the water. The activity concentration index which is the most commonly used calculation method was applied to the samples and the results showed that the reuse of red mud as a secondary raw material may not be hazardous depending on the percentage of utilization of it.

AB  - Agricultural coastal areas are frequently affected by the superimposition of various processes, with a combination of anthropogenic and natural sources, which degrade groundwater quality. In the coastal multi-aquifer system of Arborea (Italy)-a reclaimed morass area identified as a nitrate vulnerable zone, according to Nitrate Directive 91/676/EEC-intensive agricultural and livestock activities contribute to substantial nitrate contamination. For this reason, the area can be considered a bench test for tuning an appropriate methodology aiming to trace the nitrate contamination in different conditions. An approach combining environmental isotopes, water quality and hydrogeological indicators was therefore used to understand the origins and attenuation mechanisms of nitrate pollution and to define the relationship between contaminant and groundwater flow dynamics through the multi-aquifer characterized by sandy (SHU), alluvial (AHU), and volcanic hydrogeological (VHU) units. Various groundwater chemical pathways were consistent with both different nitrogen sources and groundwater dynamics. Isotope composition suggests a mixed source for nitrate (organic and synthetic fertilizer), especially for the AHU and SHU groundwater. Moreover, marked heterotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction processes were detected; although, for the contamination related to synthetic fertilizer, the attenuation was inefficient at removing NO3- to less than the human consumption threshold of 50 mg/L. Various factors contributed to control the distribution of the redox processes, such as the availability of carbon sources (organic fertilizer and the presence of lagoon-deposited aquitards), well depth, and groundwater flow paths. The characterization of these processes supports water-resource management plans, future actions, and regulations, particularly in nitrate vulnerable zones.

AB  - Although Carabidae is among the best-studied families of beetles in Europe from the faunistic point of view, there is still a lack of available information on the ecological requirements of the particular carabid species. The habitat preferences that determine the distribution of species are largely influenced by habitat structure and microclimate. In addition to other factors, these habitat parameters are influenced by the nature of the vegetation. Therefore, our study investigated the influence of tree species on carabid beetle communities. We conducted the research at 9 stands in the Borova Hora Arboretum (Zvolen, Central Slovakia). Each studied site represents a monoculture of one of nine tree species. At each site, some soil and leaf litter attributes (pH, conductivity, and content of H, C, N and P) were evaluated. Ground beetles were collected by pitfall trapping during the vegetation periods in 2008-2011. In total, 3012 individuals of 29 species were obtained. Significant differences in the total dynamic activity and species richness of the carabid beetle communities among the compared forest stands were revealed. The results of the research confirmed statistically significant relationships among 1) the soil conductivity and both the richness and Shannon diversity of the ground beetle communities, 2) the litter and soil N content and richness, the Shannon diversity and the species composition of the ground beetle communities. The Shannon diversity and richness were negatively related to the soil conductivity and positively related with the N content. Our research showed that dominant tree species indirectly influence diversity and composition of carabid communities via the soil properties.

AB  - Macrofauna in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone remain poorly understood, due both to gross undersampling and to the fact that most species collected from the area are new to science. Evaluation of the diversity and species distribution of the benthic fauna in this area is critical to predicting and managing the impacts of manganese nodule mining. In this study, we investigated the distribution of macrofauna to understand the natural variability in the macrobenthic community and, by extension, to establish a baseline for environmental risk assessment. Samples were collected from the KR5 block of the Korea Contract Area, within the abyssal area of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, by the RV Onnuri from 2012-2014. A total of 36 core samples were examined in the survey, from which we identified 183 macrobenthic species in 25 faunal groups with a mean density of 257 ind/m2. Not taking into account meio-faunal groups such as nematodes and harpacticoid copepods, the highest percentage of individuals was represented by Arthropoda. The dominant species (> 1% of total density) were the tanaids Typhlotanais sp.1, and Akanthophoreus spp. and Stenotanais sp., the isopod Macrostylis sp.1, and the polychaetes Cirratulidae spp. and Levinsenia uncinata. The abundances of the two dominant species, the tanaid Typhlotanais sp1. and isopod Macrostylis sp.1., were positively correlated with total organic carbon (TOC). There were no differences in macrofaunal density and community structure between preserved areas (PRA), the potential benthic impacted site (BIS), and other areas near the BIS. In general, higher diversity was associated with homogeneous environmental conditions, with high nodule coverage (> 50%) and TOC.

AB  - Urban public parks provide a recreational environment for residents, hence more and more citizens would spend time in parks, especially elderly and kids. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the quality of ecological environment inside parks. Therefore, this study conducted the first measurements in ten public parks of Shanghai to investigate heavy metals in air, soil and leaf, growth parameters of leaf, and ambient PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) concentrations. Results showed Al and Mg appeared the highest in air. Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn were dominating in soil. Ca and Mg were much greater in leaves. It was concluded geographical locations were major reasons to explain the level of heavy metals, which mainly came from vehicle emissions. A small portion was attributing to chemical industries nearby. PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 0.01 mg/m(3) to 0.10 mg/m(3), which met up level I and level II of air quality standard in China. BC concentrations ranged from 1000 ng/m(3) to 6000 ng/m(3). Via comparing the correlation between photosynthesis and PM2.5, as well as chlorophyll content and PM2.5, it was concluded that chlorophyll can be regarded as an indicator for assessing air quality, but not photosynthesis. Unexpectedly, a positive correlation was observed between the stomatal conductance and PM2.5 as well as BC, which might be attributed to plants resisting the ambient stress. The results of this study can be used for assessments of air quality and health exposure inside parks, and also could provide urban policy maker with scientific evidences for urban park planning.

AB  - Data on gene transcription profiles provide a comprehensive assessment of the toxic and defensive mechanisms that are triggered by pollutants. PCR-arrays have emerged as a reliable tool for analyzing the expression of a panel of relevant, pathway- or disease-focused genes under uniform cycling conditions. By using SYBR Green-optimized primer assays, it is possible to simultaneously amplify a sample with high specificity and amplification efficiencies. However, commercial PCR-arrays target a limited group of organisms, excluding most of those with environmental relevance, as is the case with Mus spretus mice. Our previous works with M. spretus showed a high sequence similarity between M. spretus and the model organism M. musculus allowing the use of commercial platforms with M. spretus. This work demonstrates the successful application of a commercial PCR-array designed for the model organism M. musculus to assess the biological effects caused by the organochlorine pesticide p,p'-DDE in a focused panel of stress related genes in M. spretus mice. This cost-effective, easy-to-use platform detected quantitative gene profiling differences between M. spretus hepatic RNA samples and generated data highly concordant with those obtained by absolute qRT-PCR, the most sensitive method to quantify transcripts. This platform is also suitable for use in field studies with free-living M. spretus mice for routine environmental risk assessment. Our results provide a broad impression of the biological consequences of p,p'-DDE on the hepatic health of mice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paleoecological and faunal-based paleoenvironmental studies rely on fossil assemblages that have high fidelity to the once-living faunas and to the target environment. However, many sedimentary records contain multiple depositional fades, transported sediments with their associated fossils, and varying degrees of taphonomic alteration, which can confound interpretations. Here we combine measures of compositional fidelity, modern analog faunal methods, sedimentary analyses, and taphonomic scoring to examine the history of sediment transport and environmental change in a similar to 60,000 year continental slope record from the Gulf of Alaska using benthic foraminiferal assemblages. These assemblages generally have good compositional fidelity to modern faunas in the Gulf of Alaska, but are not necessarily faithful to the modern continental slope. Fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages with modern analogs from shelf and slope environments are intercalated downcore suggesting episodes of sedimentary transport to the slope site. Fossil assemblages without modern analogs in this record appear ecologically, rather than taphonomically, derived and thus suggest that the range of past environmental variation in the Gulf of Alaska is not captured by modern spatial variation. These no-analog fossil assemblages are allied with analog assemblages using similarity in taxonomic and sedimentary characteristics, permitting analysis of environmental change in shelf and slope settings from a single core. The faunal composition of the no-analog assemblages suggests the Gulf of Alaska slope experienced lower oxygen conditions in the past than observed in the modern gulf. Lower productivity is also suggested for some shelf samples, however geochemical proxy data are necessary to fully interpret the no-analog assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sediments from Lake Petit (2200m a.s.l., Southern Alps) are particularly relevant for analysis of coupled landscape palaeoecology and palaeolimnology. Diatom assemblages, organic matter composition of sediments (total nitrogen and organic carbon) and Pediastrum boryanum concentrations were obtained from a 144-cm-long core, enabling the reconstruction of the aquatic ecosystem over nearly the last 5000 cal. BP. From 4800 to 4300 cal. BP, Lake Petit was a stable diatom-productive water body dominated by alkaliphilous diatoms (Staurosirella pinnata). During this period, nutrients and cations were supplied by the chemical weathering of podzols that developed under conifer woodlands. This overall stability was suddenly interrupted at 4200 cal. BP by a major detrital pulse that was probably climate linked (4200 cal. BP event) and that triggered a drop in diatom productivity and diversity. From 4100 to 2400 cal. BP, diatom productivity progressively decreased, whereas Pediastrum developed. Diatom assemblages were more diversified (predominance of Pseudostaurosira robusta, P. brevistriata and P. pseudoconstruens) and reflected a regime of continuous erosion, whereas slopes were colonised by grazed grasslands. Finally, from 2400 cal. BP to the present day, diatom assemblages reveal a slight acidification and nutrient enrichment of waters concomitant with increasing human pressure in the catchment. These results demonstrate the close links between ecosystems and the ready propagation of disturbances throughout watersheds that might lead to abrupt regime shifts in such alpine environments.

AB  - Due to the influence of relief on soil variability, homogenous pedogenetic conditions have been recommended for developing soil quality indices based on their chemical, physical and biological attributes. This limits the development and application of an index to the same pedoenvironment in hilly relief. The present work aimed to evaluate the soil coverage and soil chemical and physical attributes as indicators of quality related to visual aspects of pasture degradation and contextualizing the influence of the relief. For this purpose, degradation levels were separated from visual aspects, and soil coverage as well as soil chemical and physical attributes were evaluated. Such levels were less subjectively defined, with the discriminant functions generated using information from soil coverage. Factor Analysis showed that altitude and slope explain a lower proportion of the total variation of the data. On the other hand, slope variations control the majority of soil attribute variations, especially the physical attributes that do not present a clear and direct relationship with degradation levels, which makes it difficult to use these attributes as indicators of quality. This relationship with the soil attributes is differentiated mainly as a function of the sun-facing slope: on the East/South facing slope, a greater relationship was observed for the physical attributes and plant cover, which was not observed on the West/North facing slopes. The influence of hilly relief on controlling solar radiation and soil moisture modifies the soil-vegetation relationship dynamic. As such, on hilly relief the measure of plant cover and use of discriminant functions becomes a more efficient way to discriminate among degradation levels, with environmental factors (temperature, solar radiation and soil moisture) also influencing pasture quality.

AB  - Normalograptids constitute a distinctive but not easily identified group of derived axonophorans. A new study of Normalograptus morphology indicates that many Late Ordovician taxa previously identified as Normalograptus are actually referable to Styracograptus and related climacograptoids. These re-identifications have led to the recognition of a complex biogeographic history among normalograptids and their descendants, including an interesting pattern that had previously been overlooked - a late Katian disappearance of Normalograptus from the palaeotropics. Normalograptid palaeogeographic distribution in the Ordovician appears to comprise 5 main phases: (1) evolutionary origin probably in relatively high palaeolatitudes in the early to mid Darriwilian; (2) spread to global distribution in later Darriwilian time; (3) retreat from most low palaeolatitude regions during the early Katian, with perhaps a slightly delayed retreat from Laurentia; (4) a complete extirpation from the low palaeolatitudes by the mid Katian (Ea4); (5) reinvasion of the low palaeolatitudes that accompanies the remarkable ecological and evolutionary replacement of the Diplograptina by species of Normalograptus and their descendants during the latest Katian-early Hirnantian. We propose two sets of hypotheses to explain Late Ordovician Normalograptus distribution. First, given the low species diversity of Normalograptus, we suggest as a null hypothesis that the disappearance of normalograptids from low palaeolatitudes during the late Sandbian and early Katian as simply a stochastic outcome - a small clade simply went extinct by chance alone. The alternative is that the loss of Normalograptus species reflects some form of extinction for cause, either: (1) competitive exclusion; or (2) an inability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the case of the competitive exclusion hypothesis, the most likely competitors are species of the Diplograptina.

AB  - Following the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the need to reach a "good ecological status" for rivers, key-questions are being raised about braided rivers. Before any environmental policy can be drawn up, these rivers need to be located, long term changes must be evaluated, and the regional diversity of such systems must be understood, as their inner complexity has not yet been well studied. Therefore, the aim of this work is to carry out a census of the braided channels of the French Alps and to establish a typology based on basic geomorphic indicators. A minimum estimate of the cumulative length of braided rivers prior to major infrastructure construction amounted to 1214 km. Around 53% of these rivers have disappeared during the last two centuries in relation to embankment or channelization, but a loss of 17% is still unexplained. The range in catchment size, mean slope and active channel width has been determined for the Western Alpine braided channels as well as the range in changes due to narrowing, widening and shifting. Seven types of braided rivers have been distinguished based on geographical settings (climate conditions and geology) and differences in terms of adjustment to human pressure on peak flow and sediment delivery. The percentage area of islands in the active channel and the relative length of banks also show a regional difference. Maximum and minimum thresholds of braided activity have been established taking into account the active channel width and the catchment area. The position of the studied reaches between these two thresholds are discussed in relation to position of rivers known in the literature, considering both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in channel width.

AB  - In this study, we asked the Ariaal herders of northern Kenya to answer "why, what and how" they classified landscape, and assessed and monitored the biodiversity of 10 km(2) of grazing land. To answer the "why question" the herders classified grazing resources into 39 landscape patches grouped into six landscape types and classified soil as 'warm', 'intermediate' or 'cold' for [lie purpose of land use. For the "what question" the herders used soil conditions and vegetation characteristics to assess biodiversity. Plant species were described as 'increasers', 'decreasers' or 'stable'. The decreaser species were mostly grasses and forbs preferred for cattle and sheep grazing and the increasers were mostly woody species preferred by goats. The herders evaluated biodiversity in terms of key forage species and used absence or presence of the preferred species from individual landscapes for monitoring change in biodiversity. For the "how question" the herders used anthropogenic indicators concerned with livestock management for assessing landscape potential and suitability for grazing. The anthropogenic indicators were related to soils and biodiversity. The herders used plant species grazing preferences to determine the links between livestock production and biodiversity. By addressing these three questions, the study shows the value of incorporating the indigenous knowledge of herders into classification of landscape and assessment and monitoring of biodiversity in the grazing lands. We conclude that herder knowledge of biodiversity is related to the use as opposed to exclusive conservation practices. This type of knowledge is extremely valuable to conservation agencies for establishing a baseline for monitoring changes in biodiversity in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hydrological response of Swiss river basins to the 2003 European summer heatwave was evaluated by a combined analysis of historical discharge records and specific applications of distributed hydrological modeling. In the summer of 2003, the discharge from headwater streams of the Swiss Central Plateau was only 40%-60% of the long-term average. For alpine basins runoff was about 60%-80% of the average. Glacierized basins showed the opposite behavior. According to the degree of glacierization, the average summer runoff was close or even above average. The hydrological model PREVAH was applied for the period 1982-2005. Even if the model was not calibrated for such extreme meteorological conditions, it was well able to simulate the hydrological responses of three basins. The aridity index phi describes feedbacks between hydrological and meteorological anomalies, and was adopted as an indicator of hydrological drought. The anomalies of phi and temperature in the summer of 2003 exceeded the 1982-2005 mean by more than 2 standard deviations. Catchments without glaciers showed negative correlations between phi and discharge R. In basins with about 15% glacierization, phi and R were not correlated. River basins with higher glacier percentages showed a positive correlation between phi and R. Icemelt was positively correlated with phi and reduced the variability of discharge with larger amounts of meltwater. Runoff generation from the non-glaciated sub-areas was limited by high evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. The 2003 summer heatwave could be a precursor to similar events in the near future. Hydrological models and further data analysis will allow the identification of the most sensitive regions where heatwaves may become a recurrent natural hazard with large environmental, social and economical impacts.

AB  - This paper discusses vegetation types and diversity patterns in relation to environment and land-use at summer farms, a characteristic cultural landscape in the Norwegian mountains. Floristic data (189 taxa) were collected in 130 4-m(2) sample plots within 12 summer farms in Roldal, western Norway. The study was designed to sample as fully as possible the range of floristic, environmental, and land-use conditions. Vegetation types delimited by two-way indicator species analysis were consistent with results from earlier phytosociological studies. Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis show that rather than being distinct vegetation types, the major floristic variation is structured along a spatial gradient from summer farm to the surrounding heathland vegetation. Species richness (alpha diversity) was modelled against environmental variables by generalized linear modelling and compositional turnover (beta diversity) by canonical correspondence analysis. Most environmental factors made significant contributions, but the spatial distance-to-farm gradient was the best predictor of both species richness and turnover. While summer farms reduce mean species richness at the plot scale, the compositional heterogeneity of the upland landscapes is increased, thereby creating `ecological room' for additional vegetation types and species. Within an overall similarity across scales, soil variables (pH, base saturation, LOI, phosphate and nitrogen) differed considerably in their explanatory power for richness and turnover. A difference between `productivity limiting' factors and `environmental sieves' is proposed as an explanation. Species turnover with altitude is relatively low in grasslands as compared to heaths.

AB  - Melon vine decline causes severe economic losses to melon crops all over the world. Two fungi, Acremonium cucurbitacearum and Monosporascus cannonballus, have been reported as the main causal agents of root damage, responsible for the decrease in root water and nutrient uptake capacity. However, melon vine decline aetiology is not completely understood, so screening assays must be conducted under natural infestation conditions. In field assays, the erratic effect of uncontrolled environmental factors makes the study of the trait's genetics difficult. The percentage of asymptomatic plants scored at individual moments during the infection process in the field is an imprecise indicator of the resistance level of each genotype. The analysis of disease progress curves does allow for the minimization of the stochastic fluctuations caused by environmental factors at various moments in time. Using this analysis the mode of inheritance of the partial resistance to melon vine decline derived from the: accession Pat 81 of Cucumis melo var. agrestis was further studied. Data from the six generations assayed (susceptible and resistant parents. F-1, F-2, and backcrosses BC1 and BC2) were fitted to an additive/dominance model without epistatic effects using a scaling test. Monogenic control was proposed as the simplest model to explain the data. Assuming this simple model, the method of analysis also allowed for the characterization of the incomplete penetrance of resistance, which varies as a log probit function of the time. Simple genetic control would simplify the use of Pat 81 in breeding programmes aimed at developing commercial melon varieties with resistance to vine decline.

AB  - Cyanobacterial biocrusts (CBCs) perform a range of functions including early successional colonization of substrates, modification of soil properties, surface stabilization and carbon sequestration. The response of CBCs to hydration is well-constrained for cultured or single-species but less so for in situ communities and there are few studies of CBC response to, and impact on, wind erosion. This paper investigates the in situ response of dryland CBCs to rainfall and wind erosion using biological and physical indicators. Field sites are in central Australia in three geomorphic situations - sand dune, nebkha and claypan. Results indicate higher amounts of rainfall trigger a more intense biological response than lower amounts, but not one of longer duration. The intensity of photosynthetic response to rainfall appears related to air temperature. The relationship between CBC and soil loss by wind erosion is inconclusive, but saltation efficiency (Qs/Q) is highest on the dune and claypan when tested 48 hr after applying 5 mm of rainfall. This is attributed to rainfall detachment of sand particles increasing the availability of loose erodible material on the surface. The results highlight the rapid biological response of CBCs to rainfall events (within hours), and the importance of overall environmental conditions, such as air temperature, but raise questions as to the longevity of the biological impact of such response. Drought-affected CBCs can protect the surface against wind erosion but dehydration may reduce resilience to disturbance and, under predicted future climate scenarios, the protective role of cyanobacterial crusts may be compromised.

AB  - Aquatic reed beds provide important ecological functions, yet their monitoring by remote sensing methods remains challenging. In this study, we propose an approach of assessing aquatic reed stand status indicators based on data from the airborne photogrammetric 3K-system of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). By a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, we computed stand surface models of aquatic reeds for each of the 14 areas of interest (AOI) investigated at Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, Germany. Based on reed heights, we subsequently calculated the reed area, surface structure homogeneity and shape of the frontline. For verification, we compared 3K aquatic reed heights against reed stem metrics obtained from ground-based infield data collected at each AOI. The root mean square error (RMSE) for 1358 reference points from the 3K digital surface model and the field-measured data ranged between 39 cm and 104 cm depending on the AOI. Considering strong object movements due to wind and waves, superimposed by water surface effects such as sun glint altering 3K data, the results of the aquatic reed surface reconstruction were promising. Combining the parameter height, area, density and frontline shape, we finally calculated an indicator for status determination: the aquatic reed status index (aRSI), which is based on metrics, and thus is repeatable and transferable in space and time. The findings of our study illustrate that, even under the adverse conditions given by the environment of the aquatic reed, aerial photogrammetry can deliver appropriate results for deriving objective and reconstructable parameters for aquatic reed status (Phragmites australis) assessment.

The manuscript aims to present a scientometric analysis followed by a review on eco-restoration of heavy metal polluted mine spoil, tailing and to develop a timeline analysis done in the last 10 years (2010-2020). Web of Science (WoS) database was used to obtain the desired data set, and these are analysed based on WoS categories, leading journals and contributing countries. According to these databases, research progress was delineated to draw a clear picture of the scientific status and progress and to develop knowledge gap in this area. China is the leading country in eco-restoration-based study for heavy metal remediation in mines. Among the categories, "Environmental Science" has the highest number of publications in this domain. After reviewing various literature, it is evident that vegetation cover has the ability to remediate mine derelict sites. Most of the studies reported that woody, fast growing, native vegetation cover suit best for heavy metal remediation. The use of vegetation cover native to the mining sites should be prioritized as they are better indicator of reclamation success due to their high biomass, fast growing, ability to acclimatize in adverse environmental condition in nature. Lastly, as most studies focused on the recuperating soil properties, the application of innovative genomic approaches (recognising genetic markers for abatement of contaminants) to heavy metal remediation practice should also be amplified to develop new concepts of land reclamation in mining area.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The structural diversity of an urban forest affects ecosystem service provision, and can inform management, planning, as well as policy. Trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) is amongst the most common measures of tree structure due to its ease of measurement and strong relationships with other structural and non-structural urban forest characteristics. Materials and Methods: In this study, the DBH distributions of urban forests are summarised for 38 American cities with a combined population of over 30 million people and a range of geographic, climatic, and demographic conditions. The Anderson-Darling (AD) test was used to test the hypothesis that all DBH distributions came from a common population. Moreover, structural diversity was compared using the Shannon-Wiener index. Results: The AD test results failed to identify any statistically significant differences in DBH distributions. However, qualitatively, the DBH distributions have two primary forms, which have important functional, management, and planning implications. The vast majority of cities have an exponentially inverse-proportional distribution, such that the proportion of trees in each successively larger DBH class decreases exponentially. The Shannon-Wiener index indicates an uneven DBH distribution in the cities with an exponentially inverse-proportional diameter distribution; these cities are dominated by trees in the smallest diameter class. Potential explanations for a large proportion of trees in the smallest diameter classes include a large number of small, naturally regenerating trees; a preference for smaller trees in urban areas; or a recent increase in tree planting efforts. Conclusions: Despite no statistical differences in DBH distributions for the 38 study cities, the functional, management, and planning implications will differ considerably.

AB  - The existence of submarine fresh groundwater has been recorded at continental shelves worldwide. The dynamic preservation and lifetime of fresh groundwater in the offshore environment remains an open hydrogeological problem. The mechanisms and time scales of fresh groundwater preservation are examined using numerical simulations based on a geologically representative model of the New Jersey shelf, USA. Utilizing two-dimensional depth-migrated seismic and well data, a detailed hydrogeological model is built, with a vertical resolution of 10 m. The model captures the highly heterogeneous shelf environment and accounts for porosity compaction trends derived from core data. The results show transient coupled simulations of groundwater flow and heat and salt transport from the late Pleistocene until present day and projected 18,000 years into the future. They reveal freshwater preservation patterns and yield simulated borehole salinity profiles broadly consistent with field observations. The simulations show that freshwater intervals of a thickness of 200-300 m and lateral extent of tens of kilometers may have been preserved from the Last Glacial Maximum until today. It was found that approximately 30-45% of the initial freshwater volume remains preserved after 12,000 years, depending on the recharge boundary condition. The preserved volume ranges between 15 and 30% after 30,000 years. These results improve the understanding of submarine preservation of fresh groundwater through an interdisciplinary approach which integrates seismic imaging, hydrogeological modeling and high-performance numerical simulation.

AB  - Open-pit mining causes severe land degradation in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Vegetation restoration on the degraded land with open-pit mining is challenging due to great physical and chemical condition changes of the post-mined landscape. In this study, we compared the vegetation community composition and environmental factors along three disturbance gradients (mining area, restoration area, and control area) in four typical open-pit mine types (phosphate, zinc, tin, and iron sites). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that there are significant differences in the vegetation communities along three gradients for these mine sites. Quality species were selected by indicator species analysis for vegetation restoration as follows: Chloris virgata Sw. and Artemisia princeps Pamp at the phosphate site; Coriaria nepalensis Wall., Artemisia princeps Pamp, and Picris hieracioides L. at the zinc site; Artemisia princeps Pamp at the tin site; and Panicum brevifolium L. at the iron site. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordination and Monte Carlo permutation tests were further used to determine the effects of environmental factors on vegetation diversity. The results showed that Cd, As, Zn, Pb, TC, and altitude all had significant effects on vegetation diversity (P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that the integrated effects of these variables on vegetation were greater in the mining area than in the other two gradients based on the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion. These results suggest that any plans for vegetation restoration in open-pit mining areas should take disturbance intensity, mine types, and critical environmental variables into account.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in deep-sea fauna ( > 200 m depth) of the northern Mexican Pacific is unknown. We measured the total Hg concentration (THg g/g wet weight) in 18 fish species, caught between 90 and 1100 m depth, in two ecoregions of the Mexican Pacific: The Gulf of California (GC) and the western coast of Baja California (BC), in the Southern Californian Pacific. We assessed spatial (ecoregion and depth) and biological (species, tissues, trophic position, sex and size) patterns of bioaccumulation. The highest THg concentrations were observed in liver (geometric mean: 1.28 2.31 g/g, range: < Method Detection Limit (MDL)-16.17 g/g), followed by muscle (geometric mean: 0.34 0.53 g/g, range: < MDL-6.12 g/g) and gonad (geometric mean: 0.29 0.49 g/g, range: < MDL-2.18 g/g). The maximum limit established for human consumption (1 g/g wet weight) was exceeded by 7.8% of the muscle samples and 31% exceeded the protection threshold for possible harmful effects in fish (0.2 g/g wet weight). We observed that THg concentrations tended to increase at higher trophic levels, total lengths and condition factors. Our results indicate a clear differentiation of the mercury bioaccumulation patterns between GC and BC, where GC species (200-500 m) had consistently higher liver/muscle concentration ratios than those from BC (600-1100 in). Altogether, the findings presented in this study are possible evidence of differential scenarios of environmental contamination.

AB  - Many pharmaceuticals inevitably end up in surface waters, exerting unwanted biological activity in nontarget organisms. This effect is confined by the compound's environmental persistence. Regulatory laboratory simulation tests are used in persistence assessment and exposure modeling. While doubt has been expressed about the usefulness of laboratory-derived persistence indicators under field conditions, these remain the only inputs for chemical fate models due to difficulties of measuring persistence in situ, especially at large scales. To improve understanding about relationships between laboratory experiments and the environmental fate in streams, we developed a mathematical model of biodegradation in stream networks and combined it with in-stream monitoring data to (i) test if persistence could be evaluated from field data, (ii) check if persistence extracted from laboratory tests applied in the field, and (iii) locate hot spots of biodegradation in a large river basin. The model describes partitioning, and particle settling and resuspension, and is structurally compatible with those applied for evaluating laboratory simulation tests. Application to the Rhine river basin suggests that biotransformation rate constants extracted from laboratory tests underestimate those in the field, yet the percentage of biotransformation in the Rhine basin is less than in the laboratory tests due effective biotransformation being limited to small- and medium-sized streams. In conclusion, our data show that biotransformation rates can accurately be predicted if (i) monitoring is performed across a wide range in stream order and (ii) precise estimates for consumption and removal rates at wastewater treatment plants are known.

AB  - Rising environmental pressures on water resources and resource quality associated with urbanisation, industrialisation, mining and agriculture are a global concern. In the current study the upper Olifants River catchment as case study was used, to show that acid mine drainage (AMD) and acid precipitation were the two most important drivers of possible acidification during a four-year study period. Over the study period 59% of the precipitation sampled was classified as acidic with a pH value below 5.6. Traces of acidification in the river system using aquatic organisms at different trophic levels were only evident in areas of AMD point sources. Data gathered from the ecotoxicology screening tools, revealed that discharge of untreated and partially treated domestic sewage from municipal sewage treatment works and informal housing partially mitigate any traces of acidification by AMD and acid precipitation in the main stem of the upper Olifants River. The outcome of the study using phytoplankton and macro invertebrates as indicator organisms revealed that the high loads of sewage effluent might have played a major role in the neutralization of acidic surface water conditions caused by AMD and acid precipitation. Although previous multi stage and microcosm studies confirmed the decrease in acidity and metals concentrations by municipal wastewater, the current study is the first to provide supportive evidence of this co-attenuation on catchment scale. These findings are important for integrated water resource management on catchment level, especially in river systems with a complex mixture of pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The bivalve mollusks are among the aquatic bioindicators that are commonly used in monitoring water pollution studies, thanks to their behavior and metabolism. They are directly affected by the level of pollution in a given site. During this research, the study of the biological response in gills, hepatopancreas and muscles of indigenous mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were used for monitoring, emissary's pollution in four polluted sites in the coastal environment of Casablanca. Seasonal variations of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes, catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as lipid peroxidation (LP) were measured as biomarkers within a one year period and compared to mussels from an unpolluted sampling site. This study was completed by analysing a series of abiotic factors (temperature, pH and conductivity) and chemicals (heavy metals; Hg, Pb, Cu) into seawater. Our result showed that the availability of metallic contamination and the environmental stress conditions causes relatively an oxidative stress in this species at each station studied. While the pollution's level clearly varies according to the sampling campaign. Furthermore, they revealed a significant increase in GST activities and LP concentrations and significant decrease in CAT activities in mussels collected in sites with industrial contamination. This negative correlation suggested that the organisms at this location are exposed to a relatively higher level of oxidative stress. This first study in the area confirm that variations of antioxidant defence enzymes activities and LP concentrations in mussels could be used as prospective biomarkers of toxicity in environmental monitoring programs.

For practical reasons, the adopted IMO-D2 standard for organisms in discharged ballast water only considers total abundance of biological indicators, without consideration of species richness or source community. Here we explore the effect of ballast-water source, ballast water exchange, chlorination, or a combination of both (hybrid treatment) on both colonization pressure and propagule pressure for one IMO-D2 size class (>= 10 mu m and < 50 mu m; phytoplankton). A strong reduction of propagule pressure was observed in all experimental trials and taxonomic groups, probably owing to environment conditions inside ballast tanks and treatment effects. However, only the hybrid treatment met the IMO-D2 standard for propagule pressure, while also significantly reducing colonization pressure, from 25 initial groups to 16 final groups. In this treatment, dinoflagellates and diatoms dominated final composition. The impact of different treatments on colonization pressure and propagule pressure was always lower when the vessel was ballasted in a brackish than freshwater port. Our study demonstrates that even treated ballast water compliant with the IMO-D2 standard may still harbor a diverse phytoplankton community, albeit with low individual species abundances. These results might be similar even using a type approved ballast water management systems which usually includes a filter for > 50 mu zeta m organisms as a pre-treatment.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems in Nothofagus antarctica (ire) forest have become an economical, ecological and productive alternative in Patagonia. Southern Patagonia's experience over the past 12 years with silvopastoral systems is reviewed. The productivity and nutritive value (crude protein content and dry matter digestibility) of the understorey grassland were dependent on the interaction of environmental (mainly soil water availability and light intensity) and management factors under the trees and in turn determined animal performance. A method developed for carrying capacity estimation at the paddock level was based on the potential aboveground net primary production, and values ranged from 85 to 2200 kg DM ha(-1) year(-1). Planned thinning in secondary forest stands provides wood production and also improves the undestorey DM production by increasing incoming radiation. Within a management plan, a stand's water stress conditions as well as the use of Reineke's stand density index are proposed to assist in determining thinning intensities. Livestock production is the main annual income of silvopastoral systems where cattle and mixed livestock production (cattle + sheep) is the main activity. Animal performance at the whole farm scale is presented by comparing traditional extensive grazing management with an adaptive silvopastoral management that included strategic separation in homogeneous areas (grass steppe, forest and riparian meadows), stocking rate adjustment to grassland net primary production and the protection of regeneration from herbivores browsing. Data from litter decomposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage studies also are presented. Finally, aspects related to the criteria and indicators to assess ire forest's sustainability under silvopastoral use along with biodiversity conservation issues are presented.

AB  - Bats are considered important bioindicators and deliver key ecosystem services to humans. However, it is not clear how the individual and combined effects of climate change and land-use change will affect their conservation in the future. We used a spatial conservation prioritization framework to determine future shifts in the priority areas for the conservation of 169 bat species under projected climate and' land-use change scenarios across Africa. Specifically, we modelled species distribution models under four different climate change scenarios at the 2050 horizon. We used land-use change scenarios within the spatial conservation prioritization framework to assess habitat quality in areas where bats may shift their distributions. Overall, bats' representation within already existing protected areas in Africa was low (similar to 5% of their suitable habitat in protected areas which cover similar to 7% of Africa). Accounting for future land-use change resulted in the largest shift in spatial priority areas for conservation actions, and species representation within priority areas for conservation actions decreased by similar to 9%. A large proportion of spatial conservation priorities will shift from forested areas with little disturbance under present conditions to agricultural areas in the future. Planning land use to reduce impacts on bats in priority areas outside protected areas where bats will be shifting their ranges in the future is crucial to enhance their conservation and maintain the important ecosystem services they provide to humans.

AB  - Understanding the processes that influence the structure of biotic communities is one of the major ecological topics, and both stochastic and deterministic processes are expected to be at work simultaneously in most communities. Here, we investigated the vertical distribution patterns of bacterial communities in a 10-m-long soil core taken within permafrost of the Qing-hai-Tibet Plateau. To get a better understanding of the forces that govern these patterns, we examined the diversity and structure of bacterial communities, and the change in community composition along the vertical distance (spatial turnover) from both taxonomic and phylogenetic perspectives. Measures of taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity revealed that bacterial community composition changed continuously along the soil core, and showed a vertical distance-decay relationship. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that bacterial alpha diversity and phylogenetic structure were strongly correlated with soil conductivity and pH but weakly correlated with depth. There was evidence that deterministic and stochastic processes collectively drived bacterial vertically-structured pattern. Bacterial communities in five soil horizons (two originated from the active layer and three from permafrost) of the permafrost core were phylogenetically random, indicator of stochastic processes. However, we found a stronger effect of deterministic processes related to soil pH, conductivity, and organic carbon content that were structuring the bacterial communities. We therefore conclude that the vertical distribution of bacterial communities was governed primarily by deterministic ecological selection, although stochastic processes were also at work. Furthermore, the strong impact of environmental conditions ( for example, soil physicochemical parameters and seasonal freeze-thaw cycles) on these communities underlines the sensitivity of permafrost microorganisms to climate change and potentially subsequent permafrost thaw.

AB  - Climate warming is expected to induce treelines to advance to higher elevations. Empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges, however, give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines and rather insignificant responses. The inconsistency of findings suggests distinct differences in the sensitivity of global treelines to recent climate change. It is still unclear where Himalayan treeline ecotones are located along the response gradient from rapid dynamics to apparently complete inertia. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding sensitivity and response of Himalayan treelines to climate warming, based on extensive field observations, published results in the widely scattered literature, and novel data from ongoing research of the present authors.
   Several sensitivity indicators such as treeline type, treeline form, seed-based regeneration, and growth patterns are evaluated. Since most Himalayan treelines are anthropogenically depressed, observed advances are largely the result of land use change. Near-natural treelines are usually krummholz treelines, which are relatively unresponsive to climate change. Nevertheless, intense recruitment of treeline trees suggests a great potential for future treeline advance. Competitive abilities of seedlings within krummholz thickets and dwarf scrub heaths will be a major source of variation in treeline dynamics. Tree growth-climate relationships show mature treeline trees to be responsive to temperature change, in particular in winter and pre-monsoon seasons. High pre-monsoon temperature trends will most likely drive tree growth performance in the western and central Himalaya. Ecological niche modelling suggests that bioclimatic conditions for a range expansion of treeline trees will be created during coming decades.

AB  - Forests are among the most important ecosystems for the provision of hydrological services. These include water supply and water damage mitigation, in the dimensions of quantity, timing and quality. Although the hydrological role of forests is well documented in the literature, a conceptual framework integrating these three dimensions is still missing. In this study, a comprehensive conceptual framework to improve the assessment of hydrological services provided by forests was developed. In addition, the framework was tested by an illustration for northern Portugal, a region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic climatic influences. The TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) framework of ecosystem services was adapted to the relation between forests and water. Then, this new framework was complemented with a set of spatially-explicit indicators that quantify the supply and demand of hydrological services. In addition, the implications of the framework were discussed in the context of the social-ecological systems, using the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, and Responses) model. Finally, the framework and the indicators were illustrated for northern Portugal using the water supply (quantity) and soil erosion control as examples. Results show that the proposed conceptual framework is a useful tool to support land planning and forest management, adapting the provision of hydrological services to the regional biophysical and social conditions. The test of the framework across a heterogeneous region suggests that a spatially explicit combination of system property, function, service and benefit indicators can be an effective way of analysing and managing the supply and demand of the hydrological services.

AB  - Environmental changes due to natural processes and anthropic modifications can be characterized by the degree of land cover modification and its environmental implications overtime. The main goal of the present study was to propose and apply a land cover modification geoindicator in order to assess the environmental condition of the territory per landscape units. It was designed to interpret diffuse information and transform it into a synthetic indicator that will be useful for environmental managers. The geoindicator evaluation was performed through a multi-temporal analysis of medium resolution Landsat satellite images and their unsupervised classification according to the direction of land use transitions. A change detection analysis between image pairs from 1973, 1991 and 2001 was made to detect unaffected areas and the areas in which positive or negative land cover changes could be observed. The proposed methodology was applied in the coastal palustrine area; specifically, in the marine-terrestrial ecotone of Campeche, Mexico. Geoindicator values during the 1974-1991 and 1991-2001 periods were low, 46.5% and 40.9%, respectively, due to the intrinsic limitations of coastal wetlands for productive activities. Urban and suburban transition areas showed high degrees of modification of about 39.5% and 32.1% for the first and the second period, respectively. Moderate modification, 4.9% in the first period and 5.7% in the second, was observed in isolated landscape units with recovering vegetation. The proposed geoindicator showed physiognomic and functional evidence of affectation levels from human activities, regeneration patterns and alteration of the landscape structure, modulated by the historical-economic process in the studied area.

AB  - Global warming is increasing the variability of climate change and intensifying hydrologic cycle components including precipitation, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and runoff. These changes increase the chance of more severe and frequent natural conditions, and limit ecosystem function and human activities. Adaptation to climate change requires assessment of the potential disaster risk. The objectives of this study were to estimate the flood risk index (FRI) considering regional flood characteristics at the national level and to prioritize the factors affecting flood risk through principal component analysis. FRI was estimated based on the Delphi survey results from 50 water resources experts in South Korea. The potential risk analysis was conducted for 229 local governments in South Korea. The results showed that natural and social factors were more influential flood risk factors to South Korea than administrative and economic and facility factors. Specifically, natural, social, administrative and economic, and facility factors were, respectively, highest at Jindo-Gun in Jennam-Do, Gumi-Si in Kyongsanbuk-Do, Dong-Gu in Incheon-Si, and Suwon-Si, Kyonggi-Do. Overall, the highest FRI is shown in Anyang-Si, Kyongggi-Do. The spatial distribution of the FRI was high in the southeastern coastal region and basins of the two biggest rivers in South Korea, and normalized flood frequency followed spatial patterns similar to FRIs. This study provided information on the relative flood risk index among administrative units for investment prioritization in flood risk management. In this regard, the suggested FRI is expected to significantly contribute to methodical and economic improvements in budget allocations for flood risk management.

AB  - Deadwood is an indicator that addresses many parameters of naturalness and is becoming a general reference for natural forests. If there are enough of the different kinds of deadwood in a forest, then it is likely to be properly natural. Also, it is a practical indicator, representing the health and biodiversity of forests. The aim of this research was to find out how much deadwood should be present in different developmental stages in a natural forest as a reference. For this purpose, a natural forest ecosystem in Mazandaran province, north of Iran, which is located in Noshahr, was selected. Species, diameter and height of all (living and dead) trees in each area were assessed. Then, developmental stages were determined, and their map was produced. The amount of deadwood was determined in different stages. Results showed that all three stages (initial, optimal and decay stage) could be recognized in the studied beech stands. Deadwood rate varied and greatest volume and number of it occurred in decay and initial stages, respectively. The frequency and volume of deadwood depend on the pattern of natural disturbance, developmental stages and stand structure. The amount of deadwood within managed forests is open to debate and requires detailed knowledge about beech stands in local conditions. So, based on these results in natural forests of beech in north of Iran, deadwood volume between 4.9 and 54.3 m(3) ha(-1) or 1.1-9.6 % of total volume of wood could be considered as a reasonable amount and each developmental stage must be different.

AB  - This study compares among fossil fuel power plants in PJM and California ISO by their unified (operational and environmental) performance. DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) is used as a methodology. For comparative analysis, DEA incorporates strategic concepts such as natural and managerial disposability into the computational process. This study explores both how to measure Returns to Scale (RTS) under natural disposability and how to measure Damages to Scale (DTS) under managerial disposability. This empirical study obtains two implications on US energy policy. One of the two policy implications is that California ISO outperforms PJM in terms of the three unified efficiency measures. The result implies that strict regulation on undesirable outputs, as found in California, is important in enhancing the performance of US fossil fuel power plants. Thus, it is necessary for federal and local governments to regulate the fossil fuel power plants under the strict implementation of environmental protection. Under such a policy direction, it is possible for US fossil fuel power plants to attain economic prosperity (by enhancing their operational efficiencies) and to satisfy environmental regulation (by enhancing their environmental efficiencies). The other policy implication is that coal-fired and gas-fired power plants in PJM and California ISO need to reduce their operational sizes or introduce technology innovation on desirable and undesirable outputs and/or new management for environmental protection within their operations. Meanwhile, oil-fired power plants may increase their operational sizes if they can introduce technology innovation and new management on undesirable outputs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Estuarine and coastal habitats are known to be polluted by a range of chemical contaminants from both industrial and domestic sources. Blue mussels (Mytilus spp.), which inhabit these areas, are widely used as bio-indicators in eco-toxicological studies, because of their sedentary nature and their ability to bio-accumulate contaminants. The analysis of DNA damage in mussel haemocytes is a valuable tool for biomonitoring but sampling issues related to storage, handling and transportation have often limited its application in large-scale monitoring programmes. This study uses a trial and error method to evaluate and validate a suitable protocol for cryopreservation of mussel haemocytes, thereby allowing material collected in the field to be analysed later under controlled laboratory conditions. Three different cell-culture media, i.e. Leibovitz-15, Hank's balanced salt solution and mussel physiological saline, along with four different cryoprotectants, i.e. dimethyl sulphoxide (10% and 20%), 1,2-propanediol (10%), ethylene glycol (10%) and glycerol (10%) were tested to assess their suitability for cryopreservation of mussel haemocytes for analysis in the comet assay. Experimental studies where mussel haemocytes were also exposed to UV radiation or benzo(a)pyrene were conducted in order to mimic environmental stresses and to verify the effectiveness of newly defined cryopreservation protocols. The comet assay was used to demonstrate that mussel haemocytes could be preserved at cryogenic temperatures for a month without altering levels of DNA damage, which could possibly be used for lab or field studies where time constraints or facilities do not allow instant analysis.

AB  - The analysis of sedimentary chironomid assemblages is an approach that has been widely adopted for inferring past environmental conditions. However, there is an ongoing discussion in the literature about whether this approach could become more sensitive at detecting past environmental changes if paleolimnologists conducted finer taxonomic analyses of their specimens. To advance this discussion, we conducted comparative analyses of larval chironomid assemblages resolved to two levels of taxonomic resolution. For this exercise, we chose to use live assemblages (as opposed to sub-fossil assemblages) because fine taxonomic resolution of live assemblages is more easily obtained. Our specific aims were to (i) determine if finely resolved taxa comprising a coarsely resolved group have similar ecological niches, (ii) determine if different environmental predictors of community composition are identified when two different levels of taxonomic resolution are applied and (iii) evaluate whether the variance explained by environmental variables differs substantially between levels of taxonomic resolution. We found that there was substantial dispersion among finely resolved taxa belonging to a single coarse group, which suggests that the merging of these taxa results in the loss of ecological information, and therefore warrants higher taxonomic precision. However, the identification of significant environmental predictors and the proportion of variance explained by these did not differ greatly between our two levels of taxonomic resolution. Overall our results show that coarse-resolution analyses may be adequate for some applications, but if the aim is to infer subtle environmental changes (as is the case in most paleolimnological studies) we recommend the highest possible level of taxonomic resolution.

AB  - The article presents the platform "Pimp your landscape" (PYL), which aims firstly at the support of planners by simulating alternative land-use scenarios and by an evaluation of benefits or risks for regionally important ecosystem services. Second, PYL supports an integration of information on environmental and landscape conditions into impact assessment. Third, PYL supports the integration of impacts of planning measures on ecosystem services. PYL is a modified 2-D cellular automaton with GIS features. The cells have the major attribute "land-use type" and can be supplemented with additional information, such as specifics regarding geology, topography and climate. The GIS features support the delineation of non-cellular infrastructural elements, such as roads or water bodies. An evaluation matrix represents the core element of the system. In this matrix, values in a relative scale from 0 (lowest value) to 100 (highest value) are assigned to the land-use types and infrastructural elements depending on their effect on ecosystem services. The option to configure rules for describing the impact of environmental attributes and proximity effects on cell values and land-use transition probabilities is of particular importance. User interface and usage of the platform are demonstrated by an application case. Constraints and limits of the recent version are discussed, including the need to consider in the evaluation, landscape-structure aspects such as patch size, fragmentation and spatial connectivity. Regarding the further development, it is planned to include the impact of land management practices to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in regional planning.

AB  - Aim
   In any region affected, fires exhibit a strong seasonal cycle driven by the dynamic of fuel moisture and ignition sources throughout the year. In this paper we investigate the global patterns of fire seasonality, which we relate to climatic, anthropogenic, land-cover and land-use variables.
   Location
   Global, with detailed analyses from single 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells.
   Methods
   We use a fire risk index, the Chandler burning index (CBI), as an indicator of the 'natural', eco-climatic fire seasonality, across all types of ecosystems. A simple metric, the middle of the fire season, is computed from both gridded CBI data and satellite-derived fire detections. We then interpret the difference between the eco-climatic and observed metrics as an indicator of the human footprint on fire seasonality.
   Results
   Deforestation, shifting cultivation, cropland production or tropical savanna fires are associated with specific timings due to land-use practices, sometimes largely decoupled from the CBI dynamics. Detailed time series from relevant locations provide comprehensive information about these practices and how they are adapted to eco-climatic conditions.
   Main conclusions
   We find a great influence of anthropogenic activities on global patterns of fire seasonality. The specificity of the main fire practices and their easy identification from global observation is a potential tool to support land-use monitoring efforts. Our results should also prove valuable in the development of a methodological approach for improving the representation of anthropogenic fire practices in dynamic global vegetation models.

AB  - We used a process-oriented model (Ecosim) to characterize changes in marine resources in the north-central (NC) Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean) from 1975 to 2002, and to explore the extent to which these changes were driven by trophic interactions, environment and fishing. Fishing efforts and fishing mortalities were used to drive the ecosystem model, and available biomass and catch data were compared to the model predictions. We calibrated and assessed the fit of the model using the sum of the squared deviations of the observed and predicted biomass values. Trophodynamic indicators were then calculated and used to analyse changes to the ecosystem. Trophic interactions, fishing, and environmental conditions were important driving factors of the ecosystem, Predictions from the model adequately matched observed biomass and catch data for each year. Observed trends and predicted data for biomasses decreased with time for several species, including Norway lobster, hake, red mullets, flatfish, and anchovy. The environmental functions resulting from the fitting procedure predicted that primary production and nutrients increased beyond the baseline from 1975 level, and then showed a decrease. They were negatively correlated with mean sea surface temperature and positively correlated with the Mediterranean Oscillation Index. Our results suggested that the NC Adriatic ecosystem became more degraded over time due to expanding fishing effort, bottom-up effects, and climatic anomalies. Possible mechanisms involved are discussed. Comparing our findings with descriptions of the south Catalan Sea ecosystem showed certain similarities between these 2 Mediterranean ecosystems and revealed unique features of the Adriatic Sea.

AB  - In this work, the processes and products involved in the generation of acid rock drainage - metal leaching (ARD-ML) from mine waste material (tailings) derived from the exploitation of an ore type Pb-Zn-Ag skarn were characterized. Laboratory tests (static and kinetic) of historic and recent tailings were conducted along with the mineralogical characterization of solids, and chemical analyses of solids and leachates. Pyrite (FeS2) is the most abundant sulfide phase, and one of the main minerals promoting ARD-ML generation, followed by pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) and arsenopyrite (FeAsS). Carbonates are present as calcite (CaCO3) and lesser amounts of ankerite [Ca(Fe,Mg)(CO3)(2)]. Also, smaller concentrations of quartz and feldspar were identified. Results of the static tests (acid base accounting: ABA) indicate that both, recent and historic tailings, have a likely ARD-ML potential (neutralization potential, NP < 1). Kinetic tests were performed in humidity cells to simulate the natural oxidation of primary mineral samples; the obtained leachates had circum-neutral pH values (4.5-7.9) and relatively low heavy metals contents. Nevertheless, oxidation-neutralization curves suggest that oxidation capacity in both sample types is higher than their neutralizing capacity, and that sulfide oxidation is more important in historic than in recent tailings. The obtained information, along with statistical tests (F ratio and t-student), demonstrated that the tailings have a strong capacity to generate ARD-ML, and that the particular characteristics of the historic and recent mine waste materials created different conditions for the generation of ARD-ML.

KW  - VARIABILITY
AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) analyzing global climate change tendencies and their possible impacts on the natural environment and human lifestyles has determined that the ocean and sea level fluctuations are among the indicators of climate change. Annual variations of hydrometeorological conditions were found to have been predetermined not by a steady increase or decrease of one parameter but by their variations within seasons. Therefore the present paper deals with the long-term seasonal Baltic Sea level fluctuations near the Lithuanian coast. Mean monthly values of sea level measured in the port of Klaipeda were chosen for detailed analysis of sea level fluctuations in the Baltic Sea. The long-term dynamic pattern of mean sea level fluctuations near Klaipeda includes two time spans distinguished by pronounced differences of sea level rise intensity: 1898-1975 and 1976-2005. The 51-year time span for a detailed analysis of long-term seasonal sea level fluctuations (1955-2005) was chosen purposefully because it best reflects the changes of sea level rise intensity. The analysis of long-term seasonal sea level fluctuations revealed cyclic character. Yet the monthly cycle phases not always coincide. Also it was determined that the character of maximal mean monthly sea level dynamics in cold season had changed. Generalized comparative analysis of monthly sea level dynamics and climate variations showed that the sea level dynamics was a good reflection of the climate changes in cold season (October-March), whereas in warm season (April-September), sea level fluctuations were not so well reflected in climate changes.

AB  - Vibrio cholerae is autochthonous to natural waters and can pose a health risk when it is consumed via untreated water or contaminated shellfish. The correlation between the occurrence of V. cholerae in Chesapeake Bay and environmental factors was investigated over a 3-year period. Water and plankton samples were collected monthly from five shore sampling sites in northern Chesapeake Bay (January 1998 to February 2000) and from research cruise stations on a north-south transect (summers of 1999 and 2000). Enrichment was used to detect culturable V. cholerae, and 21.1% (n = 427) of the samples were positive. As determined by serology tests, the isolates, did not belong to serogroup 01 or 0139 associated with cholera epidemics. A direct fluorescent-antibody assay was used to detect V. cholerae 01, and 23.8% (n = 412) of the samples were positive. V cholerae was more frequently detected during the warmer months and in northern Chesapeake Bay, where the salinity is lower. Statistical models successfully predicted the presence of V. cholerae as a function of water temperature and salinity. Temperatures above 19degreesC and salinities between 2 and 14 ppt yielded at least a fourfold increase in the number of detectable V. cholerae. The results suggest that salinity variation in Chesapeake Bay or other parameters associated with Susquehanna River inflow contribute to the variability in the occurrence of V. cholerae and that salinity is a useful indicator. Under scenarios of global climate change, increased climate variability, accompanied by higher stream How rates and warmer temperatures, could favor conditions that increase the occurrence of V. cholerae in Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the values of basic blood indicators and of biochemical plasma indicators of wels (Silurus glanis L.) intensively bred in warmed power station water without natural feeds. The study included 8 feeding experiments using 4 imported (ALMA, BioMar) and 4 domestic pelleted feeds with different protein (40 - 49%) and fat (8 - 22%) content. The experiment involved 3265 one-year-old sheat fish (Su(1)) of 209 and 295 g average individual weight (in 1996 and 1997, respectively). Analysed were 56 fish of 15 months (1997) and 17 months (1996) of age, individual weight 1288 and 752 g (1996 and 1997, respectively). The average values of blood indicators in fish of all the studied groups were the following: PCV 0.26 l.l(-1), Hb 56.88 g.l(-1), BC 0.78 T.l(-1), Leuko 30.13 G.l(-1), MCV 317.65 fl, MCH 68.90 pg and MCHC 0.21 l.l(-1). The leukogram had a lymphocytic character with a lower number of mature granulocytes. Average values of the biochemical blood plasma indicators were as follows: glucose 4.96 mmol.l(-1) total protein (TP) 29.89 g.l(-1), total lipids (TL) 8.81 g.l(-1) and cholesterol (chol) 4.57 mmol.l(-1).
   Significant changes (P < 0.05) in hematological indicators were found in fish fed the PD2 feed mixture and very significant (P < 0.01) differences in the Chol a TL values in fish fed BioMar and W 97. These data characterise the adaptation reaction of the internal environment of wels to conditions of intensive aquaculture with warmed water and the nutritional value of used feeds.

AB  - Cadmium is a micronutrient element and a tracer of biological productivity in the ocean. The contrasting Cd distributions in sediments from modern restricted basins, continental oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), and oxic settings make it possible to establish accurate thresholds to distinguish between various environments. By receiver operating characteristic analysis, we propose that Cd 14.5 mu g/g and Cd/Al > 4.33 x 10-4 provide strong evidence for deposition within perennial OMZs, while Cd < 0.52 mu g/g and Cd/Al < 0.08 x 10-4 separate oxic sediments from anoxic sediments. With the modern Cd cycle as a guide, we present a case study of sedimentary Cd enrichment through a slope-basin transect in the early Cambrian Nanhua Basin, South China. With increasing water depth, the patterns of Cd concentrations and Cd/Al ratios are similar to those of the modern Peruvian margin, which are characterized by highest Cd enrichments in the OMZ core and muted Cd enrichments at the upper and lower edges of the OMZ. These data, combined with previous studies, indicate that the OMZ-like structure might be common in early Cambrian oceans. Furthermore, we analyzed Cd contents of shales from the Mesoproterozoic and assemble them with published data to explore the secular evolution of seawater Cd inventory. We find that a significant increase in Cd abundance and Cd/Al ratio occurs through the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, reflecting enlarged Cd reservoir and widespread ocean oxygenation. Overall, Cd geochemistry can provide unique information concerning the redox state and hydrological condition of paleoenvironment.

AB  - Wireless virtual reality integrated multidisciplinary technology, combined with related industries and fields, has changed the way of human-computer interaction and opened up a new field of user experience. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of computer technology and hardware conditions, interactive technology has developed rapidly. The existing wireless virtual reality interactive system is too single and cannot be used in multiple environments. The original system requires a large number of sensor equipment, the cost is high, and the traditional perception technology is too restrictive and cannot realize human-computer interaction more naturally. This paper proposes a dual intention perception algorithm based on the fusion of touch (obtained by experimental simulation equipment), hearing, and vision. The algorithm can perceive the user's operation intention through the user's natural behavior and can identify the user's two intentions at the same time. This paper proposes a navigational interactive mode, which provides users with multimodal intelligent navigation through intelligent perception of user intent and experimental progress. We determine the impact model of the interactive system effect evaluation and analyze its effect evaluation strategy in depth and then further quantify the indicators under the four effect dimensions of information perception, artistic reflection, social entertainment, and aesthetic experience. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to carry out relevant research on effect evaluation, usability test, and questionnaire interview. The experimental results show that this interactive system has better entertainment effects than other forms of film and television animation, but still needs to pay attention to and strengthen the construction and embodiment of film and television animation content, as well as the optimization and perfection of the fault-tolerant mechanism in the design process.

AB  - The induction and relaxation of photochemistry and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) are not instantaneous and require time to respond to fluctuating environments. There is a lack of integrated understanding on how photochemistry and NPQ influence photosynthesis in fluctuating environments. We measured the induction and relaxation of chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange in poplar and cotton at varying temperatures under saturating and fluctuating lights. When the light shifted from dark to high, the fraction of open reaction centers in photosystem II (q(L)) gradually increased while NPQ increased suddenly and then remained stable. Temperature significantly changed the response of q(L) but not that of NPQ during the dark to high light transition. Increased q(L) led to higher photosynthesis but their precise relationship was affected by NPQ and temperature. q(L) was significantly related to biochemical capacity. Thus, q(L) appears to be a strong indicator of the activation of carboxylase, leading to the similar dynamics between q(L) and photosynthesis. When the light shifted from high to low intensity, NPQ is still engaged at a high level, causing a stronger decline in photosynthesis. Our finding suggests that the dynamic effects of photochemistry and NPQ on photosynthesis depend on the phases of environmental fluctuations and interactive effects of light and temperature. Across the full spectra of light fluctuation, the slow induction of q(L) is a more important limiting factor than the slow relaxation of NPQ for photosynthesis in typical ranges of temperature for photosynthesis. The findings provided a new perspective to improve photosynthetic productivity with molecular biology under natural fluctuating environments.

AB  - The Gran Chaco Americano is a large subtropical plain and one of the major biogeographic and morphostructural territories of South-America. Eastern Chaco is the wettest sector of the Gran Chaco and has heterogeneous environments. It includes different types of woodlands and forests together with savannahs, grasslands and wetlands. These vegetation patterns have been proposed to be the result of the Quaternary alluvial plain dynamics and the intensive migration of the Chacoan main rivers. Fossil records-that show change-are scarce and most of them come from the Fidelidad Formation (late Holocene). This Formation is located on the Bermejo River natural levees near the Villa Escolar Town (Formosa Province, Argentina). Fern fossils discovered in this Formation correspond to heterosporous aquatic ferns (Salviniaceae). The impressions were assigned to Salvinia cf. minima Baker 1886. These correspond with orbicular to elliptical leaves, with a smooth margin, and both the apex and the base are rounded. The base bears a slightly developed petiole. The venation pattern is dichotomous with anastomoses forming areolas. Generally, four tubercles (trichome bases) per areola are observed. The massulae and spores correspond to Azolla cristata Kaulfuss 1824. The massulae are rounded, oval or kidney-shaped and have septate glochidia. Spores are trilete and spheroidal. The floating ferns Salvinia and Azolla are good indicators of open fresh-water or wetlands paleo-environments. Hence, the lower levels of the Fidelidad Formation are associated with mostly calm freshwater bodies such as rivers, streams or wetlands, which are closely related to the activity of the Bermejo River during the late Holocene. These aquatic fern fossils provide new insights into paleoenvironmental conditions and increase the paleontological richness of the Eastern Chaco.

AB  - Chemical-contaminant mixtures are widely reported in large stream reaches in urban/agriculture-developed watersheds, but mixture compositions and aggregate biological effects are less well understood in corresponding smaller headwaters, which comprise most of stream length, riparian connectivity, and spatial biodiversity. During 20142017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured 389 unique organic analytes (pharmaceutical, pesticide, organic wastewater indicators) in 305 headwater streams within four contiguous United States (US) regions. Potential aquatic biological effects were evaluated for estimated maximum and median exposure conditions using multiple lines of evidence, including occurrence/concentrations of designed-bioactive pesticides and pharmaceuticals and cumulative risk screening based on vertebrate-centric ToxCast (TM) exposure-response data and on invertebrate and nonvascular plant aquatic life benchmarks. Mixed-contaminant exposures were ubiquitous and varied, with 78% (304) of analytes detected at least once and cumulative maximum concentrations up to more than 156,000 ng/L. Designed bioactives represented 83% of detected analytes. Contaminant summary metrics correlated strong-positive (rho (rho): 0.5690.719) to multiple watershed-development metrics, only weak-positive to point-source discharges (rho: 0.225353), and moderate- to strong-negative with multiple instream invertebrate metrics (rho: -0.373 to -0.652). Risk screening indicated common exposures with high probability of vertebrate-centric molecular effects and of acute toxicity to invertebrates, respectively. The results confirm exposures to broad and diverse contaminant mixtures and provide convincing multiple lines of evidence that chemical contaminants contribute substantially to adverse multi-stressor effects in headwater-stream communities.

AB  - One key tool to manage fragile ecosystems in arid lands is knowledge of land degradation. For this purpose, field-based soil and vegetation characteristics were related to remote sensing information extracted from Landsat OLI moving standard deviation index (MSDI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) in degraded (watering points and livestock camps) and reference sites of arid rangelands of Iran. Values of spectral indices along grazing gradients at a distance of 50-1500 m from the centre of degradation were also extracted and analysed. Statistical analysis (t-test and ordination analysis) shows that MSDI is a sensitive index of landscape heterogeneity and, unlike other indices, exhibits a significant difference between degraded and reference sites. MSDI was sensitive to grazing gradients around watering points and livestock camps, and declined with increasing distance from these areas, although this varied between different sites due to grazing intensity and characteristics of soil and vegetation cover. Soil analysis showed that the amount of organic carbon, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and soil stability indicator (SSI) at reference sites were significantly higher than those at degraded areas. Ordination analysis confirmed the results of t-test regarding the high potential capability of MSDI in separating degraded areas. This simple and practical index can be used to determine ecological thresholds and investigating rangeland condition in arid ecosystems.

AB  - While water-energy-food (WEF) nexus is a major livelihood sources for local community, its security issues grow continually and there is limited information on how nexus resource management is effective at delivering livelihoods and food security. These difficulties are related to the lack of local community knowledge of the use and exploitation of water, energy, and food resources; this limited awareness leads to trade-offs, especially in local and marginalized areas. On the basis of data collected from a local community through a survey-based approach, this study examines local community perception of nexus resources and their contribution to livelihoods. The results indicate that community perceptions of nexus resources can be understood through social, natural, economic, human, physical, and environmental livelihood indicators. According to our findings, the perception of nexus resources is based on the benefits of individual resources rather than their interlinkages. This could be the result of community perceptions of a particular nexus resource from three nexus sector, that is, food. Food is the center of nexus resources for the community in the study area. This indicates, that there is a missing link between cross-sectorial resource utilization and management, and full-scale adoption of the WEF nexus to enhance living conditions. Our findings suggest that there is a low understanding of WEF nexus resource use and management, and the livelihood benefit of individual nexus resources is the primary focus in the studied community. From these results, we recommend more action to be taken by the government and other stakeholders to improve the local community perception of nexus resources for their livelihoods.

AB  - Acid mine drainage represents an extreme type of water pollution. The environments develop especial hydrochemical and ecological characteristics, such as high concentrations of acidity and low biodiversity, with dominance of acidophilic organisms.
   Ecological criteria are assuming increasing relevance for assessing water quality, including in acid mine drainage-affected systems. Photosynthetic pigments, like chlorophyll, could be considered in this context as they are generally used to estimate phytoplankton biomass.
   The present work was focused on acid mine drainage and their relationships with chlorophyll a. It was developed in the historic mine of Sao Domingos (Iberian Pyrite Belt, SW Europe). The methodological approach comprised two sampling campaigns (October and February) to represent seasonal behaviour. The diversity of hydrological conditions was also considered through sampling sites established in the pit lake, acidic lagoons and affected stream. Hydrochemistry and chlorophyll a were analysed. The obtained results revealed very low pH values, with a minimum of 2.1. In general, hydrochemistry indicates higher concentrations of pollutants in summer. One of the sampling point, located in an acidic lagoon, stood out by highest concentrations, presenting maximum of sulfate (6564 mg/L), As (6.26 mg/L), and metals like Al (675 mg/L), Cd (1,30 mg/L), Zn (199 mg/L). These highest concentrations coincided with the maximum concentration of chlorophyll a (113 mu g/L). The results suggested that the more contaminated the environment, more chlorophyll a was produced. Factor analyses emphasised the relationships between acid drainage properties and the photosynthetic activity, indicating a strong pH dependency of chlorophyll a production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Light is a primary driver of lake ecosystem metabolism, and the dependence of primary production on light is often quantified as a photosynthesis-irradiance or "P-I" curve. The parameters of the P-I curve (e.g., the maximum primary production when light is in excess) can change through time due to a variety of biological factors (e.g., changes in biomass or community composition), which themselves are subject to external drivers (e.g., herbivory or nutrient availability). However, the relative contribution of variation in the P-I curve to overall ecosystem metabolism is largely unknown. I developed a statistical model of ecosystem metabolism with time-varying parameters governing the P-I curve, while also accounting for the influence of temperature. I parameterized the model with dissolved oxygen time series spanning six summers from Lake Myvatn, a shallow eutrophic lake in northern Iceland with large temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism. All of the estimated parameters of the P-I curve varied substantially through time. The sensitivity of primary production to light under light-limiting conditions was particularly variable (>15-fold) and had a compensatory relationship with ambient light levels. However, the 3.5-fold variation in the maximum potential primary production made the largest contribution to variation in ecosystem metabolism, accounting for around 90% of the variance in net ecosystem production. Much of the variation in maximum primary production was attributable to cyanobacterial blooms, which occur in some but not all years in Myvatn. Overall, these results illustrate how changes in the P-I curve contribute substantially to temporal variation in lake ecosystem metabolism.

AB  - Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in 22 surface sediment samples and an approximately 100-year scale sediment core collected from Poyang Lake. This valuable sediments enable analysis of spatial and temporal distribution patterns of PAH sources, and determine the anthropogenic impacts on Poyang Lake. Total PAH concentrations in the surface sediments ranged from 73.2 to 367.2 ng/g dw, and higher residues were encountered in regions with high-density populations and intensive human activities. Total PAH concentrations in the sediment core ranged from 42.0 to 334.0 ng/g dw and were grouped in two clusters (pre-1990s and post-1990s to the present). PAH concentrations in sediments changed both temporally and spatially, suggesting a difference in PAH sources. Before the 1990s, major PAH sources in the sediment core were from coal, wood and grass combustion. This finding naturally agrees with open lake conditions on a spatial scale, which were related to agricultural activities. Petroleum combustion from industrialization and urbanization has become the predominant PAH source in the sediment core from the 1990s to the present and corresponds to sources observed in the southwestern lake near the relatively developed Nanchang City. In the northern lake leading to the Yangtze River, certain petroleum-related contaminants from shipping have become the main PAH sources. The different PAH sources observed in sediments generally reflect the degree of socio-economic development in the Poyang Lake valley, which is consistent with the local written records, indirectly validating the connection of sediment PAH records to the history of human activities in and around Poyang Lake.

AB  - Climate change is leading to northward shifts in species distributions that is altering interspecific interactions at low-and mid-trophic levels. However, little attention has been focused on the effects of redistributions of species on the trophic ecology of a high trophic-level predator assemblage. Here, during a 22-year period (1990-2012) of increasing sea temperature (1.0 degrees C) and decreasing sea ice extent (12%) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, we examined the trophic structure of a near-apex predator assemblage before (1990-2002) and after (2005-2012) an increase in the availability of capelin-generally an indicator species in colder marine environments for a warming climate. Stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used in a Bayesian framework to assess shifts in diet, niche size and community-wide metrics for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), ringed seals (Ansa hispida), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). After 2005, consumption of forage fish increased for all predator species, suggesting diet flexibility with changing abiotic and biotic conditions. An associated temporal shift from a trophically diverse to a trophically redundant predator assemblage occurred where predators now play similar trophic roles by consuming prey primarily from the pelagic energy pathway. Overall, these long-term ecological changes signify that trophic shifts of a high trophic-level predator assemblage associated with climate change have occurred in the Arctic food web.

AB  - An ever-increasing diversity of potentially toxic chemical compounds are being developed and released into the environment as a result of human activities (e.g. agriculture, drugs, and cosmetics). Among these, pesticides have been shown to affect non-targeted wildlife since the 1960s. A range of ecotoxicological tests are used to assess the toxicity of pesticides on various model organisms. However most model organisms are metazoans, while the majority of Eukaryotes are unicellular microorganisms known as protists. Protists are ubiquitous organisms of key functional roles in all ecosystems but are so far little studied with respect to pesticide impact. To fill this gap, we developed a new ecotoxicological test based on Euglypha rotunda, a common soil amoeba, grown in culture flask with Escherichia coli as sole food source. We tested this assay with the herbicide S-metolachlor, which is known to affect cell division in seedling shoots and roots of weeds. Reproducible growth conditions were obtained for E. rotunda. The growth of E. coil was not affected by the herbicide. The growth of E. rotunda was affected by the herbicide in a non-linear way, growth being significantly reduced at ca. 15 mu g/L but not at 150 mu g/L Our results show the potential for using soil protists in ecotoxicology and adds to the growing body of evidence for non-linear impacts of pesticides on non-target organisms. With the acquisition of additional data, the protocol should be suitable for standard ecotoxicological tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conversion of old-growth into secondary forest changes profoundly the community structure of most plant life-forms, including the communities of terrestrial herbs. Here, we verify how herb communities are affected by environmental variables of old-growth and secondary stands of South Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We identified all herbaceous species and estimated their frequency and cover in 16 plots of 6 x 6 m in each forest type. We used the structural characteristics of the tree component (i.e., basal area, density, average height and canopy openness) and soil parameters as environmental variables of each forest. Results showed that old-growth and secondary forests have distinct herb composition, with the later showing higher plant cover and species diversity. Canopy openness and soil parameters explained part of the variation in herb composition between forests. Herb cover and richness responded positively to soil fertility in both forests, and in secondary forest these two descriptors were also positively correlated with canopy openness. The abiotic differences between forests allowed the establishment of herbaceous species with different ecological requirements, especially in the secondary forest, marked by input of species typically found in disturbed environments. These species contribute to the higher cover values and species richness in secondary forest. Our findings suggest that changes in environmental conditions in a forest substantially change the herb community. Because of their importance as environmental indicators, herb communities can contribute to a better understanding of successional patterns in the Atlantic Forest.

AB  - This study is focused on determining the response behaviour of five saline plant communities to two environmental variables: flooding and salinity. Also, total soil organic carbon, diversity, plant cover and vegetation height were measured. Once this behaviour is known, the impacts of future climate scenarios may be approached. Since some of these variables could be altered by climate change, the future vegetation dynamics might indicate the trending of change, so plant communities can be used as bioindicators. The investigation was carried out in some small coastal wetlands located in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Low values of diversity were found in these plant communities due to a great effect of flooding, followed by salinity. 'Reed beds' are bioindicators of flooding and environmental disturbance. 'Saline rushes' are also flooding bioindicators and efficient accumulators of organic matter. 'Mediterranean halophilous scrubs' are bioindicators of seasonal flooding and changes to salinity. 'Mediterranean halo-nitrophilous scrubs' might be considered as bioindicators of low flooding and low salinity in anthropic environment while 'Mediterranean salt steppes' bioindicate driest conditions. At present, Mediterranean halophilous scrubs are the most widely extended community, which could be interpreted as a consequence of a changing and sharply seasonal climate. Our research suggests that future climate change scenarios involving flooding increases would support the proliferation of the lowest diversity and thus lower ecological value plant communities (i.e. reed beds). Conversely, a future scenario of decreasing flooding would benefit the most diverse and valuable conservation community actually priortized by European Habitats Directive (Mediterranean salt steppes, Limonietalia).

AB  - Standard NASA ocean color algorithm OC4 was developed on the basis of ocean optical data and while appropriate for Case 1 oceanic waters could not be adequately applied for the Black Sea waters due to its different bio-optical properties. OC4 algorithm is shown to overestimate chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a) in summer and underestimate Chl-a during early spring phytoplankton blooms in the Black Sea. For correct conversion of satellite data to Chl-a, primary production and other indicators regional algorithms should be developed taking into account bio-optical properties of the Black Sea waters. Light absorption by phytoplankton pigments-a(ph)(lambda) have been measured in open sea and shelf Black Sea waters in different seasons since 1998. It was shown that the first optical depth was located within the upper mixed layer (UML) for most of the year with the exception of the spring when seasonal stratification was developing. As a result spectral features of water leaving radiance were determined by optical properties of the UML. Significant seasonal differences in Chl-a specific light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton within UML have been revealed. These differences were caused by adaptive changes of composition and intracellular pigment concentration due to variable environment conditions-mainly light intensity. Empirical relationships between a(ph)(lambda) and Chl-a were derived by least squares fitting to power functions for different seasons. Incorporation of these results will refine the regional ocean color models and provide improved and seasonally adjusted estimates of chlorophyll a concentration, downwelling radiance and primary production in the Black Sea based on satellite data.

AB  - Description of the subject. Soil organisms and their activities are essential for soil ecosystem functioning and they can thus be used as pertinent indicators of soil quality. Recent efforts have been undertaken to include biological indicators of soil quality into regional/national monitoring networks.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to provide a first dataset of six biological indicators and two eco-physiological quotients for two landscape units in Wallonia. These spatial units are characterized by homogeneous climate conditions, soil type, land-use and management (here, grasslands in the Ardennes, and croplands in the Loam Region).
   Method. Respiration potential, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, net nitrogen mineralization, metabolic potential of soil bacteria and earthworm abundance were measured at a total of 60 sites in two different landscape units (LSU). Variability within each LSU was studied. Data was synthesized through calculation of a comprehensive score and presentation as radar plots.
   Results. All selected biological indicators were significantly higher under grassland than under cropland soils, highlighting the biological indicators' power of discrimination between main land use types. Variability within LSU depended on the biological indicator and was generally higher in grassland than in cropland soils. Each site could unambiguously be assigned to its landscape unit based on its calculated comprehensive score. Radar plots allowed an assessment of the distribution of values within a landscape unit at a glance.
   Conclusions. The pilot-study defined the first baseline values for agricultural soils in Wallonia and laid the foundation for a monitoring network of biological soil quality.

AB  - The Republic of Serbia has significant resources for the development of agriculture (natural, scientific and professional). However, agriculture doesn't achieve the results adequate to conditions it has and which are expected of it. The aim of the research in this paper is to perceive the contribution of agriculture in the development of Serbia. The contribution of agriculture was considered by an analysis of next indicators: 1. Share of rural population in total population and an active rural population in the total work force, 2. Share of agriculture in the creation of gross domestic product (GDP) and, 3. Contribution of agriculture and agro-industry to the foreign trade exchange. The analysis of the mentioned indicators points out that our developmental strategy must be based on the increase of agricultural-food products export (intensive production), and the change in production structure in accordance with the solvent demand (especially for the demand of ecologically healthy food) and which level of finalization would be higher, in order to increase competitiveness and a new value. In this paper were used published data of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, and then the research results of some authors in this field, as well as the results of the authors' other research. The research period was from the year 2000 to the year 2015. In the analysis of contribution (performances) of agriculture were used the system and comparative analysis, as well as the standard statistical - mathematical instrumentation: average values, a rate of change and a coefficient of determination. In the paper were presented also the linear trends of GDP and income of agriculture and a share of agriculture in GDP, as well as the export/import of whole economy and agriculture trends.

AB  - Panax ginseng CA. Meyer is a valuable herb in China that has also gained popularity in the West because of its pharmacological properties. The constituents isolated and characterized in ginseng stems include ginsenosides, fatty acids, amino acids, volatile oils, and polysaccharides. In this study, the effects of fungicide azoxystrobin applied on antioxidant enzyme activity and ginsenosides content in ginseng stems was studied by using Panax ginseng C. A. Mey. cv. (the cultivar of Ermaya) under natural environmental conditions. The azoxystrobin formulation (25% SC) was sprayed three times on ginseng plants at different doses (150 g a.i./ha and 225 g a.i./ ha), respectively. Two new fatty acids esters (ethyl linoleate and methyl linolenate) were firstly detected in ginseng stems by the application of azoxystrobin as foliar spray. The results indicated that activities of enzymatic antioxidants, the content of ginsenosides and two new fatty acids esters in ginseng stems in azoxystrobin-treated plants were increased. Azoxystrobin treatments to ginseng plants at all growth stages suggest that the azoxystrobin-induced delay of senescence is due to an enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity protecting the plants from harmful active oxygen species (AOS). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in azoxystrobintreated plants was about 1-3 times higher than that in untreated plants. And the effects was more significant (P = 0.05) when azoxystrobin was applied at dose of 225 g a.i./ha. This work suggests that azoxystrobin plays an important role in delaying of senescence by changing physiological and biochemical indicators and increasing ginsenosides content in ginseng stems.

AB  - Increasing activity of oil sands extraction and processing in northern Alberta is marked by ongoing controversy about the nature and extent of associated environmental impacts. Bitumen contains a mixture of toxic chemicals, including metals and residual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), whose release into the environment poses a distinct risk to the surrounding environment, plus wildlife and human health. In the present study, the authors evaluated several subclinical biomarkers of exposure and effect to mixtures of metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg) and/or PAHs (3 alkylated forms) at environmentally relevant concentrations (100-fold and 10-fold higher than the maximum dissolved concentrations found in snow, to simulate a worst-case scenario), using laboratory mice as a model for future studies of small mammals in the wild. Both metals and alkyl-PAHs exposure were associated with 1) increased relative liver, kidney, and spleen size; 2) alterations in the homeostasis of the antioxidant vitamins A and E in liver; and 3) compromised glutathione redox status in testes, with results also indicating synergistic interactions from co-exposure. The combination of morphometric and oxidative stress biomarkers provide reliable and sensitive measures of the response to contaminant exposure in a mammalian model, suggesting associated physiological costs. Based on the present experimental study, the authors propose that wild small mammals will prove to be valuable sentinel species reflecting sublethal health effects from oil sands-related contaminants. The present study's results also present a basis for the interpretation of future field data. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2884-2897. (c) 2015 SETAC

AB  - Beta diversity describes how local communities within an area or region differ in species composition/abundance. There have been attempts to use changes in beta diversity as a biotic indicator of disturbance, but lack of theory and methodological caveats have hampered progress. We here propose that the neutral theory of biodiversity plus the definition of beta diversity as the total variance of a community matrix provide a suitable, novel, starting point for ecological applications. Observed levels of beta diversity (BD) can be compared to neutral predictions with three possible outcomes: Observed BD equals neutral prediction or is larger (divergence) or smaller (convergence) than the neutral prediction. Disturbance might lead to either divergence or convergence, depending on type and strength. We here apply these ideas to datasets collected on oribatid mites (a key, very diverse soil taxon) under several regimes of disturbances. When disturbance is expected to increase the heterogeneity of soil spatial properties or the sampling strategy encompassed a range of diverging environmental conditions, we observed diverging assemblages. On the contrary, we observed patterns consistent with neutrality when disturbance could determine homogenization of soil properties in space or the sampling strategy encompassed fairly homogeneous areas. With our method, spatial and temporal changes in beta diversity can be directly and easily monitored to detect significant changes in community dynamics, although the method itself cannot inform on underlying mechanisms. However, human-driven disturbances and the spatial scales at which they operate are usually known. In this case, our approach allows the formulation of testable predictions in terms of expected changes in beta diversity, thereby offering a promising monitoring tool.

AB  - Biogas is a renewable energy resource produced during the anaerobic digestion of various organic substrates. A wide community of microorganisms is involved, including methanogens. These Archaea are the biologic key to the process because they accomplish the methane-forming reaction. Despite its crucial role, the microbiome inside the digester is poorly understood. The aim of this work is to develop bioindicators of efficiency for the anaerobic process through the quantification and characterisation of the methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria. From a full-scale digester fed with organic wastes, 31 samples were collected. Temperature, pH, acidity, alkalinity and biogas quantity and quality were monitored over time. The methanogens were detected from the samples both in total and as belonging to different taxa units. These evaluations, by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) methods, produced valuable results for Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta, Methanocorpusculaceae and sulphate-reducing bacteria. Methanosarcina was the most abundant family, followed by Methanocorpusculaceae and then Methanosaeta. The methanogen taxa are significantly and directly correlated with each other (p < 0.05). Methanosaeta and Methanocorpusculaceae are present in significantly different amounts at different temperatures. While Methanosaeta levels also change when the organic load increases (t test, p < 0.05), Methanosarcina is more tolerant, and its levels are quite constant. Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta are proposed to be bioindicators of the stability of the process (the first) and of susceptibility (the second) to detect early sufferance conditions in the digester. These methods will be useful in the control and optimisation of an eco-friendly waste-to-energy system.

AB  - Hormone systems evolved over 500 million years of animal natural history to motivate feeding behavior and convert excess calories to fat. These systems produced vertebrates, including humans, who are famine-resistant but sensitive to obesity in environments of persistent overnutrition. We looked for cell-intrinsic metabolic features, which might have been subject to an evolutionary drive favoring lipogenesis. Mitochondrial protein acetylation appears to be such a system. Because mitochondrial acetyl-coA is the central mediator of fuel oxidation and is saturable, this metabolite is postulated to be the fundamental indicator of energy excess, which imprints a memory of nutritional imbalances by covalent modification. Fungal and invertebrate mitochondria have highly acetylated mitochondrial proteomes without an apparent mitochondrially targeted protein lysine acetyltransferase. Thus, mitochondrial acetylation is hypothesized to have evolved as a nonenzymatic phenomenon. Because the pK(a) of a nonperturbed Lys is 10.4 and linkage of a carbonyl carbon to an e amino group cannot be formed with a protonated Lys, we hypothesize that acetylation occurs on residues with depressed pKa values, accounting for the propensity of acetylation to hit active sites and suggesting that regulatory Lys residues may have been under selective pressure to avoid or attract acetylation throughout animal evolution. In addition, a shortage of mitochondrial oxaloacetate under ketotic conditions can explain why macronutrient insufficiency also produces mitochondrial hyperacetylation. Reduced mitochondrial activity during times of overnutrition and undernutrition would improve fitness by virtue of resource conservation. Micronutrient insufficiency is predicted to exacerbate mitochondrial hyperacetylation. Nicotinamide riboside and Sirt3 activity are predicted to relieve mitochondrial inhibition.

AB  - The consumption of low-salt bread represents an efficient way to improve public health by decreasing cardiovascular health issues related to increased intakes of sodium chloride (NaCl). The reduction of NaCl influences the bread quality characteristics, in particular the shelf-life. Calcium propionate (CP) is commonly used in bread as an antifungal agent. Alternatively, sourdough can be used as a natural preservative. This work addresses the feasibility of NaCl reduction in wheat bread focussing on shelf-life and the compensation using sourdough as well as chemical preservatives. The impact of NaCl reduction and the addition of preservative agents in conjunction with different NaCl concentrations on the shelf-life of bread were tested under 'environmental' conditions in a bakery as well as using challenge tests against selected fungi. The challenge tests were performed using fungi commonly found in the bakery environment such as Penicillium expansum, Fusarium culmorum and Aspergillus niger. NaCl reduction decreased the shelf-life by 1-2 days. The addition of sourdough with antifungal activity prolonged the shelf-life to 12-14 days whereas the addition of 0.3 % calcium propionate prolonged the shelf-life to 10-12 days only. The fungal challenge tests revealed differences in the determined shelf-life between the different fungi based on their resistance. Similar antifungal performance was observed in sourdough breads and calcium propionate breads when tested against the different indicator moulds. The findings of this study indicate that addition of sourdough fermented using a specifically selected antifungal Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 can replace the chemical preservative calcium propionate addition and compensate for the reduced level and, therefore, guarantee the product safety of low-salt bread.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate the technological usefulness of selected industrial wine yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus and their intra- and interspecific hybrids responsible for excessively acidic musts. The stability of yeast fermentation profiles in apple musts was assessed after 90-170 generations, following previous subculturing under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in media with or without L-malic acid. During this study, 35 apple wines produced by wild strains and their segregates were statistically evaluated according to 12 chemical parameters. Although the wines met the official standards for basic chemical parameters, their total acidity was too low. Both the yeasts and their segregates metabolized from 66.3 to 77.0 % of malic acid present in the must. The industrial wine yeasts and their hybrids exhibited marked polymorphism of fermentation profiles in apple must with elevated L-malic acid content. At the same time, the level of demalication activity made it possible to clearly differentiate segregates from the wild strains, which may suggest that malic acid is probably one of the principal factors in the adaptive evolution of yeasts. Our study proves that among industrial wine yeasts, there are both, strains expressing very high stability (Saccharomyces cerevisiae W-13) and labile ones (S. cerevisiae Syrena). The interspecific hybrids S. cerevisiae x S. bayanus showed low stability of technological features, while the intraspecific hybrid of S. cerevisiae preserved its fermentative capacity. The presented results indicate that fermentative stability assessment under environmental stress can help to select the yeast strains best suited for the fermentation of specific musts.

AB  - The pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin is used for agricultural and public health campaigns. Its residues may contaminate soils and the beneficial soil organisms, like the earthworms, that may ingest the contaminated soil particles. Due to its ecological relevance, earthworms Eisenia andrei/fetida have been used in different ecotoxicological tests. The avoidance of soils treated with cypermethrin by compost worms Eisenia andrei was studied here as a bioindicator of the influence of treatment dosage and the pesticide formulation in three different agricultural soils indicated by the Brazilian environmental authorities for ecotoxicological tests. This earthworms' behavior was studied here as a first attempt to propose the test for regulation purposes. The two-compartment test systems, where the earthworms were placed for a two-day exposure period, contained samples of untreated soil alone or together with soil treated with technical grade or wettable powder formulation of cypermethrin. After 48 h, there was no mortality, but the avoidance was clear because all earthworms were found in the untreated section of each type of soil (p < 0.05). No differences were found by the Fisher's exact test (p <= 1.000) for each soil and treatment, demonstrating that the different soil characteristics, the cypermethrin concentrations and formulation, as well as the smaller amounts of soil and earthworms did not influence the avoidance behavior of the earthworms to cypermethrin. The number and range of treatments used in this study do not allow a detailed recommendation of the conditions applied here, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported attempt to identify the avoidance of pesticide treated tropical soils by earthworms.

AB  - The incidence rates of cancers in men differ by countries of the world. We compared the incidence rates of three of the most common cancers (prostate, lung, and colon) in men residing in 164 different countries with the population-weighted light at night (LAN) exposure and with several developmental and environmental indicators, including per capita income, percent urban population, and electricity consumption. The estimate of per capita LAN exposure was a novel aspect of this study. Both ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial error (SE) regression models were used in the analysis. We found a significant positive association between population exposure to LAN and incidence rates of prostate cancer, but no such association with lung cancer or colon cancer. The prostate cancer result is consistent with a biological theory and a limited number of previous studies of circadian disruption and risk. The LAN-prostate cancer connection is postulated to be due to suppression of melatonin and/or disruption of clock gene function. An analysis holding other variables at average values across the 164 countries yielded a risk of prostate cancer in the highest LAN-exposed countries 110% higher than in the lowest LAN exposed countries. This observed association is a necessary condition for a potentially large effect of LAN on risk of prostate cancer. However, it is not sufficient due to potential confounding by factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer and are also associated with LAN among the studied countries.

AB  - The urban environment presents new and different challenges to wildlife, but also potential opportunities depending on the species. As urban encroachment onto native habitats continues, understanding the impact of this expansion on native species is vital to conservation. A key physiological indicator of environmental disturbance is the vertebrate stress response, involving increases in circulating glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone), which exert influence on numerous physiological parameters including energy storage, reproduction, and immunity. We examined how urbanization in Phoenix, Arizona influences corticosterone levels, blood parasitism, and innate immunity in populations of tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) to determine whether urbanization may be detrimental or beneficial to this species. Both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations were significantly lower in urban lizards relative to the rural ones, however, the magnitude of the increase in corticosterone with stress did not differ across populations. Urban lizards also had a lower ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes, but elevated overall leukocyte count, as compared to lizards from the natural site. Urban and rural lizards did not differ in their prevalence of the blood parasite, Plasmodium mexicanum. Taken together, these results suggest that urban tree lizards may have suppressed overall corticosterone concentrations possibly from down-regulation as a result of frequent exposure to stressors, or increased access to urban resources. Also, urban lizards may have bolstered immunocompetence possibly from increased immune challenges, such as wounding, in the urban environment, or from greater energetic reserves being available as a result of access to urban resources.

AB  - The degradation of estuaries is a result of human activities which overloads the environment with substances of both industrial and/or natural origins. Bioindicators have been consistently used to interpret effects of contaminants in the environment. In this study, the use of biomarkers (particular measurable characteristics of a bioindicator organism) was used to evaluate the contamination by xenobiotics of Crangon crangon natural populations. The central aim was to evaluate the capability of a battery of biomarkers to discriminate sites with different types of contamination. The activity of the enzymes cholinesterases (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutathione Stransferases (GST) were used as biomarkers. In addition, the ChE form(s) present in the cephalotorax of C. crangon were characterised. Organisms were seasonally sampled from winter 2001/2002 to autumn of 2002, at "reference" sites and at sites that receive agricultural, industrial and/or urban effluents. Results obtained in the characterisation of ChE with different substrates and selective inhibitors demonstrate that the form of ChE present in the cephalotorax of C crangon shows proprieties of vertebrates' AChE and therefore it may be classified as true AChE-like ChE. The battery of biomarkers exhibited seasonal and local variations, apparently related to agricultural, industrial or urban effluent contamination. The tested biomarkers proved to be able to discriminate sources of environmental contamination, and confirms C crangon as a sensitive species suitable to be used as a bioindicator.

AB  - A study was carried out during four years to evaluate the effect of two grazing intensities in it soil-plant-animal system. In the economical analysis, expenses and incomes were taken by the grazing method. The data were analyzed by a simple classification model. The expenses in feeding decreased (P < 0.01) in time. representing 54.1 vs. 52.5 and 21.3 vs. 21.5% vs. the total expense, for high grazing intensity (HI) and low grazing intensity (LI) in the first and fourth year. In respect to the average and market cost of production Of the milk liter, there were no differences in the methods used and they decreased (P < 0.05) from the first to the fourth year with values of 0.35. 0.39. 0.47 and 0.64 and 0.38. 0.44. 0.52 and 0.71 Cuban pesos/L, respectively. The benefit-cost ratio did not show tiny difference between the methods used. but decreased (P < 0.01) in both in the fourth year. compared to the first (2.26 vs 1.24). The economical gains per animal per area did not differ between treatments, but a reduction (P < 0.01) of both economical indicators was observed in this study. This showed an unsustainability in the systems during the four years. In the conditions of this study, a lack of economic stability with low incomes was shown according to the results obtained and despite the grazing intensities used from a biological and economical point of view because of the low animal productivity. Thus, further studies are necessary to achieve a balance in the grazing ecosystems (soil-plant-animal) and also from all economical point of view.

AB  - 1 There is evidence that plants in natural communities form transitive competitive hierarchies, but the pervasiveness and malleability of hierarchies remain controversial. We constructed three competitive rankings among 20 wetland plant species in conditions known to be important in wetlands: a mesic, fertile environment, an infertile environment and a flooded environment.
   2 Rankings were constructed using plants grown from seed in pairwise combinations for one growing season in an outdoor compound. The indicator species used to construct the rankings were Carex crinita, Gnaphalium uliginosum and Lycopus americanus. The others represented a wide array of morphologies, habitats and abundances and ranged from the large cosmopolitan Typha angustifolia to the small and rare Sabatia kennedyana.
   3 Competitive rankings formed in all three environments. Competitive effect rankings based upon the results for all three indicator species were significantly concordant across the three environments (W = 0.59; P < 0.05), i,e. competitive effect did not change across environment. When calculated separately for each indicator species, rankings across the three environments were significantly concordant for two of the three indicator species. Within any environment the ranking varied among the indicator species.
   4 Rankings based upon the mean competitive response to all three phytometer species were not concordant across the three environments (W = 0.35; P > 0.3) and were not concordant when calculated separately for each indicator species. Within any environment, response rankings were significantly concordant for two out of the three indicator species.
   5 Competitive effect rankings tended to be constant across environments and were sensitive to the kind of neighbour. Competitive response rankings varied across environments and were insensitive to the kind of neighbour.

AB  - We report a new, autonomous Lab-on-Chip (LOC) microfluidic pH sensor with a 6000 m depth capability, ten times the depth capability of the state of the art autonomous spectrophotometric sensor. The pH is determined spectrophotometrically using purified meta-Cresol Purple indicator dye offering high precision (<0.001 pH unit measurement reproducibility), high frequency (every 8 min) measurements on the total proton scale from the surface to the deep ocean (to 600 bar). The sensor requires low power (3 W during continuous operation or similar to 1300 J per measurement) and low reagent volume (similar to 3 mu L per measurement) and generates small waste volume (similar to 2 mL per measurement) which can be retained during deployments. The performance of the LOC pH sensor was demonstrated on fixed and moving platforms over varying environmental salinity, temperature, and pressure conditions. Measurement accuracy was +0.003 +/- 0.022 pH units (n = 47) by comparison with validation seawater sample measurements in coastal waters. The combined standard uncertainty of the sensor in situ pH(T) measurements was estimated to be <= 0.009 pH units at pH 8.5, <= 0.010 pH units at pH 8.0, and <= 0.014 pH units at pH 7.5. Integrated on autonomous platforms, this novel sensor opens new frontiers for pH observations, especially within the largest and most understudied ecosystem on the planet, the deep ocean.

AB  - Within the Ararat Valley (Armenia), a continuously growing water demand (for irrigation and fish farming) and a simultaneous decline in groundwater recharge (due to climate change) result in increasing stress on the local groundwater resources. This detrimental development is reflected by groundwater-level drops and an associated reduction of the area with artesian conditions in the valley centre. This situation calls for increasing efforts aimed at more sustainable water resources management. The aim of this baseline study was the collection of data that allows for study on the origin and age distribution of the Ararat Valley groundwater based on environmental tracers, namely stable (delta H-2, delta O-18) and radioactive (S-35, H-3) isotopes, as well as physical-chemical indicators. The results show that the Ararat Valley receives modern recharge, despite its (semi-)arid climate. While subannual groundwater residence times could be disproved (S-35), the detected H-3 pattern suggests groundwater ages of several decades, with the oldest waters being recharged around 60 years ago. The differing groundwater ages are reflected by varying scatter of stable isotope and hydrochemical signatures. The presence of young groundwater (i.e., younger that the 1970s), some containing nitrate, indicates groundwater vulnerability and underscores the importance of increased efforts to achieve sustainable management of this natural resource. Since stable isotope signatures indicate the recharge areas to be located in the mountains surrounding the valley, these efforts must not be limited to the central part of the valley where most of the abstraction wells are located.

AB  - The positive balance of soil organic matter (SOM) in amble land is the main issue of sustainable agriculture. Organic fertilization via composting is an effective method of soil productivity support. The deficit of traditional organic fertilizers creates the need to explore new sources of organic matter such as agricultural waste, sewage sludge. municipal and industrial waste.
   The different types of organic materials were researched of their use as fertilizers by the method of composting with natural soils for circular economy purposes. That, on the one hand, is related to full use of resources, and on the other for a positive balance of humus in soils under conditions of intensive agriculture. The study included both environmental bioresources (biochar and compost) as well as traditionally known manure (cow and sheep mature) and sewage sludge from domestic wastewater.
   The composting is done with two soil types - Alluvial-meadow soil and Smolnitza. The following phisico-chemical and agrochemical parameters were analyzed: pH in water; electrical conductivity; cation exchange capacity and base of saturation; the content and composition of the organic matter, total nitrogen; mobile forms of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
   The studied indicators reflect a more profound change with the addition of organic materials to Alluvial meadow soil compared with the Smolnitza soil type. This is mainly due to changes in CEC characteristics of both soil types. Changes in the content and composition of soil organic matter are highly indicative of the composting process. They are more sensitive for the Alluvial-meadow soil, where the soil organic matter from humic-fulvic type is converted to humic type by addition of all organic materials, except the cow mature.

AB  - Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters are used in cosmetic and personal care products (CPCPs) and over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreens, due to their ability to absorb solar radiation. When OTC and CPCP ingredients are washed down the drain, they can then enter freshwaters that receive wastewater treatment plant effluents. This paper presents a freshwater environmental safety assessment of a key UV filter, oxybenzone, used in OTC sunscreens and CPCPs in the United States. Exposure was characterized using iSTREEM (R), a spatially resolved aquatic exposure model developed for chemicals disposed of down the drain. iSTREEM (R) provides a comprehensive exposure assessment of oxybenzone concentrations in United States receiving waters through predicted environmental concentration (PEC) distributions representative of conditions across the region. A review of available hazard data was used to derive a predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) using aquatic toxicity data and assessment factors. A safety assessment was conducted by comparing the PEC distribution with the PNEC. The results indicate that oxybenzone is of low concern and there is a significant margin of safety as the 90th percentile PEC is two orders of magnitude below the PNEC. These results are instrumental in demonstrating the environmental safety of key organic UV filters in the U.S. freshwater environment and will help prioritize future work.

AB  - Pharmaceutical substances are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and their concentration levels typically range from ng/L up to several pg/L. Furthermore, as those compounds are designed to be highly biologically active, assessing their impacts on non-target organisms is important. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment testing a mixture of five pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, carbamazepine, irbesartan, acetaminophen and naproxen) on fish, three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The mixture concentration levels were chosen on the basis of the contamination of the Meuse river in Belgium which had been measured previously during a monitoring campaign undertaken in 2015 and 2016. Three nominal mixture concentration levels were tested: the lowest concentration level mixture was composed by environmentally-relevant concentrations that approximate average realistic values for each pharmaceuticals (Mxl); the two other levels were 10 and 100 times these concentrations. Although no impact on stickleback prey was observed, the mixture significantly impaired the survival of female fish introduced in the mesocosms at the highest treatment level without causing other major differences on fish population structure. Impacts on condition factors of adults and juveniles were also observed at both individual and population levels. Using a modelling approach with an individual-based model coupled to a bioenergetic model (DEB-IBM), we concluded that chronic exposure to environmentally-relevant concentrations of five pharmaceuticals often detected in the rivers did not appear to strongly affect the three-spined stickleback populations. Mechanisms of population regulation may have counteracted the mixture impacts in the mesocosms.

AB  - Blastocyst biopsy is performed to obtain a reliable genetic diagnosis during IVF cycles with preimplantation genetic testing. Then, the ideal workflow entails a safe and efficient vitrification protocol, due to the turnaround time of the diagnostic techniques and to transfer the selected embryo(s) on a physiological endometrium in a following natural cycle. A biopsy approach encompassing the sequential opening of the zona pellucida and retrieval of 5-10 trophectoderm cells (ideally 7-8) limits both the number of manipulations required and the exposure of the embryo to sub-optimal environmental conditions. After proper training, the technique was reproducible across different operators in terms of timing of biopsy (similar to 8 min, ranging 3-22 min based on the number of embryos to biopsy per dish), conclusive diagnoses obtained (similar to 97.5%) and live birth rates after vitrified-warmed euploid blastocyst transfer (>40%). The survival rate after biopsy, vitrification and warming was as high as 99.8%. The re-expansion rate at 1.5 h from warming was as high as 97%, largely dependent on the timing between biopsy and vitrification (ideally <= 30 min), blastocyst morphological quality and day of biopsy. In general, it is better to vitrify a collapsed blastocyst; therefore, in non-PGT cycles, laser-assisted artificial shrinkage might be performed to induce embryo collapse prior to cryopreservation. The most promising future perspective is the non-invasive analysis of the IVF culture media after blastocyst culture as a putative source of embryonic DNA. However, this potential avant-garde is still under investigation and a reliable protocol yet needs to be defined and validated.

AB  - This article proposes a two-stage design optimization approach which is applied to a prototype passively designed high-rise residential building under different ventilation modes and thermal load requirements. Machine learning methods are employed to develop surrogate models for improving the computation efficiency of the multi-objective optimization process. The surrogate model is trained by modeling experiments with EnergyPlus and R, which can provide reliable energy performance indicators of generic building models featuring passive design parameters including the building layout, envelope thermophysics, building geometry and infiltration & air-tightness. The lighting, cooling and heating demands of the generic building model are determined by the hybrid ventilation and light diming control strategies in compliance with local green building assessment criteria in Hong Kong. The multiple linear regression (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and support vector machines (SVM) are examined by the statistical modelling. SVM is capable of fitting a surrogate model with the best prediction performance based on the coefficient of determination and root mean square error. In addition, both single-sided ventilation and cross-ventilation models under varied thermal load requirements are investigated to compare the preferable design solutions for each scenario. The multi-stage optimization approach is also applied to a Mediterranean climate to explore optimal design solutions in more diverse external environmental conditions. This research can provide a highly efficient design optimization tool to appropriately deploy passive architectural strategies in a green building project.

AB  - The Upper Cretaceous Fika sediments in the Chad (Bornu) Basin were characterised to define paleoenvironment and source of the organic matter, using an integration of organic geochemical analyses and palynofacies observations. The present-day TOC contents of the Fika sediments are in the range of 0.41-237 wt%, while the Hydrogen Index (HI) values are largely below 200 mg HC/g TOC, suggesting that the sediments generally have fair to good generative potential and contain mainly Type III and Type IV kerogens. This is supported by palynofacies observations whereby the kerogen is characterised by large amounts AOM and phytoclasts. The Fika sediments have vitrinite reflectance and T-max, values in the range of 0.70-134% and 429-465 degrees C, respectively, indicating early mature to late-mature stage of oil-window. The level of organic maturation in Fika sediments was further supported by the several biomarker maturity indicators.
   Biomarker distributions and palynofacies data provide evidence for a mixed aquatic algae and terrigenous organic matter input deposited in a marginally marine, moderate salinity, proximal setting with a strong influx of terrestrial plant under environmental conditions that were mostly suboxic. Compound specific isotopic analysis of n-alkanes fraction were also used for the paleoenvironmental inferences. The flat portion pattern of the n-alkane profile between n-C-21 and n-C-26 in Fika samples is an indication of marine environment and it shows that Fika sediments consist of both terrestrial and marine organic matter deposited in fluvial/deltaic to shallow marine settings.

AB  - Nowadays studying plant objects in the framework of environmental monitoring to improve the quality of herbal remedies is a very important area of research. The aim of the work is to determine the elemental composition and assessment of environmental cleanliness of rosemary shoots (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), introduced in Botanical garden of Pyatigorsk medical-pharmaceutical Institute (PMPI), Pyatigorsk (Russia). Materials and methods. An experimental study was performed at the Central research laboratories spectral analysis ("Kavkazgeolsyemka") on diffraction spectrograph DFS-8-1 by evaporation from a crater of the carbon electrode. Photometric measurement of spectrograms was performed using the Atlas of spectral lines and spectra of standards with an accuracy of not more than 2% in terms of ash. Results and discussion. For the first time there were 25 elements identified in rosemary shoots introduced in the North Caucasus. The prevailing macro elements were K, Ca, Mg, Na, P and the trace elements were Al, Si and Fe. The toxic elements As, Cd, Hg, Bi, Sb were not detected in the rosemary shoots. Rosemary does not accumulate heavy metals or they are present in trace amounts. Conclusion. The absence of heavy metals or their low content in rosemary shoots can be explained prosperous environmental conditions of Pyatigorsk Botanical garden. The use of rosemary shoots as a source of natural compounds of primary and secondary synthesis and minerals, are involved in the regulation of life processes. This underlines the therapeutic importance of the raw materials and the possibility of creating drugs of combined action on the basis of rosemary for the treatment and prevention of pathologies associated with disorders of mineral metabolism.

AB  - Heavy disturbance-induced mortality can negatively impact forest biota, functions, and services by drastically altering the forest structures that create stable environmental conditions. Disturbance impacts on forest structure can be assessed using structural sustainability the degree of balance between living and dead portions of a tree population's size-class distribution which is the basis of baseline mortality analysis. This analysis uses a conditionally calibrated reference level (i.e., baseline mortality) against which to detect significant mortality deviations without need for historical references. Recently, a structural sustainability index was developed by parameterizing results of this analysis to allow spatial and temporal comparisons within or among forested landscapes. The utility of this index as a tool for forest health monitoring programs and triage decisions has not been examined. Here, we investigated this utility by retrospectively analyzing the structural sustainability of a mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae)-impacted, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)-dominated landscape annually from 2000 to 2006 as well as among watersheds. We show that temporal patterns of structural sustainability at the landscape-level reflect accumulating beetle-induced mortality as well as beetle-lodgepole pine ecology. At the watershed-level, this sustainability spatially varied with 2006 beetle-induced mortality. Further, structural sustainability satisfies key criteria for effective indicators of ecosystem change. We conclude that structural sustainability is a viable tool upon which to base or supplement forest health monitoring and triage programs, and could potentially increase the efficacy of such programs under current and future climate change-associated disturbance patterns.

AB  - Metrosideros polymorpha, a dominant tree species in the Hawaiian Islands, shows an extreme phenotypic polymorphism both across gradients of climatic/edaphic conditions and within populations, making it a potentially useful model species for evolutionary study. In order to understand how the phenotypic diversity is maintained within populations as well as across populations, we examined the diversities of several leaf and stem functional traits across five elevations and two soil substrates on the volcanic mountain of Mauna Loa, on the island of Hawaii. Leaf dry mass per area (LMA), a key leaf functional trait, was particularly focused on and analyzed in relation to its underlying components-namely, tissue LMA and trichome LMA (LMA = tissue LMA + trichome LMA). Across populations, tissue LMA increased linearly with elevation while trichome LMA showed unimodal patterns with elevation, which were better correlated with temperature and rainfall, respectively. Substantial phenotypic variations were also found within populations. Interestingly, the variations of tissue LMA were often negatively correlated to trichome LMA within populations, which contrasts with the cross-populations pattern, where a strong positive correlation between tissue LMA and trichome LMA was found. This suggests that phenotypic variations within populations were substantially influenced by local ecological processes. Soil depth (an indicator of local water availability) and tree size (an indicator of colonized timing) modestly explained the within-population variations, implying other local environmental factors and/or random processes are also important in local phenotypic diversity. This study provides an insight about how phenotypic diversity of plant species is maintained from local to landscape levels.

AB  - Climate change has been identified as a leading human and environmental crisis of the twenty-first century. Drylands throughout the world have always undergone periods of degradation due to naturally occurring fluctuation in climate. Persistence of widespread degradation in arid and semiarid regions of Iran necessitates monitoring and evaluation. This paper aims to monitor the desertification trend in three types of land use, including range, forest and desert, affected by climate change in Tehran province for the 2000s and 2030s. For assessing climate change at Mehrabad synoptic station, the data of two emission scenarios, including A2 and B2, were used, utilizing statistical downscaling techniques and data generated by the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM). The index of net primary production (NPP) resulting from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images was employed as an indicator of destruction from 2001 to 2010. The results showed that temperature is the most significant driving force which alters the net primary production in rangeland, forest and desert land use in Tehran province. On the basis of monitoring findings under real conditions, in the 2000s, over 60 % of rangelands and 80 % of the forest were below the average production in the province. On the other hand, the long-term average changes of NPP in the rangeland and forests indicated the presence of relatively large areas of these land uses with a production rate lower than the desert. The results also showed that, assuming the existence of circumstances of each emission scenarios, the desertification status will not improve significantly in the rangelands and forests of Tehran province.

AB  - Vegetation is one of the natural sources which contribute to the amount of surface active agent into the environment. It is believed that surfactants can be derived from various kinds of sources such as biomass burning or soil and these excessive level of surfactants emitted into the atmosphere can influence both cloud formation and climate. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of both anionic and cationic surfactants as well as levoglucosan from vegetation and soot and at different weather conditions around the tin mine lakes environment. The samples were prepared by cutting several parts of tropical plant species, namely Cinnamomum Iners, Gliricidia Sepium and Hopea Odorata, which were mainly leaves and stems. After that, samples were allowed to dry in an oven at a temperature of 40 degrees C for 2 h. The concentrations of levoglucosan and surfactant such as methylene blue active substance (MBAS) and disulphine blue active substance (DBAS) were analysed through the colorimetric method. The results showed that higher concentrations for both anionic and cationic surfactants were found in C. Iners leaves which give the concentrations of 86.92 +/- 38.99 and 22.33 +/- 10.59 mu g/g. It was noted that the concentrations of anionic and cationic surfactants in this research were correlated to each other, indicating the possibility of similar sources that affect both levels of surfactants in the vegetation. In addition, the highest level of levoglucosan was dominated by the leaves from G. Sepium species with the concentration of 25.62 +/- 12.65 mg/g, respectively. A positive significant correlation (r = 0.8447, 0.8355 and p = 0.0001 < 0.05) between anionic surfactants and levoglucosan was also discovered in this study.

AB  - Lesser Himalayan subtropical forests have unique species composition due to diverse climatic and topographic factors which create numerous microhabitats. Phytosociological characteristics, structural attributes and biological spectrum of plant communities in the forests of Himalayan foothills in Kashmir were analyzed. A total of 65 species belonging to 26 plant families were recorded constituting 6 plant communities. Average value of diversity recorded for the communities was 2.44; species richness 4.01; whereas evenness was found to be 0.48. The species data indicated random distribution of species with a hump shaped diversity pattern directly correlated with increasing altitude. Themeda anathera was the dominant species with an importance value percentage of 14.7% followed by Pinus roxburghii (9.6%), Mallotus philippenensis (5.2%), Malvastrum coromandelianum (5.1%), Acacia modesta (5%), Olea ferruginea (3.8%) and Oxalis corniculata (3.2%). Vegetation was dominated by Therophytes (30%) and megaphanerophytes (23.3) with dominant leaf spectrum as leptophylls (31.6%). Thirty seven percent plants had medicinal values followed by 31% having fodder values where as 12% used as fuel. Principal component analyses and cluster analyses revealed the association of dominant species with specific sites due to prevailing environmental conditions. The distribution of species in ordination diagrams indicated a continuous change in species composition along the altitudinal gradient. Key stone tree species were subject to immense tree felling resulting in deteriorating changes in forest structure. Visual indicators showed over grazing at all the studied sites evident from the dominance of unpalatable species. Local forest stands demand immediate attention of policy makers as well as forest management so that local diversity and floristic richness could be conserved and rehabilitated.

AB  - Darfur's complex conflict situation led to large-scale internal displacement of people with significant implications for the environment as well as for the conflict situation itself. Time series analyses of medium-resolution satellite data for monitoring large regions were carried out over a longer period to detect the impact of camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) on their surrounding environment. Four regions of interest were defined in the Darfur region, Sudan, which cover the main and most dynamic IDP camps of the region and are characterized by different environmental conditions. Hotspots of anthropogenic impacts on the vegetation are revealed based on the Seasonal Kendall test applied to quality-enhanced enhanced vegetation index and normalized difference vegetation index Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time series. Overlaying the resulting trend pattern with the locations of IDP camps suggests significant impact on the vegetation, especially -but not exclusively -in those areas with very high population densities. A comparison of the temporal development of the detected hotspots with precipitation and population figures over the investigated period help differentiate between natural and human-induced impacts. Subsequent to the analysis of the medium resolution data, the resulting trends in vegetation cover were correlated with changes detected with very-high-resolution satellite imagery for the two areas around Zalingei and Zam Zam. Areas of decreased vegetation cover in the resulting trend pattern can be correlated with logging of trees as well as removal of shrubs and grass, while positive changes in vegetation cover are related to agricultural land expansion.

AB  - Majority of deaths due to communicable and non-communicable diseases occur in the low and middle-income nations (LMNs), mainly due to the lack of early diagnoses and timely treatments. In such a scenario, biomarkers serve as an indispensible resource that can be used as indicators of biological processes, specific disease conditions or response to therapeutic interventions. Evaluation, diagnosis and management of diseases in developing world by following/extrapolating the findings obtained on the basis of the research work involving only the populations from the developed countries, could often be highly misleading due to existence of diverse patterns of diseases in developing countries compared to the developed world. Biomarker candidates identified from high-throughput integrated omics technologies have promising potential; however, their actual clinical applications are found to be limited, primarily due to the challenges of disease heterogeneity and preanalytical variability associated with the biomarker discovery pipeline. Additionally, in the developing world, economic crunches, lack of awareness and education, paucity of biorepositories, enormous diversities in socio-epidemiological background, ethnicity, lifestyle, diet, exposure to various environmental risk factors and infectious agents, and ethical and social issues also cumulatively hinder biomarker discovery ventures. Establishment of standard operating procedures, comprehensive data repositories and exchange of scientific findings are crucial for reducing the variability and fragmentation of data. This review highlights the challenges associated with the discovery, validation and translational phases of biomarker research in LMNs with some of their amenable solutions and future prospects.

AB  - We present an organic geochemical study of surface sediments of Lake Sarbsko, a shallow coastal lake on the middle Polish Baltic coast. The aim was to provide evidence concerning the origin of the organic matter (OM) and its compositional diversity in surface deposits of this very productive, highly dynamic water body. The content and composition of the OM in the bottom sediments were investigated at 11 sampling stations throughout the lake basin. OM sources were assigned on the basis of bulk indicators [ total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), delta C-13(TOC) and delta N-15 and extractable OM yield], biomarker composition of extractable OM and compound-specific C isotope signatures. The source characterization of autochthonous compounds was verified via phytoplankton analysis. The distribution of gaseous hydrocarbons in the sediments, as well as temporal changes in lake water pH, the concentration of DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) and delta C-13(DIC) were used to trace OM decomposition.
   The sedimentary OM is composed mainly of well preserved phytoplankton compounds and shows minor spatial variability in composition. However, the presence of CH4 and CO2 in the bottom deposits provides evidence for microbial degradation of sedimentary OM. The transformation of organic compounds in surface, bottom and pore waters via oxidative processes influences carbonate equilibrium in the lake and seasonally favours precipitation or dissolution of CaCO3.
   The data enhance our understanding of the relationships between the composition of sedimentary OM and environmental conditions within coastal ecosystems and shed light on the reliability of OM proxies for environmental reconstruction of coastal lakes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Novel environmentally adapted lubricant additives were synthesized from cystine (Cys(2)), an essential amino acid obtained from natural sources. The structural feature of cystine is a dimeric amino acid with a central disulfide bond. The carboxyl groups in Cys(2) were converted to corresponding esters by reaction with long-chain alcohols. The resultant diesters were soluble in poly-alpha-olefin (PAO) and ester-type synthetic oils. The structural features of the new additives include multifunctional groups on the same molecule, such as disulfide as a tribologically active moiety and polar functional groups as anchors to friction surfaces. The additives consist of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; they are free of phosphorus, chlorine, and metals. The tribological properties of the additives in a solution of synthetic oil were evaluated by performing laboratory tribotests under boundary conditions. The Cys(2)-derived additives exhibited comparable antiwear properties to the conventional additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZnDTP). The additives showed good antiwear properties even at low concentrations of sulfur (160 ppm) in synthetic hydrocarbons such as PAOs. A high concentration of sulfur (640 ppm) was required to obtain an optimized antiwear performance of the synthetic esters as a base oil. The new additives reduced the friction coefficient of PAOs and synthetic esters. A saturated ester of Cys(2) reduced the friction of PAOs and synthetic esters up to oil temperatures of 150 degrees C. The lubrication mechanism was discussed with respect to the role of functional groups in the additive molecule. The use of amino acids as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of environmentally adapted additives was also pointed out.

AB  - South Africa uniquely lies at the junction of two major currents, the Agulhas and the Benguela. The waters overlying the continental shelf exhibit exceptionally high short-, medium- and long-term (days to inter-decadal) variability compared with most other shelf areas, and strongly contrasting oceanographic conditions are observed on the east and west coasts. South Africa is rich in fisheries resources and associated environmental data collected over more than a century. The South African marine scientific community has a history of multidisciplinary studies of marine foodwebs, from the driving forces such as wind, currents and solar heating, to the top predators, with the development of kelp bed, sub-tidal reefs and estuarine ecosystem studies in the 1970s; the Benguela Ecology Programme, which ran through four successive five-year stages, focused on the pelagic marine resources. Various approaches have been used to observe the continental shelf at different time and space scales, including: macroscale but frequent satellite imagery, mesoscale environmental and fishery surveys, dedicated cross-shelf transects in key areas, measurements of dynamic processes, use of moored buoys and coastal weather stations, and integrated monitoring approaches, including modelling and simulation studies. Between 30 and 50 years of comprehensive marine data now exist, which are proving useful in the application of an ecosystem approach to fisheries monitoring and management, as decadal changes become discernible. These observations need to continue; even though the single-species stock assessment and operational management procedures have not yet formally used environmental factors for fisheries management advice, they help us to understand the factors affecting fish population fluctuations and early life histories and to identify large-scale regime shifts where marine trophic structure and functioning alter to a new state.

AB  - The welfare of conventional stock laboratory mice has been assessed in 46 UK animal units using an expert-defined welfare assessment protocol containing 119 measures of mouse welfare. These were recorded using a questionnaire and observations made during a one-day visit to each unit. The standard of mouse welfare was considered to be good with widespread use of substrate and nesting material and space allowances in most cases well above the minimum recommended levels. Education and training was available and encouraged by the majority of animal units. The health and welfare of laboratory mice was being frequently assessed by animal care staff using daily inspections/observations, health records, and health monitoring schemes. Overall the mice assessed could be considered to be in good health, as indicators of poor health and welfare were exhibited at low levels, and the mice were observed exhibiting a wide range of positive natural behaviours. A number of environmental conditions (humidity, noise and light intensity) were outside recommended ranges in some ani. mal units. The provision of cage resources such as shelters, gnawing material, floor food and other enrichment items were found to be variable. A high proportion of the units surveyed housed at least some of their mice (mainly males) singly and handling of mice by care staff varied between units. In some units there may be an opportunity for some staff to improve in some aspects of mouse handling. Finally, a number of interesting correlations were found between various behaviours and potential indictors of abnormal health or welfare, which require further investigation.

AB  - Several laboratory experiments have demonstrated degradation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) in groundwater, but there appear to have been no corroborating long-term field studies. Investigations conducted in 1989 and 1999 at an industrial site constructed on an infilled estuarine environment in France provide data over a decade for which CT degradation could be evaluated. A Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) containing oil and > 90% CT that was present in 1989 was absent in the extremely reducing site groundwater in both 1999 and 2000 (average Eh = -170 mV at pH 7, sulfide up to 21 mg 1(-1), and Fe+2 Up to 3.2 mg 1(-1)). These conditions facilitated dechlorination of CT to chloroform (CF) present at up to 46 mg 1(-1), and methylene chloride (up to 75 mg 1(-1)). Carbon disulfide (CS2), a terminal degradation product in reducing environments in laboratory experiments, was present at a mass ratio averaging 2.4:1 CF:CS2, indicative of abiotic degradation. The lack of detection of the separate phase CT, the ratio of CF:CS2, the presence of low molecular weight organic acids (i.e., acetate similar to900 mg 1(-1); citrate 360 mg 1(-1); and propionate, up to 111 mg 1(-1)) and pyrite in conjunction with excess inorganic Cl in groundwater are all indicators of ongoing degradation of the chlorinated compounds. However, while natural attenuation of chloromethanes may be a viable adjunct to strategies designed to remediate CT in reducing groundwater, its efficacy is hard to quantify in complex field environments where upgradient sources are still present.

AB  - Long-term studies on the reproductive fitness of fish under controlled exposure conditions are necessary to address some of the controversy surrounding the field-based studies of pulp and paper effluent effects. This study undertook effluent exposures of 2+ age rainbow trout that were approximately halfway through gonadal growth. Trout were exposed to a mixed thermomechanical/bleached kraft effluent in 12,000-L flow-through exposure tanks at an environmental research facility located at a pulp and paper mill in Kawerau, New Zealand. Trout were exposed to either upstream river water or 10% effluent in upstream river water and were maintained at a ration of 0.7% of body, wet weight during the experiment. Results of the 2-month study indicated that trout survival was not significantly different between effluent-exposed tanks and reference tanks. There was extensive growth during the exposure but no differences were found due to effluent exposure. Gonadal development was not significantly different between treatments. Steroid hormone concentrations in males and females were not affected by effluent exposure. The effluent showed no potential to be estrogenic as indicated by a lack of vitellogenin induction in male trout. Other physiological indicators of energy storage and utilization also showed no significant differences. Modest induction of hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (2.5-fold) was the only detectable biological effect of the exposure. Biliary concentration of effluent-related compounds were typical of pulp mill effluent exposure and further suggested that the source of phytosterols was in fact dietary and not effluent-derived.

AB  - A wide range of contaminants are continuously introduced into the aquatic environment and among these, heavy metals constitute one of the most dangerous groups because of their persistent nature, toxicity, tendency to accumulate in organisms and more still, they are non-degradable. Marine organisms such as sponges represent target species for the monitoring of heavy metal contamination due their filtering activity. This study aims to evaluate the retention capacity of lead and cadmium by the sponge Axinella damicornis under laboratory conditions. The sponges were exposed for 144 h to seawaters artificially polluted with lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) separately and with a mixture of the two metals. The final goal of the experiments was to evaluate the metal uptake in the sponge body and efficiency of the sponge in removing the metals from seawater. In particular, the highest values of metal concentration in the sponges were recorded for Pb: this metal was found to be 6 times and 9 times more concentrated than Cd, respectively in the case of exposure to the single metal and to the combination of both metals. The metal concentrations found, especially for Pb, were much higher in A. damicornis than in other organisms investigated in the sea. Remarkable signs of stress and necrosis were recorded in the specimens when exposed to the combination of Pb and Cd, evidencing a synergistic effect of the metals mixture. This study paves adds knowledge on the contamination effects by heavy metals on the marine organisms and on the contribution from A. damicornis as efficient tool for bioremediation of polluted seawaters.

AB  - Different compounds at nanoscale level show more efficient behavior because of increased surface area and optical properties. CeO2 nanoparticles are of great importance for their unique properties. However, the extensive release of CeO2 nanoparticles in the environment is also a serious problem that must be addressed as available data related to ceria toxicity is currently not comprehensive. The present study was aimed to evaluate the potential of CeO2 nanoparticles in biomedical applications and assessment of their toxicity by using mutagenic and acute in-vivo approaches. High yield CeO2 nanoparticles with spherical morphology and with an average size of 40 nm were synthesized by adopting the alkaline fusion method under mild conditions. The synthesized CeO2 nanoparticles showed antibacterial activity at different concentrations (50-500 mu g/mL) against E. coli. The antioxidant properties of CeO2 nanoparticles were determined, and CeO2 nanoparticles show anti-oxidant behavior that may be helpful for anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug preparation. Ames test confirms no mutagenicity at different concentrations of CeO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, in the current study CeO2 nanoparticles showed no toxicity for aquatic life even at a concentration of 100 mg/L in the same way the in-vivo toxicology was not evident even at the highest concentration (>= 5000 mg/kg BW for rats), no significant change was observed in hematological and biochemical parameters of control and CeO(2)nanoparticles exposed rats. In-vivo dermal toxicity was not observed in rabbits at the application of 0.5 g CeO2 nanoparticles. These results indicate the nontoxic nature of these nanomaterials. However, further experimentation is recommended to completely define the toxic potential of the nanomaterials.

AB  - The early Pleistocene is the key period for understanding the evolutionary history and palaeobiogeography of rabbits (Genus Oryctolagus). In western Europe, many species were endemic, making them a reliable indicator of the evolution of the terrestrial ecosystems in which many species have evolved. However, the morphological variability of rabbit species is still poorly understood and their phylogeny remains a subject of debate. Through both qualitative (morphological description) and quantitative (linear measurements and two-dimensional geometric morphometrics) approaches, we address here the morphometric diversity of the third lower premolar (p3), a tooth commonly used to distinguish leporid species, in order to assess intra- and inter-regional morphological variations in several early Pleistocene rabbit populations. Our results suggest that the different approaches are complementary and allow, on different levels, a full characterization of the p3 variability of early Pleistocene rabbits and to imply relations between populations. The size and shape variations of this tooth reflect the taxonomic and phylogenetic signals of the different species but were probably also significantly impacted by geographical position and local climatic conditions. In view of the great morphometric variability highlighted in this work, we suggest a careful reconsideration of certain dental criteria previously considered 'diagnostic' in the characterization of these species. However, the overall results allowed us to discuss the phylogeny of the genus Oryctolagus and to hypothesize the ecological requirements and different phases of the dispersal of taxa in western Europe, probably associated with global climate changes.

AB  - Araucaria araucana is an iconic long-lived endangered tree species native to Southern Chile and Argentina. Araucaria forests and soils provide a myriad of ecosystem benefits to local communities, which are threatened by increasing anthropic-driven disturbances like fire and livestock overgrazing. The main objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate the effect of uncontrolled livestock grazing on soil health; and (ii) to identify a set of sensitive soil health indicators to grazing pressure. Twenty soil health indicators in two contiguous degraded forest areas with contrasting grazing pressure were considered. A substantial shift in forest structure and a 12% reduction in tree coverage on the overgrazed sites were observed. Overgrazing has substantially affected soil physical, chemical, and biological health indicators, making soil conditions less suitable for forest regeneration. Significant increments in C:P and N:P ratios were observed due to overgrazing (p < 0.01). Soil chemical properties such as Kjeldahl nitrogen, P-fractions (total, inorganic, and available), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH were identified as the best indicators of overgrazing activity in these soils. Additionally, forest cover reduction and overgrazing altered soil physical indicators (e.g., saturated hydraulic conductivity, infiltration, and aggregate stability), suggesting changes in hydrological behavior with potential consequences in water storage and availability. Our results show that uncontrolled grazing in native protected forests degrades soils and forests, restricting forest regeneration and potentially accelerating erosive processes. These results emphasize the need for improved conservation plans for these endangered forests that systematically evaluates and monitors the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on soil health.

AB  - This study was carried out to assess the microbiological quality of two coastal ecosystems of Agadir Bay: Oued Souss estuary and Agadir beach (Atlantic coast of Morocco). The study revolves on the effect of environmental parameters on the fecal bacteria populations between March 2018 and February 2019. Environmental parameters and bacterial enumeration of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci were performed for water, bivalves (Donax trunculus and Scrobicularia plana) and sediments. Standardized methods of conventional microbiology were used for the enumeration of fecal indicator bacteria. The physicochemical parameters showed seasonal fluctuations following those of climatic conditions. With a total of 72 samples, Oued Souss and Agadir beach have almost the same trend of fecal coliforms loads around 4.95, 4.73 and 2.19 log10 CFU/g in sediment, bivalve and water, respectively. For fecal streptococci, Agadir beach recorded a maximum of 5.47 log10 CFU/g for both sediments and bivalves and 1.95 log10 CFU/g for water. However, higher values were observed at Oued Souss estuary with an average of 6.55, 5.84 and 2.08 log10 CFU/g in sediment, bivalve and water compartment, respectively. The ratios of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci represented maximum values in Spring (3.73) and Winter (2.31) for Agadir beach and in summer (1.03) for Oued Souss estuary. The principal component analysis was applied to determine the contribution of environmental parameters to the abundance of fecal indicator bacteria. Overall, these findings show the effect of environmental parameters on the evolution of fecal contamination in the studied sites.

AB  - Marine traffic is increasing in the Canadian Arctic, largely because of changing ice conditions, a growing tourism industry, and natural resource extraction. Impact assessment (IA) is a primary instrument for managing the impacts of project development in the Arctic, but there has been limited analysis of the scope and application of IA for identifying and managing the impacts of shipping. This paper examines the impacts of shipping activity associated with mining projects in the eastern Canadian Arctic, including barge traffic and resupply vessels; the mitigation actions commonly prescribed in IA; and the key IA challenges facing decision-makers. Results show 71 impacts that may be considered common to IA applications for shipping, for which the mitigation strategies rely heavily on compliance-based measures and "best" practices to either minimize or avoid impacts, supported by follow-up programs that provide for adaptation of mitigation based on monitoring results. However, results also illustrate concerns over the ability of IA to effectively manage the cumulative effects of increasing Arctic marine traffic. Only a minority of projects involving marine transport trigger IA, even though other types of marine traffic, such as tourism, may generate similar types of impacts. The common impacts and mitigation solutions identified in this research and the lessons from monitoring can inform future IAs for shipping, improve permitting processes for shipping activities that do not require IA, and provide a foundation for a more regional or sector-wide approach to identifying and mitigating the cumulative effects of increasing vessel traffic.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly applied in ecological studies, including studies with the primary purpose of criminal investigation, in which eDNA from soil can be used to pair samples or reveal sample provenance. We collected soil eDNA samples as part of a large national biodiversity research project across 130 sites in Denmark. We investigated the potential for soil eDNA metabarcoding in predicting provenance in terms of environmental conditions, habitat type and geographic regions. We used linear regression for predicting environmental gradients of light, soil moisture, pH and nutrient status (represented by Ellenberg Indicator Values, EIVs) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to predict habitat type and geographic region. eDNA data performed relatively well as a predictor of environmental gradients (R-2 > 0.81). Its ability to discriminate between habitat types was variable, with high accuracy for certain forest types and low accuracy for heathland, which was poorly predicted. Geographic region was also less accurately predicted by eDNA. We demonstrated the application of provenance prediction in forensic science by evaluating and discussing two mock crime scenes. Here, we listed the plant species from annotated sequences, which can further aid in identifying the likely habitat or, in case of rare species, a geographic region. Predictions of environmental gradients and habitat types together give an overall accurate description of a crime scene, but care should be taken when interpreting annotated sequences, e.g. due to erroneous assignments in GenBank. Our approach demonstrates that important habitat properties can be derived from soil eDNA, and exemplifies a range of potential applications of eDNA in forensic ecology.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances play an important role in everyday affect and vice versa. However, the causal day-to-day interaction between sleep and mood has not been thoroughly explored, partly because of the lack of daily assessment data. Mobile phones enable us to collect ecological momentary assessment data on a daily basis in a noninvasive manner.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between self-reported daily mood and sleep quality.
   Methods: A total of 208 adult participants were recruited to report mood and sleep patterns daily via their mobile phones for 6 consecutive weeks. Participants were recruited in 4 roughly equal groups: depressed and anxious, depressed only, anxious only, and controls. The effect of daily mood on sleep quality and vice versa were assessed using mixed effects models and propensity score matching.
   Results: All methods showed a significant effect of sleep quality on mood and vice versa. However, within individuals, the effect of sleep quality on next-day mood was much larger than the effect of previous-day mood on sleep quality. We did not find these effects to be confounded by the participants' past mood and sleep quality or other variables such as stress, physical activity, and weather conditions.
   Conclusions: We found that daily sleep quality and mood are related, with the effect of sleep quality on mood being significantly larger than the reverse. Correcting for participant fixed effects dramatically affected results. Causal analysis suggests that environmental factors included in the study and sleep and mood history do not mediate the relationship.

AB  - In this paper, the variation in forest cover in the central Mediterranean region, reflected by percentage changes in the arboreal pollen record, has been examined in relation to the 4.2 ka event. A total of 36 well-dated and detailed pollen records from latitudes between 45 and 36 degrees N were selected and their vegetation dynamics between 5 and 3 ka examined in relation to the physiographic and climatic features of the study area and to the influence of human activity on past vegetation, as suggested by anthropogenic pollen indicators. We have found that the sites located between 43 and 45 degrees N do not show any significant vegetation change in correspondence with the 4.2 ka event. Several sites located on the Italian Peninsula between 39 and 43 degrees N show a marked opening of the forest, suggesting a vegetation response to the climate instability of the 4.2 ka event. Between 36 and 39 degrees N, a forest decline is always visible around 4.2 ka, and in some cases it is dramatic. This indicates that this region was severely affected by a climate change towards arid conditions that lasted a few hundred years and was followed by a recovery of forest vegetation in the Middle Bronze Age. Human activity, especially intense in southern Italy, may have been favored by this natural opening of vegetation. In Sardinia and Corsica, no clear change in vegetation is observed at the same time. We suggest that during the 4.2 ka event southern Italy and Tunisia were under the prevalent influence of a north African climate system characterized by a persistent high-pressure cell.

AB  - The Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) directive was an important improvement of long-term water quality monitoring at the European level, leading to the use of sediments and biota as relevant matrices for assessing priority substances under the European Water Framework directive. Currently, commonly accepted sediment EQS for Hg are missing in Europe. In this study we present a new, tiered approach to deriving sediment quality standards for Hg: the derivation of Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) from data in the literature, followed by adjusting values at regional scale, using ecological field data (macroinvertebrate community assessment) and field sediment ecotoxicity bioassays. The limited set of effect data available for Hg spiked-sediment ecotoxicity tests has resulted in unreliable PNEC values for sediment quality assessment. Field reference sites (n = 40) where the macroinvertebrate community status was assessed as High or Good were used to define the ecological background and threshold levels in sediments in northern Spain. Sediment QS developed in other areas were not suitable for specific basins in our study area, since they were within the range of our Hg background levels. Temporary sediment Quality Standards (QS) for Hg were developed for the Nalon River basin (where several mining districts occur), using field effect-based approaches such as sediment ecotoxicity data from Tubifex tubifex chronic bioassays and ecological assessment of macroinvertebrate communities. A proposal for Hg quality assessment in freshwater sediments of northern Spain is made based on ecologically relevant QS values, providing benchmark values for No-Effect and Effect Hg sediment concentrations.

AB  - In the present study, in situ assessment of metal (Cu and Zn) toxicity followed by their recovery response was examined in periphyton dominated by diatoms. For doing so, metal diffusing substrates (MDS) were constructed and deployed in the river water for 6 weeks (3 weeks stress and 3 weeks recovery after replacing metal solution from the MDS).The use of MDS ensured that colonised periphyton on metal diffusing and control substrates were exposed to similar environmental conditions. The metal toxicity and recovery response of the community was examined in terms of traditional algal community parameters (biovolume, species richness, Shannon index, relative abundance) as well as with the newer non-taxonomical parameters (deformities and lipid bodies in diatoms). Both traditional and non-taxonomical parameters indicated complete recovery (from metal toxicity) of periphytic communities after 3 weeks following the withdrawal of Cu and Zn solution from the diffusing substrates. Newer non-taxonomical parameters, such as, deformities and lipid bodies, provide a new insight to understand metal toxicity and recovery response of diatom assemblages (the dominant autotrophs in the periphyton community) because these features are directly visible in live frustules, need no expertise in identification of diatoms and can be globally assessed with simple protocol. The experimental loss of metal pollutants and the constant immigration of algae (not previously exposed to high levels of metals) in fluvial systems aided periphyton recovery. Lastly, it is found that periphytic biofilms (dominated by diatoms) proved to be good bioindicators of metal toxicity and recovery in fluvial ecosystem. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Earthworms are common organisms in the soil toxicity-testing framework, and the epigeic Eisenia andrei and E. fetida are the recommended species. However, Eisenia species are rarely found in agricultural soils and recent studies have pointed out endogeic species are more sensitive to pesticides than Eisenia. Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea caliginosa are two endogeic soil-dwelling species that are abundant in the agroecosystem. However, knowledge on pesticide impact on this ecological group of earthworms is still incipient. Herein, we compared the biochemical (acetylcholinesterase [AChE) and carboxylesterase [CbE] activities) and behavioral (burrowing, casting and feeding) biomarker responses of these two endogeic earthworm species exposed for 7 days to soils contaminated with 0.1, 1 and 10 mg kg(-1) ethyl-parathion. The results showed marked species-specific differences in both groups of biomarkers, suggesting A. caliginosa the most sensitive species to this organophosphorus pesticide under the exposure conditions in this study. Moreover, an in vitro inhibition trial with ethyl-paraoxon evidenced a higher sensitivity of A. caliginosa AChE activity compared with that of A. chlorotica. This finding suggested that this molecular target endpoint could contribute to the interspecific differences of behavioral responses rather than CbE activity; this latter considered a potent mechanism of OP removal. Our results suggest the inclusion of more than one endogeic earthworm species to assess toxicity from organophosphorus insecticides. However, the use of A. caliginosa in the environmental risk assessment framework of organophosphorus contamination is highly recommended because of its higher sensibility to this class of pesticides, in addition to its abundance in the agroecosystem.

AB  - Within the existing literature body, the evaluation exercises predominantly adopt expert disciplined assessments to explore the biophysical conditions and economic values of ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS). This preference largely emerges from the relative convenience in data collection and quantification of these approaches, collectively accrue to practitioners' beliefs that unless explicitly quantified and monetized, these benefits will be negligible. Social aspects of ecosystems contributions to human well-being, on the other hand, are comparatively harder to grasp, thus predominantly overlooked in the general assessment of ES and EDS. To alleviate this imbalance, we presented a case study in exploring relevant ES and EDS within the context of a protected area using non-monetary methods with the aid of the local community. In particular, through deliberative mapping approach, the manuscript strived to locate, quantify, and assess a full range of relevant ES and EDS as perceived by local inhabitants across the landscape of U Minh Thuong National Park (UMTNP), Vietnam. Within the scope of this paper, we also delved into how socio-cultural perceptions and preferences towards these natural resources diverge among groups of respondents. Through the presented research, we strived to consolidate the baseline understanding regarding the ES profile of the research area with relevant social insights, paving the way for the design and implementation of sustainable management strategies. Finally, this manuscript also sought to present a practical measure to account for social dimensions and their relevance to the general assessment of ES.

AB  - Metazoan parasite assemblages of Pagrus pagrus inhabiting the southwestern Atlantic were analysed with the aim of identifying the existence of different stocks and to comparatively assess the value of different parasite guilds as indicators of zoogeographical regions. A total of 186 fish was examined. Samples were obtained from three Brazilian and one Argentine localities, distributed in three different biogeographic districts of the Argentine Zoogeographical Province. Pagrus pagrus harboured 26 metazoan parasite species distributed in three guilds, ectoparasites (10 species), long-lived larval endoparasites and short-lived gastrointestinal endoparasites (eight species each). Prevalence and abundance values of the former two guilds allowed analysing them comparatively to assess their value as biological indicators of both host population structure and zoogeography. Results of analyses on long-lived parasites evidenced the existence of three stocks, one in the regions of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, other in southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul) and a third in northern Argentina (Mar del Plata), responding to the differential environmental conditions characteristic of three zoogeographical ecoregions. Ectoparasite assemblages exhibited significant differences between all pairs of samples, including those considered as a single stock according to data on persistent parasites. Assemblages of long-lived larval parasites are considered as better indicators for stock assessment purposes than ectoparasites, whose population parameters were variable temporally and heterogeneous at small spatial scales. The distributional variability of persistent parasites of P. pagrus along large scales provides valuable information to help defining robust biogeographical patterns, applicable to stock identification and fishery management of this species.

AB  - With increasing stressors to coral reefs, defining tools that evaluate their dynamics and resilience is important to interpret system trajectories and direct conservation efforts. In this context, surveys must go beyond conventional monitoring approaches that focus on abundance and biomass of key groups and quantify metrics that better assess ecological processes and ecosystem trajectories. By measuring a variety of conventional (e.g. proportional cover of broad benthic groups, biomass of herbivorous fish) and complementary resilience-based metrics (e.g. algal turf height, coral recruitment rates, juvenile coral densities, herbivorous fish grazing rates), this study evaluated the ecosystem responses to community-based management in Fiji. The study was conducted across three paired tabu areas (periodically closed to fishing) and adjacent fished sites. Conventional metrics reflected no management effect on benthic or herbivorous fish assemblages. In contrast, the complementary metrics generally indicated positive effects of management, particularly within the benthos. Significant differences were observed for turf height (33% lower), coral recruitment rate (159% higher) and juvenile coral density (42% higher) within areas closed to fishing compared to adjacent open reefs. In addition, turf height was inversely related to coral recruitment and juvenile coral density, and longer turfs (>= 5 mm) were more competitive in interaction with corals. These results emphasise that conventional metrics may overlook benefits of local management to inshore reefs, and that incorporating complementary resilience-based metrics such as turf height into reef survey protocols will strengthen their capacity to predict the plausible future condition of reefs and their responses to disturbances.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination has long been a water quality concern worldwide. Most studies have focused on heavy metal concentration in water through suspended sediment and bottom sediment; however, the concentration transported by river-bottom sediment, known as bedload, has not been taken into account. In order to fill this gap, this study aimed to determine the concentration of Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, As, Fe and Mn in bedload of Ipojuca River which is an environmentally impacted river in Brazil. The use of bedload in heavy metal contamination studies raises the following question: Is the bedload an adequate indicator of heavy metal contamination? To answer this question, sediment contamination assessment was performed using sediment contamination indices, principal component analysis, and comparison with background values and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). Comparing with sediment quality guidelines, the Probable Effect Level (PEL) and Threshold Effect Level (TEL) seem to underestimate the harmful effect on sediment-dwelling organisms, being essential either to calibrate the SQGs for site specific conditions or develop site specific guidelines. The pollution load index (PLI) indicated that the upstream and downstream sites were not polluted and polluted, respectively. Principal component analysis explained roughly 91% and 81% of the total variance in heavy metal contamination upstream and downstream, respectively, and distinguished natural and anthropogenic contributions in Ipojuca River. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that heavy metal concentrations in bedload were an adequate and feasible indicator of anthropogenic impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aphis craccivora is considered to be a potential indicator for global warming. This species is characterized by a fast developmental rate and a high reproductive potential. It reveals a number of adaptation strategies to adjust to changing environmental conditions. The paper presents the impact of temperature on developmental stages, fecundity, survival rate and the demographic parameters of A. craccivora rear on Robinia pseudoacacia. The research was carried out under control at five constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 28 degrees C, 75% humidity and photoperiod 16 L:8 D. The higher the temperature, the shorter the observed length of the pre-reproductive period, ranging from 6 days at 28 degrees C up to 24 days at 10 degrees C. The reproductive period also became shorter with the increase in temperature. A. craccivora female fecundity was dependent on temperature. The highest recorded rate of fecundity was observed when the temperature was 20 degrees C (on average 115 larvae/female). The developmental threshold was calculated to be 3.3 degrees C. The intrinsic rate (r(m)) was maximal (0.42) at 28 degrees C and minimal (0.07) at 10 degrees C. With increasing temperature there is a finite rate of increase, and the mean rate of generation development shortens. The research suggests that the best range of temperatures for the development of A. craccivora on R. pseudoacacia is between 20-28 degrees C. Therefore, in the future, with climate warming, Aphis craccivora may become more problematic.

AB  - Taxonomic diversity indices have a number of desirable properties as indicators in the assessment of environmental quality, and have become an important measure in biodiversity studies. Macrobenthic taxonomic variations were studied in Bohai Bay, northern China, an area under threat from rapid human development. Four seasonal cruise datasets were collected between 2006 and 2007. Environmental conditions exhibited large fluctuations due to human development; nitrogen and phosphorus were the main environmental stressors. A total of 97 macrofauna taxa were identified belonging to 88 genera, 72 families, 36 orders, 14 classes, and nine phyla. Analysis of similarity indicated that there were significant assemblage differences across sampling stations as well as seasons. Four taxonomic indices, taxonomic diversity (Delta), taxonomic distinctness (Delta*), average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)), and variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda(+)) were calculated using abundance data. Among the stations and seasons, there were greater variations in both Delta and Lambda(+) than in Delta* and Delta(+). The funnel plot of Delta(+) could identify disturbed stations to some extent, but was not always a strong indicator of disturbance. The Delta(+) performance was better in autumn than in spring, but could not identify a disturbed station in autumn due to a low number of species. The efficiency of taxonomic distinctness may depend on taxa or the pollution indicators. Taxonomic distinctness indices can be effective at assessing environmental degradation when correctly applied; however, they are unsuitable for directly assessing environmental quality in a new area prior to efficiency testing.

AB  - Monitoring of environment is a key contemporary issue that has necessitated search for bio-indicators. The very fact that epiphytes do not have a direct contact with soil and absorb nutrients from the environment puts them among the best indicators of environmental conditions. We, therefore, selected Pyrrosia flocculosa (D. Don) Ching-an epiphytic fern that commonly occurs in the Himalaya for this study. The study focused on analyzing heavy metal concentrations in the fronds of P. flocculosa growing along a disturbance gradient. For this, three sites representing different levels of disturbance viz., least disturbed, moderately disturbed, and highly disturbed, were identified in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh. From each site, fronds of P. flocculosa were collected, categorized into three growth stages (juvenile, young, and mature), and brought to the laboratory for analyses. After drying and powdering, the samples were analyzed for Pb, Cd, Fe, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results obtained were statistically compared using the software package Statistica. As expected, concentration of the metals varied among the sites and also among the identified growth stages of the species. In general, concentration of the metals was in the order Fe (639.28 +/- 81.63) > Ni (56.03 +/- 4.97) > Mn (7.54 +/- 0.69) > Zn (6.51 +/- 0.36) > Cd (4.01 +/- 0.86) > Cu (1.93 +/- 0.74). Barring Mn, concentration of all the metals increased with disturbance and was positively correlated to it. However, except for Cd and Fe, none of the metals reported higher than threshold values. Effective monitoring of the environment can thus be done using P. flocculosa.

AB  - We characterized regional patterns of the tidal channel benthic diatom community and examined the relative importance of local wetland and surrounding landscape level factors measured at multiple scales in structuring this assemblage. Surrounding land cover was characterized at the 100, 250, 1,000 m, and watershed buffer scales. Tidal channel benthic diatom communities were characterized by high species richness, abundance of rare species, and an abundance of species characterized as meso-eutraphentic and eutraphentic. The number of species per site ranged between 21 and 60 (mean +/- standard deviation 43.5 +/- 9.4). Abundant and frequently occurring taxa included Planothidium delicatulum, Navicula gregaria, and Amphora coffeaeformis. The tidal channel benthic diatom community was most strongly correlated with variables related to human disturbance at all scales surrounding the wetland and not with any tidal channel water quality parameter, including salinity. Furthermore, developed and impervious surface land covers within the 100 and 250 m buffers were more strongly correlated with the diatom assemblage than these covers at larger spatial scales. Species richness and Shannon diversity index were both negatively correlated with the amount of wetland and mudflat surrounding the sites. Of secondary importance in structuring the diatom assemblage were sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in wetlands immediately surrounding the tidal channels. The sensitivity of the tidal creek benthic diatom assemblage to both wetland and landscape level factors indicates that it might be a useful bioindicator of human disturbance to tidal wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Ensuring sustainable fisheries and community development requires integrating and harmonizing the environmental, social and economic issues which in turn might lead to effective management plans. This paper describes a new methodology based on the Human Development Index (HDI). We transformed the HDI to adapt it to local and specific purposes and create a new set of indicators for assessing the sustainability of ornamental fish fisheries and the human development at a community level for the inhabitants linked to this activity. We chose a women-owned and operated marine ornamental fish business located along the coast of the Gulf of California as a study case. Socio-economic data, obtained in 2011 from the women associates and the inhabitants of their coastal community, show that monthly income and living conditions were still very modest. Results indicated an intermediate development and financially unsustainable but ecologically sustainable fisheries for the aquarium market. As captures, based on authorized and managed quotas by the Mexican Government, revealed an under-exploitation, a participatory SWOT analysis of the ornamental fish cooperative was carried out in order to provide information about the cooperative's current situation which helped to produce future business strategies to optimize the company's operations in a sustainable way. Our conclusion is that the cooperative is still "young" and needs time to stabilize in order to generate enough profits that would enable its women associates to increase their standard of living while respecting the sustainability of the marine resources. We also noted that such a business activity can be a good employment opportunity in small communities, regardless of gender, and that its sustainability is closely linked to ecological, and socio-economic factors.

AB  - This study quantifies and models the influence of the type and the degree of decomposition of cover crops (CC) on three pesticides sorption: epoxiconazole (EPX), S-metolachlor (SMOC) and glyphosate (GLY). Residues of four cover crop species were incubated for 0, 6, 28 or 56 d in controlled conditions. For each incubation time, adsorption of pesticides on CC residues was measured in batch experiments. Additionally, the biochemical and elemental composition (Van Soest fractionation, C:N, C-13 NMR spectroscopy) of CC was characterized. Mineralization of CC residues was monitored at all incubation times using CO2 trapping. Results showed that the adsorption of pesticides differed significantly according to (i) the type of molecule, (ii) the type of CC, (iii) the degree of CC decomposition and the interaction CC x decomposition time. EPX and GLY were the most (K-d ranging from 188 to 267 L kg(-1)) and the least (K-d ranging from 18 to 28 L kg(-1)) sorbed pesticides respectively. With increasing decomposition of the CC residue, sorption increased by 1.6- to 4.7-fold according to the type of pesticide and cover crop. It was significantly correlated with the net cumulative mineralization (p > 0.7) and other indicators of biochemical composition such as C:N ratio (p < -0.7), the Van Soest neutral detergent soluble fraction (p > 0.5) and the alkyl/O-alkyl C ratio determined by NMR. An innovative model based on net cumulative mineralization of CC residues is proposed to describe the pesticide sorption and appears to be a promising approach to account for the effects of decaying plant residues on the environmental fate of pesticides.

AB  - Human management of river ecosystems dampens natural disturbance regimes that drive critical habitat-forming processes. However, the quantification of processes can be difficult and is typically accomplished through surrogate analyses. In 2001, a channel-damming landslide in the Cedar River, Washington, changed habitat conditions and spawning distributions of Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. We evaluated annual changes in a number of key indicators of river processes during the pre- and post-disturbance periods. We used an exhaustive chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) model to evaluate the effect of changes in habitat complexity, discharge characteristics, and parental generation spawning distributions on 54years (1952-2006) of weekly spawning fish surveys. Before the landslide, the spatial and temporal patterns of Sockeye Salmon distributions were heavily influenced by the spawning locations of their parents. Densities of spawning fish were highest in the uppermost river reaches. After the landslide, habitat complexity and fish densities increased in the lower, landslide-affected river reaches. The CHAID model analyses indicated that fluvial habitat complexity, river discharge characteristics, and the density of fish in respective parental generations were significant factors explaining the spawning distributions by reach. Our analyses of the salmon population response to annual changes in habitat complexity affirm that our metrics were useful surrogates for measuring the habitat-forming processes restored when the landslide reconnected the river channel with its floodplain. Furthermore, this study provides an "order of magnitude" insight into the amount of restoration that will elicit a population-scale response in salmon.

AB  - Many plant species are able to tolerate severe disturbance leading to removal of a substantial portion of the body by resprouting from intact or fragmented organs. Resprouting enables plants to compensate for biomass loss and complete their life cycles. The degree of disturbance tolerance, and hence the ecological advantage of damage tolerance (in contrast to alternative strategies), has been reported to be affected by environmental productivity. In our study, we examined the influence of soil nutrients (as an indicator of environmental productivity) on biomass and stored carbohydrate compensation after removal of aboveground parts in the perennial resprouter Plantago lanceolata. Specifically, we tested and compared the effects of nutrient availability on biomass and carbon storage in damaged and undamaged individuals. Damaged plants of P. lanceolata compensated neither in terms of biomass nor overall carbon storage. However, whereas in the nutrient-poor environment, root total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations (TNC) were similar for damaged and undamaged plants, in the nutrient-rich environment, damaged plants had remarkably higher TNC than undamaged plants. Based on TNC allocation patterns, we conclude that tolerance to disturbance is promoted in more productive environments, where higher photosynthetic efficiency allows for successful replenishment of carbohydrates. Although plants under nutrient-rich conditions did not compensate in terms of biomass or seed production, they entered winter with higher content of carbohydrates, which might result in better performance in the next growing season. This otherwise overlooked compensation mechanism might be responsible for inconsistent results reported from other studies.

AB  - Non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) are microfossils other than pollen and spores from plants found within samples prepared for pollen analyses. Their utility as paleoecological indicators is rapidly growing because of their potential to complement palynological reconstructions of past communities and environments. The study of modern NPP sedimentation patterns using surface samples from different substrates, vegetation types, and environmental conditions is needed to characterize the main environmental and anthropogenic factors involved in establishing ecological gradients. Here, we analyze modern NPP distribution along an elevational transect from the south-central Pyrenees. We use these data to test the potential influence of elevation, vegetation type, sampling sites, and human disturbance on modern NPP distribution and to obtain a NPP modern-analog model, which will enhance further paleoecological interpretations. Our study used the same surface samples obtained in a previous modern-analog palynological study, along an elevational transect from 870 to 2600 m a.s.l. We identified 55 NPPs, including 13 unidentified morphotypes that were described and depicted. Individual NPP analysis and multivariate statistical methods showed that altitude plays a significant role in the NPP distribution along the transect, but other factors such as soil moisture, landscape openness, and grazing intensity also influenced the composition of NPP assemblages. Our results also recognized some characteristic NPP assemblages linked to elevational vegetation belts and individual NPP morphotypes related with specific microhabitats, both with potential paleoecological indicator capacity. This work is a first step to improve the knowledge of the NPP's indicator value in the study area.

AB  - Exotic plant invasions into Hawaiian montane forests have altered many important nutrient cycling processes and pools. Across different ecosystems, researchers are uncovering the mechanisms involved in how invasive plants impact the soil microbial community-the primary mediator of soil nutrient cycling. We examined whether the invasive plant, Hedychium gardnerianum, altered microbial community composition in forests dominated by a native tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, under varying soil nutrient limitations and soil fertility properties within forest plots of the Hawaii long-term substrate age gradient (LSAG). Microbial community lipid analysis revealed that when nutrient limitation (as determined by aboveground net primary production [ANPP]) and soil fertility were taken into account, plant species differentially altered soil microbial community composition. Microbial community characteristics differed under invasive and native plants primarily when N or P was added to the older, highly weathered, P-limited soils. Long-term fertilization with N or P at the P-limited site led to a significant increase in the relative abundance of the saprophytic fungal indicator (18:2 omega 6c,9c) under the invasive plant. In the younger, N-limited soils, plant species played a minor role in influencing soil microbial community composition. We found that the general rhizosphere microbial community structure was determined more by soil fertility than by plant species. This study indicates that although the aggressive invasion of a nutrient-demanding, rapidly decomposable, and invasive plant into Hawaiian forests had large impacts on soil microbial decomposers, relatively little impact occurred on the overall soil microbial community structure. Instead, soil nutrient conditions were more important determinants of the overall microbial community structure within Hawaii's montane forests.

AB  - We investigated the response of community assemblages of carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and tenebrionids (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) from June to August in 2003 and 2004 on ponderosa pine forest stands of various conditions that were created by fuel reduction treatments (thinning, and thinning plus prescribed burning) and wildfires between 1987 and 1996 in northern Arizona. We found that richness and abundance increased for carabids but decreased for tenebrionid significantly from June (the driest season of the year) to August (wet monsoon season of the year), a temporal partition for ecological niches in ponderosa pine forests. For both taxa, wildfire burned stands had the highest species richness and diversity; whereas the thinned stands had the highest species evenness. Both fuel reduction treatment and wildfire resulted in significantly different community assemblages of carabids and tenebrionids compared to unmanaged stands. Results showed that carabids from the genera of Amara, Anisodactylus, Cicindela, Harpalus, Radine, and tenebrionids in the genus of Eleodes were ecological indicators for wildfire stands. However, Synuchus dubius, and Coelocnemis spp. I were indicator species for thinned stands, and unmanaged stands, respectively. We concluded that the richness and diversity of both taxa tended to increase after fuel reduction treatment and wildfire, and that some species from both taxa were suitable as ecological indicators for the structural change of ponderosa pine forests. Creating a mosaic of heterogeneous landscape through mechanical fuel reduction treatments is an important management strategy to maintain high invertebrate species diversity in ponderosa pine forest ecosystems in the southwestern US.

KW  - China
AB  - Since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, a great deal of researches on the exploitation of shoaly land, which is considered as an important kind of land reserves in China, have been done in China. With reference to the published papers and some conference presentations, almost 52 years' history of shoaly land research in China will be elaborated in the paper. Firstly, an outline of the distribution and exploitation situation on shoaly land is presented. Secondly, based on the analysis of the research progress we have achieved in the past, a systematic research framework in the future for shoaly land is developed from multi-disciplinary point of view. In our opinion, the study of shoaly land in China can be divided into two stages with the separation point of the late 1980's. The earlier period centered on the general investigation of the basic conditions of shoaly land. The latter is a period with many multi-disciplinary researches, during which there has been specialization on theoretical research and technological breakthroughs, initiating the public participation in the management of shoaly land development. As to the further research, we propose a two-level research framework on shoaly land in China, namely, basic research and applied research. Basic research includes the research on basic conception, dynamic evolution, and developing theories. Applied research is divided into three categories, social research, economic research, and ecological research. Finally, some priorities of the researches are pointed out which should be given special attention, such as statistical caliber, dynamic monitoring, legislation, administration system, public participation, industrial development policy, resource grading and evaluation, and environmental impact assessment.

AB  - De-icing chemicals used during the winter season are potential pollutants for the groundwater underneath the new main airport of Norway. Several field experiments examining the transport and degradation of propyleneglycol (PG), potassium acetate (KAc) and non-reactive tracers were performed in a lysimeter trench under natural snowmelting conditions. Chemicals were applied underneath the snow cover and the transport in a heterogeneous coarse sandy soil was examined by extracting soil water from 30 or 40 suction cups placed at five depths between 0.4 and 2.4 m depth. Transport and degradation was analysed by spatial moment calculations. The de-icing chemicals showed the same basic displacement as chemically inactive tracers, an initial fast transport during the melting period followed by a period of stagnation throughout the summer season. PG seemed to be displaced to greater depths compared to non-reactive tracer after the first application. However, computer simulations of transport and degradation in a heterogeneous unsaturated soil showed that decreasing degradation constants with depth can generate a downward movement of the centre of mass without any flow occurring in the system. Potassium acetate showed some adsorption, with calculated retardation factors of approximately 1.3 and 1.2. The degradation rate constant for PG was calculated to be 0.015 day(-1) in 1994 and increased to 0.047 day(-1) in the second application made in 1995. The degradation rate constant for acetate was estimated to be 0.02 day(-1). Increased manganese concentrations seem to be a good indicator of degradation of PG and Ac. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The correlation between areas of open water in ice-covered seas and increased biological productivity has been noted for some time. To date, most attention has been focused on larger polynyas, such as the Northeast Water and the Northwater. Although spectacular in their own right, these large polynyas represent only part of a vitally important continuum of biological productivity that varies significantly between geographic areas and ice habitats, that includes the multi-year pack of the polar ocean and small localized polynyas in annual ice. Surveys of the distribution and abundance of ringed seals in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago have shown differences in density that are correlated with the presence or absence of polynyas. There is also significant variation in the biological productivity of polynya areas of the Canadian High Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland, all of which receive inflow from the polar basin. Long-term studies of polar bears and ringed seals in western Hudson Bay and the eastern Beaufort Sea show significant but dissimilar patterns of change in condition and reproductive rates between the two regions and suggest that fundamentally different climatic or oceanographic processes may be involved. Projections of climate models suggest that, if warming occurs, then the extent of ice cover in Hudson Bay may be among the first things affected. Long-term studies of polar bears and ringed seals in the eastern Beaufort Sea and Hudson Bay would suggest these two species to be suitable indicators of significant climatic or oceanographic changes in the marine ecosystem.

AB  - In stratified oligotrophic waters, phytoplankton communities forming the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) are isolated from atmospheric iron sources above and remineralized iron sources below. Reduced supply leads to a minimum in dissolved iron (dFe) near 100 m, but it is unclear if iron limits growth at the DCM. Here, we propose that natural iron addition events occur regularly with the passage of mesoscale eddies, which alter the supply of dFe and other nutrients relative to the availability of light, and can be used to test for iron limitation at the DCM. This framework is applied to two eddies sampled in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Observations in an anticyclonic eddy center indicated downwelling of iron-rich surface waters, leading to increased dFe at the DCM but no increase in productivity. In contrast, uplift of isopycnals within a cyclonic eddy center increased supply of both nitrate and dFe to the DCM, and led to dominance of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Iron addition experiments did not increase productivity in either eddy, but significant enhancement of leucine incorporation in the light was observed in the cyclonic eddy, a potential indicator of iron stress among Prochlorococcus. Rapid cycling of siderophores and low dFe:nitrate uptake ratios also indicate that a portion of the microbial community was stressed by low iron. However, near-complete nitrate drawdown in this eddy, which represents an extreme case in nutrient supply compared to nearby Hawaii Ocean Time-series observations, suggests that recycling of dFe in oligotrophic ecosystems is sufficient to avoid iron limitation in the DCM under typical conditions.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an ecological indicator reflecting the link between carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems, which is often affected by drought disturbance. However, knowledge about the influences of soil moisture drought on WUE is still lacking. Therefore, this paper aims to quantify the lagged effect and impact of soil moisture drought on terrestrial ecosystem WUE from 1982 to 2018 using ERA5 and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) datasets. Drought conditions are described by the soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI). The lagged effect of drought on WUE is measured by the month with the maximum significant correlation between SMAPI and WUE. The impact of drought on WUE is estimated through the relative change of WUE during drought and non-drought periods. The results showed that: (1) Drought had an approximately 4month lagged effect on WUE, which was observed in 70.87% of the global vegetated areas. The lagged effect of drought on WUE was a short period (1-4 months) for shrubland and sparse vegetation, middle and long periods (5-12 months) for forest. (2) When drought occurred, WUE decreased by 36.95% in the Tibetan Plateau and 24.93% in West Africa, while WUE in North Europe, Alaska/N.W. Canada, and West Asia increased by 14.64%, 8.83%, and 8.53%, respectively. The negative and positive impacts of drought on WUE in each vegetation type were commensurate. Our results provide useful information for understanding the response of ecosystem carbon and water cycles to drought..

AB  - The spatial distribution of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in 11 surface sediment samples collected in Guanabara Bay embayments and associated trace metals revealed the applicability of dinocysts as bioindicators of environmental conditions in estuarine systems. The surface sediment samples presented coarse to fine granulometry. The dinoflagellate cyst analysis followed the standard methodology through the elimination of carbonates and silica. Trace metals were extracted by the evaluation of 1 g of sediment plus a mixture of HNO3 and HCl in a microwave digestion system. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages were dominated by Operculodinium centrocarpum, Spiniferites spp., and Lingulodinium machaerophorum. Trace metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, and Ni) showed variations at the different sampling points. The values obtained were Cu (6.7-82.8 mg kg-1), Zn (29.5-355.4 mg kg-1), Pb (18.3-86.2 mg kg-1), Cr (5.1-196.2 mg kg-1), and Ni (19.6-286.0 mg kg-1). Several samples showed high pseudototal concentrations of trace metals, which were above the natural concentrations found in nature. Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between dinocysts species and some trace metals. Lingulodinium machaerophorum showed a high correlation with 4/5 analysed trace metals and is a eutrophication-sensitive species. However, Brigantedinium sp. presented a positive correlation with all trace metals analysed. The high frequency of L. machaerophorum cysts in all analysed samples associated with several trace metals is indicative of environmental eutrophication. The high availability of trace metals in the surface sediments of Guanabara Bay may be related to the untreated industrial wastes that are dumped directly into the bay.

AB  - This case study documents responses in a headwater macroinvertebrate assemblage to insecticide pollution and hydrological drought. In 2014, the Doubravka brook (Czech Republic) was damaged by a large overflow of a mixture of chlorpyrifos (CPS) and cypermethrin (CP). In 2016-2017, this brook was then affected by severe drought that sometimes led to an almost complete absence of surface water. We found significant relationships between the strength of both these disturbances and the deeper taxonomic levels of both the overall macroinvertebrate assemblage (classes) and the arthropod assemblage alone (orders and dipteran families), as well as the functional feeding groups (FFGs). The CPS-CP contamination was mostly negatively correlated to arthropod and non-arthropod taxa and was positively correlated only with FFG collector-gatherers; on the other hand, the drought was negatively correlated to Simuliidae, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and the FFG of grazer-scrapers and passive filterers. Drought conditions correlated most positively with Isopoda, Ostracoda, Heteroptera, adult Coleoptera, and predator and active filterer FFGs. The chosen eco-indicators (SPEAR(pesticides), SPEAR(refuge), BMWP, and EPT) used as support information reveal the poor ecological status of the whole assemblage, including the control site, the cause of which is most likely to be the exploitation of the adjacent catchment area by large-scale agriculture. This type of agricultural exploitation will undoubtedly affect macroinvertebrate assemblages as a result of agrochemical and soil inputs during run-off events and will also exacerbate the effect of droughts when precipitation levels drop.

AB  - Terrestrial mosses which retain moisture provide a suitable ambience for diatoms colonization and suitable experimental platforms for observing climate change impact. The distribution and diversity patterns of such epibryic diatom communities are governed by various biotic and abiotic factors of moss habitats. The present study is first of ever attempt to investigate the moss-inhabiting diatoms in relation to various abiotic environmental variables from the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). Samples were collected from 23 different sites in the Neora Valley National Park in Eastern Himalayas and analyzed through standard methods. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and cluster analysis (CA) performed to classify the samples and habitats while direct canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the linkage between moss-inhabiting diatom species from various sample and abiotic environmental gradients. A total of 27 diatoms found colonizing on terrestrial moss patches from 23 sites of the park. CCA ordination plots showed that pH, conductivity and relative humidity were the primary factors influencing the diatom diversity and distribution, but altitude and temperature had no influence on the species distribution. But, correlation study on the average valve length of the most abundant and frequent taxa of Neora Valley National Park, i.e.Eunotia paludosa,E. bigibbaandHantzschia amphioxys, in relation to the environmental variables like, altitude, moisture content, relative humidity and temperature revealed a significant inference. The average valve length of these three diatoms decreases in warmer and drier climatic conditions at lower altitudes. Thus, these can be considered as potential indicator species to observe any climate change.

AB  - The rapid response of benthic foraminifera to environmental factors (e.g. organic matter quality and quantity, salinity, pH) and their high fossilisation potential make them promising bio-indicators for the intensity and recurrence of brine formation in Arctic seas. Such an approach, however, requires a thorough knowledge of their modern ecology in such extreme settings. To this aim, seven stations along a north-south transect across the Storfjorden (Svalbard archipelago) have been sampled using an interface multicorer. This fjord is an area of intense sea ice formation characterised by the production of brine-enriched shelf waters (BSW) as a result of a recurrent latent-heat polynya. Living (rose bengal-stained) foraminiferal assemblages were analysed together with geochemical and sedimentological parameters in the top 5 cm of the sediment. Three major biozones were distinguished. (i) The "inner fjord" zone, dominated by typical glacier proximal calcareous species, which opportunistically respond to fresh organic matter inputs. (ii) The "deep basins and sill" zone, characterised by glacier distal agglutinated fauna; these are either dominant because of the mostly refractory nature of organic matter and/or the brine persistence that hampers the growth of calcareous species and/or causes their dissolution. (iii) The "outer fjord" zone, characterised by typical North Atlantic species due to the intrusion of the North Atlantic water in the Storfjordrenna. The stressful conditions present in the deep basins and sill (i.e. acidic waters and low food quality) result in a high agglutinated / calcareous ratio (A/C). This supports the potential use of the A/C ratio as a proxy for brine persistence and overflow in Storfjorden.

AB  - Purpose
   Right up to the moment, the financial sector has been considered a clean and a neutral sector, as far as social and environmental impact concerns. The purpose of this paper is to determine the attitude of Spanish credit institutions to the sustainable development.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Delphi methodology was used to test the viability and validity of the questionnaire and to choose the best systematic way of communication. The research to understand society and environment focussed on investments was conducted using a survey completed by 57 Spanish credit institutions. Various types of statistical analyses were performed to assess the questionnaire.
   Findings
   The higher the entities' investment is in environmental projects, the more sensitive they will be about social responsibilities issues. However, the higher the percentage invested in funding to communities or dejected regions and in cultural projects.
   Research limitations/implications - To know, measure and evaluate the activities of a credit institution in the environment, it is necessary to define indicators for the policies, procedures and management practices adequate for the sector. Practical implications - Credit Spanish Institutions sector organizations are responding positively to sustainable development and, in the process, enhancing stakeholder value. Social implications - In various practices of credit institutions, implementing a preventive environmental approach or undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibilities - along with the possibility to allocate funds for certain projects - environmental conditions are also considered.
   Originality/value
   To develop good environmental practices in credit institutions, they apply the principles of sustainability and identify and quantify the environmental risk in the normal internal process of risk assessment.

AB  - Identifying both modern and fossil bamboos to the species and genus level is quite difficult because of the relative homogeneity of bamboo shells and their rare flowering periods. Phytolith analysis has potential taxonomic significance for identifying bamboos at the genus level. We present morphometric and assemblage analyses of phytoliths from 17 woody bamboo species within the genera Phyllostachys, Dendrocalamus and Bambusa in subtropical southwest China. The oblong concave saddle and narrow elliptates are the two most abundant phytolith morphotypes in these samples. The average lengths and widths of oblong concave saddles varied considerably between Phyllostachys (192 and 10.5 mu m), Dendrocalamus (18.00 and 8.7 mu m), and Bambusa (172 and 9.4 mu m), suggesting that size measurements alone may be used to distinguish these genera. Further, hierarchical cluster analysis of the relative abundance of all phytolith morphotypes in these samples, as well as the morphological parameters of oblong concave saddles, demonstrate that these parameters are able to classify bamboos at the genus level. In sum, the relative abundance of specific phytolith morphotypes (narrow eliliptates and oblong concave saddles), the relative assemblages of all phytolith morphotypes, and the morphological parameters (length and width) of oblong concave saddles, all exhibit taxonomical value at the genus level for the Bambusoideae subfamily. Phytolith analysis provides an ability to taxonomically classify a culturally and ecologically significant subfamily of plants in the past and at present. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - No-tillage (NT) agriculture represents a great advance in soil conservation in tropical and subtropical zones, occupying more than 32 million ha in Brazil in 2017. No-tillage systems can promote earthworm populations, which can improve soil physical and chemical properties, thus enhancing the benefits of NT for soil conservation and ecosystem services. Furthermore, earthworms can be used as indicators of the quality of NT systems. Here, we summarize the studies that evaluated earthworm populations in NT systems between 1986 and 2016 in Brazil, highlighting important gaps in knowledge. The studies were highly skewed geographically, with most data from southern and south-eastern Brazil, and had very little information from the two states with the greatest NT area (Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul) which together represent 43% of Brazil's NT area. Abundance values ranged from 0 to 660 ind. m(-2), with a mean of 91 +/- 129 ind. m(-2) (+/- SD), and at least 33 species were identified in NT systems. However, 73% of sites were considered to have poor and moderate soil quality based on their earthworm populations, raising concern regarding soil quality levels in Brazilian NT systems. Climate, soil and management conditions are important drivers of earthworm populations in Brazilian NT systems and future earthworm surveys in NT systems should provide ample data on these attributes, as well as on earthworm species, in order to improve their use as soil quality bioindicators.

AB  - The impact of the Three Gorges Dam on the downstream flow regime and carp communities is assessed through a systematic examination of various indicators of hydrology (IHs) recorded during the pre-and post-dam periods. Specifically, the Spearman correlation method is used to identify a number of key indicators better correlated with carp population changes. The range of variability approach (RVA) is then applied to these key IHs to calculate their degree of alteration after the dam impoundment. Also, a new composite index is proposed here to determine the most important IHs. This index quantifies the relative impact among the competing indicators by accounting for both their alteration and correlation levels. It is observed that the presence of Three Gorges Dam disrupts the natural flow patterns and limits the downstream areas to small-scale, short-lived flow events. These flow events are insufficient regarding both the magnitude and duration to satisfy the carps' breeding needs. Among 32 IHs considered here, high-pulse duration and rise rate of discharge or water level are found to be the most important flow properties for the carps' spawning success; at the same time, they are the worst affected by the dam presence. Other indicators, such as base flow discharge and fall rate of discharge, also play a role, as they are adversely affecting the carp fry biomass. The present results are very useful for designing water releases that will be effective in improving the breeding conditions and augmenting the overall carp population.

AB  - This study examined the effect of Carbon Capture and Storage units on the environmental, energy and economic performance of the Brazilian electric grid. Four scenarios were established considering the coupling of Calcium Looping (CaL) processes to capture CO2 emitted from thermoelectric using coal and natural gas: S1: the current condition of the Brazilian grid; S2 and S3: Brazilian grid with CaL applied individually to coal (TEC) and gas (TGN) operated thermoelectric; and S4: CaL is simultaneously coupled to both sources. Global warming potential (GWP) expressed the environmental dimension, Primary Energy Demand (PED) was the energy indicator and Levelised Cost of Energy described the economic range. Attributional Life Cycle Assessment for generation of 1.0 MWh was applied in the analysis. None of the scenarios accumulated the best indexes in all dimensions. Regarding GWP, S4 totals the positive effects of using CaL to reduce CO2 from TEC and TGN, but the CH4 emissions increased due to its energy requirements. As for PED, S1 and S2 are similar and presented higher performances than S3 and S4. The price of natural gas compromises the use of CaL in TGN. A combined verification of the three analysis dimensions, proved that S2 was the best option of the series due to the homogeneity of its indices. The installation of CaL in TECs and TGNs was effective to capture and store CO2 emissions, but the costs of this system should be reduced and its energy efficiency still needs to be improved.

AB  - Diversity of arable plants in Europe has markedly declined during the past decades and many species have become threatened. Low-intensity farming can offer potential retreats for these species, while spontaneous dispersal between such fields is unlikely. Thus, reintroduction of endangered species is necessary to restore agrobiodiversity. To test the applicability under real farm conditions, we seeded a mixture of three winter annuals (Legousia speculum-veneris, Consolida regalis, Lithospermum arvense) at 850 seeds/m(2) on four organic farms near Munich, Germany, in autumn 2011. Seed production and soil seed banks were investigated on four plots within one field on each farm for 3years. In addition, we evaluated seed dispersal caused by arable management along the main machining direction. In the first year, winter cereals were cultivated and the study species emerged at all sites with a seed production mostly exceeding the initial sowing rates. In the third year, species establishment varied depending on crop rotations. Seed production of L. speculum-veneris was higher than in the two other species, and exceeded the number of originally sown seeds up to 20 times. While L. speculum-veneris became very common in the seed bank, C. regalis was less abundant and L. arvense hardly developed a soil seed bank. Seeds of L. speculum-veneris and L. arvense were found up to 15m and seeds of C. regalis up to 13m away from the sown plots. We suggest using seed production, seed bank, and dispersal as key indicators to evaluate establishment of reintroduced arable plants.

AB  - Effects of fishing on the stability of fish populations have been examined in numerous studies; however, species interactions and their changes with life history stages may complicate such effects at the community level, which has not been well understood. We simulated trophic interactions within fish communities using a size-spectrum model and examined the effects of fishing on community stability for a variety of scenarios. We focused on two characteristics of community stability, the level of fluctuations in community status and recovery rates after perturbation, measured by spawning stock biomass (SSB) and two size-based indicators, mean body size (MW) and slope of the size spectrum (Slope). Increasing variability of fishing pressure was found to lead to linear increases in the variation of community status, whereas the impact was limited on integrated indicators such as MW, Slope and total SSB. The interaction of fishing pressure with given levels of recruitment variability amplified the fluctuations in SSB, but reduced those in MW and Slope. For a variety of random perturbations, all scenarios showed similar recovery trajectories, in which MW and Slope showed a steep decrease and slow recovery. Fishing pressure had substantial influences on the recovery of SSB and MW, but less effects on Slope, except for the non-fishing scenarios. The recovery time of SSB was highly variable among species and decreased with the increasing fishing pressure in general. The indirect effect of fishing on stability could be largely attributed to the changes in feeding conditions. Our stability evaluations have several implications for fisheries management, suggesting the potential and challenge for the recovery of depleted fisheries stocks in the absence of environmental changes.

AB  - After-1 yr on the seafloor at water depths of similar to 700 m on Hydrate Ridge in the Pacific, eight colonization experiments composed primarily of a plastic mesh cube (from here on refered to as SEA(3), for Seafloor Epibenthic Attachment Cubes) were colonized by 1076 Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi on similar to 1841 cm(2) of experimental substrate. This species is typically considered an indicator of well-oxygenated conditions, and recruitment of such large numbers in bottom waters with low dissolved oxygen availability (0.24-0.37 mL/L) indicate that this taxon may not be as limited by oxygen as previously thought. Clues about substrate preferences were evident from the distribution, or lack thereof, of individuals among plastic mesh, coated steel frame, wooden dowels and reflective tape. Abundance, individual size distributions within cage populations and isotopic biogeochemistry of living foraminifera colonizing experimental substrates were compared between active seep and adjacent off seep experiment locations, revealing potential differences between these environments. Few studies have examined foraminiferal colonization of hard substrates in the deep-sea and to our knowledge no previous study has compared foraminiferal colonization of active seep and off-seep substrates from the same region. This study provides initial results of recruitment, colonization, geochemical and morphological aspects of the paleoceanographically significant species, C. wuellerstorfi, from dynamic deep-sea environments. Further experimental deployments of SEA(3)s will provide a means to assess relatively unknown ecologic dynamics of important foraminiferal deep-sea species.

AB  - Non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) adapt to species-specific environmental conditions and hence are promising bioindicators for aquatic and ecotoxicological monitoring. Although their utility for these purposes was historically limited by difficulties in their morphological identification, DNA barcoding offers a possible solution. Here, eight Japanese species of the genus Chironomus, which is characterized by its worldwide distribution and abundance among Chironomidae, were subjected to DNA barcoding using cytochromec oxidase subunitI (COI). To examine whether this DNA barcode is a useful indicator for Japanese species of Chironomus, we calculated genetic distances within and between the COI sequences of Chironomus species both from this study and worldwide and constructed phylogenetic trees. Based on 415bp COI sequences and the Kimura two-parameter model, the average genetic distances within 37 species and between 72 species were 2.6% and 17.2%, respectively. Although the ranges of genetic distances within and between species overlapped from 0.8% to 17.3%, 99.7% of average genetic distances between species were >3.0%. Some of this overlap is attributable to distances within species that were too large as well as those between species that were too small. Of eight Japanese species examined, two showed genetic distances between species that were below a 3.0% threshold, and four had distances within species that were greater than 3.0%. These results suggest a possible reclassification of these species and the need for further sampling to unveil biogeographic variations among different countries and regions.

AB  - Taking a global perspective this paper sets out to theoretically and empirically identify prosperity patterns for four groups of countries at different levels of economic development. It conceptualizes 'prosperity' in terms of ecological sustainability, social inclusion, and the quality of life and contextualizes this definition in global perspective. Subsequently, it operationalizes and measures these dimensions on the basis of data from sources such as the World Bank, the Global Footprint Network and the OECD for 138 countries and by applying dual multiple factor analysis. Building on earlier research that suggested that higher development levels in terms of GDP per capita are capable of providing social and individual prosperity but at the expense of environmental sustainability, we ask whether other interrelations between prosperity indicators exist on other levels of economic development. Empirically distinguishing between 'rich', 'emerging', 'developing' and 'poor countries' the paper finds that social and individual prosperity indicators largely increase with economic development while ecological sustainability indicators worsen. Our analyses further reveal that 'social cohesion' can be established under different economic and institutional conditions, that subjective wellbeing increases with income rises at all levels of economic development and that a decoupling of carbon emissions from the provision of prosperity is, in principle, achievable, while a reduction of the global matter and energy throughput poses a much greater challenge. The paper concludes by highlighting the repercussions of these findings for the trajectories that countries at different levels of economic development would need to undertake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - MODIS images during the year 2012 were used for modelling of the radiation and energy balance components with the application of the SAFER algorithm (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) in the Brazilian Pantanal area. Pixels from the main sub-regions of BarAo de Melgaco (BR), Paiaguas (PA) and Nhecolandia (NH) were extracted in order to process microclimatic comparisons. In general, the net radiation (R-n) relied much more on the global solar radiation (R-G) levels than on water conditions and ecosystem types, in accordance with the low R-n standard deviation values. The fraction of the available energy used as latent heat flux (E) were, on average, 65, 50 and 49% for the BR, PA and NH sub-regions, respectively. Horizontal heat advection, identified by the negative values of sensible heat flux (H), made several pixels with E values higher than those for R-n in the middle of the year. Taking the evaporative fraction (E-f) as a surface moisture indicator, the Tree-Lined Savanna (TLS) was considered the moister ecosystem class, with 58% of the available energy being used as E, while the driest one was the modified ecosystem Anthropogenic Changes (AC), presenting a E/R-n fraction of 0.46. According to the spatial and temporal consistencies, and after comparisons with other previous point and large-scale studies, the SAFER algorithm proved to have sensibility to quantify and compare the large-scale radiation and energy balance components in the different ecosystems of the Brazilian Pantanal. The algorithm is useful for monitoring the energy exchange dynamics among the different terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem types throughout the seasons of the year.

AB  - Long-term exploitation of boreal ecosystems often results in a reduced range of ecological conditions that threatens several species. In most boreal jurisdictions, the northern extent of commercial forestry corresponds to economical rather than ecological considerations. Our general objective is to offer guidance for sustainable boreal forest management by using a biodiversity criterion based on three indicators. The first two indicators are part of a coarse filter referring to the proportion and fragmentation of tall, dense forest habitats, whereas a third one uses a fine filter for specific requirements of boreal caribou. We applied the methodology with and without anthropogenic disturbances on 1114 land districts to contrast the preindustrial potential and current capacity of Quebec's boreal forest to support forest management. Originally, 826 districts (74%) were above the 20% cutoff value for the minimum proportion of tall, dense forest habitats. Among the 567 districts currently under forest management, 45 did not reach this value because of past anthropogenic disturbances. Originally, 88% of the districts had sufficient undisturbed habitats to maintain caribou populations, but anthropogenic disturbances reduced this proportion to 51%. The proposed methodology could contribute to delineating areas where sustainable forest management can be implemented. Our results also clearly show that management targets of the last decades were insufficient to prevent loss of habitats below strict minimum ecological thresholds. Our approach offers a general framework that could be adapted to other forested regions to attain similar biodiversity conservation objectives.

AB  - Radon represents the major source of natural radioactivity in confined environments. Despite the clear evidence of a direct association between residential exposure and human lung cancer provided by case-control studies, results relating indoor exposure and genotoxic/mutagenic effect induction are still contradictory. The present study attempts to estimate the genotoxic effects induced by exposure to radioactive radon in wild cricket populations sampled from caves where varying concentrations of radon are present. Cave crickets are also tested as possible bio-indicator organisms of genotoxic potential of contaminated residential and confined environments. Six caves in Central Italy are considered covering a broad spectrum of radon radioactivity concentration (221-26,000 Bq/m(3)). Dolichopoda specimens were sampled from each cave; both haemocytes and brain cells taken from individuals were tested for responsiveness to DNA damage induced by radon through the Comet assay. Specimens from the least radioactive cave, housed in controlled conditions for 60 days before analysis, were used as control group. Statistically significant increase of DNA damage was found in all groups of individuals from each cave, for both cell types. Very low values of all Comet parameters were found in control group individuals, which gave indications of a good responsiveness of the organism to the variable environmental levels of radioactive contamination. Results indicate that cave crickets represent a reliable tool for the detection of genotoxic potential induced by radioactive contamination of confined environments and can be proposed as a possible bio-indicator system for air (-radioactive) pollution related to indoor exposure

AB  - Monosaccharide, compositions were determined for a sediment core (RD-1) collected from a tropical wetland, Rawa Danau, West Java, Indonesia (location 6 degrees 11' S and 105 degrees 59' E) to assess the sources and diagenetic fate of carbohydrates in a tropical wetland based on the acid-hydrolysis monosaccharide compositions. Total monosaccharides (TCHO; normalized to organic carbon) and individual monosaccharide abundances were variable and mostly dominated by glucose through out all depths. The high TCHO, uneqimolar monosaccharide compositions and relatively low deoxysugars/pentoses ratio indicated that carbohydrates were preserved under reducing conditions. The monosaccharide compositional data and diagnostic parameters show that sources of sedimentary carbohydrates changes due to changes in terrigenous plant material which predominantly comprised of angiosperm plants. There are also few transitions between terrestrial and aquatic sources as the most dominant source of sedimentary carbohydrates. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the monosaccharide composition of potential source organisms and RD-1 samples revealed that sources of carbohydrates can be distinguished from the factor loading values. A cross plot of principal component one (PC!) and two (PC2) clearly separated terrestrial and aquatic sources since PC2 has positive values for terrestrial sources and negative values for aquatic sources. Vertical profile of PC2 indicated few major changes in sources of carbohydrates in Rawa Danau wetland associated to changes in local environment. Therefore, combination of monosaccharides composition to PCA is applicable for investigating the sources and fate of carbohydrates in natural environments.

AB  - In this paper the adaptation capacity of the algae Scenedesmus sp to the stress induced by cadmium and vanadium was evaluated in order to use it to detect the presence of these metals in water ecosystems. Algae were obtained from the collection of the Universidad Del Zulia, Venezuela. The algae were maintained in an algal culture medium at 28 +/- 2 degrees C, a 12: 12 h photoperiod and were exposed to 10 ppm of each metal during 10 days. The effect of metals on the cellular viability was determined by quantifying the production of pigments using the spectrophotometer, while the accumulation of cadmium and vanadium was determined by spectrometry of atomic absorption (GFAAS) and the ultrastructural changes were determined using TEM. All the bioassays were carried out for triplicate, each one with its own control. The results reflected that both metals produce an adverse effect on the pigment production. However, the levels of this parameter indicate cellular viability, which demonstrates adaptability of the cultures exposed to the metals. Furthermore, a significant metal accumulation was present, which is a parameter required for an environmental bioindicator. The ultrastructural analysis revealed morphologic changes which let to alterations in the organelles involved in the pigment production as well as in those in charge of the energetic metabolites storage. Through these changes the microorganisms might be able to overcome the adverse conditions of exposure and to maintain the viability cellular. Therefore, the species can be used as a experimental model to supervise the contamination by heavy metals.

AB  - Defining the reference condition is one of the most critical aspects of ecosystem investigations since it describes the baseline against which the experimental sites will be evaluated and compared. In large-scale ecosystem experiments, this reference is ideally another ecosystem which is similar to the experimental system. We investigated two streams for their potential as experimental sites for a full-size pairwise ecosystem experiment. Temporal (2 years) and spatial (pool, riffle) variabilities of abiotic factors and as biotic element the structure of the macroinvertebrate communities were investigated. Criteria of similarity that we applied at the two streams were: (1) high similarity in abiotic factors, (2) only small differences in the faunal assemblages (abundance structures, composition, feeding types), and (3) that the differences between the two systems should not exceed the temporal and spatial differences within each system. Among the abiotic factors investigated, only the inorganic nutrients (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus), major ions (magnesium, calcium), electric conductivity, and pH showed significant differences between the two streams. Discharge rate, current velocity, temperature, and oxygen concentrations did not significantly differ between the streams. Also, the community structure did not differ in species richness, abundance, and biomass; and only small differences in dominance structure and feeding-type composition were observed. The differences between habitats within each stream were always higher than those between the streams. Thus, both the streams are characterized by a similar structure of the macroinvertebrate community, a main component of the stream food-web, which make them suitable for a full size pairwise ecosystem experiment. The present case study can form a basis for other full-size field experiments.

AB  - In carbonate depositional environments, sediment is mostly produced by different groups of organisms. Ecological parameters, thus, play a major role controlling carbonate production. In the present work, carbonate-producing biota, especially foraminifers, are studied to construct a depositional model and paleoecological interpretation of the lower Tortonian distally steepened ramp of Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). This carbonate platform corresponds to a highstand systems track prograding and aggrading over a Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and, locally, lower Tertiary basement. Outcrops are excellently exposed in the southern part of the island. Five facies associations are observed, which, in downdip direction, correspond to inner ramp, middle ramp, ramp slope, toe of the slope, and outer ramp. Samples have been studied using point counting of 102 thin sections. Six foraminiferal assemblages have been distinguished. Eight microfacies are identified (IR.1, IR.2, MR, URS, LRS, TS.1, TS.2, and OR), based on the abundance and ecological significance of the foraminifers (large benthic foraminifers, epiphytics, low-oxygen indicators, and planktonics) and other carbonate-producing organisms (echinoids, mollusks, barnacles, bryozoans, serpulids, coral genus Pontes, and green and red algae). Seagrass meadows in the inner ramp correspond to the euphotic carbonate factory, whereas red algae and large benthic foraminifers dominate the oligophotic carbonate factory in the middle ramp and upper ramp slope. Microfacies composition verified intense sediment-transport processes from inner and middle ramp down to lower ramp slope, toe of the slope, and outer ramp. Finally, microfacies analysis also indicates that carbonate-production took place in warm-water conditions, in oligotrophic-to-mesotrophic waters.

AB  - Poor fetal environments are thought to produce adaptive changes in human developmental trajectories according to the Predictive Adaptive Response hypothesis. Although many studies have demonstrated correlations between indicators of fetal environment and negative adult health outcomes, the adaptive significance of these outcomes is unclear. Our study explicitly tests the adaptive nature of fetal programming in humans. We show that differences in nutritional status at birth are associated with adaptive differences in the sensitivity of adult ovarian function to energetic stress. Women who were born as relatively fat babies do not exhibit ovarian suppression in response to moderate levels of physical activity at adulthood, in contrast to women who were born as skinnier babies. The levels of estradiol in women born in the highest tertile of ponderal index (an indicator of neonatal nutritional status) were 37% and 46% higher, respectively, than levels of estradiol in women born in the low and middle ponderal index tertiles. These findings suggest that fetal programming of reproductive function results in developmentally plastic, but essentially adaptive, shifts in set points of ovarian response to energetic stress, such that women who were gestated under conditions of energetic constraint show greater sensitivity to energetic stress in adulthood. Our results have practical implications in terms of behavioral strategies for reducing the risk of breast cancer. We suggest that the amount of activity necessary to reduce levels of estrogen, which may in turn reduce cancer risk, can depend on a woman's nutritional status at birth.

AB  - After a 40-year absence caused by pollution and eutrophication, burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.) recolonized western Lake Erie in the mid 1990s as water quality improved. Mayflies are an important food resource for the economically valuable yellow perch fishery and are considered to be major indicator species of the ecological condition of the lake. Since their reappearance, however, mayfly populations have suffered occasional unexplained recruitment failures. In 2002, a failure of fall recruitment followed an unusually warm summer in which western Lake Erie became temporarily stratified, resulting in low dissolved oxygen levels near the lake floor. In the present study, we examined a possible link between Hexagenia recruitment and periods of intermittent stratification for the years 1997-2002. A simple model was developed using surface temperature, wind speed, and water column data from 2003 to predict stratification. The model was then used to detect episodes of stratification in past years for which water column data are unavailable. Low or undetectable mayfly recruitment occurred in 1997 and 2002, years in which there was frequent or extended stratification between June and September. Highest mayfly reproduction in 2000 corresponded to the fewest stratified periods. These results suggest that even relatively brief periods of stratification can result in loss of larval mayfly recruitment, probably through the effects of hypoxia. A trend toward increasing frequency of hot summers in the Great Lakes region could result in recurrent loss of mayfly larvae in western Lake Erie and other shallow areas in the Great Lakes.

AB  - This paper presents the system-level responses of experimental lake ecosystems to three chemical stresses (acidification, copper and pesticide contamination) using exergy and structural exergy as ecological indicators. The results indicate that the doses or toxicity of the three chemical stressors contributed to changes in both exergy and structural exergy. Remarkable changes in exergy and structural exergy occurred under acidic conditions and in the presence of Dursban, 24D-DMA, permethrin, bifenthrin, Carbaryl, TCP, PCP, trichlorethylene, benzene, and high doses of Cu, oil, and hexazinone. This seemed to indicate that the subject ecosystems were seriously contaminated by these chemical stressors. For low doses of Cu, oil, atrazine, HCBP, and hexazinone, exergy and structural exergy were either unchanged or only slightly changed, suggesting that the lake ecosystems were not significantly impacted by these chemical stressors. Discussion of the relationships between ecosystem-level changes and structural and functional changes in stressed take ecosystems indicates that the above-mentioned ecosystem-level changes were in accordance with the changes in structure and function. The observed changes in exergy and structural exergy were also consistent with Odum's predictions of shortened food chains, reduced resource use efficiency, poor stability, low information, and high entropy in stressed aquatic ecosystems. The findings lead the authors to conclude that it is feasible for exergy and structural exergy to serve as ecological indicators when characterizing the system-level responses of experimental lake ecosystems to chemical stress. These results for experimental lake ecosystems would be extrapolated to actual lakes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A systematic stable isotopic study of an exceptionally well-preserved Baculites compressus specimen from the Pierre Shale (Upper Campanian) of South Dakota was conducted to assess whether the variations recorded in the calcareous shells of baculitids can be used as a reliable indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions. We sampled the B. compressus conch along four sampling profiles: (1) an ontogenetic traverse parallel to growth direction, (2) a virtually isochronous traverse along two different lirae delineated by growth lines, (3) a septal traverse, and (4) a shell-wall traverse through the conch wall. To date, the ontogenetic sequence is the Longest record produced from baculitids. We interpret the isotopic variations determined from the ontogenetic, septal, and depth-profile traverses to be dominated by an. environmental signal, especially in shell material deposited prior to septal crowding (i.e., maturity). In contrast, we interpret the isotopic variations determined from the isochronous traverse along the two different lirae to be altered by "biological vital effects." Our results indicate that a careful sampling strategy that avoids strongly ornamented areas of the shell is required ifa "true" paleoenvironmental signal is to be extracted from the calcareous shells of baculitids, and perhaps other ammonites as well. Our best estimate of seasonal seawater-temperature variation in, the Late Campanian Western Interior Seaway at 42 degrees N, based on the oxygen isotopic data from the baculitid specimen, is 10.0 degrees C (range of 29.7 degrees C to 19.7 degrees C).

AB  - Bioaccumulation of four classes of contaminants (organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and chlorophenols) was determined in two sediment-dwelling bivalves, the tellinid Macomona liliana and the venerid Austrovenus stutchburyi at five stations along a contaminant gradient in Manukau Harbour, New Zealand. The species were chosen because they provide contrasting exposure pathways for contaminant uptake: A. sturchburyi is a filter-feeder and M. liliana is a deposit feeder. They are also important components of the estuarine ecosystem, and A. stutchburyi are used for food. Both shellfish showed marked gradients of contaminant concentrations from the inner-harbour to the entrance. Concentrations of contaminants were similar in the two species, with generally slightly higher PCB and PAH levels in M. liliana. On a dry tissue weight basis, the PAHs were the major contaminant class, with the highest concentration measured (203 ng/g DW). Mean bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were similar for the two species, with mean values in the range 20-30 for most contaminants with the exception of PAHs, which were less than 1. Mean accumulation factor (AF) values, the lipid normalized concentration in organisms divided by the organic carbon normalized sediment concentration, were mostly in the range 1-4, except for PAHs, which were 0.002 and 0.14. M, liliana showed significantly higher accumulation ratios than A. stutchburyi. The abundance and condition of M. liliana was reduced at the more contaminated sites. These results suggest that M. liliana are sensitive indicators of contaminant stress and may be usefully incorporated into chemical contaminant and biological effects monitoring programs.

AB  - The metacommunity theory includes processes that contribute, at different scales, to the understanding of the distribution of organisms in space and aims to assess the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors in the structuring of communities. Fluvial ecosystems of the Argentine Pampas are characterized by their environmental heterogeneity from slow water courses and variable development of aquatic vegetation to faster courses. They are affected by the different land uses, which are among the main threats to biodiversity and alter the dispersal of the species. Forty-four species of aquatic oligochaete assemblages from 15 streams of nine Pampean basins were seasonally analyzed. The assemblages were characterized through estimations of taxonomic richness, alpha and beta diversity. No differences were found in the assemblages of the substrates (sediments and aquatic vegetation) within each stream, except for Juan Blanco stream. However, differences were found between streams, as well as between basins. The oligochaetes that contributed most to the dissimilarity among streams and basins were Nais communis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Dero obtusa, and Stylaria fossularis. Two groups of sites were identified through the analysis of canonical correspondence: those of mountain basins and those of lowland basins. The variance partitioning showed that local environmental conditions (acting as environmental filters) accounted for 15.64% in the ordering of the assemblages, while 14.60% was explained by altitude and geographic factors (as a dispersal limitation). These results help to understand the processes that organize the distribution of organisms at different scales, which could have important implications when making decisions regarding biomonitoring and conservation.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from 15 modern surface sediment samples of the Bay of Quiberon (Southern Brittany shelf) have been examined to assess their potential as marine bio-indicators for paleoenvironmental reconstructions in a shallow coastal environment. Some discrepancies are noted in the distribution of dinocyst taxa in the study area, and particularly regarding dinocyst concentration and diversity (26 different taxa identified in total) as well as heterotrophic taxa percentages. We suggest that the proportion of heterotrophic taxa is, in an embayment of 15 m deep in average, mainly attributed to bottom water oxygenation and sediment granulometry, both acting on species-selective degradation after dinocyst deposition. More precisely, higher heterotrophic abundances are found under lower oxic conditions and in fine grain-size sediment samples, leading to caution about their use as productivity indicators in coastal environments when these parameters are not fully addressed. The comparison of the Bay of Quiberon data with surface sediment samples and top cores from previously published data makes it possible to establish a transect of the modern dinocyst distribution from inshore to offshore areas in the northern Bay of Biscay, allowing to identify different ecological groups according to the hydrological and bathymetric contexts: i) an estuarine assemblage strongly dominated by Lingulodinium machaerophorum, ii) a proximal coastal assemblage dominated by L. machaerophorum and, to a lesser extent, Spiniferites bentodi, iii) a neritic assemblage dominated by L. machaerophorum, Spiniferites ramosus and cysts of Pentapharsodinium dalei, and iv) an oceanic group dominated by Spiniferites mirabilis and Operculodinium centrocarpum.

AB  - Soil resources in parts of Tanzania are rapidly being depleted by increased rates of soil erosion and downstream sediment transport, threatening ecosystem health, water and livelihood security in the region. However, incomplete understanding to what effect the dynamics of soil erosion and sediment transport are responding to land-use changes and climatic variability are hindering the actions needed to future-proof Tanzanian land-use practices. Complementary environmental diagnostic tools were applied to reconstruct the rates and sources of sedimentation over time in three Tanzanian river systems that have experienced changing land use and climatic conditions. Detailed historical analysis of sediment deposits revealed drastic changes in sediment yield and source contributions. Quantitative sedimentation reconstruction using radionuclide dating showed a 20-fold increase in sediment yield over the past 120 years. The observed dramatic increase in sediment yield is most likely driven by increasing land-use pressures. Deforestation, cropland expansion and increasing grazing pressures resulted into accelerating rates of sheet erosion. A regime shift after years of progressive soil degradation and convergence of surface flows resulted into a highly incised landscape, where high amounts of eroded soil from throughout the catchment are rapidly transported downstream by strongly connected ephemeral drainage networks. By integrating complementary spatial and temporal evidence bases, this study demonstrated links between land-use change, increased soil erosion and downstream sedimentation. Such evidence can guide stakeholders and policy makers in the design of targeted management interventions to safeguard future soil health and water quality.

AB  - Shipyards impact on estuarine environments because of the use of antifouling paints and petroleum products, which release trace metals that may remain in their bioavailable or labile form. Regardless of its importance, the relation between continuous input of trace metals (hotspot area) and their availability in the water column has been scarcely studied. This study evaluated seasonal variations in the concentrations of labile fractions of metals in shipyards located in estuarine areas on the Brazilian subtropical coast. These fractions were determined by the Diffuse Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) technique. Maximum labile fraction concentrations of Cr (0.3 mu g L-1), Ni (2.2 mu g L-1) and V (2.0 mu g L-1) are directly related to (i) their specific source: antifouling paints (for Cr), metal and steel alloys (for Cr and Ni) and petroleum products (for V), besides (ii) periods of intensive traffic and vessel repair. Additionally, variations in labile fractions of Ni and V in the Patos Lagoon estuary were influenced by salinity, which is known to affect metal desorption from surface sediments in resuspension events. Even though Cr is affected by the same processes, it is available as Cr(III) and does not represent any ecological risk in the study areas. Although the areas under study are affected by variations in physical and chemical conditions, shipyards were effectively hotspots of trace metals in their labile fraction in various estuarine systems in southeastern and southern Brazil. Thus, they represent areas where Ecological Risk Assessment, mainly of V, should be carried out. (C)2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Green alder (Alnus viridis) is a shrub species that has expanded over former pastures in Central Europe due to land abandonment, leading to negative agri-environmental impacts, such as a reduction in forage yield and quality and an increase in nitrate leaching. Robust livestock breeds such as Highland cattle could be used to control A. viridis encroachment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of A. viridis encroachment on plant community composition and diversity and to map the spatial distribution of Highland cattle in A. viridis-encroached pastures. During the summer of 2019, three different Highland cattle herds were placed along an A. viridis encroachment gradient. A total of 58 botanical surveys were carried out before grazing to assess plant community composition, pastoral value, and ecological indicator values. The spatial distribution of cattle was studied during the whole grazing period by monitoring six to eight cows equipped with GPS collars in each herd. Plant species associated with higher pastoral values of the vegetation were found in areas with lower A. viridis cover, while highly encroached areas were dominated by a few nitrophilus and shade-tolerant broad-leaved species and by ferns. Cattle spent more time in areas with higher pastoral value but did not avoid areas with high cover of A. viridis, on steep slopes or far from water. These results show that Highland cattle are able to tolerate harsh environmental conditions and that they can exploit A. viridis-encroached pastures. This suggests that they have a high potential to reduce A. viridis encroachment in the long-term.

AB  - Tetracycline (TC), a widely-used antibiotic to treat bacterial infections, combines with Eu3+ to form a stable EuTC complex that has a low fluorescence (FL) yield because of Eu3+ coordination with water molecules. We report a simple, label-free ratiometric fluorescent platform for sensitively and selectively sensing of TC, using L-histidine caped gold nanoclusters (His-AuNCs) as a FL indicator and an enhancer of Eu3+ FL. The His-AuNCs were prepared via chemical reduction of Au(III) by L-histidine, which was a reducer and a protecting agent. The His-AuNCs exhibited good photostability, outstanding stability toward high ionic strengths, storage stability, and favorable optical properties. In the absence of TC, the AuNCs-Eu3+ system displays strong FL emission at 475 nm (F-475) from the His-AuNCs and weak FL at 620 nm from Eu3+ (F-620) with excitation at 375 nm. TC quenches the His-AuNC FL and greatly enhances the Eu3+ emission. This is attributed to an enhancement of the EuTC complex fluorescence by the His-AuNCs. Thus, a ratiometric F-620/F-475 FL signal can be used for TC detection by simply mixing AuNCs and Eu3+. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range from 10 nM to 60 mu M and a detection limit of 4 nM (S/N = 3) for TC were obtained. The application of the assay platform for the detection of TC in environmental and biological samples was demonstrated. The sensing platform has advantages of easy preparation, rapid response, high sensitivity, and good selectivity.

AB  - High gravity (HG) and very high gravity (VHG) fermentations are increasingly attractive within the brewing industry as a means of optimizing process efficiency and energy-saving. However, the use of highly concentrated worts is concomitant with a number of biological stress factors that can impact on yeast quality and fermentation performance. In order to eliminate or reduce potentially detrimental effects, brewing yeast respond to their environment by shunting carbon into different metabolic end products, which assist in the protection of cells, but also impact on final ethanol yield. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of substrate sugar concentration on carbon partitioning in brewing fermentations. This was conducted using a series of laboratory-scale fermentations with worts of 13?P, 18?P and 24?P, pitched using lager and ale yeast strains. Fermentation performance was assessed with respect to the uptake of wort sugars and the production of key carbon-based metabolites, leading to a calculation of yeast central carbon flux. Analysis of carbon assimilation and dissimilation revealed that changes in intracellular trehalose, glycogen, higher alcohols and esters were observed, however the production of yeast biomass acted as the major trade-off with ethanol production. The data presented here shows for the first time the requirements of yeast populations during HG and VHG conditions and the factors that have a major impact on key performance indicators. This data has major significance for fermentation-based industries globally and is especially important for those sectors seeking to maximize yield from existing resources through high gravity fermentations.

AB  - The ability of Pseudomonas species to thrive in all major natural environments (i.e. terrestrial, freshwater and marine) is based on its exceptional capability to adapt to physicochemical changes. Thus, environmental bacteria have to tightly control the maintenance of numerous physiological traits across different conditions. The intracellular pH (pH(i)) homoeostasis is a particularly important feature, since the pH(i) influences a large portion of the biochemical processes in the cell. Despite its importance, relatively few reliable, easy-to-implement tools have been designed for quantifying in vivo pH(i) changes in Gram-negative bacteria with minimal manipulations. Here we describe a convenient, non-invasive protocol for the quantification of the pH(i) in bacteria, which is based on the ratiometric fluorescent indicator protein PHP (pH indicator for Pseudomonas). The DNA sequence encoding PHP was thoroughly adapted to guarantee optimal transcription and translation of the indicator in Pseudomonas species. Our PHP-based quantification method demonstrated that pH(i) is tightly regulated over a narrow range of pH values not only in Pseudomonas, but also in other Gram-negative bacterial species such as Escherichia coli. The maintenance of the cytoplasmic pH homoeostasis in vivo could also be observed upon internal (e.g. redirection of glucose consumption pathways in P. putida) and external (e.g. antibiotic exposure in P. aeruginosa) perturbations, and the PHP indicator was also used to follow dynamic changes in the pH(i) upon external pH shifts. In summary, our work describes a reliable method for measuring pH(i) in Pseudomonas, allowing for the detailed investigation of bacterial pH(i) homoeostasis and its regulation.

AB  - Microbiological parameters and character of transformation of humic substances of sod-podzolic soil at the end of five rotations of eight-full crop rotation in long-term stationary field experiment (1978-2017) are investigated. The direction of microbiological processes due to the effect of long-term application of mineral fertilizers in increasing doses - 30 to 150 kg/ha of NPK was determined. A comparison of the arable soil with its virgin analogs (mixed forest and natural meadow) as well as with the planting of goatling (Galegae orientalis L.). It was found that the different use of sod-podzolic soil led to a change in the direction of soil microbial processes. Plowing the soil reduced the content of total humus and increased the number and variety of actinomycetes involved in the mineralization of semi-decomposed plant residues, i. e. detritus. In the variants with application of mineral fertilizers for cereal crops in doses 90-150 kg/ha of NPK it was observed the preservation of the original content of humus and a decrease of the index of pedotrophy compared to virgin counterparts and arable soil without fertilizers or treated with fertilizer in low doses. With the long-term cultivation of perennial leguminous culture without applying fertilizers, a microbial community is formed in the soil which is close in terms of quantitative and qualitative indicators to the microbial community of virgin soil analogs and its humus state is stabilized.

AB  - Since neophytes can become invasive in the future, untangling their ecological preferences is of paramount importance, especially in urban areas where they represent a substantial proportion of the local flora. Studies exploring alien species assemblages in urban environments are however scarce. This study aims to unravel alien plant species preferences for five urban land uses (densely built-up areas, open built-up areas, industrial areas, broadleaved urban forests, and agricultural areas and small landscape elements). We took the city of Brussels as a model, in which we recorded all vascular species growing spontaneously in grid cells of 1km(2). We tested two different ways of classifying the 1-km(2) cells: (1) We simply associated each cell with its dominant land cover; (2) We used a fuzzy approach for which the degree of association of a given cell to a given land cover depended on the proportion of that land cover within the cell. For both classification methods, we calculated the indicator species of the resulting land cover types based on alien species only. The crisp and fuzzy classifications identified 33 and 49 species, respectively, with a clear preference for some urban land use types (from a total of 129 alien plant species analyzed). Results showed that urban land use types having apparently similar environmental conditions can actually harbor different neophyte assemblages. Fine-tuning the categorization of urban environments in future ecological studies is therefore important for understanding spatial patterns of alien species occurrence.

AB  - Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.

AB  - Unlike southern Spain, northern Morocco has been little investigated for palaeoecological purposes. Consequently, the origin and history of the Rifan vegetation is largely unknown, as well as the past role of human activities. A review of the Plio-Pleistocene fossil data available from North Africa clearly reveals the ancient origin of much of the present-day flora and vegetation structures of the region. A well-dated pollen record covering the last 5,000 years, obtained from a fen, is compared to previous regional pollen data in order to understand the late-Holocene vegetation dynamics and the influence of anthropogenic disturbances. Modern pollen spectra have allowed the calibration of pollen diversity and evenness as indicators of tree-cover density. The results obtained show the long-term persistence of regional forests until the onset of Arab Sharifian dynasties in the 16th century, with a surprising lack of human impact during the late Neolithic, and little impact during Roman colonisation. The increasing density of deciduous forests recorded from 3,800 to 1,900 cal bp, concomitant with the expansion of cedar in the Middle Atlas, could reveal the onset of widespread cooler and moister climatic conditions. The weak and late human impact in the Rifan mountains explains, at least in part, their high diversity and the conservation of their forest ecosystems. Anthropogenic activities however have led to severe modification of the understorey structure of these forests during the four last centuries, and to the worrying on-going deforestation that presently threatens the survival of this invaluable biological heritage.

AB  - ABSTRACT-Whereas 'biological site fidelity' refers to the regular reuse of a favored locale (e.g., breeding ground or nest) by an individual animal, 'paleontological site fidelity' typically refers to repeated use of a nesting locality by a herd or species over geologic time scales. Two new Cretaceous specimens from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, U.S.A., and the Liantoutang Formation of Zhejiang, China, each preserve two closely superimposed clutches of the egg form Prismatoolithus. These eggs belong to the Troodontidae, small theropod dinosaurs sharing a close ancestry with Aves. In both specimens, eggs of a lower clutch are truncated at a level below what would normally preserve in an undisturbed hatched clutch. These traces differ from past examples of dinosaur site fidelity in (1) the close or cross-cutting relationship of the clutches, (2) the precise overlay of clutch atop clutch, and (3) the implication of nest reuse and, thus, site fidelity on an ecologic rather than geologic scale and at approximately the individual rather than species level. Given the likely extended occupation of troodontid nesting sites by attending adults, factors such as nesting success and territoriality may, in addition to favorable substrates, have influenced the behaviors recorded by these specimens. The arrangements of eggs as clutches within the geologic record represent trace fossils. Thus, they record past in situ behavior, providing important insight into dinosaur nesting. In addition, they can serve as independent indicators of substrate conditions and sedimentary history, potentially refining our understanding of paleoenvironments.

AB  - Land managers often use fire prescriptions to mimic intensity, season, completeness, and return interval of historical fire regimes. However, fire prescriptions based on average historical fire regimes do not consider natural stochastic variability in fire season and frequency. Applying prescribed fire based on averages could alter the relative abundance of important plant species and structure. We evaluated the density and distribution of oak (Quercus spp.) and persimmon (Diospyros virgiana) stems and mast after 22 yr of a historical-based growing-season fire prescription that failed to consider the variability in historical fire regimes. We randomly established 30 25-m transects in each of 5 vegetation types and counted reproductively mature oak and persimmon stems and their fruits. In upland longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stands, this fire regime killed young hardwood trees, thereby decreasing compositional and structural heterogeneity within the upland pine vegetation type and limiting occurrence of the upland hardwood vegetation type. Acorns and persimmons were disproportionately distributed near firebreaks within low intensity fire transition zones. Mast was maintained, though in an unnatural distribution, as a result of an elaborate firebreak system. Our data indicate managed fire regimes may fail to mimic spatial distribution, frequency, and intensity of historical disturbances even when the fire prescription is based on empirical reference fire regimes. To maximize structural heterogeneity and conserve key ecosystem functionality, fire prescriptions should include variations in frequency, season, application method, and fire weather conditions rather than focusing on an average historical fire regime.

AB  - Heavy metals are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, and their toxic effects have been widely studied. However, their transgenerational effects between parent and progeny at environmental relevant concentrations need further investigations. Currently, L3 stage of Caenorhabditis elegans was exposed to aqueous metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) at environmentally realistic concentrations for 96 h. The whole exposure time covered the formation of sperm, ovum and eggs. Subsequently the behavior and growth indicators were measured. The parent nematodes were then bleached to gain synchronized eggs, which were cultured under non-toxic conditions to L3 stage when the same indicators were measured in the progeny. The parent suffered concentration-dependent inhibitions on behavior and growth. Based on the median effective concentration (EC50) values, body bending frequency showed relatively higher sensitivity than other behavior indicators. The inhibitions on growth and behavior of progeny were more severe than those of the parent, based on their respective EC50 values. Interestingly, Cd was not the most toxic metal in either parent or progeny according to EC50 values, but its EC50 ratios between parent and progeny (EC50, (parent)/EC50, (progeny)) were the most significant, indicating its greatest transgenerational effects. The results demonstrated the higher sensitivity of L3 larva stage of C elegans in the transgenerational effect studies than other life stages used before. Our findings suggested that parental exposure to heavy metals can multiply their harmful effects in following generations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thermophilous oak wood is the most species-rich forest habitat in the zone of mixed deciduous forests. A very limited amount of it has been saved in good condition. We investigated the principal hypothesis that the vegetation and seed banks, especially of the ancient forest species, are good indicators of habitat naturalness and its aptitude for restoration. Vegetation and seed bank sampling were carried out in fragments of forest with a known management and disturbance history over the past 80 years. We predicted that natural and anthropogenic transformations of tree stands would be significant factors shaping species composition and similarity of vegetation and seed banks. The closest similarity was observed between the seed banks of plots which were never logged. The least related to others was the seed bank of the logged site, whose soil was ploughed prior to tree replantation. The highest number of ancient forest species was recorded in the vegetation (33 species) and in the soil seed bank (21 species) of the least transformed patch of thermophilous oak forest. It was decreasing gradually with increase of the tree canopy cover on the research plots. Our results indicate also that the higher the coefficient of similarity between seed bank and vegetation, especially of the ancient forest species, the higher the forest's naturalness. We conclude that restoration of thermophilous oak wood has the highest chances for success in patches with well preserved seed banks and vegetation.

AB  - Most calibration data sets used to infer past environmental conditions from biological proxies are derived from many sites. An alternative strategy is to derive the calibration data set from within a single site. Transfer functions derived from such intra-site calibration data sets are usually applied to fossil assemblages from the focal lake, but a recent development has been to apply these transfer functions to other sites. Transfer functions derived from intra-site calibration data sets can have impressive cross-validation performance, but that gives little indication of their performance when applied to other sites. Here, we develop transfer functions for lake depth from intra-lake chironomid calibration data sets in Norway and Alaska and test the resulting models by cross-validation and against known depth in external lakes. Lake depth is a statistically significant predictor of chironomid assemblages at all these lakes, and most intra-lake transfer functions perform reasonably well under cross-validation, but their performance against external data is erratic. Downcore reconstructions from transfer functions developed on different lakes are dissimilar. Ignoring the poorly performing transfer functions, only 3 of 14 downcore reconstructions are statistically significant. Few assemblages downcore had good modern analogues in the calibration data set, even when the core was from the same lake as the calibration data set. We conclude that intra-site calibration data sets can find site-specific rather than general relationships between species and the environment and thus should be applied with care and to external sites only after careful and critical validation.

AB  - Wild fish are frequently exposed to multiple stressors, but the influence of previous or ongoing stress on an animal's subsequent response is poorly understood. Using wild-caught bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) as a model, we used exogenous hormone implants to experimentally raise circulating cortisol in a group of fish for similar to 10 days. We also maintained sham-treated and control groups of fish. We subjected all animals to a secondary stressor in the form of either a heat challenge or fasting challenge. We compared survival, body condition, and plasma-borne indicators of physiological status among cortisol-treated, sham-treated, and control groups following the secondary stressor. In order to compare short- and long-term effects of cortisol treatment, we initiated the secondary stressor either 4 or 30 days following initial cortisol treatment. Cortisol-treated fish succumbed to the fasting challenge sooner than sham-treated and control fish at both 4 and 30 days. Interestingly, cortisol-treated fish lost equilibrium sooner than sham-treated and control fish during the heat challenge when conducted at 30 days, but not at 4 days. These results demonstrate that multiple simultaneous stressors have cumulative effects on bluegill sunfish. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that supraphysiological cortisol doses alter the long-term responses of bluegill sunfish to additional challenges, even after apparent recovery. Such cumulative and long-term effects may be an important factor in mediating the response of wild animals to natural and anthropogenic stressors, and should be considered in ecological studies. J.

AB  - Development and environmental issues are commonly analysed by using administrative divisions. In this paper, instead, we analysed how the human population and various economic, social and environmental indicators are distributed across the north-south axis by using latitudinal approach. This was done because many of the factors forming the natural living conditions of human societies, such as climate, are largely depending on the distance to the equator. The analysis was done with the spatial resolution of five latitudinal degrees while the temporal scale of the study includes the last 50 years.
   We found that only less than 1/8 of the human population lives south of the equator while around 50% of the population dwell within the area between 20 degrees N and 40 degrees N, where also most of the world's development and poverty related problems are located. Majority of the economic and social indicators are low on both sides of the equator, but go up with the distance from the equator. For environmental indicators, however, the pattern is more heterogenic and is often correlated with the population density. Most populated latitudes are the scarcest on water, and land in there has been taken to agricultural use more than in other parts of the globe.
   The latitudinal approach allowed us to see geography based development patterns that might not have been visible with more conventional methods such as cross-country analyses on development. The approach was developed substantially beyond the previous studies. Four development directions of using spatial data-based approaches in development studies were identified. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A calibration data set of 51 surface sediment samples from Lake Donggi Cona on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau was investigated to study the relationship between sub-fossil ostracod assemblages and water depth. Samples were collected over a depth range from 0.6 to 80 m. A total of 16 ostracod species was identified from the lake with about half of the species restricted to the Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain ranges and poorly known in terms of ecological preferences, and the other half displaying a mainly Holarctic distribution. Living macrophytes and macroalgae were recorded in Lake Donggi Cona down to a depth of about 30 m, and bivalve (Pisidium cf. zugmayeri) and gastropod (Gyraulus, Radix) shells were found down to depths of 43 and 48 m, respectively. The ostracod-water-depth relationship was assessed by multivariate statistical analysis and ostracod-based transfer functions for water depth were constructed. Weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression provided the best model with a coefficient of determination r (2) of 0.91 between measured and ostracod-inferred water depth, a root mean square error of prediction of 8% and a maximum bias of 10.6% of the gradient length, as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. Our results show the potential of ostracods as palaeo-depth indicators in appropriate settings. However, transfer-function applications using fossil ostracod assemblages for palaeo-depth estimations require a thorough understanding of the palaeolimnological conditions of lakes and therefore detailed multi-proxy analysis to avoid misinterpretation of ostracod-based inferences.

AB  - 1. The influence of spatial structure on population dynamics within river-stream networks is poorly understood. Utilizing spatially explicit analyses of temporal genetic variance, we tested whether persistence of central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) reflects differences in habitat quality and location within a highly modified urban catchment in southwestern Ohio, U.S.A.
   2. Estimates of genetic diversity did not vary with habitat quality. Nevertheless, evidence of weak but temporally stable genetic structure, location-dependent effective population sizes and rates of immigration among sites, together suggest that persistence of central stonerollers within the catchment may be attributable to source-sink dynamics driven by habitat heterogeneity.
   3. Under this scenario, migrant-pool colonization from areas of relatively high habitat quality in the upper catchment sustains the presence of central stonerollers at degraded sites in the main stem and dampens population subdivision within the catchment. However, because intact habitat is restricted to the upper portion of the catchment, it is not possible to preclude net downstream dispersal as a mechanism contributing to source-sink dynamics. The slight genetic structure that persists appears to reflect weak isolation by distance diminished by high rates of immigration.
   4. This study suggests that without a systems perspective of the conditions that sustain populations in degraded waterways, environmental assessments may underestimate levels of impairment. Conservation and management of stream fishes could be improved by maintaining habitat in areas that are net exporters of migrants or by remediation of impaired habitat.

AB  - The US Navy Dome method for measuring copper release rates from antifouling paint in-service on ships' hulls can be considered to be the most reliable indicator of environmental release rates. In this paper, the relationship between the apparent copper release rate and the environmental release rate is established for a number of antifouling coating types using data from a variety of available laboratory, field and calculation methods. Apart from a modified Dome method using panels, all laboratory, field and calculation methods significantly overestimate the environmental release rate of copper from antifouling coatings. The difference is greatest for self-polishing copolymer antifoulings (SPCs) and smallest for certain erodible/ablative antifoulings, where the ASTM/ISO standard and the CEPE calculation method are seen to typically overestimate environmental release rates by factors of about 10 and 4, respectively. Where ASTM/ISO or CEPE copper release rate data are used for environmental risk assessment or regulatory purposes, it is proposed that the release rate values should be divided by a correction factor to enable more reliable generic environmental risk assessments to be made. Using a conservative approach based on a realistic worst case and accounting for experimental uncertainty in the data that are currently available, proposed default correction factors for use with all paint types are 5.4 for the ASTM/ISO method and 2.9 for the CEPE calculation method. Further work is required to expand this data-set and refine the correction factors through correlation of laboratory measured and calculated copper release rates with the direct in situ environmental release rate for different antifouling paints under a range of environmental conditions.

AB  - The use of parasites as biological tags allowed the identification of three stocks of Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi in the south-west Atlantic. A total of 344 fish caught in the Argentine-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, San Matias Gulf, San Jorge Gulf and Patagonian Shelf, were examined for parasites and 26 species were found. Univariate analysis on both parasite populations and infracommunity descriptors, as well as a discriminant analysis, allowed the identification of three separate stocks, one composed of hake from the Argentine-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, a second by fish from San Matias Gulf and a third comprising samples from both San Jorge Gulf and the Patagonian Shelf. Northern samples were characterized by low values of prevalence for most parasite species, with the exception of Corynosoma australe and Grillotia sp. 1. Among Patagonian hake, Anisakis simplex showed similar values of prevalence in all zones, fish from San Matias Gulf were characterized by Kudoa rosenbuschi, Grillotia sp. 1 and Contracaecum sp. Among all compared areas, San Jorge Gulf and the Patagonian Shelf were the most similar, sharing most of their biological indicators (Grillotia sp. 2. Pseudophyllidea sp. 1 plerocerci and Hysterothylacium aduncum); therefore, the hypothesis on the presence of a separate stock in San Jorge Gulf could not be confirmed. Varying environmental conditions and their influence on the distribution of both zooplankton and other hosts involved in the life-cycles of parasites could be determinant factors for the differences observed among hake stocks.

AB  - O-caffeoyltyrosine is a host recognition kairomone for Aphytis melinus DeBach (Aphelinidae) found in the covers of its host, California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Diaspidae). This study tests the hypothesis that the concentration of O-caffeoyltyrosine and scale cover size are reliable indicators of scale body size, an important component of host quality for A. melinus, over a range of scale rearing conditions. Both scale cover area and O-caffeoyltyrosine concentrations were only qualitatively related to scale body size during the third instar, the scale life stage most suitable for A. melinus. Scale cover area and O-caffeoyltyrosine concentrations were reduced, relative to scale body size, when scale were reared on bark and leaves compared to fruits. Scale cover area and O-caffeoyltyrosine concentration were also relatively reduced when scales were reared in mid-summer compared to spring and fall, and when reared on orange cultivars compared to lemon cultivars in the field. Finally, scale cover area and O-caffeoyltyrosine concentration were reduced when scale were reared at 52% compared to 100% humidity in the laboratory. Scales appear to be chemically conspicuous to A. melinus for a short period of the time in which they are physiologically susceptible. Scales that minimize their cover size and maximize the incorporation rate of O-caffeoyltyrosine into covers may minimize their conspicuousness to A. melinus. Minimizing scale cover size, but not necessarily incorporation rates, may make scales more vulnerable to predators, however.

AB  - Tatlarin dam lake is an important watershed of the Central Anatolia (Cappadocia) Region, which has experienced the effects of global warming on a large scale in recent years. The aim of this research is to investigate all the environmental factors involved in the pollution of the lake and to reveal the dam water quality comprehensively in terms of irrigation and other uses. In this context, the water quality of the dam under drought and eutrophic threat was evaluated integrated with multivariate statistical and spatial analysis. In addition, the current trophic status of the reservoir was determined. In the study, seasonal changes on the ecological structure were examined with national and international quality indeces, the trophic state index (TSI), and trophic level index (TLI). Field studies were conducted in the reservoir for four seasons (2017-2018), and the collected surface water samples were analyzed according to standard methods. The annual averages of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, which are indicators of excess nutrient input, were determined at 0.79, 3.91, 61.60, and 5.72 mg/L, respectively. The measurement results showed the presence of significant amounts of anthropogenic pollution throughout the lake. Periodic findings observed from distribution maps created with ArcGIS revealed significant changes in trophic level due to the effect of contaminated lake water and measures for reducing eutrophication should be taken rapidly.

AB  - Dryland ecosystems generally require active restoration to recover from severe land degradation caused by resource and energy extraction operations. While seeding remains one of the most used forms of active restoration, land managers in dryland systems have generally had difficulty re-establishing desirable plant communities, due in part to alterations in supporting ecosystem processes and the episodic nature of resource availability. In this study, we examined the impacts of site preparation, seeding, and livestock grazing on developing plant communities after the construction of a buried natural gas pipeline corridor in the southwestern United States. We monitored plant species cover and composition beginning with the second season of growth through the sixth. Analysis of each individual year show that conclusions from the initial year of data collection did not well represent the findings in the following years. The site preparation and topsoil treatment had an ongoing positive effect on richness and cover compared to the nearby baseline conditions, while seeding only further increased cover and richness in the first year of monitoring (second season of growth). However, without seeding, the plant communities were driven by ruderal, annual species, whereas the seeded plant communities were driven by desirable seeded perennial grasses and forbs. Grazing and trampling effects were not significant overall, and the effects of livestock may have been confounded with effects of small mammals due to the exclosure configuration. We suggest that the site preparation, topsoil treatment, and configuration linearity of the disturbance corridor allowed for high levels of natural recruitment.

AB  - Phenology is an important indicator of plant responses to environmental changes and is closely correlated with biomass production. However, how changes in phenological events affect plant biomass production when exposed to changing temperature and precipitation remain unclear.
   We conducted a 4-year manipulative experiment of warming and precipitation addition to explore phenology-biomass interactions under climate change in a dry alpine meadow on the central Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2015 to 2018.
   In dry and warm years, warming delayed phenology and precipitation addition advanced them. Warming decreased the biomass of Kobresia pygmaea in 2018 and the biomass of Poa pratensis in 2015, 2017 and 2018. However, precipitation addition significantly increased the biomass of Poa pratensis and Potentilla multifida in most of the experimental years. Phenological changes regulated the responses of biomass to treatments. Specifically, delay of green up of P. pratensis and delay of withering of K. pygmaea induced by warming can increase biomass production, but it can be offset by the direct negative effects of warming on biomass.
   Synthesis. Here we show how warming-induced drought tend to decrease the biomass production of graminoids and the negative effects of warming on the biomass of P. pratensis and K. pygmaea were partially offset by green up postponement and withering postponement respectively. Our results highlights phenology is a crucial regulator for biomass production under climate change. Hence, both direct and indirect effects of warming and precipitation addition on phenology and biomass cannot be ignored when predicting biomass responses to climate change.

AB  - Ciliates are key components of aquatic ecosystems, significantly contributing to the decomposition of organic matter and energy transfer to higher trophic levels. They are considered good biological indicators of chemical pollution and relatively sensitive to heavy metal contamination. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of the available toxicity data of heavy metals and ciliates to assess: (1) the sensitivity of freshwater ciliates to different heavy metals, (2) the relative sensitivity of ciliates in comparison to the standard test species used in ecotoxicological risk assessment, and (3) the difference in sensitivity across ciliate taxa. Our study shows that the tolerance of ciliates to heavy metals varies notably, which is partly influenced by differences in methodological conditions across studies. Ciliates are, in general, sensitive to Mercury > Cadmium > Copper > Zinc > Lead > Chromium. Also, this study shows that most ciliates are more tolerant to heavy metal pollution than the standard test species used in ecotoxicological risk assessments, i.e., Raphidocelis subcapitata, Daphnia magna, and Onchornyncus mykiss. Threshold concentrations derived from toxicity data for these species is expected to confer sufficient protection for the vast majority of ciliate species. Our data analysis also shows that the most commonly tested ciliate species, Paramecium caudatum and Tetrahymena thermophila, are not necessarily the most sensitive ones to heavy metal pollution. Finally, this study stresses the importance of developing standard toxicity test protocols for ciliates, which could lead to a better comprehension of the toxicological impact of heavy metals and other contaminants to ciliate species.

AB  - Root turnover time is jointly predicted by climate factors and soil properties in global grasslands with different vegetation types. Pasture availability is directly related to the belowground dynamics of soil conditions on spatial scales. However, few studies have examined whether pasture availability could be a spatial indicator of grassland root turnover time on a global scale. In the present study, geographically weighted regression (GWR) modelling, coupled with the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, was used to develop an indicator of root turnover time in global grasslands based on pasture availability. The results revealed a significant relationship between pasture availability and root turnover time in global grasslands. Furthermore, this relationship may depend on the type of vegetation and could be affected by animal grazing (including buffaloes, cattle, horses, goats, pigs, and sheep). Based on regression modelling, significantly positive relationships were detected between pasture availability and root turnover time for temperate grassland and meadows (P < 0.001) and tundra (P < 0.001) vegetation. These relationships were stronger for tundra (r(2) = 0.76; P < 0.001) when compared with the temperate grassland and meadow regions (r(2) = 0.25; P < 0.001). Taken together, the current study results showed that pasture availability could serve as a spatial indicator of root turnover time in global grasslands. Thus, I suggest the integration of pasture availability and animal grazing into prediction modelling of root turnover on spatial scales, and that there should be a focus on grazing management practices for future ecosystem monitoring.

AB  - Cloud computing offers developers of learning environments access to unprecedented amounts of learner data. This makes possible data-driven development (D-3) of learning environments. In the D-3 approach the learning environment is a data collection tool as well a learning tool. It continually collects data from interactions with learners, which is used in ongoing evaluation and iterative development. Iterative development cycles become very rapid, limited by the time required to analyze data and deploy system updates. D-3 is particularly relevant to fielded AIED systems that operate in uncontrolled conditions, where learners may behave in unexpected ways. This article presents two snapshot case studies in the data-driven development of Enskill((R)) English, a system for learning to speak English as a foreign language. In the first trial at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia two versions of Enskill English's dialogue system were tested simultaneously: the released version and a new version incorporating statistical natural language processing technology. A new version was released and data were collected from a second snapshot evaluation at the University of Split, Croatia. Data from learners in Latin America and Europe were analyzed for comparison. The evaluations provided preliminary evidence that Enskill English is helpful for learning spoken English skills, and leading indicators that learner performance improves through practice with Enskill English. They suggest that Enskill English can be extended to meet the needs of more advanced learners who wish to use English in a professional context. Broader recommendations for data-driven development of intelligent learning environments are presented.

AB  - Understanding processes that determine biodiversity is a fundamental challenge in ecology. At the landscape scale, physical alteration of ecosystems by organisms, called ecosystem engineering, enhances biodiversity worldwide by increasing heterogeneity in resource conditions and enhancing species coexistence across engineered and non-engineered habitats. Engineering-diversity relationships can vary along environmental gradients due to changes in the amount of physical structuring created by ecosystem engineering, but it is unclear how this variation is influenced by the responsiveness of non-structural abiotic properties to engineering. Here we show that environmental gradients determine the capacity for engineering to alter resource availability and species diversity, independent of the magnitude of structural change produced by engineering. We created an experimental rainfall gradient in an arid grassland where rodents restructure soils by constructing large, long-lasting burrows. We found that greater rainfall increased water availability and productivity in both burrow and inter-burrow habitats, causing a decline in local (alpha) plant diversity within both of these habitats. However, increased rainfall also resulted in greater differences in soil resources between burrow and inter-burrow habitats, which increased species turnover (beta diversity) across habitats and stabilized landscape-level (gamma) diversity. These responses occurred regardless of rodent presence and without changes in the extent of physical alteration of soils by rodents. Our results suggest that environmental gradients can influence the effects of ecosystem engineering in maintaining biodiversity via resource heterogeneity and species turnover. In an era of rapid environmental change, accounting for this interaction may be critical to conservation and management.

AB  - Managing the nonlethal effects of disturbance on wildlife populations has been a long-term goal for decision makers, managers, and ecologists, and assessment of these effects is currently required by European Union and United States legislation. However, robust assessment of these effects is challenging. The management of human activities that have nonlethal effects on wildlife is a specific example of a fundamental ecological problem: how to understand the population-level consequences of changes in the behavior or physiology of individual animals that are caused by external stressors. In this study, we review recent applications of a conceptual framework for assessing and predicting these consequences for marine mammal populations. We explore the range of models that can be used to formalize the approach and we identify critical research gaps. We also provide a decision tree that can be used to select the most appropriate model structure given the available data. Synthesis and applications: The implementation of this framework has moved the focus of discussion of the management of nonlethal disturbances on marine mammal populations away from a rhetorical debate about defining negligible impact and toward a quantitative understanding of long-term population-level effects. Here we demonstrate the framework's general applicability to other marine and terrestrial systems and show how it can support integrated modeling of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that regulate trait-mediated, indirect interactions in ecological communities, that is, the nonconsumptive effects of a predator or stressor on a species' behavior, physiology, or life history.

AB  - As proxies and indicators of environmental conditions, offshore benthic assemblages are pertinent to understanding global change. To investigate long-term change in epibenthic assemblages, we compared digitally reprocessed historical (1988) and repeat (2013) benthic survey photographs from nearshore (40-130 m) and interisland locations (140-500 m) at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands. Given changing interactions between regional oceanography and terrestrially influenced productivity at the islands, temporal change in the benthos is likely, and is expected to be dependent on proximity to the islands (nearshore vs. inter-island). Multivariate PERMANOVA analyses identified a significant interaction effect on epibenthic assemblages (Year 9 Location), with significant dispersion effects defining temporal differences within the inter-island region but not in the nearshore area. Differences in epibenthic assemblages observed between 1988 and 2013 were found to be driven primarily by increased abundances of several common suspension feeding taxa, including a significant increase in the density of a key bioengineering species, the polychaete Lanice marionensis. These higher abundances are congruent with local trophic evidence of long-term, climate-related shifts towards greater allochthonous food supply to the benthos. Given this congruence, a unifying explanation for the observed temporal differences in epibenthic assemblages is that long-term alteration of the position of the subAntarctic Front has changed the local primary productivity regime and hence the flux of food to the benthos. This study provides the first direct support for the notion of long-term change in epibenthic assemblage composition at the islands.

AB  - Tropical forest restoration is increasingly seen as an activity that may counteract or reduce biodiversity loss. However, few studies monitor fauna or consider measures of functional diversity to assess restoration success. We assessed the effect of a tropical montane forest restoration program on species and functional diversity, using amphibians as the target group. We compared amphibian assemblages in three types of land use: restoration areas, tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF; reference ecosystem) and cattle pastures (degraded ecosystem) in southern Mexico. We also described microclimate, microhabitat heterogeneity, woody vegetation structure and diversity for each type of land use, and their relationship to amphibian species and functional diversity. Compared to TMCF, restoration areas had similar environmental conditions. However, amphibian species richness was similar in the three types of land use and abundance was lower in the restoration areas. In TMCF, the amphibian assemblage was dominated by forest-specialist species, the pastures by generalist species, and the restoration areas by a combination of both species types. Interestingly, functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence did not vary with land use, though the number of functional groups in restoration areas and TMCF was slightly higher. Overall, the results suggest that after seven years, active restoration provided habitat heterogeneity and recovered woody vegetation capable of maintaining amphibian species and functional groups similar to those inhabiting TMCF. Forest fragments adjacent to restoration areas seem to facilitate fauna recolonization and this emphasizes the importance of the conservation of the reference ecosystems to achieving restoration success.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are widely used in Europe and worldwide to access ecological status of running waters. One of key goals of Water Framework Directive is to classify rivers and streams using biological quality elements and type specifi c reference conditions. According to system B which incorporates additional abiotic descriptors, there are 24 water types in Croatia. For biological analyses 92 rivers and streams with 140 sampling points were chosen and sampled for benthic diatoms and water chemistry simultaneously. Self organizing map (SOM) analysis was used to defi ne biotypes from species composition and abundance of benthic diatoms. Grouping of samples in SOM resulted in 10 distinctive groups. Based on their geographical position and site characteristics, groups represent sites with similar properties (as waterbed, catchment size, altitude, size of stream) belonging to different ecoregions in Croatia. Analysis of variance revealed statistically signifi cant differences (p<0.05) among SOM groups concerning ammonia, nitrates and total phosphorus. Indicator species analysis (IndVal) singled out species that were signifi cantly characteristic (p<0.05) for SOM and abiotic types. Compared to abiotic groups, in which 7 out of 24 have no indicator species, all SOM groups have one or several characteristic diatom species, thus indicating diatom assemblages as valuable site descriptors. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates analysis also indicated that SOM grouping of samples is statistically reliable. Grouping of similar sites, although placed into different abiotic types, makes SOM groups with its corresponding representative species an easy tool for water quality assessment and description of reference assemblage.

AB  - Many anthropogenic activities in the oceans involve direct contact with the seabed (for example pile driving), creating radiating particle motion waves. However, the consequences of these waveforms to marine organisms are largely unknown and there is little information on the ability of invertebrates to detect vibration, or indeed the acoustic component of the signal. We quantified sensitivity of the marine bivalve Mytilus edulis to substrate-borne vibration by exposure to vibration under controlled conditions. Sinusoidal excitation by tonal signals at frequencies within the range 5 to 410 Hz was applied during the tests, using the 'staircase' method of threshold determination. Thresholds were related to mussel size and to seabed vibration data produced by anthropogenic activities. Clear behavioural changes were observed in response to the vibration stimulus. Thresholds ranged from 0.06 to 0.55 m s(-2) (acceleration, root mean squared), with valve closure used as the behavioural indicator of reception and response. Thresholds were shown to be within the range of vibrations measured in the vicinity of anthropogenic operations such as pile driving and blasting. The responses show that vibration is likely to impact the overall fitness of both individuals and mussel beds of M. edulis due to disruption of natural valve periodicity, which may have ecosystem and commercial implications. The observed data provide a valuable first step to understanding the impacts of such vibration upon a key coastal and estuarine invertebrate which lives near industrial and construction activity, and illustrate that the role of seabed vibration should not be underestimated when assessing the impacts of noise pollution.

AB  - This study uses two remotely sensed vegetation indices to investigate cumulative long-term changes of undisturbed vegetation in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada, between 1984 and 2012. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI) were derived from both Landsat and MODIS time series, for comparative purposes and to increase confidence in detected trends. Trend analysis of undisturbed forest areas, i.e., area without abrupt changes revealed a consistent decrease in vegetation condition, quantified by an average reduction of 18.6% (SD = 5.02%) in NDVI and of 31.0% (SD = 10.06%) in NDWI, over the 28-year period. The study does not conclusively associate the trends with any single stressor, but seeks to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of cumulative effects resulting from a variety of natural and anthropogenic causes. Examination of the temporal pattern of trends showed an increase in the occurrence of decreasing trends in the last 10 years. The decreasing trends were more frequent closer to mining developments for both the Landsat and MODIS time series. Climate change was not considered a major causal factor as climate normalized trends had little effect on the results. The trend analysis undertaken can be used to enhance in situ monitoring programs for site selection of additional monitoring facilities particularly regarding potential cumulative effects, provide an indication of likely future short-term changes in the region, and to aid in the development of mitigation measures.

AB  - Tropical peatlands represent globally important carbon sinks with a unique biodiversity and are currently threatened by climate change and human activities. It is now imperative that proxy methods are developed to understand the ecohydrological dynamics of these systems and for testing peatland development models. Testate amoebae have been used as environmental indicators in ecological and palaeoecological studies of peatlands, primarily in ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in the mid- and high-latitudes. We present the first ecological analysis of testate amoebae in a tropical peatland, a nutrient-poor domed bog in western (Peruvian) Amazonia. Litter samples were collected from different hydrological microforms (hummock to pool) along a transect from the edge to the interior of the peatland. We recorded 47 taxa from 21 genera. The most common taxa are Cryptodifflugia oviformis, Euglypha rotunda type, Phryganella acropodia, Pseudodifflugia fulva type and Trinema lineare. One species found only in the southern hemisphere, Argynnia spicata, is present. Arcella spp., Centropyxis aculeata and Lesqueresia spiralis are indicators of pools containing standing water. Canonical correspondence analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling illustrate that water table depth is a significant control on the distribution of testate amoebae, similar to the results from mid- and high-latitude peatlands. A transfer function model for water table based on weighted averaging partial least-squares (WAPLS) regression is presented and performs well under cross-validation (r). The transfer function was applied to a 1-m peat core, and sample-specific reconstruction errors were generated using bootstrapping. The reconstruction generally suggests near-surface water tables over the last 3,000 years, with a shift to drier conditions at c. cal. 1218-1273 AD.

AB  - This paper presents the analysis of the advantages of applying the ISO 14001 system in an environmental protection management system. The environmental protection management system which is not licensed, i.e. compatible with the principles and standard pre-conditions, considerably increases the plausibility for ecological risk. There are some issues that remain to be solved in the areas which are not expressed by financial values only but also have a non-financial character with the aim of expanding markets, company image improvement and improvement of the environmental performance indicators. By improving a company's environmental management system efficiency we expect to achieve the minimization and elimination of damaging influences on the environment, which are the consequence of the company's activities. A case study in the Oil Refinery Belgrade (RNB) analyses the implementation of the standard ISO 14001:2004 into its environment protection management system, particularly emphasizing the company's own way of evaluating the environment aspects with the aim of establishing results of ecological performances indicators improvement. The average values of the first ecological indicator of the plant, the total amount of the waste waters in m(3) per a ton of pro-duct, clearly show the downturn trend, which is confirmed by the proportional reduction of the second ecological plant indicator, that is by the flocculants consumption (Al-2(SO4)(3) , Na2CO3) in kg per m(3) of the waste water of the RNB for the given period 2008-2010. Case study RNB confirms the improvement of environmental performances using the ISO 14001 standard.

AB  - Climate change can cause mismatches between the breeding phenology and peak abundance of food resources of migratory species. Moreover, asynchronously changing climate regimes across their ranges may constrain the ability of migratory species to adapt to all the regimes they encounter. To understand the potential effect of asynchronous changes, I examined the influences of both large- and local-scale weather and climate on the timing of arrival of two disjunct breeding populations of Hudsonian Godwits (Limosa haemastica). I used arrival data from two study sites-Beluga River, Alaska, and Churchill, Manitoba-combined with 37 years of weather and climate data from both winter and stopover sites and the breeding grounds. The Alaskan population now arrives similar to 9 days earlier than it did in the early 1970s, and the Churchill population arrives >10 days later. A model-selection process using linear regression models suggested that these divergent trends result from different suites of environmental factors affecting the timing of migration for the two populations. The cues used by the Alaskan population have remained reliable indicators of the timing of the onset of spring on their breeding grounds, but this is not the case for the Churchill population. Conflicting warming regimes in midcontinental North America cause the Churchill population to arrive later to their breeding grounds and limit their ability to properly time their breeding efforts. These results suggest that ecological and phenological limitations, not just evolutionary constraints, are critical to determining how populations respond to climate change.

AB  - To better understand the relation between coastal areas and their influence on social and economic conditions of municipalities, a set of indexes were developed to characterize coastal Mexico with an interdisciplinary approach. The composite of these bio-physical. social and economic indexes is referred to as an "integrated coastal orientation index". Coastal characteristics should be taken into account in the coastal management policy formulation of a given region, and this index can be used to identify key areas for environmental protection or economic development at a national level. The results suggest that municipalities must manage their coastal jurisdictions, a large and diverse array of coastal space and ecosystems, medium to weak spatial demographics and settlement structures, infrastructure to improve quality of life, an overall low coastal population income, and various coastal activities. Spatial heterogeneity along the littoral zone in the coastal orientation led us to conduct a state analysis. We discuss these values and identify five highly coastal-orientated states in the extremes of the country. The development of this tool could help to pin-point different types of key areas within the regions studied and provide a tool to guide regional priorities. As an example, using a combination of extreme values of bio-physical, social and economic indexes was used to identify specific municipalities as candidates for environmental protection and others as areas where development can continue. Choices of indexes are discussed, and the relative importance given to each component of the coastal orientation (rather bio-physical, social and/or economic) will define the course of the coast's development and its sustainability.

AB  - The focus of biodiversity conservation is shifting to larger spatial scales in response to habitat fragmentation and the need to integrate multiple landscape objectives. Conservation strategies increasingly incorporate measures to combat fragmentation such as ecological networks. These are often based on assessment of landscape structure but such approaches fail to capitalise on the potential offered by more ecologically robust assessments of landscape function and connectivity. In this paper, we describe a modelling approach to identifying functional habitat networks and demonstrate its application to a fragmented landscape where policy initiatives seek to improve conditions for woodland biodiversity including increasing woodland cover. Functional habitat networks were defined by identifying suitable habitat and by modelling connectivity using least-cost approaches to account for matrix permeability. Generic focal species (GFS) profiles were developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to represent species with high and moderate sensitivity to fragmentation. We demonstrated how this form of analysis can be used to aid the spatial targeting of conservation actions. This 'targeted' action scenario was tested for effectiveness against comparable scenarios, which were based on random and clumped actions within the same landscape. We tested effectiveness using structural metrics, network-based metrics and a published functional connectivity indicator. Targeting actions within networks resulted in the highest mean woodland area and highest connectivity indicator value. Our approach provides an assessment of landscape function by recognising the importance of the landscape matrix. It provides a framework for the targeting and evaluation of alternative conservation options, offering a pragmatic, ecologically-robust solution to a current need in applied landscape ecology.

AB  - Transport is an economic activity having complex interactions with the environment, and since the concept of sustainable development was identified as a global priority, there has been a growing interest in assessing the performance of transport systems with respect to sustainability issues Although the Ecological Economics literature deals extensively with the strategy of sustainable development, far less attention has been paid to its application in the transport sector as of yet The main purpose of this study was to introduce the noncompensatory analytical tool, which integrates multidimensional conditions present in the sustainability concept The focus was on the potential of the outranking approach, namely the ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite, Elimination And Choice Corresponding to Reality) method for the evaluation of transport sustainability at the macro level, using the indicator set as a starting point The method has been applied to selected European countries within a case study As a result, according to transport-sustainability issues, pairwise relations between countries have been established Based on these relations, and according to the chosen criteria, a set of countries with a better level of performance was selected as the core subset of the relation graph. To control and avoid the appearance of indifference relations between countries, as well as to reduce the subjectivity of decision makers, we propose a modification of ELECTRE I Finally, we apply both the original and the modified methods, together with the sensitivity analysis The results are presented in a convenient graph form and then compared (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Soil acidity and lack (or disbalance) of nutrients are pedochemical conditions which have a restrictive impact on root growth and development in humid areas. There is good correspondence between exchangeable cations and the soil pH value ratio. The phytosequence of the herbaceous layer in Central European beech forests is determined by a fall in pH values and exchangeable Ca(++) ion concentrations. There are several important species of herbaceous vegetation in this phytosequence.
   Materials and Methods: Phytocoenological relives were taken and the soil in the surface layer at a depth of 10 cm was analyzed (pH, basic cations, total nitrogen) in two forest areas in the eastern (BE) and western (B W) part of Mt. Bilogora.
   Results: The total range of pH values is 4.28-5.94. The populations (BW and BE) differ in terms of pH values, total nitrogen, and the overall number of species in the herbaceous layer as well as with regard to 6 individual species. Correlation between the measured pedological parameters was established for 12 plant species in the herbaceous layer.
   Conclusions: From the phytocoenological aspect, the most significant pedological parameters were pH values and the total nitrogen content, Ca(++) and Mg(++). The indicator level was confirmed by the species Mercurialis perennis and Lathyrus vernus, while test results that related to the species Asarum europaeum and Festuca drymeia should be tested on a larger sample. Future research should also include iron and aluminum ions, as well as the role of the genus Tilia in the biological cycle of matter in a forest ecosystem.

AB  - 1. Measures of trait variability, in particular fluctuating asymmetry (FA), have been proposed as biological tools for monitoring environmental quality, but relevant data are often collected under artificial conditions and it can be difficult to separate genetic and environmental factors. We considered a number of trait variability measures for potential use as indicators in field grapevines exposed to salt stress.
   2. Vine responses to a salt gradient were compared using two measures of developmental stability (DS). DS quantifies an organisms' ability to buffer developmental noise. The two measures of DS tested were leaf FA, representing random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry, and translational asymmetry (TA), representing deviations in allometric relationships, in this case the relationship between internode distance and node order. Leaf size (measured as centroid size), leaf shape (calculated using the Procrustes method) and maximum internode length were also tested for sensitivity to salinity.
   3. We found that both measures of DS, FA and TA, failed to identify salinity stress in grapevines. Other measures, such as maximum internode length, leaf shape and leaf size, were sensitive to salt stress.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Often, salinity stress is detected only when the impact is harmful enough to cause severe biological effects. Alternative, more sensitive monitoring techniques would allow earlier intervention and management of the problem. We evaluated a number of techniques and showed that indices of bilateral and TA were not useful in detecting salt stress in grapevines. However, changes in internode length, leaf size and leaf shape proved to be sensitive and are potential tools for monitoring salinity in vineyards.

AB  - Relationships between snow cover and atmospheric dynamics are difficult To isolate because of the complex nature of their interaction. While regional snow lover patterns can be altered radically by a single cyclonic event, the presence or absence of terrestrial snow covet can also greatly influence passing weather systems. A consistent time series of snow cover data, coveting an extensive spatial area, at a synoptically sensitive temporal resolution is therefore required to examine potential relationships between surface snow conditions and atmospheric variables. Snow water Equivalent (SWE) derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave data fits these requirements because of all weather imaging capabilities, broad spatial resolution, wide swath width, and frequent revisit time. The applicability of these data to examining relationships between snow cover and atmospheric dynamics is evaluated in this paper through a comparative study of two winter seasons currently available in rite appropriate grid format: December, January and February (DJF) 1988/89 and 1989/90. Five-day average (pentad) SWE imagery derived from SSM/I brightness temperatures using the Atmospheric Environment Service's (AES) dual channel algorithm is analyzed along with gridded National Meteorological Center (NMC, now National Center for Environmental Prediction, NCEP) atmospheric data. Principal components analysis is used to isolate within variable relntionships, while time lagged cross correlation analysis is used to identify between variable relationships. Results indicate that both these data and the methodology show great potential for developing an SWE/atmospheric climatology, although integration of a wet snow indicator, also developed by AES, would strengthen the snow cover product. Further discussion regarding the future use of SSM/I derived SWE data for studying snow cover/atmospheric interaction is also presented.

AB  - Habitat degradation, mostly caused by human impact, is one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. This is a global problem, causing a decline in the number of pollinators, such as hoverflies. In the process of digitalizing ecological studies in Serbia, remote-sensing-based land cover classification has become a key component for both current and future research. Object-based land cover classification, using machine learning algorithms of very high resolution (VHR) imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was carried out in three different study sites on Mt. Stara Planina, Eastern Serbia. UAV land cover classified maps with seven land cover classes (trees, shrubs, meadows, road, water, agricultural land, and forest patches) were studied. Moreover, three different classification algorithms-support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-NN (k-nearest neighbors)-were compared. This study shows that the random forest classifier performs better with respect to the other classifiers in all three study sites, with overall accuracy values ranging from 0.87 to 0.96. The overall results are robust to changes in labeling ground truth subsets. The obtained UAV land cover classified maps were compared with the Map of the Natural Vegetation of Europe (EPNV) and used to quantify habitat degradation and assess hoverfly species richness. It was concluded that the percentage of habitat degradation is primarily caused by anthropogenic pressure, thus affecting the richness of hoverfly species in the study sites. In order to enable research reproducibility, the datasets used in this study are made available in a public repository.

AB  - Urban resilience to natural disasters has constantly been a challenge to sustainable development in human societies. Since Iran is always exposed to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, it is necessary to address novel approaches to deal with these disasters. The use of urban land and its characteristics in each city is one of the most important indicators related to urban resilience. The Manba Ab neighborhood is one of the most disorderly neighborhoods in Ahvaz city. Considering human perspective (inappropriate social construction), natural (adjacent to the only fault of Ahvaz city and the presence of unevenness in the area), physical and the built environment (improper proportions of land uses and road network; the proximity to large-scale industrial land uses) the city has an unsustainable condition that makes the resilience improvements in the area inevitable. This research aims to assess the resilience of the Manba Ab neighborhood against one of the most critical disasters, namely earthquakes. The paper is an applied descriptive-analytical, and collected data are analyzed in the GIS using algorithms in the ANP model, and Super Decision software. Obtained results show that about 45% of the Manba Ab neighborhood have low resilience against earthquakes due to fine-grained fabrics, low width of the passages, unsuitable building skeleton, deficiency in urban green spaces, and deficiency in relief services land uses. In this regard, land use planning is an essential tool in promoting earthquake resilience in neighborhoods. Identifying vulnerable areas of neighborhoods and reducing factors of neighborhood vulnerability can be very effective in earthquake resilience.

AB  - Purpose A major challenge faced by West Africa is to find comfortable housing as a result of climate change and population growth. The climatic adaptation of buildings and their indoor environment become an essential condition for maintaining the health and productivity of the occupants. This paper proposes a model to assess the thermal comfort of naturally ventilated buildings in hot and dry climates in Burkina Faso. Design/methodology/approach The proposed method is an adaptive model which relies on a combination of parameters such as the operative temperature, the new effective temperature and the basic parameters of thermal comfort. It consists in proposing the zones of thermal comfort on the diagram of the humid air for each climatic region. Findings A decision-making tool is set up for evaluating the comfort of buildings to better consider the bio-climatic concept through a long-term comfort index. This comfort index is defined and is used to assess the degree of thermal discomfort for various types of housing. Two natural ventilation pilot buildings located in Ouagadougou were considered. The results show that the pilot building whose wall are is made of Earth blocks achieves 26.4% of thermal comfort while the building made of hollow cement block achieves 25.8% of thermal comfort. Originality/value The decision-making tool proposed in the present study allow building stakeholders to better and easily design, assess and improve the thermal environment of buildings.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the conversion of biomass to biofuels, energy, and chemicals due to an increase in meeting environmental demands and price and decrease in the potential availability of crude oil. Among the biofuels postulated as viable alternatives due to their physicochemical characteristics is butanol. Given its high energy content, it is projected as a potential substitute for ordinary gasoline. However, butanol production process through fermentation of lignocellulosic material has shown some disadvantages. Another way of producing butanol is by reduction of volatile fatty acids (from waste streams of organic matters) with hydrogen. An effluent with a high content of water and butanol is obtained. In that sense, thermodynamic interactions make the separation process challenging. On the other hand, current policies and needs have guided the proposals for chemical processes to meet various sustainability metrics, for example, high profit margins and low environmental impact, with inherent safety and robust operation in the presence of disturbances. With this in mind, this work proposes purification schemes to obtain butanol of high purity, from a butanol-water mixture, in the compositions generated by reduction of volatile fatty acids, using pervaporation, pressure swing distillation, and azeotropic distillation. Comparing the results obtained, the pervaporation scheme turned out to be the most promising alternative as it presents reductions in all the "green" indicators (compared to the other purification alternatives) in percentages between 27 and 52%. The general indices for such alternative were 0.0392 ($/kg(butanol)), 0.0066 (ecopoints/kg(butanol)), 8274, 2.772 x 10(-04) (probability/year), and 0.4281 $/kg(butanol) regarding the total annual cost, ecological indicator 99, condition number, individual risk, and minimum selling price, respectively.

AB  - Twenty-five years after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force, what impact has it had on the US-Mexico border environment? This paper asks what lessons NAFTA offers to contemporary debates about trade and environmental governance through analysis of time series data and expert perceptions on the environment of the US-Mexico borderlands. In the early 1990s, scholars and activists argued that NAFTA would have mostly negative impacts on the US-Mexico border, creating water scarcity and increasing air, land and water pollution; degrading ecosystems; and causing health problems. The debate over NAFTA was part of the larger discussion on the environmental impacts of trade and globalization. In response to these concerns, several governance institutions were created to monitor the environment (the Commission for Environmental Cooper-ation) and to certify and fund improvements to environmental infrastructure along the US-Mexico border (the Border Environment Cooperation Commission and North American Development Bank). NAFTA was recently replaced with a new trade deal (the USMCA). In this paper we review trends in environmental conditions over the past 25 years, mostly on the Mexican side of the border where greater impacts were anticipated, through datasets, institutional reports and scholarly literature. We also present and discuss the results of semi-structured interviews and surveys with 49 experts (researchers, activists, government personnel, and other border insti-tutional actors) to understand the varied legacy of NAFTA on the border environment at 25 years. Although missing data and challenges in attribution complicated our analysis, we found both positive and negative trends in environmental indicators and the literature.

AB  - The effects of fullerenol nanopriming (0, 10, 40, 80 and 120 nM concentration) on salt stressed-wheat (0 and 150 mM NaCl) were investigated under natural conditions. Salinity resulted in a shift in wheat growth pattern in the form of LAR (+ 40.9% increase) and RGR (+ 13.4% increase) while decreased NAR (- 31.7%). It also disturbed shoot and root biomass, ion uptake and reduced chlorophyll contents. Despite increase in enzyme activities, higher ROS generation (+ 48.1% O-2(-) anion; and + 62.2% H2O2) and lipid peroxidation (+ 40.8% MDA) were detected in salt-stressed wheat plants. Possibly, the increases in enzyme activities were not up to the level to completely counteract the salinity induced oxidative stress. Nanopriming with fullerenol improved NAR (+ 8.77% to 23.2%), ROS metabolism and decreased indicators of oxidative stress. Hydropriming treatment also promoted NAR recovery by 21.9% than control plants. Compared to Na+ ions, improvements in shoot relative concentrations of K+, Ca2+ and P also recorded along with soluble sugars and amino acids, which improved osmotic balance. These biochemical modifications contributed to improvements in grain yield attributes (+11.8% to 18.3% in 100 grain-weight) than salinity stressed control. Hydropriming also contributed to a recovery in grain yield attributes by 12.6%. Above all, the harvested seeds from fullerenol treated plants also showed better germination and seedlings growth traits. Conclusively, we report non-toxic, growth-promoting effects of fullerenol nanoparticles on wheat crop and as a way forward; we suggest its exogenous application to recover crop productivity under saline environments.

AB  - Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) could be a decisive game-changer for the development of household solid waste management (e.g., reduce waste in landfills). However, in a nascent household waste management (HSWM) system, which is characterized by divergent interest groups ranging from the national government, municipalities, waste pickers and householders as providers of waste, implementing MBTs could create positive but also adverse impacts, in particular on waste pickers (WPs). Formal WPs are in cities, like Belo Horizonte (Brazil), a constituent part of the HSWM. This study builds strategies as a form of normative scenarios to assist decision-making processes to deal with WPs and implement MBTs systems. The present study includes material and energy flows, life cycle environmental impacts and social indicators characterized by the number of active WPs and capacity building. The results show that an integrated commitment of the local society can reduce landfilling by 70% and global warming emissions to a quarter. An emphasis on greenhouse gas emissions, like Belo Horizonte's promise for long-term attitude, brings a broad commitment to developing HSWM since a functioning system based on focused strategies will consequently reflect a positive action on climate. Waste pickers can fulfill the estimated vacancies at MBT plants and promote their active life or not according to the capacity building. MBT has substantial room to grow. Therefore, this growth will only happen with new thoughts on the adaptability of MBT systems focused on sufficiency to secure fair conditions for local livelihoods and targets with systemic implications.

AB  - Marine sediment is the final sink of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from river input and atmospheric deposition. Such kind of pollutant cycles in the marine environment is usually controlled by hydrodynamic conditions. Many previous studies have explored how ocean currents influence pollutant distribution, but very few studies have focused on the relationships between the distribution patterns of pollutant and residual currents or sediment transport. In this study, 16 monomers of PAHs from 135 surface sediment samples collected in the Hangzhou Bay, a typical macrotidal bay, were systematically identified and their sources were analyzed. The sediment characteristics and distribution pattern were also comprehensively analyzed. The results showed the seabed sediments were moderately polluted by PAHs with a level of 38.58-1371.06 ng/g (median 186.70 ng/g). Most of the PAHs are composed of three to five rings, originated from combustion of coal and firewood. The combustion of oil also contributes to PAHs in seabed sediments for some areas. The PAHs are found to be concentrated within the estuary and the offshore areas, as well in coastal ocean. Fine-grained sediment transport is controlled by residual currents, which leads to PAH accumulation in the bay and the offshore areas, forming a high-value distribution pattern. Hence, we conclude that residual current is the main factors that control the long-term distribution of PAHs in the seabed sediments of the macrotidal bay. Temporal and spatial varying models of PAHs were needed in a further study to explore further the mechanisms how PAHs are transported in coastal areas.

AB  - To investigate whether there is a nexus between the microbial diversity level (taxonomic, functional and ecological) and the stress tolerance potential of the microbial community, the impact of different ammonium sources was evaluated. Therefore reactors adapted either to the anaerobic digestions of sugar beet silage or maize silage (SBS/MS) were supplemented with animal manure (M) or ammonium carbonate (A).
   The results showed that increasing concentrations of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) were not the only reason for community changes: the bacterial community in the reactors given animal manure became more similar over time compared to the reactors given ammonium carbonate. However, this study revealed that a bacterial community with a few dominant members led to a functional more flexible archaeal community (SBS reactors) which was more stress resistant under the experimental conditions. This indicates that a higher functional diversity within a certain part of the community, in the present study the archaeal community, is one important factor for process stability due to a higher tolerance to increasing amounts of process-inhibiting metabolites such as TAN. Compared to this a bacterial community with higher amount of more evenly distributed community members combined with a more rigid archaeal community (MS reactors) showed a lower stress tolerance potential.
   Moreover it was observed that the disappearance of members of the phylum Cloacimonetes can be used as an indicator for an upcoming process disturbance due to increasing TAN concentrations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial structure of the habitat for plant communities based on soil functions in virgin forest-steppe of the Central Russian Upland is the focus of this study. The objectives include the identification of the leading factors of soil function variety and to determine the spatial heterogeneity of the soil function. A detailed topographic survey was carried out on a key site (35 hectares), 157 soil, and 34 geobotanical descriptions were made. The main factor of soil and plant cover differentiation is the redistribution of soil moisture along the microrelief. Redistributed runoff value was modelled in SIMWE and used as a tool for spatial prediction of soils due to their role in a habitat for plant communities' functional context. The main methods of the study are the multidimensional scaling and discriminant analysis. We model the composition of plant communities (accuracy is 95%) and Reference Soil Group (accuracy is 88%) due to different soil moisture conditions. There are two stable soil habitat types: mesophytic communities on the Phaeozems (with additional water runoff more than 80 mm) and xerophytic communities on Chernozems (additional runoff less than 55 mm). A transitional type corresponded to xero- mesophytic communities on the Phaeozems with 55-80 mm additional redistributed runoff value. With acceptable accuracy, the habitat for natural plant communities based on soil function model predicts the position of contrastingly different components of biota in relation to their soil moisture requirements within the virgin forest-steppe of the Central Russian Upland.

AB  - Domestic and imported biomass or biofuels used for energy purposes play an important role in many future energy scenarios and national policies. But both the realizable potential for biomass and the environmental consequences of its deployment for energy can be controversial. The aim of this study is to identify environmentally-optimal strategies for bioenergy, considering domestic biomass resource availability, the full energy system context, and a consequential life cycle perspective. We apply our approach to the case of Switzerland and three alternative energy scenarios for the year 2035, and compare the environmentally-optimal strategies obtained over several single-issue and one fully-aggregated impact indicator. From the optimal solutions, we analyze substrate-specific (i.e., per biomass resource type) marginal impacts of biomass supply and the influences of boundary conditions imposed on biomass use by the different future energy scenarios. Minimizing impacts on global warming, cumulative fossil energy demand, and the Swiss ecological scarcity method leads to near-complete utilization of sustainably-available biomass resources, whereas less biomass is deployed when optimizing for particulate matter formation, land use (biodiversity loss), and water footprint. The results suggest that increased deployment of energy wood (excluding forest wood apt for material applications) and manures would be environmentally beneficial. In contrast, substrates suitable for animal feeding should not be used for energy purposes due to the burdens associated with increasing the demand for conventional feed-stuffs. The findings and case-specific recommendations illustrate the importance of considering a holistic environmental perspective, alongside techno-economic restrictions to the physical biomass potential, when establishing national (bio-)energy policies.

AB  - Climate change and its impacts are the biggest environmental problems the world is facing in recent decades. Climate-sensitive events have already been critical obstacles of poverty reduction and sustainable economic development. Assessing how climate change affects poverty reduction is of great significance to the comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts on social economy and mitigation of its negative impacts. With geo-spatially referenced malnutrition and infant mortality data as a proxy for poverty, focusing on the aspects of agriculture and human well-being that consist of physical health and personal autonomy. This study selects three countries, China, India and Senegal, to investigate the impacts of climate change on poverty reduction. Contrast to previous work when analyze climate changes' impacts most concentrated on coastal urban areas, this paper is focused more on the rural poor areas and conduct a contrastive analysis of different income groups of countries. The correlation analysis results show the same is that the indicators of climate change are in significant correlations with indicators of poverty and that of agriculture and human well-being in China, India and Senegal. However, China performs poorly in terms of personal autonomy, while Senegal performs well, the correlations of forest area percentage (one indicator of climate change) with other variables in Senegal are absolutely opposite to that in China and India. We find the same influence factors have different effects on poverty reduction in these countries, the anti-poverty policies should be made according to local conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lake Baikal (Siberia, Russia) is the oldest, the deepest and the most voluminous lake on Earth. During the last century, Baikal has experienced gradual increases in temperature but remains highly oligotrophic with increases in primary productivity limited to the warmest parts of the lake. Using whole body RNA:DNA ratio as an indicator of metabolic rate, we demonstrate that the key primary consumer in Baikal's plankton, Epischura baikalensis (Copepoda: Calanoida), is a capital breeder that relies on lipid storage to maintain productivity. In individuals from nature, the RNA:DNA ratio correlated with lipid content in samples from cold, low phytoplankton density locations from Baikal's North and Central basins, but not in samples from warmer South basin and Maloe More strait. Lipid reserves, both visually assessed and measured by Nile Red fluorescence, correlated positively with phytoplankton density. In laboratory experiments the RNA:DNA ratio responded to starvation and temperature in non-reproducing, low lipid storage females, but not in individuals with developed ovaries or high lipid storage. This indicates that, unlike many other zooplanlcton crustaceans, E. baikalensis uses resource storage to support current reproduction, which buffers the dependency of metabolic rate on current feeding conditions. We discuss possible effects of such buffering on E. baikalensis competition with non-endemic, largely income-feeding zoo plankton species whose frequency is currently increasing in Baikal pelagia.

AB  - Global freshwater biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates while non-native species are expanding. Examining diversity patterns across variable river conditions can help develop better management strategies. However, many indicators can be used to determine the conservartion value of aquatic communities, and little is known of how well they correlate to each other in making diagnostics, including when testing for the efficacy of protected areas. Using an extensive data set (99,700 km(2), n = 530 sites) across protected and unprotected river reaches in 15 catchments of NE Spain, we examine correlations among 20 indicators of conservation value of fish communities, including the benefits they provide to birds and threatened mammals and mussels. Our results showed that total native fish abundance or richness correlated reasonably well with many native indicators. However, the lack of a strong congruence led modelling techniques to identify different river attributes for each indicator of conservation-value. Overall, tributaries were identified as native fish refugees, and nutrient pollution, salinization, low water velocity and poor habitat structure as major threats to the native biota. We also found that protected areas offered limited coverage to major components of biodiversity, including rarity, threat and host-parasite relationships, even though values of non-native indicators were notably reduced. In conclusion, restoring natural hydrological regimes and water chemical status is a priority to stem freshwater biodiversity loss in this region. A complementary action can be the protection of tributaries, but more studies examining multiple components of diversity are necessary to fully test their potential as fluvial reserves in Mediterranean climate areas.

AB  - Airborne bacteria and fungi are important biological components of bioaerosol and play an important role in the conservation environmental. A microbiological study on bioaerosoles was carried out at the Municipal Waste Utilization Plant in Northern Poland and at points located beyond the facility at the distance of 150, 450, 1000 and 1250 m. The highest emission of bioaerosol occurred in the area of the waste landfill site and during compost pile turning. The total number of mesophilic bacteria, filamentous fungi and actinomycetes reached the values up to 104 CFU/m(3). Strong air contamination with mannitolpositive and mannitol-negative staphylococci occurred remarkably more frequently in the area of the test facility than in the points beyond it. The number of indicator bacteria of Pseudomonas fluorescens was quite changeable and did not depend on a distance from pollutant emission source. The number of Escherichia coli rods remained at the low level of about 102 CFU/m3, and they were only isolated sporadically in the points beyond the landfill. The highest percentage of bacterial aerosol comprised Gram-positive cocci, and then Gram-positive bacilli. Mycological analyses confirmed the presence in the studied air of fungi with potentially allergic and mycotoxinogenic properties, such as: Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, A. terreus, Cladosporium herbarum and the genus Fusarium. The concentration level of microbial bioaerosol several times exceeded the threshold values recommended by the Polish Standards. The factors influenced the concentration of microorganisms in the tested air included the distance of the active landfill, weather conditions and the season.

AB  - Understanding the nanomaterial potential to the food conversion of two food chain levels is important in the ecosystem assessment as manufactured nanomaterials are being released into the environment. In this investigation, the food conversion from Daphnia magna (D. magna) (prey) to Danio rerio (D. rerio) (predator) was used as the study object of aqueous stable fullerene nanocrystals (nC(60)). Accumulated nC(60) of D. magna was determined as the nominal initial exposure concentration for D. rerio. The results of 21-d dietary exposure experiment demonstrate that nC(60) in D. magna decreased the body weight growths and condition factors of D. rerio, and reduced the food conversion ratio by 20% (from D. magna to D. rerio). Further, the experiments present that nC(60) decrease three digestive enzymes activities of trypsinase, lipase, and amylase by 30, 29, and 55% in vivo, and by 60, 90, and 42% in vitro, respectively. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that nC(60) was involved with the decrements of digestive enzymes activities. These decrements in digestive enzymes activities may be due to the deactivation caused by the adsorption of nC(60) particles onto the surface or active center of digestive enzymes. Sum up, these results not only describe the nC(60) deleterious effects on the food conversion from D. magna to D. rerio, but also provide some information regarding a probable food conversion inhibition mechanism of nC(60).

AB  - Black shales contain high concentrations of trace elements, which may be liberated to the environment as a result of natural weathering and, potentially, during shale gas development and future mining of black shales for extraction of shale oil. The Sunbury Shale is one of the youngest units making up the thick Devonian and Mississippian black shale sequence in the Appalachian Basin. This study compares the trace element geochemistry of samples collected from two exposures of Sunbury Shale located <8 km apart in northeastern Kentucky, one a fresh excavation, the second, a roadcut exposed for 50 years, wherein the shale was visibly weathered. Core samples obtained from sites similar to 40 km NE and similar to 60 km SW of the exposures were also analyzed. The 50-year period of surface weathering resulted in significant loss of some trace elements, particularly Mn and elements associated with sulfides (e.g., Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn). It is expected that Mn would be maintained in its soluble reduced form in the presence of sulfides and our results suggest Mn is a particularly sensitive indicator of weathering in carbonate-poor black shales. The relative immobility of As, Sb, and Se, also found in sulfides, reflects preferential sorption of oxyanions under the locally acidic conditions resulting from sulfide oxidation. Leaching experiments show waters in contact with the shale may, nonetheless, acquire concentrations of As and Se well in excess of water quality standards. No significant differences were found in the concentrations of Cr, Mo, or V that are associated with refractory phases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Around 20 progestins (also called gestagens, progestogens, or progestagens) are used today in assisting a range of medical conditions from endometrial cancer to uterine bleeding and as an important component of oral contraception. These progestins can bind to a wide range of receptors including progestin, estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptor, as well as sex hormone and corticosteroid binding globulins. It appears that only five of these (four synthetic and one natural) progestins have so far been studied in sewage effluent and surface waters. Analysis has reported values as either nondetects or low nanograms per liter in rivers. Seven of the progestins have been examined for their effects on aquatic vertebrates (fish and frogs). The greatest concern is associated with levonorgestrel, norethisterone, and gestodene and their ability to reduce egg production in fish at levels of 0.81.0 ng/L. The lack of environmental measurements, and some of the contradictions in existing values, however, hampers our ability to make a risk assessment. Only a few nanograms per liter of ethynodiol diacetate and desogestrel in water would be needed for fish to receive a human therapeutic dose for these progestins according to modeled bioconcentration factors. But for the other synthetic progestins levels would need to reach tens or hundreds of nanograms per liter to achieve a therapeutic dose. Nevertheless, the wide range of compounds, diverse receptor targets, and the effect on fish reproduction at sub-nanogram-per-liter levels should prompt further research. The ability to impair female reproduction at very low concentrations makes the progestins arguably the most important pharmaceutical group of concern after ethinylestradiol.

AB  - Surface sediments in different ecosystems (lake, river, reservoir, estuary and wetland) in Eastern China were extracted with NaOH-EDTA, and the extracts were analyzed by P-31-NMR to reveal the phosphorus (P) species distribution. The P release risk was also assessed by sorption experiments. The river sediments accumulated significant amounts of P compared with other sediments. The organic phosphorus (Po) concentration in the estuarine sediment was lower than that in other sediments. Two P compounds classes (phon-P and mono-P) and five P compounds were detected in the sediments. Ortho-P (83.3-97.6%) was the dominant P compounds and mono-P (1.1-18.0%) were the dominant Po compounds classes, while smaller amounts of DNA-P (0-4.1%), pyro-P (0-4.0%) and lipid-P (0-0.8%) were found in the surface sediment. Poly-P and phon-P were detected only in site 11 (wetland), site 10 (wetland) and 11, respectively. The ERI values, as a measure of eutrophication risk, were different in the various sediments, being greater than 25% in sites 1 (river), 3 (estuary) and 4 (estuary), and with values of 26, 59 and 83%, respectively. The Xm and ERI values fitted a power function (RXm-ERI = 0.89, p<0.01) and a positive correlation between Xm and OM in the sediment (RXm-OM = 0.84, p<0.01) indicated that the chemical-physical conditions play a vital role in controlling P sorption and desorption.

AB  - In Brazil, the state of So Paulo contains both preserved areas (Jur,ia-Itatins Ecological Station) and extremely impacted ones (Cubato Municipality). This study evaluated the concentrations of five metals (Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Hg) in two mangroves with different levels of anthropogenic impact and the apparent genotoxicity to Ucides cordatus. Water and sediment samples were obtained, and metal concentrations were determined with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The genotoxic impact was quantified based on the number of micronucleated cells per 1,000 analyzed (MNaEuro degrees), using hemolymph slides stained with Giemsa. Metal concentrations in water were below the detection limit, except for lead, although no significant difference was observed between the areas (P > 0.05). Sediment from Cubato had higher concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cr, and Cu than sediment from Jur,ia-Itatins (P < 0.05), but no significant differences in metal concentrations were detected among depth strata of the sediment (P > 0.05). Crabs from Cubato had a 2.6 times higher mean frequency of micronucleated cells (5.2 +/- 1.8 MNaEuro degrees) than those from Jur,ia-Itatins (2.0 +/- 1.0 MNaEuro degrees; P < 0.0001). The more-polluted conditions found in the mangrove sediments of Cubato were reflected in the micronucleus assay, demonstrating their genotoxic effect; however, genetic damage should be attributed to a synergistic effect with other kinds of pollutants previously recorded in different environments of Cubato. U. cordatus proved to be an excellent bioindicator of mangrove pollution. This study established, for the first time, the normal frequency of MNaEuro degrees in a population of this species within an ecological station.

AB  - The pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) is one of the most endangered neotropical mammals in Uruguay. Although it has a wide geographic distribution in south-eastern South America (from 5 degrees S to 41 degrees S), the habitat required by this species has been greatly reduced by agriculture and urbanisation. The species decline was due to human activities, and currently two isolated populations survive. The parasitological load is a good indicator of the health of the species and the ecosystem. The objective of the present study was to survey and determine the parasitological composition of the two Uruguayan pampas deer populations. We quantified the coproparasite load, by analysing the effect of seasonality through the year, the micro-ecosystem environment, the topography and also the livestock of the paddock. The taxonomic assessment was based on adult individuals obtained from the post mortem necropsy examination in individuals found dead in the field. The genera of the endoparasites recorded through the morphological eggs, larvae and/or adults were Trichuris, Capillaria, Strongyloides, Fasciola, Paramphistomum, Moniezia, Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Trichostrongylus, Oesophagostomum and Coccidias ooquiste. Our results showed that the parasitological community in the pampas deer is strongly correlated with the environmental conditions, topology, micro-ecosystem and the land use, as well as the effect of the livestock load. Moreover, because we have diagnosed the same genera of helminths in domestic ruminants, we recommend balancing the carrying capacities of the field paddocks, and performing periodical surveys of the livestock parasite load that will be helpful in maintaining control at lower values.

AB  - Knowledge concerning permafrost distribution in the Alps is an important prerequisite to estimate potential developments caused by climate change. An assessment of natural hazards or the creation of risk maps in high alpine catchments very often requires the consideration of potential permafrost occurrence. The present study for the first time shows a high resolution and index based permafrost distribution for the region Hohe Tauern (approx. 4400 km(2)), which is based on the empirical model PERMAKART 3.0. The approach integrates three different relief classes (rock walls, steep slopes, foot slope position) in a topoclimatic key. The used thresholds were calibrated with field observations (geophysical soundings, mapping) and adjusted to our study site. The modelling results were validated with more than 600 BTS (bottom temperature of snow cover) measurements. At present an area of 550 km(2) is affected by permafrost to a lesser or greater extent. The occurrence of permafrost varies according to aspect and relief conditions in some locations more than 1000 m in altitude. Low altitude sporadic permafrost occurrence is possible in shady northerly exposed slopes at 2000 m a.s.l., whereas southerly exposed rock walls remain permafrost free even above 3000 m a.s.l. In the national park "Hohe Tauern" (1856 km(2)) 25% of the area is underlain by permafrost. A simple scenario taking into account a possible temperature increase of 1 K would lead to widespread permafrost degradation. The produced permafrost map assists planers and decision-makers and contributes to better understanding of our mountain ecosystem.

AB  - Eastern Mediterranean silvopastoral oak woodlands have been greatly damaged through forest conversion, illegal lumbering, overgrazing, and forest fires. The aim of this study was to assess land-use changes and the legacies that they have imprinted on the forest structure of Quercus macrolepis and accompanying Quercus pubescens and Quercus cerris woodlands on Lesvos Island, Greece. The size structures of adult oak populations were analyzed as indicators of long-term oak regeneration, while short-term recruitment was determined by counting oak seedlings and saplings. The size structure of the adult Q. macrolepis population was similar to the inverse J-shaped distribution typical for natural Mediterranean oak forests, indicating continuous recruitment with a constant mortality rate of mature individuals. Seedling and sapling densities were highly variable, but generally low in relation to adult oak densities. Recruitment of oak seedlings and saplings was positively related to determinants such as forest cover, adult oak density and basal area, woody plant richness, and litter cover. Both seedling and sapling occurrence were negatively associated with dung frequency, which suggests that sheep grazing imposes a barrier to oak recruitment. The study outlines a comprehensive land-use transition from the 1950 to 1970s, during which a complex and multifunctional agrosilvopastoral land-use system was simplified to an intensive grazing system. The discrepancy between the successful long-term regeneration and the less successful short-term recruitment of oaks illustrates that intensified livestock grazing has been a major driver of vegetation change. Grazing impact is likely to interact with increasing drought conditions, which may trigger a negative feedback cycle that undermines the capacity of woodlands to sustain ecosystem services.

AB  - Based on a stratified random sample of 93 vegetation plots and coincident measurements of ecological conditions in mountain forests of the Bavarian Alps, the degree to which species composition and Ellenberg indicator values derived thereof were related to measured environmental variables was assessed for vascular understorey plants and epigeic bryophytes. According to Mantel tests vascular composition contained ca. 30% more ecological information than bryophyte composition. When expressed as average Ellenberg or Dull values, vascular plant-based values reflected 60% more of measured variables than bryophyte-based values. The differences remained after rarefaction of the vascular matrix to the gamma diversity of bryophytes, showing that indication is not a function of indicator richness. Analysing vascular plants and bryophytes combined yielded very similar, or even slightly less stringent relationships with the environment than using vascular plants only.
   Bivariate relationships of indicator values with corresponding ecological measurements confirmed the specific potential of the values to estimate ecological factors from both plant groups, but vascular plants performed better for all factors. Bryophyte indication was particularly poor for light, temperature and base saturation. Bryophyte-based indicator values did not significantly predict the residuals of measured ecological variables against vascular plant-based Ellenberg values.
   For the study region, it is concluded that indicator values of vascular forest understorey should be used without consideration of Dull's indicator values for epigeic bryopyhtes. There appears to be potential to improve bioindication by recalibrating indicator values of epigeic bryophytes based on ecological measurements and vascular plant indicator values.

AB  - Spatial structure in plant communities occurs in the forms of (1) single-species aggregation and dispersion patterns, (2) distance-dependent interactions between species, and (3) the response to the spatial structure of environmental conditions. Different methods deal with these components of spatial variation: geostatistical analysis reveals autocorrelation in a spatial sample; the variance of species richness has been used as an indicator for interspecific interactions due to niche limitation; and ordination techniques describe multispecies responses to environmental factors. Based on the mathematical properties of presence-absence data, it is shown how variogram modeling, the testing of interspecific associations, and multiscale ordination can be integrated using the same set of distance-dependent variance-covariance matrices (variogram matrix). The variogram matrix partitions the variance of community data into spatial components at the levels of the individual species, species composition, and species richness. It can be used to factor out the effects of single-species aggregation patterns, interspecific interactions, or environmental heterogeneity. The mathematical integration of traditionally unrelated methods increases the interpretability of variograms of plant communities, provides a spatial extension and an empirical null model for the variance test of species richness, and extends multiscale ordination to nonsystematic spatial samples. Beyond the individual applications, the variogram matrix provides a framework for a mathematical unification of geostatistics, multivariate data analysis, and the analysis of variance that may enable ecologists from a broad range of fields to incorporate spatial effects into their research and to integrate analyses across different levels of biological organization.

AB  - The fission yield of Tc-99 from Pu-239 and U-235 is similar to that of Cs-137 or Sr-90 and it is therefore an important component of nuclear weapons fall-out, nuclear waste and releases from nuclear facilities. There is particular current interest in Tc-99 transfer from soil to plants for: (a) environmental impact assessments for terrestrial nuclear waste repositories, and (b) assessments of the potential for phytoextraction of radionuclides from contaminated effluent and soil. Vascular plants have a high Tc-99 uptake capacity, a strong tendency to transport it to shoot material and accumulate it in vegetative rather than reproductive structures. The mechanisms that control Tc-99 entry to plants have not been identified and there has been little discussion of the potential for phytoextraction of Tc-99 contaminated effluents or soil. Here we review soil availability, plant uptake mechanisms and soil to plant transfer of Tc-99 in the light of recent advances in soil science, plant molecular biology and phytoextraction technologies. We conclude that Tc-99 might not be highly available in the long term from up to 50% of soils worldwide, and that no single mechanism that might be easily targeted by recombinant DNA technologies controls Tc-99 uptake by plants. Overall, we suggest that Tc might be less available in terrestrial ecosystems than is often assumed but that nevertheless the potential of phytoextraction as a decontamination strategy is probably greater for Tc-99 than for any other nuclide of radioecological interest.

AB  - The third edition of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.; effective from January, 1(st), 1997) slates that biological indicators are to be stored at specified temperature and that an expiry date has to be set. In addition to that, biological indicators shall have a specified spore population with a certain resistance (D-value(1))) against the sterilising agent. For steam sterilisation, spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus (e.g. ATTC 7953) are recommended. The number of viable spores/indicator shall exceed 5 x 10(5) and the D-value of these spores at T = 121 degrees C shall exceed 1.5 min. The use of biological indicators for routine monitoring of sterilisation is mainly justified for sterilisation with gases, but in case of steam sterilisation it is also recommended in certain cases. To test deteriorating effects of prolonged storage times on spores of biological indicators, indicators for monitoring irradiation sterilisation are suited best as only one parameter (adsorbed dose (kGy) which can easily be determined by using dosemeters) has to be monitored. But also indicators for steam sterilisation with two relevant parameters (time and temperature, which can easily be monitored by physical/technical means) can be used to investigate storage conditions.
   In the present investigation it could be demonstrated that storage of biological indicators up to 2 years longer than the stated expiry date does neither affect the viability of the indicator spores nor their resistance against the sterilising agent: In cases like that it could be helpful if the European Pharmacopoeia like the US Pharmacopoeia could describe ranges in which the certified parameters are to be determined.
   D-value: The time tin minutes) required to reduce the specified spore population to 1/10 (by 90 %) at a given temperature(e.g. 121 degrees C).

AB  - This paper assesses the value of American wildcelery, Vallisneria americana, as a biomonitor of organochlorine contamination. Plants provide a valuable indicator of local environmental conditions and sub-lethal effects of contaminants on growth and reproduction provide a means of assessing both acute and chronic contaminant effects. In a field survey, Vallisneria plants in the St. Clair and Detroit rivers were found to accumulate significant amounts of organochlorine contaminants, and the concentration increased over the season. Root tissue contained the highest concentrations on each occasion, suggesting contaminant transfer occurred from sediments to the roots. A factorial experiment was set up at two stations in the channel connecting Lakes Huron and Erie to assess the separate effects of contaminant concentrations in the sediment, water column, and source population of the plants, upon growth and reproduction of Vallisneria plants. Contaminant concentrations in sediment and plant tissues were also measured to correlate contaminant content and demographic effects. A clear relationship between exposure to contaminants and effect (on plant performance) was observed. Results indicated that exposure first to the water column, and secondarily to the sediments from the more contaminated site had detrimental effects on plant performance and survival. Plants at each site appeared to be locally adapted and differed in their apparent resistance to organochlorine contaminants. An ''impairment index'' (reflecting relative plant performance) was calculated and can be used to calibrate the degree of contamination of different sites relative to a ''clean '' reference site. This may allow prioritization of remediation of contaminated sites, and should allow field managers to track and document the restoration of environmental quality in recognized Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes.

AB  - Dairy industries generate enormous volumes of waste water which are significantly rich in organic compounds; contributing to high BOD, COD and sulfates. As a mandate to 'treat' effluents generated by different unit operations in a dairy industry, current treatment methods rely on physico-chemical, mechanical and conventional biological interventions. This approach remains unviable because of cost intensiveness and excessive energy usage. Additionally, the significant lowering of pollution indicators remains a daunting task with inlet and outlet parameters. With these identifiable gaps, our study was aimed to screen bio-efficacious, naturally attenuated fungal isolates to lower exceeding levels of sulfate in effluents released by dairy industry. Effluent samples were collected from Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) of Jaipur Dairy, Rajasthan Dairy Co-operation Limited (RCDF), Jaipur. For mycological investigations, qualitative screening was carried out in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) supplemented with Calcium Sulfate (CaSo4) (0.1g/L). The most promising fungal isolates belonging to Aspergillus sp. was characterized based on its cultural and microscopic characteristics. Microcosm study was conducted by supplementing Aspergillus sp. in Untreated Dairy Effluent (UDE) for a period of 7 days at Room Temperature (RT) under static conditions. Following the incubation phase, mycelial mesh (plug) was indicative of exponential fungal growth. Effluent seeded with Aspergillus sp. and abiotic controls were spinned at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes to eliminate biomass. Sulfate estimation was carried out in Cell Free Extract (CFE) of both experimental and control group. A significant reduction of 67.3% was observed (p<0.05) with respect to positive control and 8.4% when contrasted with abiotic control.

AB  - The precise assessing and monitoring of coral reefs are necessary to address and understand the threats and changes in coral communities. With the development of new technologies and algorithms for image processing, new protocols like underwater photogrammetry are implemented to study these ecosystems. This study compares the main ecological metrics for reef condition assessment, obtained with an underwater digital photogrammetry protocol (UWP) and traditional sampling design simulations in coral reefs of the Cozumel Reefs National Park. Three orthomosaics (380 m(2)) per reef on six fringing reefs were constructed, and the hard coral community characterized using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The orthomosaics were also used as a basis to simulate transect lines and obtain data on the hard coral community according to the video transect (VT) protocol, point intercept (PIT) protocol, and the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) protocol. Higher colony abundance, species richness, and lower coral cover estimates (p < 0.05) were obtained with the UWP. This protocol was also sensitive to small sized species. All the sampling designs showed similar capability to identify dominant species in terms of colony abundance and coral cover. The VT, PIT, and AGGRA showed similar coral cover values (p > 0.05), which seems to indicate that these sampling designs overestimate this important metric. Our results will help to understand and integrate the observations obtained with UWP with long-term data obtained with commonly used monitoring protocols in the Caribbean region.

AB  - Here, a new gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure photoionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-APPI-HRMS) method combined with selective pressurized liquid extraction (sPLE) has been developed for the selective determination of Dechlorane Plus (DP) and its related compounds in gull egg samples used as a bioindicator of contamination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these compounds have been analyzed by GC-MS using atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). Negative ion dopant-assisted APPI using vapors of diethyl ether and a source temperature of 250 degrees C provided high ionization efficiencies and mass spectra characterized by intense in-source fragment ions as well as the presence of molecular ion and characteristic cluster ions containing oxygen atoms in their chemical structure. This made it possible to improve the selectivity in the determination of these compounds compared to that obtained with traditional GC-MS ion sources. Under optimized conditions, the sPLE GC-APPI-HRMS (Orbitrap) method provided high recoveries (> 91%), good precisions (RSD% < 12%), and low method limits of detection (0.1-3.5 pg g(-1) wet weight). The developed methodology has been applied to the determination of DP and related compounds in eggs of two gull species (L. michahellis and L. audouinii) from several Spanish protected areas. The results obtained showed significant differences in the DP concentration profiles in eggs from different gull breeding locations and between gull species of the same protected area. These results demonstrated the good performance of the GC-APPI-HRMS system to achieve a selective and sensitive determination of DP and related compounds in complex environmental samples.

AB  - We investigate the economic benefits of fundamental forest ecosystem services (FES) for the population in Germany at national level in monetary terms and estimate the spatial distribution of these benefits at county level. Specifically, we consider the benefits of timber production, of global climate protection due to carbon sequestration, of recreation for local residents, and of services for nature protection and landscape amenity. Combining information from official statistics and data from valuation studies that are compatible with economic demand theory, we identify spatial drivers of FES benefits and derive generic valuation functions for each of the services. Using a Geographic Information System, these valuation functions are applied to the conditions in the Local Administrative Units (municipalities), resulting in Benefit Function Transfer estimates for each service and each municipality. Afterwards, results are aggregated to NUTS-3 level (counties) and mapped. Aggregate annual benefits of timber production to society as a whole, of climate protection and of recreation services together exceed the ten billion Euro mark-far more than what is reflected in market statistics. Scenarios illustrate the potential for enhancing nature protection benefits particularly by restoring forest biodiversity, as measured by an avifaunistic indicator. The spatial analysis reveals distinct distributional patterns for each of the services. We conclude that a spatially explicit valuation for an entire country is possible even with limited data, which can help policy makers improve the institutional setting in a way that the protection and use of the forests become more sustainable and efficient. After pointing at several caveats, we finally suggest various possibilities for further model development.

AB  - The development of eco-environmental tourism resources in traditional villages does not comprehensively consider the development potential of traditional villages, and it is easy to lead to excessive development. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose the development method of traditional village ecological environment tourism resources under the background of supply-side reform. We systematically analyzed the necessity of rural tourism supply-side reform from two aspects, that is improving the quality of tourism product supply and complementing the shortcomings of tourism development. In addition, we use the IPA analysis method to take the surrounding environment and geographical conditions as development vehicles. Moreover, combined with the characteristics of the village itself, an evaluation model of resource development potential was constructed based on the selected evaluation indicators. This method requires preprocessing of the positive and inverse indicators to obtain the final judgment matrix and determine the indicator weights. The weighted results are used to analyze the difficulties faced by the development of eco-environmental tourism resources. Furthermore, it is proposed to broaden funding channels, protect traditional buildings, and realize the tourism supply of traditional villages. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the introduction of talents and improve management satisfaction in order to adjust the development structure and improve the development path of the tourism industry chain. In the end, KMO and Bartlett's sphere test and variable co-degree were used to test and evaluate the accuracy of the model. The results show that the proposed 13 evaluation indicators are suitable for analysis factors, and the resource development method is feasible.

AB  - There is a need to monitor environmental changes in situ across aquatic ecosystems. Sclerochronology, a systematic biogeochemical method that assesses variations in the accretionary hard tissues of invertebrates, can be useful in studying these changes. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether an equilibrium relationship exists between seasonal annual temperature variations in bivalve shells of species with multiple geographic ranges. We present one of the first sderochronology reports to characterize the delta O-18 and delta C-13 shell profiles of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter, 1864. We evaluated its utility as a proxy for past water temperature relating to seasonal cycles. The objectives were to: (1) assess shell delta O-18 and delta C-13 values from specimens sampled over time; and (2) evaluate whether delta O-18 shell profiles correlate with seasonal temperature patterns. Seven O. lurida specimens were collected, and measurements were taken across shell growth. Results from generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that O. lurida produced delta O-18 profiles consistent with a sinusoidal time pattern. The delta O-18 values ranged from -2.74 parts per thousand to -1.05 parts per thousand, and there was a significant third-order polynomial temporal relationship. Covariation between profiles of shell delta O-18 and delta C-13 values was observed over time. Two independently estimated measures of delta O-18(water,) accounting for salinity, temperature, and shell carbonate, were also positively correlated over time. Implications support the theory that O. lurida shell delta O-18 profiles may be in isotopic equilibrium with ambient water conditions with applications for monitoring programs.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of the study was to investigate whether the occurrence of the I laths lines (HLs) affects the bone massiveness and intravital body height of the individuals. Depending on the nature of the Harris lines, catch up growth processes, bone remodelling or purely a nutritional stress response, may be the causing factor. Methods: The skeletal material of 404 individuals was investigated (male N = 141/ female N = 133). HLs were recorded on roentgenographs in two bone extremities. Results: Although HLs appeared more frequently in male tibiae, the difference was not statistically significant. The distal ends of tibiae were characterized by significantly higher occurrence of HLs than the proximal ends. The percentage of HLs-containing tibiae decreased with an individual's age. Both frequency and intensity were independent of sex and they reached higher values in left tibiae. HLs frequency was higher in the distal ends of the tibiae. HLs-containing left and right female tibiae were significantly shorter. Moreover HLs-containing right female tibiae possessed significantly thinner distal ends. Intravital body height of female skeletons without HLs was significantly higher. When controlled, the massiveness ratios, despite its slightly higher values in tibiae with HLs, were not significant. Conclusions: Weak differences in massiveness ratios suggest, that the observed differences in the number of HLs were caused by factors other than different bone remodelling at the right and left side of a skeleton. The observations suggest also that the factors promoting HLs formation affected men and women in the dissimilar way or, at least, the effects of compensation of temporarily arrested bone growth were different in the two sexes.

AB  - In pesticide risk assessments, semifield studies, such as large-scale colony feeding studies (LSCFSs), are conducted to assess potential risks at the honey bee colony level. However, such studies are very cost and time intensive, and high overwintering losses of untreated control hives have been observed in some studies. Honey bee colony models such as BEEHAVE may provide tools to systematically assess multiple factors influencing colony outcomes, to inform study design, and to estimate pesticide impacts under varying environmental conditions. Before they can be used reliably, models should be validated to demonstrate they can appropriately reproduce patterns observed in the field. Despite the recognized need for validation, methodologies to be used in the context of applied ecological models are not agreed on. For the parameterization, calibration, and validation of BEEHAVE, we used control data from multiple LSCFSs. We conducted detailed visual and quantitative performance analyses as a demonstration of validation methodologies. The BEEHAVE outputs showed good agreement with apiary-specific validation data sets representing the first year of the studies. However, the simulations of colony dynamics in the spring periods following overwintering were identified as less reliable. The comprehensive validation effort applied provides important insights that can inform the usability of BEEHAVE in applications related to higher tier risk assessments. In addition, the validation methodology applied could be used in a wider context of ecological models.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-17.

AB  - Agricultural intensification can lead to high volumes of livestock faeces being applied to land, either as solid or liquid manures or via direct defecation, and can result in reservoirs of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) persisting within farmland. Understanding the survival of FIOs, e.g. E. coli, in agricultural environments, and in particular within different livestock faeces, is key to developing catchment management practices for the protection of ecosystem services provided by clean water. Frequently, controlled laboratory studies, under constant temperature regimes, are used to determine the impact of environmental factors on E. coli persistence in livestock faeces; however, such studies oversimplify the diurnal variations and interactions of real world conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of E. coli using a controlled environment facility, which simulated diurnal variation of temperatures typically experienced during a British spring and summer. The approach provided a comparison of E. coli persistence profiles within faeces of sheep, beef cattle and dairy cattle to allow novel interpretations of E. coli regrowth patterns in contrasting livestock faeces in the period immediately post-defecation. Thus, the coupling of a tightly controlled environment facility with high resolution monitoring enabled the development of a new non-linear, asymptotic description of E. coli proliferation in livestock faeces, with increased potential for E. coli growth observed during warmer temperatures for all livestock types. While this study focused on temperatures typical of the UK, the occurrence of a phase of E. coli regrowth has implications for microbial water quality management worldwide. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Dyspeptic disorders in newborn calves are still a common condition. At the same time, it is quite often that there are violations in the hennostasis system, contributing to the onset of intravascular thrombosis in them. In a study in calves with dyspepsia that occurred during the neonatal period, an increase in platelet aggregation ability in vitro and in vivo was found. They are based on pronounced changes in the fatty composition of the membranes of blood platelets, the increase in the number of medium molecules in plasma and platelets, the enhancement of lipid peroxidation in them, the intensification of the formation of von Willebrand factor vessels. Increased thromboxane formation can be considered a serious reason for the increased activity of hemostasis in calves in the neonatal phase with dyspepsia. Previously conducted research on a highly biologically active drug, phosprenil, which is based on needle polyprenols, has shown its ability to influence metabolism, simulate natural resistance, as well as anti-inflammatory activity, properties of the hepatoprotector and detoxicant. The presence of these effects prompted the author to use fosprenil in this study. Appointment of fosprenil in calves with functional digestive disorders was able to improve lipid peroxidation and reduce the content of medium molecules in their blood and platelets. A ten-day application of fosprenil in newborn calves with functional disorders of the digestive system also improved the state of the estimated indicators of primary hemostasis optimizing the aggregation ability of platelets and the intravascular activity of the blood platelets.

AB  - Agricultural and mining activities contribute to metal inputs in freshwater ecosystems around the world, which can in turn bioaccumulate in biota such as fish. Monitoring of metals loads in biota thus provides insight into the concentrations of bioavailable metals within the environment. Little research has been conducted on the potential of Australian freshwater fish for biomonitoring metals. Within the Fitzroy Basin of Central Queensland, a major agricultural and coal mining region, three commonly-encountered fish taxa were analysed for tissue metal loads. Arsenic concentrations in Nematalosa erebi and Melanotaenia splendida splendida tissue were elevated (above Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) guidelines), with highest concentrations in N. erebi liver tissue (up to 5.14 mu g/g). Lead concentrations were above the FSANZ guidelines in all three fish taxa analysed, with highest concentrations in Hypseleotrid full-body tissue (up to 5.99 mu g/g). Selenium in M. s. splendida and N. erebi tissue was positively correlated with total selenium in water (p < 0.05; r = 0.68 and 0.87 respectively). Environmental boron, selenium and nickel concentrations were positively correlated with N. erebi liver tissue metals. N. erebi hepatosomatic index was negatively correlated with dissolved arsenic, manganese, and total phosphorus (in water). The results highlight that M. s. splendida and N. erebi yield bioindicators which are responsive to environmental metals, and thus have potential for use in biomonitoring metals. The two species are also widespread along the east coast of Australia, there is thus a strong potential for applying the results to other regions within Australia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A system of indicators has been developed to evaluate beach geomorphological vulnerability (GVI) through: intrinsic susceptibility, the agents that model them, and their ability to remain stable over time. The method is applied to 34 beaches on the island of Gran Canaria (Spain) that experience different levels and conditions of human occupation, marine incidence, landforms and sediments, and spatial evolution that have been recorded since 1960. In contrast with other studies, the analysis of these dimensions (and their relationships) allows a diagnosis of the geomorphology of the beaches with an integrated approach. The results illustrate the numerous causes that generate geomorphological vulnerability, such as wave intensity, the presence of dikes or breakwaters, coastline variations, the absence of foredunes and embryonic dunes, the width of the intertidal zone, or the absence of beachrocks or lavic stones outcropping onto the shore. These variables combine and operate differently in five defined groups of beaches with different management needs. The most vulnerable ones were those with strong marine incidence, which require maintenance of their landforms in order to guarantee their stability. The opposite situation is found in beaches with little impact from anthropic and marine components. These beaches are less vulnerable since they have moderate susceptibility and high resilience. Their management requirements consist of soft measures since they have a strong geomorphological robustness. In this context, the proposed indicator system is a potentially relevant contribution to the management of beaches, especially for those that are under threat. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tunnel excavation causes geological, hydrological, environmental and social changes. The effects of groundwater level changes caused by tunnelling on tree growth have been poorly understood. Dendrochronology was used to evaluate the impact of groundwater level drawdown on tree growth. Tree cores of Masson pines were collected from the areas affected by tunnel construction in the Zhongliang Mountains of Chongqing in south-western China to study the effects of tunnel excavation on the growth rate of trees by comparing with tree cores collected from unaffected areas. Excavation and early operation of the first tunnel in the Zhongliang Mountains from 1968 to 1984 caused a groundwater table drawdown in both karst aquifer and non-karst aquifer. The lowered groundwater table significantly reduced the growth rate of pine trees, and the low growth rate remained for 15 years. The effect was experienced up to at least 1 km from the tunnel axis. The decline in tree growth was higher in karst than in non-karst areas, though the effects on the trees of the karst areas were lagging. The high precipitation in 1998 contributed to groundwater recovery, after which the tree growth recovered moderately but not to the original level. Groundwater leakage of the recently excavated tunnels did not affect pine trees heavily, probably because the pines had adapted to the new hydrogeological conditions and new strategies in tunnel inflow management were adopted in the recently excavated tunnels. The use of tree growth rate as an indicator of groundwater table change in tunnelling areas offers a new option to study environmental impacts and the extent of tunnelling effects.

AB  - Placer gold deposits can serve as a wet/dry paleoclimate indicator because they preserve a record of physical and chemical modification. We hypothesized that such a record would be present across the four main placer units at Rich Hill, Arizona, USA. The oldest placer unit, a paleo-erosional surface on a modern topographic high, records moderate precipitation and erosion with modest transport distance following 25-22 Ma unroofing of the lode gold source. By 17-5 Ma, high-angle Basin and Range faulting produced a shallow basin that preserved three additional placer units. The oldest is a thin gold-rich gravel within bedrock gravity traps, suggestive of a steep gradient and abundant nonseasonal precipitation. The middle unit has well-rounded gold nuggets with deep chemical weathering that record abundant nonseasonal precipitation, but with a less steep gradient and significant fluvial sediment deposition. The uppermost unit is a pulse placer unit deposited by a series of landslides and debris flows during a period of lower, seasonal precipitation. During this dry period, and continuing to the present, microbial communities may have been established within the seasonally wet bedrock traps of the lowermost placer unit. This resulted in biological modification of placer gold chemistry and production of Mn-Ba-oxide biomats, which have coated and cemented both placer gold and sediments. This record of physical and chemical change within a sequence of placer gold units is consistent with known Arizona paleoclimate conditions, and it demonstrates the potential utility of this technique for paleo-environmental reconstructions.

We aimed to analyse the biodiversity of AMF and understorey plants in Zagros forest (Iran), and to find their relationships with environmental conditions (physiography and soil).
   Methods - Seventy-five plots (20 m x 20 m) were randomly divided from 1 700 to 1 900 m a.s.l. In each plot, four 1.5 m x 1.5 m microplots were established and all trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species coverage were recorded. Furthermore, four soil samples were taken from a depth of 0-20 cm in each microplot (one pooled sample for each main plot) by auger in spring. These soil samples were used for AMF assessment and soil physiochemical properties.
   Results - Seventeen AMF species (in Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae, Gigasporaceae, and Acaulosporaceae) and 47 plant taxa (in Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae and fourteen other families) were identified. Tests determined that the factors soil P, slope, tree coverage, litter thickness, and soil texture affect ANT and plant communities. Soil physiochemical properties have an effect on AMF, plant diversity, and evenness diversity indices. Furthermore, there is a high correlation between plants and AMF diversity indices and any change in the plant diversity will result in AMF changes. The results also showed positive correlations between plant diversity and AMF diversity.
   Conclusions - AMF and plant diversity indices are highly correlated, but this correlation could be affected by soil physiochemical properties and environmental factors. Moreover, canopy coverage and litter thickness are considered as strongly influencing both plants and AMF.

AB  - Zooplankton frequently face dietary limitation caused by imbalances between their nutrient requirements and the nutrient content of their phytoplankton food. While insufficient nutrition is acknowledged to affect growth and reproduction of zooplankton, the effect of dietary limitation on other aspects of their metabolism remains poorly studied. One understudied biochemical response associated with nutrient stress is changes to the free amino acid (FAA) composition of body tissues resulting from changes in dietary supply. We examined changes in FAA composition in two cladoceran species (Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex) in response to stress created by ecologically relevant food conditions: low food quantities, high algal carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratios, and high algal C: phosphorus (P) ratios. We measured 14 FAA after extracting them from lyophilized whole Daphnia grown under these contrasting algal diets. Generally, low food quantity and low algal P increased body FAA content in both daphnid species while many essential FAA decreased due to N-limitation. While significant responses to diet were seen for each daphnid species, the nature of these responses depended on the type of nutritional stress, the FAA examined, and on the species. Non-parametric discriminant analysis exhibited a high predictive ability to classify unknown zooplankton into the correct diet category. The observed changes in body FAA profiles of Daphnia illustrate strong effects that algal food quality can have on the biochemistry of planktonic consumers. Furthermore these results demonstrate body FAA composition of zooplankton may provide an important source of information about zooplankton nutrient limitation especially combined with other nutrient-dependent molecular responses.

AB  - Proteus spp. bacteria were first described in 1885 by Gustav Hauser, who had revealed their feature of intensive swarming growth. Currently, the genus is divided into Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus penneri, Proteus hauseri, and three unnamed genomospecies 4, 5, and 6 and consists of 80 O-antigenic serogroups. The bacteria are known to be human opportunistic pathogens, isolated from urine, wounds, and other clinical sources. It is postulated that intestines are a reservoir of these proteolytic organisms. Many wild and domestic animals may be hosts of Proteus spp. bacteria, which are commonly known to play a role of parasites or commen-sals. However, interesting examples of their symbiotic relationships with higher organisms have also been described. Proteus spp. bacteria present in soil or water habitats are often regarded as indicators of fecal pollution, posing a threat of poisoning when the contaminated water or seafood is consumed. The health risk may also be connected with drug-resistant strains sourcing from intestines. Positive aspects of the bacteria presence in water and soil are connected with exceptional features displayed by autochthonic Proteus spp. strains detected in these environments. These rods acquire various metabolic abilities allowing their adaptation to different environmental conditions, such as high concentrations of heavy metals or toxic substances, which may be exploited as sources of energy and nutrition by the bacteria. The Proteus spp. abilities to tolerate or utilize polluting compounds as well as promote plant growth provide a possibility of employing these microorganisms in bioremediation and environmental protection.

AB  - Environmental indicators suggest that the legislation regulating land clearing in NSW should be strengthened. However, reform has moved in the opposite direction, continuously weakening the law in response to the marginal but politically significant argument that the Act undermined sacrosanct private property rights. The cultural mythology around property and the legal discourse of property dephysicalise relations between people and place, transforming them into categories of abstract and predominantly commercial rights, and foster a vocabulary of entitlement to land as a civil and political right. Opponents to the existing legislation have also argued that it insufficiently accommodates vernacular knowledge regarding locally specific conditions and variations, and creates disrespect and mistrust between government and landholders. This paper interrogates the relationships between the key arguments of opponents to the existing legislation with place attachment. Place attachment describes the bond between people and place and is usually regarded as being positive for environmental protection. However, it may also underpin reactionary place-protective behaviours including NIMBYism, the preservation of degraded landscapes and inappropriate place management practices, including the institution of private property itself. Paradoxically, while place-protective resistance may appear to conflict with conservation, potential for resolution to this ongoing legal and geographical crisis in biodiversity conservation may be found through highlighting the common ground of place connection and inter-dependence, and by rephysicalising law to better articulate shared interests in healthy environments beyond the narrow prism of individual property rights. This endeavour may be best achieved through a multi-scalar and poly-vocal participatory process, to ensure such narrow and monological interests do not hold disproportionate sway and address path dependency and legacy issues.

AB  - Farmers are continually striving to adapt to Australia's highly variable climate. As a function of global warming, future climatic conditions will present further challenges, but may also present many new opportunities for farmers. We involved a range of rural communities via 14 workshops across a range of Australia's large-scale broadacre cropping regions employing a rural livelihoods framework to elicit and interpret community responses. Farmers identified indicators and rated them on the extent to which they might constrain or enable adaption to increased climate variability or climate change. Financial issues, such as low equity or limited capital were, considered to be most constraining, and natural capital assets, such as high soil productivity and low rainfall variability were considered to be most enabling. Most indicators were of broad-scale significance, affecting broadacre mixed farmers across a range of locations, and were not necessarily specific to climate change only. Broad-scale constraints identified were isolation/rural decline, limited access to services, poor regional infrastructure, equity/debt, and the high cost of production. Conversely, enabling factors identified were farmer education/experience, sense of community, and off-farm income. Actions to address these perceived constraints related to farm management practices, training, community, technology/research, communication, funding and institutional arrangements. In the Australian context, adapting to climate variability and change is more than just implementing a new technology, but is also about enhancing the broader resilience of the community in ways that will ensure its long term viability. To achieve this it will be necessary for different components of government and other institutional actors to work together to improve the adaptation capacity of farmers in the future.

AB  - The stability of colloidal suspensions is crucial in a wide variety of processes, including the fabrication of photonic materials and scaffolds for biological assemblies. The ionic strength of the electrolyte that suspends charged colloids is widely used to control the physical properties of colloidal suspensions. The extensively used two-body Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) approach allows for a quantitative analysis of the effective electrostatic forces between colloidal particles. DLVO relates the ionic double layers, which enclose the particles, to their effective electrostatic repulsion. Nevertheless, the double layer is distorted at high macroion volume fractions. Therefore, DLVO cannot describe the many-body effects that arise in concentrated suspensions. We show that this problem can be largely resolved by identifying effective point charges for the macroions using cell theory. This extrapolated point charge (EPC) method assigns effective point charges in a consistent way, taking into account the excluded volume of highly charged macroions at any concentration, and thereby naturally accounting for high volume fractions in both salt-free and added-salt conditions. We provide an analytical expression for the effective pair potential and validate the EPC method by comparing molecular dynamics simulations of macroions and monovalent microions that interact via Coulombic potentials to simulations of macroions interacting via the derived EPC effective potential. The simulations reproduce the macroion-macroion spatial correlation and the virial pressure obtained with the EPC model. Our findings provide a route to relate the physical properties such as pressure in systems of screened Coulomb particles to experimental measurements.

AB  - Feedback about error or reward is regarded essential for aiding learners to acquire a perceptual-motor skill. Yet, when a task has redundancy and the mapping between execution and performance outcome is unknown, simple error feedback does not suffice in guiding the learner toward the optimal solutions. The present study developed and tested a new means of implicitly guiding learners to acquire a perceptual-motor skill, rhythmically bouncing a ball on a racket. Due to its rhythmic nature, this task affords dynamically stable solutions that are robust to small errors and noise, a strategy that is independent from actively correcting error. Based on the task model implemented in a virtual environment, a time-shift manipulation was designed to shift the range of ball-racket contacts that achieved dynamically stable solutions. In two experiments, subjects practiced with this manipulation that guided them to impact the ball with more negative racket accelerations, the indicator for the strategy with dynamic stability. Subjects who practiced under normal conditions took longer time to acquire this strategy, although error measures were identical between the control and experimental groups. Unlike in many other haptic guidance or adaptation studies, the experimental groups not only learned, but also maintained the stable solution after the manipulation was removed. These results are a first demonstration that more subtle ways to guide the learner to better performance are needed especially in tasks with redundancy, where error feedback may not be sufficient.

AB  - Villafranchian faunas were widely spread throughout the European continent during the Plio-Pleistocene. Ungulates, and particularly ruminants, are very well represented in most of the localities of this period. The fossil site of Tegelen (Province of Limburg, the Netherlands) is a classical Villafranchian locality where cervids are especially abundant. Some of the sites from this period have been thoroughly studied in various aspects, such as faunal assemblages, biochronology, magnetostratigraphy, sedimentology or palaeoenvironmental conditions, among others. Tegelen has been as well studied, but its particular exploitation has hampered its study for years. In order to reconstruct its prevailing palaeohabitat, we have applied statistical analyses based on functional morphology for the first time for this fossil site. In this work, we have analysed the ecomorphology of the postcranial skeleton of Eucladoceros ctenoides and Metacervoceros rhenanus, the two extinct species of deer present in Tegelen. Results show that the best ecological indicators are the metapods and the tibia, while the astragalus seems to be the least informative element. The analyses reveal likewise how both taxa show adaptations to both open and forest environments, but with a slight trend to the former. These results disagree with the general assumption that E.ctenoides and M.rhenanus are indicative of forested settings, as well as with the classical interpretations of the palaeoenvironment of Tegelen made to date, which are exclusively based on the fauna. However, they go along with the appearance of some taxa typical of open habitats, such as the micromammals Hystrix and Dicrostonyx, which could help to explain their enigmatic presence.

AB  - Fabaceae species play a key role in ecosystem functioning through their capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen via their symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria. To increase benefits of using Fabaceae in agricultural systems, it is necessary to find ways to evaluate species or genotypes having potential adaptations to sub-optimal growth conditions. We evaluated the relevance of phylogenetic distance, absolute trait distance and hierarchical trait distance for comparing the adaptation of 13 grassland Fabaceae species to different habitats, i.e., ecological niches. We measured a wide range of functional traits (root traits, leaf traits, and whole plant traits) in these species. Species phylogenetic and ecological distances were assessed from a species-level phylogenetic tree and species' ecological indicator values, respectively. We demonstrated that differences in ecological niches between grassland Fabaceae species were related more to their hierarchical trait distances than to their phylogenetic distances. We showed that grassland Fabaceae functional traits tend to converge among species with the same ecological requirements. Species with acquisitive root strategies (thin roots, shallow root systems) are competitive species adapted to non-stressful meadows, while conservative ones (coarse roots, deep root systems) are able to tolerate stressful continental climates. In contrast, acquisitive species appeared to be able to tolerate low soil-P availability, while conservative ones need high P availability. Finally we highlight that traits converge along the ecological gradient, providing the assumption that species with similar root-trait values are better able to coexist, regardless of their phylogenetic distance.

AB  - The effects of temperature on European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) juveniles were investigated using a 30-day bioassay carried out at 18 and 25 degrees C in laboratory conditions. A multiparameter approach was applied including fish swimming velocity and several biochemical parameters involved in important physiological functions. Fish exposed for four weeks to 25 degrees C showed a decreased swimming capacity, concomitant with increased oxidative stress (increased catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities) and damage (increased lipid peroxidation levels), increased activity of an enzyme involved in energy production through the aerobic pathway (isocitrate dehydrogenase) and increased activities of brain and muscle cholinesterases (neurotransmission) compared to fish kept at 18 degrees C. Globally, these findings indicate that basic functions, essential for juvenile seabass surviving and well performing in the wild, such as predation, predator avoidance, neurofunction and ability to face chemical stress may be compromised with increasing water temperature. This may be of particular concern if D. labrax recruitment phase in northwest European estuaries and coastal areas happens gradually in more warm environments as a consequence of global warming. Considering that the selected endpoints are generally applied in monitoring studies with different species, these findings also highlight the need of more research, including interdisciplinary and multiparameter approaches, on the impacts of temperature on marine species, and stress the importance of considering scenarios of temperature increase in environmental monitoring and in marine ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Although bromine (Br) is considered conservative in seawater, it exhibits a well established correlation with organic carbon in marine sediments. This carbon-bromine association was recently attributed to covalent bonding, with organobromine in sinking particulates providing a putative link between sedimentary organobromine and organic matter cycling in surface waters. We hypothesized that phytoplankton detritus, a major precursor of sedimentary organic matter, would be susceptible to bromination through oxidative attack. Through a series of model experiments, we demonstrate incorporation of Br into algal particulate detritus through peroxidative and photochemical mechanisms. Peroxidative bromination was enhanced by addition of exogenous bromoperoxidase, but the enzyme was not required for the reaction. Fenton-like reaction conditions also promoted bromination, especially under solar irradiation, implicating radical mechanisms in the euphotic zone as another abiotic source of brominated particulates. These reactions produced aliphatic and aromatic forms of organobromine, suggesting that lipid-and protein-rich components of algal membranes provide suitable substrates for bromination. Biogenic organobromines in certain genera of phytoplankton also appeared in both aliphatic and aromatic forms. Experimental evidence and samples from oceanic midwater sediment traps imply that the aromatic fraction is more stable than the aliphatic. These experiments establish Br as a versatile oxidant in the transformation of planktonic organic matter through both enzymatic and abiotic mechanisms. Organobromine may serve as a marker of oxidative breakdown of marine organic detritus, with the metastable component providing a short-lived indicator of early-stage oxidation. By altering the stability of aliphatic and aromatic moieties, bromination may affect the availability of organic matter to organisms, with consequences for the preservation and degradation of marine organic carbon.

AB  - Following the principles of the European Water Framework Directive, the current Spanish water management legislation requires the definition of the environmental flow regimes for all water bodies, including estuaries. The scientific community has tried to answer the question of how much freshwater an estuary needs since the mid-1970s, resulting in the development of several methodologies and approaches in different parts of the world. However the ability to reproduce most of these approaches is difficult due to the scarcity of required data and also to the differences between the studied estuaries. In this paper, we present a methodology to calculate environmental flow regimes in well-mixed estuaries based on the numerical modelling of salinity and which takes into account the seasonal climatic and hydrologic pattern of the catchment. The approach follows three sequential steps: 1) Definition of reference conditions based on the unaltered salinity patterns and zoning of the estuary, 2) definition of salinity thresholds and 3) calculation of the minimum flows required to satisfy these thresholds. The application of the methodology to five estuaries on the northern coast of Spain has highlighted the importance of considering the hydrological variability and the division of the estuary into homogeneous zones. Moreover, the studies carried out demonstrate the ineffectiveness of river specific methodologies when used to define environmental flow regimes in several estuaries and periods, and the need to apply specific methodologies. The methodology is based on the principles defined by other already tested approaches, but its greatest advantage lies in the ability to be applied to large scales, when physical and biological data is scarce.

AB  - A eutrophication gradient was assembled from four spring-fed estuaries and four surface-fed estuaries to determine whether changes in zooplankton and hyperbenthos abundance along the gradient were gradual or abrupt. For 1 year in each estuary, monthly faunal surveys were conducted during nighttime flood tides using oblique plankton-net tows, producing abundance data for 316 taxa. Indicator taxa for the spring-fed and surface-fed groups were identified from a combination of abundance and encounter frequencies. Seventeen of the 20 strong indicator taxa for the spring-fed group (85 %) were benthic, whereas 10 of the 13 strong indicators for the surface-fed group (77 %) were plankton-oriented. The eight communities were ordinated by canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP); the estuarine faunas were found to be uniquely distributed along the principal CAP axis. Success of blind reclassification of plankton samples to their respective estuaries of origin ranged from 75 to 100 % (mean, 91 %). Given the assembled gradient was composed of distinctive communities that were distributed across a broad range of trophic states, the transition between benthic and plankton-oriented indicators was investigated and found to be abrupt, with strong shifts occurring nearer the oligotrophic end of the gradient. The CAP ordination agreed with trends in light attenuation, but not dissolved oxygen. We conclude that the abrupt faunal shifts were likely related to differences in basal resource (primary producer) availability brought about by differences in light environment. Abrupt loss of benthic basal resources will affect benthic consumers and those plankton-oriented consumers that intermittently depend on benthic biomass pathways whenever plankton-based pathways are unproductive.

AB  - Colonially nesting waterbirds transfer large quantities of aquatically derived nutrients into terrestrial systems, potentially altering community and ecosystem structure. Over the past three decades, the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) has undergone rapid population expansion throughout much of its historic range in North America, recolonizing habitats that had not supported colonial waterbirds for decades. Mounting evidence suggests that these populations are degrading the habitats they colonize primarily through the destruction of vegetation and the alteration of soil conditions. The study examined the effects of cormorants and co-occurring long-legged wading bird species including Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) on their nesting habitats by observing plant and arthropod community structure as well as soil and leaf litter characteristics at colonized and non-colonized sites on two islands in New York Harbor. Understory plant species richness and total plant cover were reduced, and the arthropod community shifted from primarily plant feeders to primarily carrion and dung feeders beneath cormorant nests in comparison to adjacent non-colonized habitats. On the island where cormorants have been established longer, the colony tended to be denser and larger and was associated with larger ecological impacts on plants, arthropods and soils. Long-legged wading bird colonies and more recently established cormorant colonies were smaller, less dense, and were generally associated with fewer ecological impacts.

AB  - This study aims at understanding the fecal contamination behavior in a small coastal stream (Aljezur, Portugal), which has significant economic and ecological values. Like in most small coastal systems, circulation and water renewal in the Aljezur stream exhibit a strong variability due to their dependence on tides, waves, intermittent river flows, and a highly variable morphology. Hence, the problem was approached through a combination of field surveys and the development and application of a hard-coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and fecal contamination model. Salinity and temperature results have shown that mixing and transport in the stream are very sensitive to the river flow and wind forcing. The model is able to represent the main patterns and trends observed in Escherichia coli and fecal enterococcus concentrations along the stream, for different environmental and contamination conditions, suggesting die-off rates on the order of 0.50-0.55 day(-1). Die-off rate and the representation of the sediment-associated processes were identified as the major remaining sources of uncertainty in the model. Results show that, owing to the processes that occur along the stream, fecal bacteria reach the beaches water in numbers that comply with the European Bathing Waters Directive, even during the summer periods when the upstream concentrations are larger. In particular, results suggest a direct relation between the tidal propagation upstream and the reduction of the fecal bacteria concentrations along the stream that can be relevant for the development of a strategy for the management of the system's water safety.

AB  - The harmful algal species Prymnesium parvum, a toxin-producing mixotrophic haptophyte, has caused massive fish kills in select inland Texas water bodies. Though P. parvum is present in a number of water bodies and Gulf of Mexico estuaries, it does not develop harmful blooms in all of them. A previous study by our team identified dissolved constituents from a cyanobacterial-dominated lake to exhibit concentration-dependent growth inhibition of P. parvum. Here we employed a probabilistic ecological risk assessment approach to examine the potential allelopathy of the cyanotoxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR) to P. parvum under laboratory conditions representative of Texas water bodies when blooms form. An environmental exposure distribution was constructed utilizing MC-LR concentrations detected in the environment and compared with experimental acute median lethal values reported in the literature. In a laboratory experiment, P. parvum cells were grown in media containing different MC-LR concentrations and cell density was determined daily A concentration of 4392.8 mu g L-1 significantly inhibited P. parvum growth over a portion of the study Such a concentration was predicted to be detected or exceeded 9% of the time when microcystin producers are likely to occur. However, when a concentration this high occurs in the environment to affect P. parvum growth, a number of aquatic organisms may be expected to experience acute mortality from MC-LR. Further studies are warranted to define the effects of other compounds released by cyanobacteria on P. parvum populations.

AB  - Oceanographic conditions in the southeastern Bering Sea are affected by large-scale climatic drivers (e.g. Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Aleutian Low Pressure System). Ecosystem changes in response to climate variability should be monitored, as the Bering Sea supports the largest commercial fishery in the USA (walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma). This analysis examined shifts in larval fish community composition in the southeastern Bering Sea in response to environmental variability across both warm and cold periods. Larvae were sampled in spring (May) during 5 cruises between 2002 and 2008 using oblique 60 cm bongo tows. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to quantify variability and reduce multi-species abundance data to major modes of species composition. Generalized additive models (GAMs) characterized spatial and temporal differences in assemblage structure as a function of environmental covariates. We identified a strong cross-shelf gradient delineating slope and shelf assemblages, an influence of water masses from the Gulf of Alaska on species composition, and the importance of nearshore areas for larval fish. Species assemblages differed between warm and cold periods, and larval abundances were generally greater in warm years. High abundances of walleye pollock in warm years contributed most to differences in Unimak Pass, outer domain, and shelf areas (geographic areas in the study region defined based on bathymetry). Sebastes spp. contributed to differences over the slope with increased abundances in cold years. We propose that community-level patterns in larval fish composition may reflect species-specific responses to climate change and that early life stages may be primary indicators of environmental change.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the impact of adding different items in individually ventilated rat cages on the animal's activity, cardiovascular parameters and faecal stress indicators. The following three cage items made of aspen were compared: a cross made of two intersecting boards, a similar cross where drilled holes were loaded with food pellets (restricted feeding) and a rectangular tube. Male rats of the strains BN and F344 (n = 12) were housed in groups of three; one rat in each group was implanted with a telemetric transponder to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). In a crossover design, each group spent 14 days with each type of cage furniture, thereafter faecal pellets were collected for faecal analyses. The means of activity and means and coefficient of variation for MAP and HR were calculated for days 2, 6, 10 and 14. As a way of determining which of the statistically significant MAP and HR mean changes were biologically meaningful, the night-day differences of the controls on day 14 were used. Both board types lowered MAP of F344 rats; hence dividing walls seem beneficial for F344 welfare. None of the MAP or HR differences in BN rats were biologically significant. No statistically significant differences in faecal corticosterone or IgA excretion were detected. In conclusion, provision of general recommendations with respect to cage furniture for rat cages is complicated because there is a clear genetic component involved in how animals respond to these structures.

AB  - 2,2'-Azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical cation decolorization assay has been applied under different pH conditions for the determination of trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of biological and food samples. Due to innate nature of ABTS radical cation, it is unstable at physiological pH. Further, its sensitivity is also lost at acidic pH. No single method has yet claimed to cover both drawbacks of the ABTS procedure. The present investigation was aimed at developing an improved ABTS decolorization method for the measurement of antioxidant activity of human plasma and herbal extracts with greater stability and sufficient sensitivity. A relatively stable ABTS radical cation was generated through a reaction between ABTS and potassium persulfate in the presence of sodium acetate buffer at pH 6.5 (20 mM). The electron or hydrogen atom transfer from antioxidative components of plasma or herbal extracts reduced the radical cation. Standard antioxidants like trolox, butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid demonstrated stable end-point readings showing a promising aspect of determination of total antioxidant activity (TAA) of all the other samples with reference to these indicators. The modified assay proved to be highly reproducible. TEAC values for plasma samples ranged between 1.410-2.025 mM with mean percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) 1.64 and between 1.72-1.98 with mean % RSD 1.27 for older and modified ABTS assays, respectively. The efficacy of the assay was ascertained further by determining antioxidant activity of organic and aqueous extracts of Cuscuta reflexa and Terminalia arjuna.

AB  - Chironomidae spatial and temporal distributions were investigated over two seasons at 31 reference sites in eight Mediterranean river basins in NE Spain. A total of 126 taxa included in 67 genera of chironomid larvae were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that variation in the assemblage structure of chironomids was primarily explained by temperature, altitude and geology, together with hydrological factors such as discharge and dry period, which play an important role in structuring communities in Mediterranean streams. A final classification based solely on Chironomidae reference assemblages produced four biological groups, and the corresponding indicator taxa were identified. One group is almost exclusively formed by summer samples, showing that seasonal differences are one of the most important driving forces behind differences in Chironomidae assemblage composition in Mediterranean streams. Furthermore we tested the agreement between Chironomidae assemblages and three river ecotypes (WFD approach) obtained after conducting an environmental classification in the Mediterranean region of Spain. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a large overlap of chironomid assemblages among ecotypes, although communities belonging to the ecotype "Siliceous headwaters and high altitude streams" proved to be the most different from the other ecotypes studied. Our results suggest that a top-down classification of streams (using ecotypes) does not necessarily imply exclusive assemblages of chironomids. Thus, classification based on biological data may be more appropriate than environmental classification with subsequent testing using biological data. These findings have important implications for the application of the WFD in Mediterranean streams.

AB  - A suite of dissolved trace metals (Ag, Cd, Cu and Pb), inorganic nutrients (NO3, PO4), and chlorophyll a was measured along a 55 mile transect from the East River into western and central Long Island Sound. The main objectives of this study were to determine the relative levels of contamination from sewage, and to assess its possible biological impact on local waters. The East River-Long Island Sound system receives large volumes of treated sewage and industrial effluent as a result of the heavy urbanization of the area. Despite these strong environmental pressures, this study is among the first to report dissolved metal levels from that region. Consistent with the locations of anthropogenic sources, a strong cast-west concentration gradient was observed for Ag, Pb, NO3 and PO4 with the highest levels found in the East River. In contrast, dissolved Cd and Cu were relatively constant throughout the area of study, suggesting that sewage sources have a more limited influence on the levels of those metals. Remobilization from contaminated sediments may represent the primary source of Cd and Cu to the Long Island Sound under low-runoff conditions in summer. Chlorophyll a concentrations, used as an indicator of total biomass, were also low in the East River. These low chlorophyll concentrations could not be explained by nutrient or light limitation, water column stratification, or to advection of phytoplankton out of the river during tidal flushing. These preliminary results suggest a potential toxic effect of sewage on the biological communities of the East River. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Responses to recent climatic changes in the sediment of subarctic Lake Saanajarvi in northwestern Finnish Lapland are studied by comparison of various biological and sedimentological proxies with the 200-year long climate record, specifically reconstructed for the site using a data-set of European-wide meteorological data. The multi-proxy evidence of simultaneously changing diatom, Cladocera, and chrysophyte assemblages along with the increased rates of organic matter accumulation and pigment concentrations suggest that the lake has undergone a distinct typological change starting from the turn of the 20th century. This change, indicating an increase in lake productivity, parallels a pronounced rise in the meteorologically reconstructed mean annual and summer temperatures in the region between ca. 1850 and 1930 s. We postulate that, during the Little Ice Age, the lake was not, or was only weakly, thermally stratified during summer, whereas the subsequent increase in air and hence epilimnetic water temperatures resulted in the development of the present summer stratification. The increased thermal stability of the lake created more suitable conditions for the growth of phyto- and zooplankton and changed the overall primary production from benthos to plankton. Mineral magnetic and carbonaceous particle records suggest long-distance pollution, particularly since the 1920 s, yet the observed changes in lake biota and productivity can hardly be explained by this very minor background pollution; the 20th century species configurations are typical of neutral waters and do not indicate any response to pollution.

AB  - We investigated strategies to enhance populations of bay scallops, Argopecten irradians irradians (Lamarck, 1819), in a presumably recruitment-limited natural habitat. At present, the Niantic River estuary supports only a minor bay scallop population that is harvested recreationally. Three enhancement strategies were evaluated; (1) collection and redistribution of natural spatfall, (2) introduction and over-wintering of hatchery-reared stock into natural habitat to provide new spawning stock, and (3) over-wintering of hatchery-reared stock in suspension culture for creation of mobile spawner sanctuaries. An assessment of natural bay scallop recruitment in the Niantic River conducted in 1997 indicated that few spat were found, they were widely dispersed within the river, and peak spawning occurred in late July 1997. Direct re-seeding was evaluated as an enhancement measure by planting hatchery-reared scallops (congruent to 38 mm shell height) in small-scale, 100-m(2) plots at different times and densities. Time of planting and the inferred predation intensity were major factors affecting survival; whereas, planting density had no significant effect. Approximately 9,000 scallops (35-45 mm shell height), broadcast within an eelgrass bed in November 1997, had high over-winter survival and underwent gametogenesis and spawning during 1998. Of 26,000 bay scallops (congruent to 45 mm shell height) over-wintered in suspension culture from 1998-1999, approximately 60-80% survived, and these scallops spawned in mobile sanctuaries, during the summer of 1999. There is good potential for using aquacultural methods for enhancement of bay scallop populations when natural recruitment is poor and habitat and environmental conditions are not limiting.

AB  - The Kenaga nomogram was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the mid 1970s and has since been used prior to the registration of a pesticide to estimate the maximum potential pesticide residue level on plant material in the food chain of wildlife. The objective of this study was to evaluate the nomogram using field data. Six pesticides representing a variety of pesticide classes were applied to 15 plant species. Five of the six nomogram categories were tested with plant parts representing differences in surface morphology (i.e., glabrous vs. pubescent leaves). The sixth category was a mixed-grass community seeded with three grass species. Pesticide residue levels were determined the day of application and up to 32 d afterward. While the linear nomogram model does not represent the data as well as other models, relatively few data points (10%) collected on the day of pesticide application exceeded the nomogram predictions. The one systemic pesticide tested had degradation rates similar to nonsystemic pesticides in most categories. Present nomogram categories were significantly different from each other in most cases. However, the forage category should be combined with the leaves and leafy-crop category and have higher estimated residue levels than the Kenaga nomogram. A considerable amount of variation occurs in the level of pesticide residue on plant materials even under controlled experimental conditions and therefore nomogram values should be used as an estimate only until actual field residue data are available. The nomogram, with modifications, appears to be a reasonable regulatory device if careful thought is given in selecting the plant category for making residue estimates.

AB  - Ecological restoration of open-pit mine wasteland is critical to the sustainable development of the mining industry. Using high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed soil properties and nematode community structure and function to evaluate the impact of ecological package restoration on the quality of underground ecosystem reclamation in desert steppe open-pit mine wasteland. After 7 years of ecological package restoration at an open-pit quarry, two management methods (annual removal of dominant plant genera and annual reseeding of missing plants) achieved the expected outcomes of the restoration project (return to the conditions of the pre-disturbed ecosystem). Based on LEfSe multi-level discriminant analysis and shared genera analysis, we suggest that Oxydirus, Dorylaimus, Trichotylenchus, Plectus, Scutylenchus, Paratylenchus, Tylencholaimus, and Cephalobus may be the key soil nematode genera in the damaged open-pit quarry ecosystem. We also evaluated the soil health status of different ecological package restoration time periods (2 and 5 years) at an abandoned desert steppe open-pit iron mine by analysis of the soil properties and nematode communities. We suggest that ecological package restoration for 5 years achieved the expected restoration outcomes in the open-pit iron mine wasteland. Based on LEfSe analysis and shared genera analysis, we suggest that Acrobeles, Microdorylaimus, Cehalobus, Tripylina, and Ecumenicus may be the key soil nematode genera in the damaged open-pit iron mine ecosystem. Our findings provide a reference for evaluating the reclamation effect of ecological package restoration in open-pit mine areas.

AB  - Background: Lycopene, one of the carotenoids, was increasingly attractive thanks to the significant nutritional and pharmaceutical value, causing the numerous demands of non-chemically synthesized lycopene. However, the insufficient lycopene production led to the high price. One potential way to ameliorate the situation was to elevate the extraction efficiency of lycopene by emerging technologies such as ultrasound-assisted extraction, microwave-assisted extraction. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation of these technologies. Therefore, this review is to comprehensively evaluate these technologies. Scope and approach: The market investigations indicated the huge demands of lycopene. Rising challenges spawned many new assisted technologies to weaken the hindrances in lycopene extraction. This review mainly discussed the emerging technologies for natural lycopene extraction. In addition, the evaluation of various technologies was performed, including the influences on isomerization and degradation, economic analysis and sustainability analysis. Key findings and conclusions: Hindrances of lycopene extraction from cells were illustrated. Besides, almost all the treatments could elevate the efficiency to different extents, which offered various ideas and pathways for lycopene extraction. And the summarization of advantages and disadvantages indicated the promising application potential. Many technologies could affect the isomerization and degradation of lycopene, indicating the necessity to control the extraction conditions. Statistical analysis presented comprehensive comparisons of key indicators (temperature, time, L/S and yield), and supported further evaluation. The economic analysis and sustainability analysis indicated that the cost and environmental effects varied with methods. In the future, methods with low cost, high efficiency and environment-friendly effects will be preferred.

AB  - Magnetic susceptibility (MS) is a logging method commonly used for investigating lithostratigraphic features in marine sediments or petrophysical parameters. In this paper, an application of MS core logging as a tool identifying paleoenvironment and potential high organic matter content will be presented. The aim of the study was to define the relationship between magnetic methods, Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, and the results of natural gamma-ray wire-line logging. The MS logging was conducted on six drill cores from exploration boreholes in lower Paleozoic shales from the Baltic Basin, northern Poland. In each drill core, an interval of approximately 200 m was examined. The samples for laboratory measurements were taken from two drill cores more than 3500 m deep. The intervals of rock with variable amounts of organic matter were analyzed. The results indicate that MS variations in the analyzed rocks are strongly connected with the percent amount of chlorite and has a positive correlation with oxygen and bioturbation indices while having a negative correlation with total organic carbon. This relationship suggests that MS values were influenced by the redox conditions on the seabed in the early stages of diagenesis. Another important finding was that the MS value is associated with a ferroan chlorite amount. Therefore, it is critical to define the origin of chlorite. When considering the thermal history of studied rocks (buried above 80 degrees C), it is likely that chlorite was of a diagenetic origin. However, to confirm this assumption, Fe-rich clays that are precursors for diagenetic chlorite have to be defined.

AB  - Many animals engage in a behavior known as natal philopatry, where after sexual maturity they return to their own birthplaces for subsequent reproduction. There are many proposed ultimate factors that may underlie the evolution of natal philopatry, such as genetic optimization, suitable living conditions, and friendly neighbors, which can improve the survival rates of offspring. However, here we propose that a key factor that has been overlooked could be the colonization of gut microbiota during early life and the effects these microorganisms have on host performance and fitness. In addition to the bacteria transmitted from the mother to offspring, microbes from the surrounding environment also account for a large proportion of the developing gut microbiome. While it was long believed that microbial species all have global distributions, we now know that there are substantial geographic differences and dispersal limitations to environmental microbes. The establishment of gut microbiota during early life has enormous impacts on animal development, including energy metabolism, training of the immune system, and cognitive development. Moreover, these microbial effects scale to influence animal performance and fitness, raising the possibility for natural selection to act on the integrated combination of gut microbial communities and host genetics (i.e. the holobiont). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hypothesis: that optimization of host-microbe-environment interactions represents a potentially important yet overlooked reason for natal philopatry. Microbiota obtained by natal philopatry could help animals adapt to the environment and improve the survival rates of their young. We propose future directions to test these ideas, and the implications that this hypothesis has for our understanding of host-microbe interactions.

AB  - Seed quality and seed germination are the major indicators determining the success of regeneration and structure in natural forest ecosystems. This study focuses on problems associated with seed quality and seed germination under air pollution impacts in the surrounding forest ecosystems of Ulaanbaatar city of Mongolia. The objectives were to test whether there was any negative effect of air pollutants on the site index, and to analyze the relationship between seed quality and distance from the city center (maximum pollution). The study was carried out in natural larch forests (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) growing in the vicinity of the capital of Mongolia. A total of eight 100x100 m (1 ha) sample plots were laid out using completely randomized sampling design along the main wind direction. Remoteness from the city center was 10, 15, 20 and 30 km both to the north and to the south. Results showed a high variation in stand mean height (p > 0.001) and diameter (p > 0.001) among selected forest areas. In general, all sampled forests belonged to bonitet / quality classes III, IV and V, which are considered as relatively poor growing conditions in terms of site index. Therefore, greater site index and seed quality were observed in the most distant locations from the city center, and contrary. the poorest seed quality was detected in locations close to the city center. This emphasizes that forests growing close to pollution sources exist with a potential risk of degradation, and their reproductive organs are more sensitive to the effects of pollutants.

AB  - Atlantids are holoplanktonic gastropods present in tropical to sub-polar waters, and have gained an increasing interest due to their potential use as biological indicators of climate change and ocean acidification. However, there is a lack of information regarding their distribution for large areas of some oceans, particularly in the California Current System (CCS), which has been used as a model for many acidification studies and where intense warming events occur. The distribution patterns of 18 species of Atlantidae off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, representing 90% of the atlantid species registered for the Pacific Ocean, were analyzed during a period of warm anomalies associated with the El Nino of 2015-2016 and the 2014-2016 marine heat wave (MHW). The species distribution showed 3 groups: 2 in the north (coastal and oceanic) and 1 in the south. The limit of distribution between these 3 groups was found in the vicinity of Punta Eugenia (PE). The southernmost community of atlantids was characterized by tropical and subtropical species that were transported northward due to coastal advection of warm waters associated with the El Nino of 2015-2016. North of PE, the warm-water affinity oceanic species Atlanta rosea and A. fragilis were found, evidencing the entrance of water from the Central Pacific related to MHW which affected the oceanic region off the coast of PE. The response of the distribution patterns proves that atlantids can be used as biological indicators, as they reflect the effect of environmental anomalies in the southern CCS.

AB  - The biodiversity of algal communities and environmental conditions were investigated in the springs of Mt. Konjuh. The assemblages of 20 springs emerging from different lithologies (limestones and ophiolites, respectively) comprised 234 algal taxa. Diatoms and cyanobacteria were the most species-rich groups. The most common alkaliphilic, circumneutral, and eutraphentic diatoms were represented by the genera Gomphonema, Nitzschia, Navicula, Cymbella, and Achnanthidium, and by the cyanobacterial genus Phormidium. Hierarchical clustering and SIMPROF analysis based on relative algal abundance clustered springs into six groups, separating them mainly according to spring type and lithology. Indicator species for groups and springs on different lithological substrata were singled out, revealing 33 taxa with preferences for ophiolites, and 20 taxa with preferences for carbonates. The values of the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were moderately high per spring location, and similar for the two groups of springs on different lithologies. A higher similarity in species composition was noted between springs on ophiolites and limestones than between springs on ophiolites and other types of siliceous substrata. The present study suggests that algal assemblages in springs emerging from ophiolites, even those made up by a preponderance of silicates, should be analyzed separately from those related to springs on other siliceous substrata. The results obtained showed that most of the springs studied are affected by anthropogenic impacts and morphological alterations leading to the dominance of highly competitive meso- and eutraphentic algal species, thus emphasizing the importance of further investigation and conservation of these habitats.

AB  - Bonefish (Albula vulpes) support a world-renowned fishery in South Florida, USA. However, fishing guides and anglers have been reporting significant declines in bonefish angling quality over that past three decades. In the absence of any long-term bonefish stock and ecosystem assessments, the cause of this decline in the fishery is unclear. Here we summarize our current knowledge of bonefish ecology in Florida and discuss potential causes of fishery decline. Reductions and alterations in freshwater flows from the Everglades have caused major changes in bonefish habitat, including acute (anoxic conditions) and chronic (changes in benthic flora and fauna) effects in Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay. Various pollutants from agricultural and urban runoff may also be impacting bonefish population(s) directly and/or indirectly throughout their range. Efforts to locate juvenile A. vulpes in Florida have been largely unsuccessful to date, suggesting abundances may be low, and/or juveniles have unknown habitat requirements in Florida. Further, bonefish larvae may be sourced from adult individuals outside of Florida in areas such as Cuba or Mexico, in which case bonefish conservation in other regions is highly relevant to the Florida population. Extreme weather events may have also contributed to the decline; an extreme cold spell in 2010 caused significant bonefish mortality and coincided with documented declines in the fishery. The fishery may also be impacting the population. We outline research needs and potential approaches to better understand the causes of the bonefish decline in Florida and restore populations of this ecologically and socioeconomically important species.

AB  - Basic oxygen furnace slags (BOS) are by-products of basic oxygen steel production. Whereas the solubility of some elements from these slags has been well investigated, information about the mineralogy and related leaching, i.e., availability of the environmentally relevant elements chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and vanadium (V), is still lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate these issues with a modified, four-fraction-based, sequential extraction procedure (F1-F4), combined with X-ray diffraction, of two BOS. Extractants with increasing strength were used (F1 demineralized water, F2 CH3COOH + HCl, F3 Na(2)EDTA + NH2OH center dot HCl, and F4 HF + HNO3 + H2O2), and after each fraction, X-ray diffraction was performed. The recovery of Cr was moderate (66.5%) for one BOS, but significantly better (100.2%) for the other one. High recoveries were achieved for the other elements (Mo, 100.8-107.9% and V, 112.6-87.0%), indicating that the sequential extraction procedure was reliable when adapted to BOS. The results showed that Cr and Mo primarily occurred in F4, representing rather immobile elements under natural conditions, which were strongly bound into/onto Fe minerals (srebrodolskite, magnetite, hematite, or wustite). In contrast, V was more mobile with proportional higher findings in F2 and F3, and the X-ray diffraction results reveal that V was not solely bound into Ca minerals (larnite, hatrurite, kirschsteinite, and calcite), but also bound to Fe minerals. The results indicated that the total amount of recovery was a poor indicator of the availability of elements and did not correspond to the leaching of elements from BOS.

AB  - Neighbouring heterospecific plants are often observed to reduce the probability of herbivore attack on a given focal plant. While this pattern of associational resistance is frequently reported, experimental evidence for underlying mechanisms is rare particularly for potential plant species diversity effects on focal host plants and their physical environment. Here, we used an established forest diversity experiment to determine whether tree diversity effects on an important insect pest are driven by concomitant changes in host tree growth or the light environment. We examined the effects of tree species richness, canopy cover and tree growth on the probability of occurrence, the abundance, and volume of galls caused by the pineapple gall adelgid Adelges abietis on Norway spruce. Although tree diversity had no effect on gall abundance, we observed that both the probability of gall presence and gall volume (an indicator of maternal fecundity) decreased with tree species richness and canopy cover around host spruce trees. Structural equation models revealed that effects of tree species richness on gall presence and volume were mediated by concurrent increases in canopy cover rather than changes in tree growth or host tree density. As canopy cover did not influence tree or shoot growth, patterns of associational resistance appear to be driven by improved host tree quality or more favourable microclimatic conditions in monocultures compared to mixed-stands. Our study therefore demonstrates that changes in forest structure may be critical to understanding the responses of herbivores to plant diversity and may underpin associational effects in forest ecosystems.

AB  - We describe for the first time the larval development and stages of the recently described Ziegler's Crocodile Newt (Tylototriton ziegleri), an endemic species to northern Vietnam. Diagnostic morphological characters are provided for Grosse (1997, 2013) stages 27-32, 35-36, and 44-45, as well as comparisons with larval stages of other Tylototriton representatives. In addition, natural history data and an ecological assessment of the breeding niche are presented for T. ziegleri as well as for T. vietnamensis, from whom the former species was only recently taxonomically separated. We provide data extending the known breeding season of these two cryptic species in the North of Vietnam, which in fact lasts from April until July. On average, the clutches of T. ziegleri consisted of 67 +/- 32 eggs, were found on rock and soil substrates with a distance of 50 +/- 28 cm from water, whereas the clutches of T. vietnamensis were significantly smaller (43 +/- 19 eggs), found only on soil and were further distant from water (80 +/- 41 cm). The known maximum altitudinal distribution of T. vietnamensis is herein increased to 980 m above sea level. Based on the examples of T. ziegleri and T. vietnamensis, this study highlights how important it is to uncover cryptic species, define their exact distribution range, and investigate potential differences in ecological adaptations in order to assess the conservation status, develop proper conservation planning and provide suitable conditions for potential ex situ breeding programs.

AB  - Following floods experienced in southwestern Alberta in June 2013, 36 palaeoenvironmental sediment samples were collected from the banks of four affected streams: the Kananaskis River, Highwood River, Tongue Creek and Jumping-pound Creek. The sampled layers were deposited during the Holocene, and provide evidence of riparian ecology in the region since the end of the last glacial interval. The samples were processed to extract sub-fossil macroremains (including seeds, fruits, and aquatic and terrestrial mollusc shells). Macrofossils are particularly useful for creating fine-resolution (site-specific) reconstructions. An innovative aspect of this study was the derivation of regional bioclimatic trends through time. This was achieved by applying a dual-layered weighted calibration function which incorporated the relative productivity of indicator taxa, their modelled climatic optima, and the influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on their ecological niche. Optima and climatic influence values were calculated using the machine-learning maximum entropy environmental niche modelling tool, MAXENT, trained on global occurrence records for the taxa. This study aimed to address gaps in prior palaeoenvironmental research, allowing for a spatially explicit quantitative reconstruction of climate in the transitional foothill region near Calgary. Results indicated warm conditions immediately following glacial retreat, followed by an early to mid-Holocene cooling which coincided with the driest interval. Temperature and moisture regimes oscillated in the mid-Holocene, exhibiting the highest values for both parameters. Increased moisture was at least in part prompted by increased input from summer glacial meltwater (the result of higher summer temperatures) which added to the riparian water budget. The mid-to late Holocene, and up to modern times, showed a gradual decrease in both moisture and temperature, until stabilizing near the Holocene average.

AB  - Lake extent is an indicator of water capacity as well as the aquatic ecological and environmental conditions. Due to the small sizes and rapid water dynamics, monitoring the extent of small lakes fluctuating between 2.5 and 30 km(2) require observations with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. The paper applied an improved surface reflectance (SR) downscaling method (i.e., IMAR (Improved Modified Adaptive Regression model)) to downscale the daily SR acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra platform to a consistent 250-m resolution, and derived monthly water extent of four small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (Longre Co, Ayonggongma Co, Ayonggama Co, and Ayongwama Co)) from 2000 to 2014. Using Landsat ETM+ acquired on the same date, the downscaled MODIS SR and identified water extent were compared to the original MODIS, observations downscaled using an early SR downscaling method (MAR (Modified Adaptive Regression model)) and Wavelet fusion. The results showed IMAR achieved the highest correlation coefficients (R-2) (0.89-0.957 for SR and 0.79-0.933 for water extent). The errors in the derived water extents were significantly decreased comparing to the results of MAR and Wavelet fusion, and lakes morphometry of IMAR is more comparable to Landsat results. The detected lake extents dynamic between 2000 and 2014 were analyzed using the trend and season decomposition model (BFAST), indicating an increasing trend after 2005, and it likely had higher correlations with temperature and precipitation variation in the Tibetan region (R-2: 0.598-0.728 and 0.61-0.735, respectively).

AB  - In conservation strategies of marine ecosystems, priority is given to habitat-structuring foundation species (e.g. seagrasses, mangroves and reef-building corals, shellfish) with the implicit goal to protect or restore associated communities and their interactions. However, the number and accuracy of community level metrics to measure the success of these strategies are limited. Using intertidal shellfish reefs as a model, we tested to what extent foundation species alter community and food web structure, and explored whether basic metrics of food web structure are useful indicators of ecosystem complexity compared to other often-used indices. We found that shellfish reefs strongly modified community and food web structure by modifying habitat conditions (e.g. hydrodynamics, sediment grain size). Stable isotope-based food web reconstruction captured important differences between communities from bare mudflat and shellfish reefs that did not emerge from classic abundance or diversity measures. On shellfish reefs, link density and the number of top predators were consistently higher, while both connectance and the richness of intermediate species was lower. Species richness (+42%), species density (+ 79%) and total biomass of benthos, fish and birds (+41%) was also higher on shellfish reefs, but this did not affect the Shannon diversity or Evenness. Hence, our results showed that basic food web metrics such as link density and number of top consumers and intermediate species combined with traditional measures of species richness can provide a robust tool to measure conservation and restoration success. We therefore suggest that these metrics are included as Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV), and implemented as ecosystem health indicators in legislative frameworks such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).

AB  - Hydrological indicators (HIs) are commonly used in eco-hydrological studies (i.e. environmental flow and hydrological status assessment). Their computation is based on streamflow data, and if measured data are not available, hydrological models can be used to generate flow data. The present paper describes a study that aimed to predict streamflow in a temporary river and to analyze the general reliability of some hydrological indicators evaluated by using simulated data instead of measured flow data. The SWAT model was used to predict daily streamflow in a river section of the Celone river (Puglia, Italy). Several HIs characterizing the patterns of river flow or specific hydrological components were evaluated using observed and simulated streamflow. The results show that the SWAT model is able to simulate streamflow in temporary river systems, but its performance under extreme low flow conditions may be a weak point. When simulated streamflow time series were used, the replicability of the His evaluated using a rigorous statistical methodology ranged from good to limited. Good performance was found for the magnitude of discharge in wet months (average monthly flow from November to May), for the high flow indicators (annual maxima, 1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day mean flow) and timing, while limited performance was detected for low flow indicators (annual minimum 1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day mean flow) and the number of zero flow days. Better performance for low flow indicators was found after introducing the zero-flow threshold. This type of eco-hydrological study may contribute to characterizing the flow regime and its alterations in regions with scarce data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Relationships between the assemblage structure of mayflies (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) and habitat conditions in wadis were explored in 87 localities of the North Algeria with 17 environmental variables and presence / absence data on Ephemeroptera species. The objective of this work is to (1) identify the environmental variables driving the composition of mayfly assemblages at the regional scale; (2) define the ecological preferences of mayflies species collected along environmental gradients, using recently developed statistical tools, including Outlying Mean Index Analysis (OMI) and (3) describe the assemblages of species that occur in similar habitats. 27 species of Ephemeroptera were recorded, about half of the entire Algerian mayfly fauna. Species richness is high (SR > 10), in spring, at stations located in mountain rivers (Blidean Atlas, Djurdjura) between altitude 300 to 600m. Water mineralization and altitude are the most important parameters which affected the abundance of Algerian mayfly species (North Algeria). In less extent, precipitation, substrate size, organic pollution and riparian vegetation explain also this distribution. However dissolved oxygen, pH and hydraulic factors (current velocity, depth) seem to be secondary. Baetis rhodani, Caenis luctuosa, Ecdyonurus rothschildi and Baetis pavidus are the most tolerant species against the considered variables. Rhithrogena sp. (RTol = 0.39) is characterized by narrow habitat tolerance. As for Habrophlebia gr. fusca and Alainites sp., they are linked to the headwaters (altitude), Labiobaetis neglectus and Cloeon dipterum to heavily mineralized waters (Cl and Mg). Cheleocloeon dimorphicum, Choroterpes (Ch.) atlas and Procloeon gr. bifidum occur in warm waters and Cloeon gr. simile is able to tolerate salty waters (high conductivity). Finally, Caenis pusilla, Acentrella sinaica and Ecdyonurus rothschildi, despite their narrow marginality, prefer the covered sites with coarse substrate and tolerate light pollution.

AB  - The composition, biomass and dynamics of autotrophic picoplankton (APP, size range of 0.2-2 mm) in a subtropical reservoir (Cerrillos, Puerto Rico) were examined from January to December 2013. Samples were collected monthly in the limnetic zone. Because of their small size, APP were identified and quantified using flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. The warm monomictic nature of this reservoir resulted in thermal stratification during most of the year. Near surface dissolved oxygen was relatively high (7.61 mg/L). However, hypoxic and anoxic conditions were present in the hypolimnion during the whole period of study. Flow cytometry analyses allowed the identification of two populations of picoplanktonic organisms. Picocyanobacteria groups (phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus type) were dominant throughout the study, with maximum summer abundances of 6.6 x 10(4) cells/mL, although picoeukaryotes were temporally important. Annual mean total chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the euphotic zone was 7.54 +/- 3.41 mu g/L. Fractionated Chl-a exhibited a relatively constant pattern: ranging from 0.24 to 1.99 mu g/L. The average contribution of APP to total Chl-a concentration was 11%. Chl-a concentration reflected the annual variation in picoplankton, being higher during summer when solar radiation was also higher. The picoplanktonic community was structured in accordance to thermal stratification, nutrients and light availability. Understanding the dynamics of picoplankton and their response to environmental change are important because they are a good indicator of the trophic status of reservoirs, especially drinking water reservoirs, and can guide management decisions.

AB  - In coping with rapid urbanization resulting from increased urban growth, limited resources, and the threat of natural and man-made disasters, cities are being pressured to change. The United Nations created goals to address these issues, drafting the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Goal 11 of the SDGs addresses issues pertaining to urban development, and focuses on attaining safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities. In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for globally-identified and comparable indicators. The City Prosperity Index (CPI) has been recognized as a valuable tool in evaluating the social, economic and physical aspects of cities. However, the CPI is not sufficient in itself in translating information obtained through evaluation into information relevant to policy-making and planning at the neighbourhood level. Positive urban change can be achieved through improvements made to neighbourhoods, as the core units of cities. Many countries have developed several tools to assess neighbourhoods, applying various indicators to guide the planning process, in an effort to attain sustainability. Many Turkish cities are experiencing the negative effects of rapid urbanization. Within the scope of this study, three neighbourhoods in the historic urban core of Bursa in Turkey have been assessed through Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Neighbourhood Pattern and Design (LEED-NPD) under LEED Neighbourhood Development (LEED-ND). By analyzing the existing conditions, this study aims to present the strengths and weaknesses of the case study area and establish a documental and informational base, in order to respond with a plan at the neighbourhood level.

AB  - The exposure to agrochemicals during farming activities affects the function of the reproductive system, as revealed by the increasing worldwide evidence of male infertility amongst farmers. The main objective of this study was to untangle the link between agricultural practices and male reproductive impairment due to chronic exposure to xenobiotics (such as agrochemicals) in conventional and organic farming environments. For this purpose, male wild mice (Mus musculus) populations from sites representing two distinct farming practices (conventional and organic farming systems) were used as bio-indicators for observable effects of testicular damage, namely on a set of histological and cellular parameters: (i) relative volumetric density of different spermatogenic cells and interstitial space; (ii) damage in the seminiferous tubules and (iii) apoptotic cells in the germinal epithelium. Results showed that mice from the conventional farming site bioaccumulated higher Pb hepatic loads, while mice from the organic farming site tend to bioaccumulate higher Cd hepatic loads. In general, for the analyzed testicular damage related parameters, mice from the organic farming site showed a similar performance than mice from the reference site. Mice from the conventional farming site stood out not only by underperforming in most studied parameters, while displaying an association between Pb hepatic loads and the observed testicular structural and functional disruption, but also by the increased stress index (Integrated Biomarker Response value). This study highlights the potential damaging effects of conventional farming practices on testicular structure and function, under natural conditions, raising concern about ensuing fertility risks for farmers.

AB  - Desertification is one of the main environmental and also social and economic problems facing Iran. Seventeen out of 31 Iranian provinces, which are home to approximately 70% of the total population, are affected by desertification. This study aimed to use geographic information system (GIS) and fuzzy logic for mapping environmentally sensitive areas to desertification based on Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use approach in Isfahan province, central Iran. Six desertification indicators including climate, soil, vegetation, soil erosion, groundwater, and management and policy quality were used to determine various types of environmentally sensitive areas to desertification. Seventeen desertification indices affecting the quality of each indicator were spatially mapped and assigned a value between 0 and 1 using a fuzzy logic option of ArcSDM3 software in GIS environment. Results showed that a 217% of the study area was classified as critical, 70% as fragile and 55% as potential, and 29% of the area was not affected by desertification. In the town of Borkhar, 642% of the area was classified as critical, followed by the towns of Isfahan and Nayin with 402% and 318%, respectively. Results at provincial scale indicated that the climate indicator and humidity index with a weighting mean of 071 and 077 were the most affective factors in the desertification of the study area. The developed model in this study can be used for mapping desertification status in other 16 provinces that contain desert areas. These assessments provide a GIS-based desertification database that Iran as a member of the United Nation Convention to Combat Desertification can use to report the condition of desertification at national scale.

AB  - Nebkhas are important indicators of land degradation in desert steppes and play an important role in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of desert steppe ecosystems. This study examined the relationship between the diversity of plant species and nebkha morphology during different growth stages of the nebkhas. In this study, each nebkha is defined as a self-contained unit. The species composition and vegetation patterns within each unit during different stages of formation were investigated, while also the plant species within the internebkha area of the desert steppe field were examined. Results show that more than 90% of the species within the nebkha units were herbaceous. In developing nebkhas, the increase in nebkha size was associated with an increase in the herb species richness but a decrease in the overall plant density. When nebkha size was constant, similar correlations with species richness or density were found. The richness of species within the internebkha area was significantly higher compared to developing nebkhas during periods of growth, but lower when nebkha development was complete and growth hadstalled. The density of species was significantly higher in the nebkhas than the inter-nebkha area during all developmental periods. Thus, nebkhas provide a highly favorable condition for plant recruitment and survival when fully developed. However, when nebkhas are still forming, the inter-nebldia areas provide greater plant support. These results have important implications to biodiversity conservation in desert steppe fields.

AB  - Investigating the mechanisms behind the impact of heavy metal pollution on aquatic ecosystems is urgently required. Due to increasing growth in the mining sector, pollution has become a serious threat to water resources and aquatic biodiversity and is causing unfavorable environmental changes and human health hazards. The aim of the present study was to investigate and assess the environmental risks of heavy metal pollution of river ecosystems in the Lake Sevan and Debed River catchment basins in Armenia, and a thorough study of their qualitative and quantitative parameters. Water samples were taken from the risky river sites of the Sevan and Debed basins in May and August 2013 and 2014. Investigations showed that due to mining and metallurgical industrial activities and the insufficient management of industrial waste and wastewater, the river ecosystems in these territories were exposed to heavy metal pollution, the degree of which in some sites of the Sotq, Masrik (Lake Sevan catchment basin), Debed, Alaverdi, Akhtala, and Chochkan (Debed River catchment basin) rivers may have posed health risks to aquatic life as well as to humans (at least in the case of river water used for drinking purposes). The results of a phytoplankton community study revealed that a decrease in the species diversity of planktonic algae in the investigated rivers was mainly conditioned by the impact of heavy metal pollution induced by mining and metallurgical industrial activities in the Lake Sevan and Debed River catchment basins.

AB  - Over the past 30 years of rapid development, industrial parks have been an important sustained resource for economic development in China. However, due to economic yield-oriented policy and deficient scientific planning, excessive resource consumption and environmental pollution caused by industrial activities in industrial parks has led to ecological degradation and loss in the local areas. To respond to this issue, many researchers have focused on studying the overall efficiency of industrial parks from the perspective of metabolism of material and energy and have proposed some methods such as life cycle assessment, system of environmental economic accounting (SEEA), material flow analysis, and emergy synthesis, which indeed have improved the methods of evaluating industrial activities shift from only an economic perspective to a more comprehensive direction. However, these approaches have only focused on the efficiency of industrial activities while ignoring ecological conditions of the local areas. This article addressed this issue by proposing an emergy-ecological footprint hybrid model to show how this method could be applied to demonstrate both the energy metabolism of industrial parks' activities and ecological capacity of the local areas. We took the Shenyang economic technological development area (SETDA) and the Fuzhou Qingkou investment zone (FZQKIZ) as case studies to validate this method. Results showed that although the environmental burden of SETDA was heavier than FZQKIZ, the ecological capacity of surplus for SETDA was also stronger than FZQKIZ, which caused ecological surplus of SETDA compared with FZQKIZ. This study indicated that we should pay more attention to ecological capacity of the local areas surrounding industrial parks rather than only focusing on environmental impacts caused by industrial activities.

AB  - Dinoflagellates constitute a large proportion of the planktonic biomass from marine to freshwater environments. Some species produce a preservable organic-walled resting cyst (dinocyst) during the sexual phase of their life cycle that is an important link between the organisms, the environment in which their parent motile theca grew, and the sedimentary record. Despite their abundance and widespread usage as proxy indicators for environmental conditions, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the dinocyst wall chemical composition. It is likely that numerous factors, including phylogeny and life strategy, determine the cyst wall chemistry. However, the extent to which this composition varies based on inherent (phylogenetic) or variable (ecological) factors has not been studied. To address this, we used micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to analyze nine cyst species produced by either phototrophic or heterotrophic dinoflagellates from the extant orders Gonyaulacales, Gymnodiniales, and Peridiniales. Based on the presence of characteristic functional groups, two significantly different cyst wall compositions are observed that correspond to the dinoflagellate's nutritional strategy. The dinocyst wall compositions analyzed appeared carbohydrate-based, but the cyst wall produced by phototrophic dinoflagellates suggested a cellulose-like glucan, while heterotrophic forms produced a nitrogen-rich glycan. This constitutes the first empirical evidence nutritional strategy is related to different dinocyst wall chemistries. Our results indicated phylogeny was less important for predicting composition than the nutritional strategy of the dinoflagellate, suggesting potential for cyst wall chemistry to infer past nutritional strategies of extinct taxa preserved in the sedimentary record.

AB  - 'Environmental cognitive stress' a hybrid model combining environmental stress and cognitive determinants of pro-environmental behavior is explored among Australians living in contrasting 'micro' climates in the same river catchment system. Peoples' climate risk perceptions are mediated by their connections to local environment, observations of environmental change and personal weather experiences. A longitudinal study randomly sampled 1,162 Hunter Valley coastal and rural residents in New South Wales. Telephone interviewers (2008) recruited lakeside homeowners 'at risk' of sea level rise, nearby 'control' residents and a comparable farming area group. Follow-up interviews (2011) located 81.5 % of the original sample. Fifty-six items based on the model asked about climate change observations, concerns, impacts and actions. Statistically significant rural-suburban and time differences were found. The rural sample was attuned to conditions affecting agricultural productivity: They worried about drought and heat, saw trees dying and changes to seasons and natural rhythms. They anticipate the impact of water scarcity, conserve water and value protecting plants and animals. Compared to higher elevation residents, lake dwellers observed marine life loss, worry about sea level rise and predict the decline of property values. Across time, all groups' perceptions of warming indicators declined. Concerns and impacts were high and generally stayed high, as did actions related to energy use. No differences emerged in beliefs about climate warming. Climate change observations, along with concerns and actions, have important implications for the environmental cognitive stress model. Overall, dynamic changes in residents' understandings are related to a changing policy environment, the vicissitudes of climate debates and weather experiences, including extreme swings from inundation to drought.

AB  - Rainfall events can introduce large amount of microbial contaminants including human enteric viruses into surface water by intermittent discharges from combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The present study aimed to investigate the effect of rainfall events on viral loads in surface waters impacted by CSO and the reliability of molecular methods for detection of enteric viruses. The reliability of virus detection in the samples was assessed by using process controls for virus concentration, nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) steps, which allowed accurate estimation of virus detection efficiencies. Recovery efficiencies of poliovirus in river water samples collected during rainfall events (<10%) were lower than those during dry weather conditions (>10%). The log(10)-transformed virus concentration efficiency was negatively correlated with suspended solid concentration (r(2) = 0.86) that increased significantly during rainfall events. Efficiencies of DNA extraction and qPCR steps determined with adenovirus type 5 and a primer sharing control, respectively, were lower in dry weather. However, no clear relationship was observed between organic water quality parameters and efficiencies of these two steps. Observed concentrations of indigenous enteric adenoviruses, GII-noroviruses, enteroviruses, and Aichi viruses increased during rainfall events even though the virus concentration efficiency was presumed to be lower than in dry weather. The present study highlights the importance of using appropriate process controls to evaluate accurately the concentration of water borne enteric viruses in natural waters impacted by wastewater discharge, stormwater, and CSOs.

AB  - Copper (Cu) has been the subject of intensive research over several decades as numerous evidence robustly support the involvement of excess Cu induced neurotoxicity in hepatocerebral (Wilson's disease) and neurodegenerative disorders (especially Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease); notwithstanding, the ideal Cu neurotoxicity biomarker/s for early prognosis remains elusive. Nonceruloplasmin bound Cu is a biological marker of Wilson's disease and recent studies have shown that its levels are also increased in Alzheimer's disease. Copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase seems to be the other most promising biomarker of Cu toxicity (subject to its validation). Serum/plasma Cu, urine Cu and ceruloplasmin concentrations, most widely used laboratory indicators to diagnose Wilson's disease, are not specific for Cu excess milieu as these are also influenced by age, sex, inflammation and hormonal status. High inter-individual variability, nonexistence of standardized assays and non-specificity limit the use of other cuproenzymes as biomarkers of Cu neurotoxicity. The majority of Cu neurotoxicity biomarker research has focused in plasma/serum where other factors including inflammation, oxidative stress, dietary and environmental factors influence the Cu condition being studied. Proteomics study of cerebrospinal fluid, due to its high specificity and sensitivity represents an alternative approach to study early peripheral Cu neurotoxicity biomarker/s in experimental animals. In addition, network biology, transcriptomics in conjunction with novel in vivo Cu imaging techniques allow us to explore other potential candidates and propose new targets to be studied for chronic Cu neurotoxicity biomarker/s, and for possible therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Fish are particularly sensitive to copper (Cu) because although it is an essential metal, it becomes dangerous for aquatic ecosystems, thus accounting for physiological alterations. In this study, we investigated Cu effects on neurobehavioral activities of Thalassoma pavo and, above all, its recovery strategies by evaluating behavioral disturbances, neurodegeneration, and expression of heat shock protein (HSP)90 and orexin receptor (ORXR). Ornate wrasses exposed to nominal sublethal higher (1.07mg/l) and lower (0.25mg/l) concentrations of CuCl2H2O mostly reduced swimming and feeding activities along with inducing abnormal behaviors in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, ORXR transcripts were mostly upregulated in the diffuse nucleus of the inferior lobe (NDLI, 142%) and the corpus of the cerebellum (CCe, 243%), whereas HSP90 was downregulated only in lateral part of the dorsal telencephalon (Dl, 35%), the nucleus glomerulosus (NG; 40%), and the optic tectum (OT; 33%). Interestingly, when fish were transferred to Cu-free water, some behaviors were promptly rescued, especially in fish previously exposed to the lower Cu concentration. This rescuing tendency was confirmed by evident reductions of argyrophilic signals in Dl (67%), NG (31%), and OT (42%) of fish exposed to 0.25mg/l Cu. Moreover, transcriptional events of both ORXR and HSP90 were further upregulated in order to orchestrate a reactivation of behavioral and neuronal functions. Overall, this study highlights, for the first time, new neuronal strategies against environmental adverse conditions involving both ORXergic system and HSP90 as key elements that may assure, at least in part, protection and recovery processes against toxic agents.

AB  - Large Lake Peipsi (3555km(2)) is divided between two countries, Estonia (44%) and Russia (56%). The southernmost part of the lake, Lake Pihkva, is almost entirely (99%) in Russia, and is continuously being polluted by the greatest inflow to Lake Peipsi, the insufficiently purified River Velikaya. Research on this lake (Lake Peipsi) in the growing season has been possible as a result of EstonianRussian joint expeditions (20032010) in the month of August. Our study has demonstrated statistically significant variances in the hydrochemistry and zoo- and phytoplankton data between the lake parts. Several parameters used for characterizing the lake's ecosystem were considerably higher for Lake Pihkva than for the larger Lake Peipsi s.s. These include increases in TP concentration (3x); TN (2x); Chlorophyll a (3x); biomass of cyanobacteria (4x); Microcystis (4x); Aphanizomenon (5x); abundance of Chydorus sphaericus (5x); Keratella tecta (8x). However, several values were lower in Lake Pihkva than in Lake Peipsi: water transparency (3x); ratio between zoo- and phytoplankton biomasses (2x); cladoceran mean weight (3x); abundance of Eudiaptomus gracilis (1.5x); abundance of Kellicottia longispina (1.8x). Different natural conditions (topography, catchment area, relative depth) and different pollution loads in the lake parts have resulted in apparently different resistances in their ecosystems and different responses to human activity. At present, on the basis of TP data (up to 200mg m(3)), Lake Pihkva appears to act a polluter of adjacent lake part rather than a purification pond.

AB  - The assessment of grassland degradation due to overgrazing is a global challenge in semiarid environments. In particular, investigations of beginning steppe degradation after a change or intensification of the land use are needed in order to detect and adjust detrimental land-use management rapidly and thus prevent severe damages in these sensitive ecosystems. A controlled-grazing experiment was established in Inner Mongolia (China) in 2005 that included ungrazed (UG) and heavily grazed plots with grazing intensities of 4.5 (HG4.5) and 7.5 (HG7.5) sheep per hectare. Several soil and vegetation parameters were investigated at all sites before the start of the experiment. Topsoil samples were analyzed for soil organic C (SOC), total N (Ntot), total S (Stot), and bulk density (BD). As vegetation parameters, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), tiller density (TD), and leaf-area index (LAI) were determined. After 3 y of the grazing experiment, BD increased and SOC, Ntot, Stot, ANPP, and LAI significantly decreased with increasing grazing intensity. These sensitive parameters can be regarded as early-warning indicators for degradation of semiarid grasslands. Vegetation parameters were, however, more sensitive not only to grazing but also to temporal variation of precipitation between 2006 and 2008. Contrary, soil parameters were primarily affected by grazing and resistant against climatic variations. The assessment of starting conditions in the study area and the application of defined grazing intensities is essential for the investigation of short-term degradation in semiarid environments.

AB  - Rice cultivated areas and yield information is indispensable for sustainable management and economic policy making for this strategic food crop. Introduction of high spectral and special resolution satellite data has enabled production of such information in a timely and accurate manner. Knowledge of the spectral reflectance of various land covers is a prerequisite for their identification and study. Evaluation of the spectral reflectance of plants using field spectroradiometry provides the possibility to identify and map different rice varieties especially while using hyperspectral remote sensing. This paper reports the results of the first attempt to evaluate spectral signatures of seven north Iranian rice varieties (Fajr, Hybrid, Khazar, Nemat, Neda, Shiroudi and Tarom plots) in the experimental station of the Iranian Rice Research Institute (main station in Amol, Mazanderan Province). Measurements were carried out using a field spectroradiometer in the range of 350-2,500 nm under natural light and environmental conditions. In order to eliminate erroneous data and also experimental errors in spectral reflectance curves, all curves were individually quality controlled. A set of important vegetation indices sensitive to canopy chlorophyll content, photosynthesis intensity, nitrogen and water content were employed to enhance probable differences in spectral reflectance among various rice varieties. Analysis of variance and Tukey's paired test were then used to compare rice varieties. Using Datt and PRI1 indices, significant differences (alpha= 0.01) were found among rice varieties reflectances in 19 out of 21 cases. This promises the possibility of accurate mapping of rice varieties cultivated areas based on hyperspectral remotely sensed data.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a technique of visualization and staining of nuclei of protonemal cells of Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.)Brid. in order to establish a test of genotoxicity (micronucleus assay). This technique is part of the development of methodology for environmental risk assessment. Bryophytes are often used as biological models in biomonitoring and ecotoxicology. For ecotoxicology studies, there are bioassays, including micronucleus assay. The genotoxicity assay is often practiced in higher plants: we wanted to expand its use to lower plants, like mosses and especially Ceratodon purpureus. To meet the criteria of micronucleus assay, the cells of protonemata of Ceratodon purpureus,ere selected as a model. The liquid culture of protonemata provides the quantity of biomass needed to achieve a bioassay. First, the development of a reproducible method for visualization and staining of the nuclei of protonemal cells was a necessary and prior step to the realization of micronucleus assay. So for this staining stage, the coloring agent used was the acetic orcein. It is the reference coloring agent for the micronucleus test on Vicia faba (AFNOR. 2004). With our assays of staining, we could develop a reproducible technique of staining of protonemal nuclei. Then, to attempt to visualize micronuclei, we used our method of staining after an exposure of protonemata to cadmium. The first test of staining of micronuclei following exposure of protonemata to Cd failed to demonstrate micronuclei in the conditions of the experiment. Further research must be conducted using other clastogenic agents to validate our results. Assays on micronuclei of cells of protonemata of Ceratodon purpureus are a first in scientific research. Its innovative aspect encourages further research.

AB  - There is a lack of knowledge about the effectiveness and efficiency of soil conservation policies in agriculture and there is a little understanding of how policy measures should be designed to encourage farmers to adopt soil conservation practices. This paper analyses institutional settings surrounding agricultural soil management in ten European countries based on the Institutions of Sustainability (IoS) framework. This framework considers the interdependencies between ecological and social systems, taking into account environmental conditions, farming practices impacting on soil conservation, different types of actors, policies, institutions and governance structures. The purpose of this paper is to describe the analytical framework and the methodology that all case studies are based on, present and discuss compared findings, outline implications for successful soil conservation policy and draw conclusions on the methodological approach. The case studies focused on the main soil degradation types occurring across Europe which are addressed by a broad range of mandatory and incentive policies. The findings highlight the following issues: (i) the need to design policies that target the locally most common soil threats and processes in the light of agricultural management; (ii) the need to take farming management constraints into consideration, (iii) the need for good communication and cooperation both between agricultural and environmental authorities as well as between governmental and non-governmental stakeholders; (iv) the necessary mix of mandatory and incentive instruments and (v) the need for data and monitoring systems allowing the evaluation of the effectiveness of policies and soil conservation practices.

AB  - Although the debate about coral reef decline focuses on global disturbances (e.g., increasing temperatures and acidification), local stressors (nutrient runoff and overfishing) continue to affect reef health and resilience. The effectiveness of foraminiferal and hard-coral assemblages as indicators of changes in water quality was assessed on 27 inshore reefs along the Great Barrier Reef. Environmental variables (i.e., several water quality and sediment parameters) and the composition of both benthic foraminiferal and hard-coral assemblages differed significantly between four regions (Whitsunday, Burdekin, Fitzroy, and the Wet Tropics). Grain size and organic carbon and nitrogen content of sediments, and a composite water column parameter (based on turbidity and concentrations of particulate matter) explained a significant amount of variation in the data (tested by redundancy analyses) in both assemblages. Heterotrophic species of foraminifera were dominant in sediments with high organic content and in localities with low light availability, whereas symbiont-bearing mixotrophic species were dominant elsewhere. A similar suite of parameters explained 89% of the variation in the FORAM index (a Caribbean coral reef health indicator) and 61% in foraminiferal species richness. Coral richness was not related to environmental setting. Coral assemblages varied in response to environmental variables, but were strongly shaped by acute disturbances (e.g., cyclones, Acanthaster planci outbreaks, and bleaching), thus different coral assemblages may be found at sites with the same environmental conditions. Disturbances also affect foraminiferal assemblages, but they appeared to recover more rapidly than corals. Foraminiferal assemblages are effective bioindicators of turbidity/light regimes and organic enrichment of sediments on coral reefs.

AB  - The objective of the work was to explain to what degree fluorine bioaccumulation is conditioned by the high level of industrialisation in Central Pomerania depending on the distance of a farm from the place of contamination emission in the trophic system: soil plant animal. Soil, feed, and horsehair and blood samples were taken from each level of the system. Material sampled from 48 crossbred horses was divided into three age groups: group 1 horses aged 7 years and below, group 2 horses aged between 7 and 15 years, and group 3 horses aged over 15 years. Fluorine measurements in the soil, feed, and examined tissues were taken by means of an ion-selective electrode combined with an ORION ion meter. An elevated soil acidity in zone I. in the mouth of the Vistula River, stretching 50 km west of the place or contamination emission, increased the level of this element in the soils of the examined area, as well as in feeds offered to horses, compared with zone. II located in the mouth of the Leba and the Slupia Rivers, 80 to 100 km to the west or the place of contamination emission. A significantly higher average fluorine concentration in the blood and hair of horses raised in zone I. compared with zone II, was found. This concentration was the highest in the youngest an Fluorine accumulation in the blood and in the hair of horses raised in zone II was found to increase as the animals grew. Monitoring of fluorine bioaccumulated in soil, feed, blood, and the hair of horses may be a useful indicator of fluorine contamination in the natural environment.

AB  - The abandonment of sites after clearcutting plantations is increasing rapidly in Japan. Although a few stand-level studies have been conducted, a broad-scale study is needed to understand the general tendency of vegetation recovery and to obtain information for the management of such extensively distributed abandoned clearcut sites. This study is a province-level study that aims to interpret the patterns and factors in early-stage vegetation recovery at abandoned plantation clearcut sites. We also discuss the potential indicators that may determine whether a certain site recovers towards evergreen broad-leaved forest consisting of Castanopsis cuspidata and Quercus glauca or towards deciduous broad-leaved forest comprising Q. serrata and Q. acutissima. A cluster analysis revealed that five types of vegetation (evergreen trees, evergreen trees-deciduous pioneer shrubs, pioneer species, deciduous trees, and deciduous shrubs) were observed from an early stage of succession. The first two vegetation types were considered to recover successfully to the target vegetation of evergreen broad-leaved forest, but the remaining three vegetation types did not show any tendency to recover to the target vegetations. According to the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, a smaller size of the abandoned site with adjacent evergreen broad-leaved forest and a longer time after clearcutting were identified as factors that enhance the invasion of evergreen tree species; these factors are also useful to predict the future successional tendency. In conjunction with these factors, the existence of regeneration sources (i.e., stumps) that allow sprouting appeared to be an important indicator for predicting the early-stage vegetation recovery.

AB  - Plantations for timber production combine the productive to the nursery function for natural regeneration of native species. Thinning plays a crucial role in recruitment and establishment of native species, by modifying the irradiance regime beneath the canopy cover. It also promotes the secondary succession towards a more stable forest, which is a main goal in protected areas. The present study was carried in a timber plantation of Pinus radiata D. Don, located in the National Park of Cilento and Vallo di Diano (Southern Italy). The ecophysiological responses of saplings of two hardwood species, Quercus cerris L. and Fraxinus ornus L., according to two contrasting (low and high) relative irradiance (RI) regimes were analysed. Leaf and tree ring delta C-13 values were employed as indicators of water use efficiency (WUE) to explore plant responses to light regime. A preliminary methodological comparison between bulk wood and extracted holocellulose showed no significant differences in 313 C between the two materials. Results indicate lower delta C-13 values, thus suggesting a lower WUE, at higher RI regimes (corresponding to heavy thinning) for both the studied species. Furthermore, Q. cerris delta C-13 Values are lower than those of F. ornus. These results suggest that, under the same light conditions, the mesophile Q. cerris exhibits a weaker stomatal control than the xerophile F. ornus, which keeps higher WUE. In the mesic environment studied, Q. cerris may overcome F. ornus in the long run, owing to a heavy thinning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An understanding of the ecological factors that regulate natural populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can improve control and reduce the incidence of dengue (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in tropical areas. We investigated whether immature Ae. aegypti in water-storage containers from an urban area were under food limitation. We used starvation resistance (number of days alive without food) as an indicator of the feeding history in third-instar Ae. aegypti larvae. Resistance to starvation and other measures of immature success, such as development time, survival, and adult mass, were investigated across a wide range of feeding conditions in the laboratory. Resistance to starvation of third-instar larvae and body mass of adults emerging from pupae collected in water-storage containers in an urban area were compared with the laboratory results. If resistance to starvation and adult mass of field-collected Ae. aegypti corresponded with the lower levels of feeding in the laboratory, then food limitation could be inferred in field-collected larvae. Results showed that resistance to starvation was well correlated with previous feeding levels and with the other measures of immature success. Both resistance to starvation and adult body mass of field-collected specimens corresponded with the lower levels of feeding in the laboratory. Therefore, it was concluded that food limitation or competition is likely to be a regulatory factor in water-storage containers in the urban area. It is recommended that any control measure applied to immature Ae. aegypti in water-storage containers should eliminate all or most of the individuals, otherwise unintended, undesirable results might occur, such as the production of more and larger adults.

AB  - Trade-offs between traits are a fundamental component of life history theory. However, because individuals may differ in the amount of energy available for allocation between traits, expected negative relationships are often difficult to detect or may become positive. The latter can occur when both traits are phenotypically plastic in response to variation in environmental productivity. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expected trade-offs between egg mass and clutch size, and total clutch mass and post-nesting condition, in a population of Galapagos lava lizards (Microlophus delanonis) that experienced marked annual and seasonal variation in rainfall. Due to its close relationship with overall mass (reproductive plus post-nesting mass), we considered rainfall to be a suitable indicator of environmental productivity. Females that reproduced during periods of low rainfall produced smaller and fewer eggs, and had lower post-nesting body mass independent of body size (snout-vent length). This pattern was found in comparisons both between and within individuals that nested in dry and wet periods, respectively. The relationships between egg mass and clutch size, and total clutch mass and post-nesting mass, were positive when data were combined across years and seasons. Restriction of the analysis to comparisons within time periods (in effect, holding productivity constant), resulted in negative correlations between egg mass and clutch size, and weakened relationships between total clutch mass and post-nesting mass. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity in reproduction obscures life history trade-offs and that plasticity may be more important to the fitness of females than a particular value for an individual reproductive trait.

AB  - Background: Climate is one of the most important driving factors of future changes in terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems. Any changes in these environments can significantly influence physiological and behavioural responses in aquatic animals, such as crustacea. Crustacea play an integral role as subsistence predators, prey, or debris feeders in complex food chains, and are often referred to as good indicators of polluted or stressed conditions. They also frequently have high production, consumption, and commercial significance. However, crustacean's responses to climate change are likely to vary by species, life-history stage, reproduction status and geographical distribution. This map is undertaken as part of the Long-Term Research Grant project which aims to identify any interactive effect on physiological compensation and behavioural strategy of how marine organisms, especially crustaceans, deal with stress from environmental change. Our proposed map will aim to outline the evidence currently existing for the impacts of climate change on the physiology and behaviour of important aquaculture crustacean species within Asia.
   Methods: We will document peer-reviewed articles in English using published journal articles and grey literature. Two bibliographic databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and multiple organizational websites with Google scholars will be searched. The systematic map protocol will follow in accordance with the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Guidelines and Standards. Literature will be screened at the title, abstract, and full-text level using pre-defined inclusion criteria. The map will highlight marine crustacea physiological compensation and behavioural strategies to cope with climate change. It will also improve our knowledge of the available evidence and current gaps for future research recommendations.

AB  - Classically, ecologists have considered that biota becomes more integrated and interdependent with ecosystem development in primary successional environments. However, recent work on soil microbial communities suggests that there may in fact be no change in network integration over successional time series. Here, we performed a test of this principle by identifying network-level topological features of the soil microbial co-occurrence networks in the primary successional foreland environment of the retreating high-Arctic glacier of Midtre Lovenbreen, Svalbard. Soil was sampled at sites along the foreland of inferred ages 10-90 years since deglaciation. DNA was extracted and amplicon sequenced for 16 s rRNA genes for bacteria and ITS1 region for fungi. Despite the chronologically-related soil pH decline and organic C/N accumulation, analysis on network-level topological features showed network integration did not change with inferred chronological ages, whereas network integration declined with decreasing pH and increasing total organic carbon (TOC) - both factors that can be viewed as an indicator of soil development. We also found that bacteria played a greater role in the network structure than fungi, with all keystone species in the microbial cooccurrence network being bacteria species. Both number and relative abundance of the keystone species were significantly higher when soil pH increased or TOC decreased. It appears that in the more extreme and less productive conditions of early primary succession, integration between members of soil biota into consortia may play a greater role in niche adaptation and survival. Our finding also emphasizes that ecosystem development is not simply a product of time but is influenced by locally heterogeneous factors.

AB  - Considering the temporal responses of carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) to local water availability in the spatial analysis of Delta C-13 is essential for evaluating the contribution of environmental and genetic facets of plant Delta C-13. Using tree-ring Delta C-13 from years with contrasting water availability at 76 locations across the natural range of loblolly pine, we decomposed site-level Delta C-13 signals to maximum Delta C-13 in well-watered conditions (Delta C-13(max)) and isotopic drought sensitivity (m) as a change in Delta C-13 per unit change of Palmer's Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Site water status, especially the tree lifetime average PDSI, was the primary factor affecting Delta C-13(max). The strong spatial correlation exhibited by m was related to both genetic and environmental factors. The long-term average water availability during the period relevant to trees as indicated by lifetime average PDSI correlated with Delta C-13(max), suggesting acclimation in tree gas-exchange traits, independent of incident water availability. The positive correlation between lifetime average PDSI and m indicated that loblolly pines were more sensitive to drought at mesic than xeric sites. The m was found to relate to a plant's stomatal control and may be employed as a genetic indicator of efficient water use strategies. Partitioning Delta C-13 to Delta C-13(max) and m provided a new angle for understanding sources of variation in plant Delta C-13, with several fundamental and applied implications.

AB  - Northeast Brazil (NEB) exhibits very peculiar environmental conditions, requiring integrated studies to support the knowledge of the area's susceptibility to the occurrence of droughts. The objective of the research was to evaluate the biophysical susceptibility of the High Course of the Hydrographic Sub-basin of the Piracuruca River, considering the integration of data of the average relief slope, the aridity index, the temperature at the soil surface and the vegetation index adjusted to the soil, as a subsidy to the study of droughts. The research used map algebra to integrate biophysical variables - average slope of the relief, aridity index, temperature at the soil surface and vegetation index adjusted to the soil - to estimate the biophysical susceptibility of Alto Vale. The studied area is located on the Serra Grande formation, which is formed mainly by sandstones, with relief showing marks of the dissection process from the consequent drainage network. The area is under the influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ZCIT), which currently exists in association with the El Nino Oscilacao Sul (ENOS) and the Atlantic dipole. The following soil orders were identified: Gleisols, Oxisols, Neossols and Planossols. These soils are covered by nebulous rainforest, at the top of the Plateau, and shrubby to arboreal caatinga, at the edges of the Plateau and lower areas. The variables indicated a predominance of: flat relief in 69.4% of the area; high and very high aridity in 51.8% of Alto Vale; soil surface temperature between 30.1 to 36.0 degrees C in 80.2% of the surveyed area; vegetation with low photosynthetic activity in 62.0% of the sector under study.

AB  - Trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) are notorious pollutants in groundwater. The biodegradation of them yields more toxic vinyl chloride (VC) and 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE). Although their biodegradation is highly feasible in the lab, field remediation still faces huge challenges. One challenge of them is the lack of good microbial indicators and consequently, monitoring famous species can cause the prediction of project time span and related expenses to fail. Here, in this study, we offer a solution by integrating predominance, correlation, and principal component analysis on the testing results of the biodegradation of VC and 1,1-DCE under seven different nutrient-amendment conditions. The inoculum was from a contaminated site with accumulated 1,1-DCE and VC. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was applied to 15 microbial communities. Traditional analysis relying predominance on NGS data may be misleading due to the variation of copy number per cell for different microorganisms. By considering predominance, correlation between copy number and removal efficiency, and PCA loading factors of the principle component analysis, bacteria of the Ruminococcaceae family, Syntrophomonas sp., Pseudomonas stutzuri, Candidatus Methanoregula, and Methanospirillum sp. could be microbial indicators for removing 1,1-DCE and VC in biodegradation. The results suggested a variety of combinations of bacteria and archaeal species can effectively remove 1,1-DCE but less so for VC. The influence of archaeal species in the natural environment on bioremediation of chlorinated solvents cannot be neglected.

AB  - As an important part of the Bohai economic rim, the Laizhou Bay has been stressed by serious eco-environmental problems in recent years. In this study, the Shannon-Wiener index (H'), AZTI's marine biotic index (AMBI) and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) were used to assess the ecological quality status (EQS) of the Laizhou Bay according to macrobenthos data collected annually in August 2011-2014. The results showed that the overall benthic habitat quality in the Laizhou Bay was assessed as "Good". However, 25% of the samples were classified as "Moderate", "Bad" or "Poor" status under degraded conditions. Ecological group III (EGIII) species which had a certain tolerance to environmental disturbances had a higher proportion in each station, and most of them had appeared the pollution indicator species Capitella capitata. This indicated that the benthic habitat in the Laizhou Bay had been disturbed and polluted to some extent. The comparison of the three indices evaluation result and the RDA analysis showed that the H' and M-AMBI were more suitable when the relative abundance of the single species was high and the macrobenthic community was significantly imbalanced; when the relative abundance of opportunistic species (EGIV and EGV) was high, the AMBI and M-AMBI could reflected the EQS objectively; in an undisturbed and polluted environment, all the three indices could indicate the benthic habitats quality. In summary, the better correlation between the three indices and environmental factors showed that they were well responsive to the tendency of the benthic habitats quality in the Laizhou Bay.

AB  - The study aim was to analyse the influence of a municipal solid waste landfill site in operation for over 10 years on the aquatic environment using multiple indicators. The water around the landfill area must be controlled due to the possibility of leachate interaction with harmful substances in the environment. The tests were carried out on the basis of 24 indicators, of which four were the most significant: depth of groundwater retention, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4-N), dissolved oxygen (DO), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The assessment of the quality of the surface water and groundwater and the analysis of the leachate pollution indices enabled the interpretation of the influence of a specific municipal waste landfill on the nearby water environment condition, despite not exceeding the permissible content at the highest average concentration of NH4-N at 1.34 mg L-1. The differences were significant at the level of p < 0.05 in the content of DO in the water below the landfill. The concentration of NH4-N in the groundwater below the landfill was statistically significantly correlated with the depth of the groundwater deposits (r = 0.609). Similarly, the surface water below the landfill site showed a statistically significant relation in the piezometer, which was also below the landfill, to ammoniacal nitrogen (r = 0.749). This result confirmed the statistically significant differences in the aquatic environment and the correlations with NH4-N and that, below the landfill, the penetration water seepage is moderate with a low waste accumulation not exceeding 10 Mg per day.

AB  - A multi-perspectives analysis of the potentials, challenges and characteristics of possible future industrial-scale ethylene production via Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) process was performed in this research. In doing so, miniplant-scale experimental data were utilized to scale-up, predict and represent the performance of the unit operations in the industrial-scale operation of a reference stand-alone and two different integrated OCM process configuration, each with an assumed capacity of one million tons per year ethylene production. Technical, environmental and economic performance of these alternative OCM processes were analyzed and compared using Aspen Plus simulations and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The assumptions and the conceptual conclusions made in the analysis are also discussed in this paper. The technologies and the costs associated with conditioning the methane feed stream originated from natural gas or biogas were compared and their impacts, through reducing the resulted price of methane-feed, on the economy of the OCM process are discussed. Moreover, the integration potentials of the OCM process with the ethane dehydrogenation process and the clear impacts of the resulted increase in the ethylene production on the whole process economy are also considered in this paper. The feasibility and the specifications of the selected integrated OCM process configuration, providing the fastest return of investments around 9.5 year, are discussed in this paper. The economic and environmental performance indicators of this integrated process along with the potentials and some suggestions for further improving its performance are also highlighted in this paper.

AB  - Diffuse pollution of water resources from agricultural sources is a major environmental issue in Europe. The nutrients released in groundwater from cultivated fields and livestock production, together with pesticides, are the main source of concern in the framework of the European Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC). Southern Romania continues to represent one of the most important cereal production areas of the country. The intensive exploitation during the communist period continues to have repercussions for the precarious quality of groundwater. The aim of our study was to establish the environmental conditions, quantify the agricultural activities at the local administrative unit level and afterwards, to highlight areas of susceptibility to nitrate pollution of groundwater within the Oltenia Plain. One of the most efficient methods to evaluate human influences by agricultural activities on groundwater is using different types of indicators, such as land use indicators (cultivated surfaces), animal husbandry indicators (livestock and great beef units), and agri-environmental indicators (use of fertilisers based on nitrogen and phosphorus, quantity/ha). Throughout the paper, GIS methods are used to determine the degree of influence on nitrate pollution of several eco-pedological indicators: soil types and subtypes, slope of the land, soil texture, soil permeability, and groundwater level. Statistics indicate that 85% of the study area is susceptible to nitrate pollution from agriculture. Indicators provide information that can be easily interpreted by decision and policy makers, and they facilitate the process of reducing nitrate pollution. This study shows that the correlation of statistics and GIS modelling is a useful method for guiding prevention practices for groundwater pollution at the regional scale in Southwestern Romania.

AB  - Tropical brackish ecosystems are characterized by mangrove-dominant communities which are well-adapted to extreme and unique environmental conditions. Organic matter (OM) derived from adjacent vegetation contributes to the chemical composition of sediments. Sedimentary OM can thus be used for paleoecological studies. Surface and core sediments of Bolgoda Lake were analyzed to identify sources of OMs using C, N, S elemental analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. C/N ratios of raw sediments and protokerogen derivatives illustrate the preferential degradation of mixed OM in surface sediments and mangrove muds. The n-alkanes distributions show that vascular plants are predominantly preserved in sediments due to resistance to microbial decomposition and available biomass in the watershed. Taraxerone provides the most important chemotaxonomical information to identify mangrove-dominant sediments. Ternary n- C-27, n- C-29 and n- C-31 alkanes relationships show that mangrove-dominant sediments are enriched in n-C-31 along with significant amounts of nC(29). Mangrove and herbaceous plants (grasses and/or floating plants) can be preferentially dispersed in tropical brackish sediments. The relative proportions of n-C-27 , n- C-29 and n- C-31 n-alkanes can be applied to identify different growth habitats of a particular landmass. The mangrove biomarker (pentacyclic taraxerone) and visualized long-chain n-alkanes proportions (i.e., n-C-27 , n- C-29 and n-C-31) can thus be used as chemotaxonomical indicators to reconstruct the paleoecological characteristics of tropical brackish vegetation.

AB  - This paper presents the methodology for determining the die-off coefficient of faecal indicator bacteria (enterococci) when transported in a karst environment. The main problem in exploring karst environments, which this methodology strives to cope with, is lack of field measurements, poor data on karst rock formation, fractures and channels within it, and groundwater level dynamics. The analysed karst catchment (Bokanjac-Polinik) is situated in the hinterland of the city of Zadar (Republic of Croatia) and covers an area of 235.07 km(2). In the water supply wells within the analysed catchment, a frequent occurrence of enterococci was observed. The proposed methodology consists of two basic steps. Preliminary analyses as the initial step were used in the accumulation of certain assumptions related to the detection of increased concentrations of enterococci as well as in determination of the potential source of pollution. In the second step, the analytical model was constructed with the aim of resolving processes of sorption and die-off and determining the dominant factor in the process of natural removal of enterococci when transported in karst environment. Within the model, two parts of the pollutant transport are integrated: vertical percolation and horizontal seepage flow and transport. The mean value of the total die-off coefficient by transport through the unsaturated zone in the analysed case is = 8.25. Within the saturated zone the total die-off coefficient is within the limits of 0.1 and 0.5.

AB  - Optimization of photocatalytic degradation of two natural estrogenic compounds, estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) in aqueous medium was performed on TiO2 coated Pilkington Activ (TM) self-cleaning glass as a novel approach to eliminate free nano-TiO2 releasing to the intended environment after treatment. The active glass was characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy to characterize the TiO2 nanoparticles. The main purposes were mineralization of target compounds in the treated water during the photocatalytic reaction and also to investigate the oxidation by products. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been applied to optimize the photocatalytic degradation by changing time, pH, and light intensity as effective factors. According to the results, time was the more effective parameter. The maximum efficiency degradation was achieved in alkaline media. Due to interactive effects between variable factors, 1 mg/L aqueous solution of El and 17 beta-E2 in water was totally decomposed by TiO2 photocatalyzed reactions under UV-C irradiation of 10.08 W/m(2) for 52.49 min at pH 9.42. Results of GC-MS analysis were introduced 17-deoxy Estrone and 2-Hydroxyestradiol as intermediate products for El and 17 beta-E2, respectively. All of the peaks finally disappeared after 170 min. Optimized conditions were applied for real sample of wastewater, presenting 30.40% and 56.84% in the efficiency degradation of El and 17 beta-E2, respectively.

AB  - Floating meadows are widespread globally, but ecological information on their vegetation structure and functions is lacking. We examined the structure and composition of the vegetation of the floating meadows of Keibul Lamjao National Park, Manipur, located in the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot. The floating meadows in the park are crucial for the survival of the globally threatened Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii) and the hog deer (Axis porcinus). Vegetation data were collected from 936 plots of size 0.5 m x 0.5 m during winter and summer. The vegetation data were analyzed using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) with PC-ORD version 4.20. Nine plant communities were observed in summer and eight in winter, with two communities being common to the two seasons. The overall Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, species richness and evenness of the communities varied significantly between summer and winter. The evenness (0.713) and diversity (H', 1.335) indices in summer indicate high species diversity, which is mainly due to homogenous distribution of the species. The Ivlev Electivity Index (IVI) indicates that plant communities have a specific preference for meadow thickness, Le., communities that prefer thick meadows avoid thin meadows. Competition among plant communities in terms of moisture and nutrient availability appears to be low due to the hypereutrophic condition of the lake and the floating nature of the meadows. But Capillipediwn spp., Phragmites karka, Leersia hexandra and Zizania latifolia appear to exhibit monodominance, as indicated by their frequency and abundance in most of the communities. Protection of areas with thick meadow from further deterioration is crucial for the long-term conservation of the Eld's deer and associated wild ungulates.

AB  - Geochemical and geophysical investigations were performed in the area of the Komsomolsk tailings impoundment. Gold ore tailings produced with cyanidation have been generated by the Komsomolsk Gold Extraction Plant. The relatively low sulfide content in the Komsomolsk tailings and the presence of carbonates result in a low acid production potential (AP) for these tailings. The tailings pond is characterized by neutral to slightly alkaline conditions and metal concentrations, except for those of As and Sb, below the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). The situation is complicated by the fact that the displaced Berikul tailings are stored in the southern part of the Komsomolsk tailings impoundment. Sulfide concentrate cyanidation tailings were produced by the former Berikul Gold Extraction Plant. In the Berikul tailings, the sulfide content is approximately 25%. This high content has resulted in a high AP and the formation of acidic and ultra-acidic surface ponds (pH similar to 2) with extremely high concentrations of metals and metalloids (As up to 4.1 g L-1). The estimated duration of acid drainage generated by the Berikul tailings is approximately 2400 years. Surface drainage from the tailings enters the Voskresenka River; as a result, the concentrations of As and Sb in the river water approach the MPCs established by the Russian Ministry of Health. Based on electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), the uncontrolled leakage of acidic and highly mineralized solutions through a natural geological fault into groundwater horizons was revealed. Groundwater contamination was confirmed via an analysis of drinking water from a well located near the fault.

AB  - Comparative analysis of the EU countries' socioeconomic indicators is carried out here along with the systematic analysis of the global and the EU strategic documents, the European Commission's communiques, the European Commission's (committees') and individual working groups' studies on employment issues. Potential scenarios for increasing employment are considered basing on the analysis of socioeconomic conditions in Lithuania. The article uses the methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison, summation and abstraction as well as the mathematical and statistical processing methods. Situation analysis is based on the data of the Eurostat, specialized surveys and the results of statistical calculations. The article substantiates that in order to increase employment, efficient resource allocation and targeted economic policy focused on social problems of the country are needed, and appropriate measures for its implementation are proposed. Employment-friendly macroeconomic policy-making is seen here as a fundamental strategic guideline to address the problems of employment and social economic inequality. Green economy and green jobs' development are one of the priority directions in increasing employment in Lithuania. Employment policy guidance in green technologies (renewable energy sources, recycling, and green building), the green economy, and promotion of professional skills in this area are recommended. Transition to green economy, eco-villages and ecological communities would be one of the fundamental directions in increasing employment among the most vulnerable groups. Furthermore, regional policies must be intensified in Lithuania to enhance economic (investment) and social attractiveness of less populated areas.

AB  - Drylands are home to more than two billion people and are characterised by frequent, severe droughts. Such extreme events are expected to be exacerbated in the near future by climate change. A potentially simple and cost-effective mitigation measure against drought periods is sand dams. This little-known technology aims to promote subsoil rainwater storage to support dryland agro-ecosystems. To date, there is little long-term empirical analysis that tests the effectiveness of this approach during droughts. This study addresses this shortcoming by utilising multi-year satellite imagery to monitor the effect of droughts at sand dam locations. A time series of satellite images was analysed to compare vegetation at sand dam sites and control sites over selected periods of drought, using the normalised difference vegetation index. The results show that vegetation biomass was consistently and significantly higher at sand dam sites during periods of extended droughts. It is also shown that vegetation at sand dam sites recovers more quickly from drought. The observed findings corroborate modelling-based research which identified related impacts on ground water, land cover, and socio-economic indicators. Using past periods of drought as an analogue to future climate change conditions, this study indicates that sand dams have potential to increase adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change in drylands. It therefore can be concluded that sand dams enhance the resilience of marginal environments and increase the adaptive capacity of drylands. Sand dams can therefore be a promising adaptation response to the impacts of future climate change on drylands.

AB  - The estuarine planktonic copepods have a wide geographical distribution and commendable tolerance to various kinds of contaminants. The primary aim of the present study was to contrast the impacts of model POPs (TBBPA and HBCD) on three common estuarine planktonic copepods (Oithona similis, Acartia pacifica and Pseudodiaptomus inopinus) and establish a protocol for the assessment of acute toxicity of marine organic pollutants. We first quantified the 96h-LC50 (0.566, 0.04 and 0.257 mg/L of TBBPA to the three subjects above respectively and 0.314 mg/L of HBCD to P. inopinus; all reported concentrations are nominal values). In the sub-lethal toxicity tests, it was turned out that the effects of copepods exposed to TBBPA could product different influences on the energy ingestion and metabolism. Different type of pollutions, meanwhile, could also bring varying degree effect on the target copepods. In general, the indicators (the rate of oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion, food ingestion and filtration) in higher concentration groups showed marked significant difference compared with controls as well a dose-effect relationship. The study also extended the research on the joint toxicity of TBBPA and HBCD based on the survival rate of P. inopinus. Whether 1:1 concentration or 1:1 toxic level, the research showed synergy effect relative to single exposure conditions. The result indicated that current single ecological testing used for environmental protection activities may underestimate the risk for copepods. It was also demonstrated that short-term sub-lethal experiment could be a standard to evaluate the sensitivity of copepods to POPs.

AB  - We conducted a survey of the Lake Michigan nearshore using towed electronic instrumentation to collect data that were spatially highly resolved. The tow was 1049 km in length along the 20-m depth contour and was supplemented with grab samples at 15 sites (on average every 75 km). There was low frequency variability in the alongshore reach represented by macroscopic trends across large distance scales (over 100 s km) with local variability or high frequency changes at much smaller distances (5-10 km). We found that large scale spatial patterns in some water quality parameters were strongly correlated with adjacent landscape characterization. Landscape attributes most frequently retained in step-wise regression models for each water quality parameter were agricultural chemical factors, followed by shoreline modifications and point source attributes. Specific conductivity had the greatest amount of variability explained by landscape character (78%)with beam attenuation next (51%), and followed by chlorophyll and zooplankton (each similar to 30%). We combined our chemistry samples with data from the recent National Coastal Condition Assessment (2010 NCCA) and compared nearshore chemistry data with the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) offshore fixed monitoring sites. There was a significant distinction in both mean values and variability between the nearshore (<30 m depth) and offshore waters. We also used historical data and found that the distinction between near shore and offshore waters has persisted and that the same long-term trends in parameter concentrations found in the offshore were also found in the near shore.

AB  - Vineyard landscapes in Mediterranean areas represent a strong cultural legacy and support a crucial socioeconomic sector. The sustainability of these landscapes is threatened by rapid changes of soil quality, in the context of global change and intensive management practices. Considering the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France as representative of Mediterranean soil and climate conditions, we evaluated the topsoil quality of vineyards at the regional scale, based on a set of 31 physical, chemical and biological soil indicators measured on 164 commercial vineyard plots. Almost all soil parameters were highly variable among plots. Biological activity was low but no systematic perturbation of the trophic web was noticed. The regional variability of use-invariant soil properties (such as calcium carbonate content and texture) was characterized and taken into account for the analysis of dynamic indicators. Invariant soil properties explained up to 25% of the variance of dynamic chemical and biological indicators. Consequently as a tool to improve soil management decision and recommendations, we proposed a grouping of the 164 vineyard plots into functional soil groups determined by soil invariant properties. Information redundancy between different dynamic indicators was analyzed, and their interpretation and limitations as indicators of topsoil quality were discussed. Our study has produced detailed topsoil indicator baselines that can be immediately used as references for winegrowers to appraise the topsoil quality of their vineyard in comparison with others.

AB  - Age at menarche is regarded as a sensitive indicator of physical, biological, and psychosocial environment. The aim of this study was to determine the age at menarche and its association with biological and socioeconomic factors in girls from Santa Rosa (La Pampa, Argentina). An observational cross-sectional study was carried out on 1,221 schoolgirls aged 9-15 years. Menarche data were obtained by the status-quo method. Height, sitting height, weight, arm circumference, tricipital and subscapular skinfolds were measured. We also calculated body mass index, measures of body composition and proportions, and fat distribution. To assess socioeconomic factors, parents completed a self-administered questionnaire about their occupation and education, family size, household, and other family characteristics. The median age at menarche - estimated by the logit method - was 12.84 years (95% CI: 12.71, 12.97). Compared with their premenarcheal age peers, postmenarcheal girls had greater anthropometric dimensions through age 12. After this age, only height was higher in the latter group. Data were processed by fitting two logistic regressions, both including age. The first model included anthropometric variables and birth weight, while the second model included the socioeconomic variables. The significant variables derived from each model were incorporated into a new regression: height, sitting height ratio (first model), and maternal education (second model). These three variables remained significantly associated with menarche. The results suggest a relationship between linear growth and menarche and agree with those found in other populations where the advancement of menarche is associated with improved living conditions. In relatively uniform urban contexts, maternal education may be a good proxy for the standard of living.

AB  - In Piedmont (Italy) the environmental changes due to human impact have had profound effects on rivers and their inhabitants. Thus, it is necessary to develop practical tools providing accurate ecological assessments of river and species conditions. We focus our attention on Salmo marmoratus, an endangered salmonid which is characteristic of the Po river system in Italy. In order to contribute to the management of the species. four different approaches were used to assess its presence: discriminant function analysis, logistic regression, decision tree models and artificial neural networks. Either all the 20 environmental variables measured in the field or the 7 coming from feature selection were used to classify sites as positive or negative for S. marmoratus. The performances of the different models were compared. Discriminant function analysis, logistic regression, and decision tree models (unpruned and pruned) had relatively high percentages of correctly classified instances. Although neither tree-pruning technique improved the reliability of the models significantly, they did reduce the tree complexity and hence increased the clarity of the models, The artificial neural network (ANN) approach, especially the model built with the 7 inputs coming from feature selection, showed better performance than all the others. The relative contribution of each independent variable to this model was determined by using the sensitivity analysis technique. Our findings proved that the ANNs were more effective than the other classification techniques. Moreover, ANNs achieved their high potentials when they were applied in models used to make decisions regarding river and conservation management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alike other North African countries, Tunisia is characterized by vast pastoral territories. The main vocation of these areas was livestock production. Pastoral lands, which are subject to increasing pressure leading to their degradation, not only provide forage to feed livestock but also play a critical role in alleviating many of the most challenging environmental and ecological problems. Today, the situation is complex since phenomena of degradation, drought and grain price escalation. As a result, some breeders stop their activity in search of more lucrative chances. Others diversify their income sources by trying to carry small service activities in the neighbouring villages. But, when livestock production remains the main activity, they try to strive, after all, to maintain their flocks. Livestock rearing, frequently being the only possible activity in less favoured areas, is often fundamental to maintain social activities and contribute to the national self-sufficient in meat.
   This paper provides a summary of indicators demonstrating the economic importance and potential of the livestock sector in Tunisia in order to raise the awareness of decision makers on all opportunities this sector can offer if we can orientate the breeders' behaviour with respect to economic and climatic conditions. The paper focuses on the determinants of the production supply and on the livestock dynamic process by carrying out a relational analysis to determine the factors and the decisional variables which affect the productivity parameters and the behaviour of breeders in their decisions related to meat production and optima livestock size. We showed that the identification of such determinants allows decision makers to select the intervention tools according to target objectives.

AB  - Opencast mining causes severe environmental impacts by removing the vegetation cover and depleting the fauna. Reforestation methods using native species and diverse pre- and post-disturbance approaches aim to recover the original richness and diversity of species found before the impact. Bioindicators are powerful tools to evaluate the restoration of the original environmental conditions in disturbed areas. We used species richness, endemism and diversity measurements of Collembola to compare successional stages in reforested sites of different ages compared with a control undisturbed area. Richness and abundance of Collembola were subjected to correlation analysis with age of plots and vegetational variables. Areas that were reforested for up to 16 years supported a much lower Collembola species richness than undisturbed areas. Both the age of reforestation plots and vegetation variables (number of trees, diameter of crowns, depth of leaf litter and tree species richness) were positively and significantly correlated to collembolan abundance and richness. The results showed that the diversity of the 16-year-old plot was significantly higher than that of younger areas, but significantly less diverse than that of the control area. Endemic species were more sensitive to disturbance than non-endemics. Thus, species richness and diversity of soil Collembola can be only partially restored with appropriate reforestation methods, and although it takes many years, to some extent even endemic species can be gradually restored. Nevertheless, the maintenance of undisturbed diversity reservoirs linked by ecological corridors to reforested plots is imperative, as only undisturbed areas can support most of the endemic species able to re-colonize reforested sites.

   The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of burning native pastures and of cultivating Pinus sp in monoculture in Lages, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial basal respiration (C-CO2), the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), and the ratio MBC/TOC were analyzed. Four representative areas of the region with 0.5 ha each were selected: (a) native pasture without burning for at least 50 years (NP); (b) native pasture burnt off every year (NPF); (c) natural forest (NF) with predominance of Araucaria angustifolia and (d) eight-year-old Pinus taeda monoculture (PINUS). Data were obtained from six replicate samples composed of nine sub-samples each, from a depth of 0-5 cm, in the four studied areas. The fumigation-extraction method was used for the evaluation of MBC. C-CO2 evolution was obtained under laboratory conditions. The highest C-CO2 values were detected in NF and PINUS, followed by NPF and NP, respectively. The highest values of MBC, TOC and MBC:TOC were detected in NF, but the other areas did not present significant differences among each other. The qCO(2) rate was higher in PINUS followed by NPF in comparison with NF and NP. Multivariate analysis was an important auxiliary tool for suggesting MBC as an attribute to discriminate the studied areas.

AB  - The study is concerned with the ecological responses of deciduous hardwood trees to light, moisture, pH and nitrogen, in forests located in the Boreo-nemoral zone of Sweden. Analyses were carried out for three data sets comprising releves from different areas: (1) Oland, (2) Uppland/Sodermanland, and (3) Halland/Bohuslan/Vastergotland. The values of environmental factors in the releves were assessed by calculating weighted averages of Ellenberg's species' indicator values. For each factor, the tree species' responses were determined by fitting regression curves to the log-transformed cover-abundance values of the tree species at the sites, as a function of the weighted averages at the corresponding sites. Regressions were carried out separately for the tree and field layers. In the majority of cases, significant linear or quadratic response curves were obtained.
   Fraxinus excelsior and Ulmus glabra represent two species with similar ecological behaviour. Both are very demanding with respect to soil moisture, pH and nitrogen, and in the field layer, both are highly tolerant of shade. Regarding the edaphic factors, Acer platanoides has its optima at lower values than Fraxinus and Ulmus, but is at least as shade-tolerant as these two species. Tilia cordata generally holds an intermediate position along all gradients in question. Quercus robur and Quercus petraea have their optima at the comparatively lowest values for the edaphic factors, but are the most light-demanding among the deciduous hardwood trees. The results are also discussed in view of the ecological literature from central and western Europe. Some species show geographically differing behaviour with respect to their responses to various environmental factors.

AB  - Humans have dyed textiles and leather, colored food, and paint body parts using natural dyes throughout history. Natural dyes have suffered drastically due to recent socioeconomic changes and replacement with synthetic dye in the textile industry. Hence, it is urgent to study indigenous dye plants and dyeing craft in local communities to protect these resources' potential ecological, economic, and cultural values. In 11 Monpa villages of Medog County, South-east Tibet, China, we conducted field research to record the indigenous method of cloth dyeing using madder dye. An aqueous extract of the root of Rubia wallichiana is a traditional madder dye. In this study, we used traditional dye and ethyl alcohol extract of the residue of aqueous extract. Two fabrics were dyed with the extractions in the presence of one of the metallic mordants or biomordants. Pigment compounds from aqueous extraction of madder and ethyl alcohol extraction of recycled madder were evaluated using Phytochemical, UV-visible spectroscopy, and FTIR test. We carried out One-way ANOVA and Duncan's new multiple range method to analyze different dying approaches and conditions. The dyed fabrics were evaluated by indicators of color strength and fastness, including washing, rubbing, and perspiration. The findings revealed the potentiality of biomordants to improve the dyeing properties of madder. The dyeing properties of recycled madder were marginally better than traditional madder. The results revealed the feasibility of enhancing the dyeing property and reuse of the residue from madder dyeing. The improved dyeing and reuse of residue can improve local ecological, economic benefits, and cultural heritage while applying research findings for the subsequent commercialization of plant dyes.

AB  - The Ichneumonidae, one of the largest insect families, includes beneficial insects parasitizing several pests. Due to the geographic and climatic varability of Iran, a great Ichneumonidae diversity may be expected, but our knowledge about fauna and biodiversity of this family in Iran is still insufficient, with only a few sporadic biodiversity studies on Iranian Ichneumonids. This paper examines the alpha diversity, species evenness, species richness and beta diversity of the Ichneumonid parasitoid wasp assemblages in Golestan Province, northeastern Iran with an emphasis on the two largest Ichneumonid subfamilies: Cryptinae and Ichneumoninae. The spatial diversity of Ichneumonidae in two consecutive years was studied in three habitats: forest, rangeland and orchards. A total of 336 specimens representing 62 genera and 97 species were collected and identified. The forest sites (Shast kalate and Tuskestan) and rangeland sites (Chahar bagh and Souz javal) were found to be more diverse than orchard sites (Kordkuy and Garmabdasht), but the lowest species evenness was observed in the latter. The highest species richness was found in rangeland, the highest similarity between the two forest sites, and the lowest similarity between Kordkuy (orchard) and Chaharbagh (rangeland). Of all individuals collected, 32.7% and 67.3% were female and male, respectively. The species richness and abundance of parasitoid wasp species yielded from the relatively small sample area indicate that there are many species in Iran that still remain to be discovered. In total, the use of parasitoid Hymenoptera, as potential bioindicators, provide a useful and practicable monitoring tool for tracking and evaluating changes in various ecosystems and reflecting environmental conditions.

AB  - Varied environmental conditions in coastal-inland zones tend to influence soil faunal communities. However, few studies have focused on the responses of soil fauna to environmental variations along the coastal-inland gradient. In order to better understand the aforementioned responses, a total of 80 soil macro-faunal samples were collected at the five different distances from the coastline of China's Bohai Bay. The results revealed that the compositions, structural characteristics and diversity of the soil macro-fauna varied among the different habitats. With the increases in the distance from the sea, the individual density, richness and diversity levels of the soil macro-fauna all first increased and then decreased. The individual density, richness and diversity values were all at their maximum at 30 km from the sea. The Edge effect promoted unique and rare soil macro-faunal taxa. Formicidae, Curculionidae and Aphodiidae were found to be the edge taxa. Agelenidae, Liocranidae and Nematocera were considered to be indicator taxa of severe sea effects. Paradoxosomatidae was an indicator taxon of slight effects. Overall, the environmental variations along the coastal-inland gradient were found to have the potential to affect the soil macro-faunal communities, and the different taxa of the soil macro-fauna responded to those variations in different ways. This study further revealed the processes and mechanisms of the sea influencing the soil macro-faunal communities, which had been caused by the coastal-inland gradient. The results of this study also provided a theoretical basis for developing future biodiversity guidelines for coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The annual North Atlantic phytoplankton bloom represents a hot spot of biological activity during which a significant fraction of net community production (NCP) can be partitioned into dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The fraction of seasonal NCP that is not respired by the heterotrophic bacterial community and accumulates as seasonal surplus DOC (Delta DOC) in the surface layer represents DOC export potential to the upper mesopelagic zone, and in the North Atlantic this is facilitated by winter convective mixing that can extend to depths > 400 m. However, estimates of Delta DOC and vertical DOC export for the western North Atlantic remain ill-constrained and the influence of phytoplankton community structure on the partitioning of seasonal NCP as Delta DOC is unresolved. Here, we couple hydrographic properties from autonomous in situ sensors (ARGO floats) with biogeochemical data from two meridional transects in the late spring (similar to 44-56 degrees N along similar to -41 degrees VV) and early autumn (similar to 42-53 degrees N along similar to -41 degrees W) as part of the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). We estimate that 4-35% of seasonal NCP is partitioned as Delta DOC and that annual vertical DOC export ranges between 0.34 and 1.15 mol C m(-2) in the temperate and subpolar western North Atlantic. Two lines of evidence reveal that non-siliceous picophytoplankton, like Prochiorococcus, are indicator species of the conditions that control the accumulation of DOC and the partitioning of NCP as Delta DOC.

AB  - Ducks are waterfowl belonging to the Anatidae family of cosmopolitan distribution. In duck production systems, obtaining ducklings at one-day-old is determinant for the productive chain. The egg production in some species of ducks reaches about 250 to 300 eggs per year. Obtaining one-day-old ducklings can be done by natural incubation with a broody female duck or artificially in an incubator. During artificial incubation, fertility and hatchability are the most important indicators that must be controlled, because they influence the supply of ducklings to the farm. Many factors are related to fertility and hatching, such as environmental conditions, production system, season, nutrition, management of broodstock, storage time of egg and cleaning of eggs before the incubation. According to some reports, Pekin eggs have greater hatchability than Muscovy eggs. The eggs of Muscovy have presented values lower than 22.7% of hatchability. The hatchability of Pekin duck eggs was 78.0% in the spring, while in summer it was around 46.5%. The best hatchability is observed during the winter (57.68%), as in the summer it decreases to 54.14%. The reproductive characteristics of flocks, age, external and internal quality of the egg, male female relation, and presence of lethal genes are factors that directly involve breeders. Larger sexual ratios between males and females of 1:4.3 to 1: 10 cause reduced egg fertility from 75.9% down to 49.6%. Successful production of day-old ducklings starts with the proper selection and management of breeding stock, proper post-lay handling of fertile eggs and the correct incubation process. There are different methods used to improve the hatchability such as dipping eggs in nutrients during the incubation period.

AB  - South Africa has numerous voluminous tailings dumps that will certainly require rehabilitation. The aim of this work was to develop a methodological approach for prioritization of rehabilitation of abandoned tailings dumps. To test the applicability of the developed method in different conditions, it was applied on six abandoned tailings dumps denoted as FGMT, LMMT, KLMT, MCMT, NMMT-A and NMMT-B found in the Giyani and Musina areas of South Africa. The method involved integration of quantitative and qualitative techniques in making sound decision on the order of rehabilitation of the tailings dumps in the area. It considered the contamination potential of the dumps, the ease of their dispersion to the surroundings and the impact they have on the appearance of the natural landscape. The use of the tool on abandoned tailings dumps in the study area revealed that gold tailings dumps are to be rehabilitated first than magnesite and copper tailings dumps. The study indicated that the dump with the highest pollution potential was the FGMT and that physical stabilization was considered the most suitable rehabilitation option for abating its high toxic metals from polluting the environment. The combination of methods that improve physical stability of the dump while enhancing nutrient availability for plant growth were found appropriate for rehabilitation of MCMT. The rehabilitation of the rest of the dumps required the use of chemical methods that promote growth of vegetation. According to the study, the developed tool can be used to guide rehabilitation of abandoned tailings dumps in different settings.

AB  - At depths less than 4 km in crystalline crustal rocks, water-filled fractures can be held open by hydrostatic pressure, by extensional tectonic stress and by asperities. Earthquakes in this environment exhibit cubic spectral decay above a single corner frequency, a stress drop down to 2 orders of magnitude lower than typical crustal earthquakes, and higher than normal b-values. These properties are indicators of low stress and low strength. Hence, both natural and induced earthquakes in areas of open fractures can be triggered by any process that further decreases the strength of the fracture, most commonly processes that cause short-term increases in fluid pressure. These earthquakes are often spatially and temporally associated with reservoir impoundment. Numerical models of stress surrounding an asperity on a fracture in a gravitating elastic media demonstrate that normal or strike-slip earthquakes in fluid-saturated low-stress environments and the destruction of asperities during faulting can reduce the fracture volume and increase the fluid pressure in the fracture. As a result, the increased fluid pressure would tend to migrate to surrounding and shallower fractures and create a positive feedback condition that can trigger additional earthquakes. When this positive feedback dominates over other natural processes, fore-shock activity can increase exponentially leading up to the main event(s) and hypocenters can migrate beyond and above the location of the initial triggering event. The fluid-induced near-surface positive feedback mechanism is a form of self-organized criticality (SOC) and at shallow depths is superimposed on other processes related to a relaxation of elastic stresses.

AB  - BackgroundConsumers are increasingly demanding for natural and beneficial foods, in order to improve their health and well-being. Probiotics play an important role in such demand, and dairy foods are commonly used as vehicles for such bacteria, represented predominantly by lactic acid bacteria. Due to consumers demand, food industry is constantly looking for novel bacterial strains, leading to studies that aims the isolation and characterization of their beneficial features. This study aimed to characterize the naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria obtained from a dairy environment, in order to assess their potential use as probiotics.ResultsPreliminary screening and PCR analysis, based on 16S rRNA sequencing, were applied to select and identify 15 LAB strains from the genera Lactobacillus (n=11), Pediococcus (n=2) and Weissella (n=2). All strains showed resistance to low pH and the evaluated bile salt concentrations in vitro. The API ZYM test characterized the enzymatic activity of the strains, and a high -galactosidase activity was observed in 13 strains. All strains presented resistance to simulated gastric (3h) and intestinal (4h) conditions in vitro, the ability to auto- and co-aggregate with indicator microorganisms and a high cell surface hydrophobicity. Most of the strains were positive for map and EFTu beneficial genes. All strains exhibited strong deconjugation of bile salts in vitro and all assimilated lactose.ConclusionsThe phenotypes exhibited in vitro and the presence of beneficial genes revealed the beneficial potential of the studied strains, demanding further analyses in a food matrix and in vivo to allow the development of a functional product, with health-related properties.

AB  - Currently, cleaner fish are one of the most widely used sea lice control strategies in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Two species are currently being farmed in North Atlantic countries, ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), and the sector in most countries is rapidly expanding towards self-sufficiency. The species are very different both in terms of their biology and life histories and, consequently, production and husbandry methods must be tailored to each species. There are numerous health challenges currently experienced in both species, with bacterial and parasitic diseases being the most prevalent, and cohabitation with salmon may increase the risk of disease. Good husbandry and routine health monitoring are essential, although treatment is often required when disease outbreaks occur. Ballan wrasse and lumpfish are both proven to be effective salmon delousers, although delousing efficacy can be variable in farmed fish; the provision of suitable habitat and acclimation to net-pen conditions may encourage natural behaviours, including delousing, and the use of operational welfare indicators can highlight potential welfare issues. Cleaner fish research is progressing rapidly, although much of the basic knowledge regarding the species' biology remains unknown. The simultaneous domestication of two new marine aquaculture species is a significant challenge demanding sustained effort and funding over a prolonged period of time. Research must focus on enhancing the robustness of the farmed stocks and increasing hatchery outputs to meet the urgent demands from the salmon sector and protect wild stocks from overfishing.

AB  - Oltenia Plain is one of the most important agricultural regions in Romania and one of the most sensitive in terms of extreme weather phenomena i.e. drought, due to its location in the south-western part of the country, combined with the natural and socio-economic conditions. During the post-communist period, Oltenia Plain was subject to major transformations which triggered environmental consequences i.e. land use/land cover changes, excessive fragmentation of farming land, individual farms practicing subsistence agriculture, poor services in agriculture. All of these have turned this area into one of the most vulnerable to extreme weather phenomena leading to severe degradation of agricultural land with direct impact on crop production, human health, and rural welfare. the paper aims to develop a multi-criteria vulnerability assessment using both quantitative and qualitative methods. the authors are seeking to identify relevant indicators to assess various components of socio-economic vulnerability to the drought phenomenon, using the statistical data available at LAU 2 level. As a result, three main categories of statistical variables and indicators were taken into account: demographic and social features, economy and public utilities. based on the resulted outcomes, the selected indicators are grouped in three major indexes: demographic and social vulnerability, economic vulnerability and infrastructure vulnerability based on which, an integrated socio-economic vulnerability index to drought (using the Hull score, average 50 and standard deviation 14) was computed. For the particularities of drought, the authors performed relevant climate indicators based on the meteorological data of the most representative weather stations in the study area.

AB  - Although man-made reservoirs represent an important water supply source in countries where water scarcity has become a problem, little work has been done on the evaluation of their ecological status. Taking this in account, the general aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of ecotoxicological endpoints in the potential ecological status characterization of water reservoirs, with the purpose of their possible integration in evaluation programs developed under the Water Framework Directive (WFD). To achieve this purpose, a group of bioassays were selected to evaluate both water and sediment compartments at the Alqueva reservoir (the biggest from the Iberian Peninsula), with representative species from different taxonomic and functional groups: Vibrio fischeri, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna and Heterocypris incongruens. The ecotoxicological assessment showed that sublethal endpoints (e.g., luminescence, growth or reproduction), would be more useful and sensitive to identify toxicity patterns in this type of water body. In general, the results from this ecotoxicological tool-box agreed with the potential ecological status established according to the WFD, which indicates that the bioassays complement the ecological assessment. Furthermore, the use of an ecotoxicological approach can be extremely useful, especially in cases where the biotic indices are difficult to establish, such as in man-made reservoirs. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, and/or when nutrients and organic matter concentrations are high, the two approaches do not fit, requiring further research to determine which organisms are more sensitive and the best biotic indices to use under those conditions.

AB  - China's Jiaozhou Bay is an important example of integrated coastal zone management because it has received scientific and management attention and becomes useful to other coastal managers and researchers experiencing similar challenges. Water research shows that the condition of the environment is dominated by overwhelming nutrient flows and land reclamation that has reduced the ecosystem's ability to sustain itself. Interventions have included a raft of legal measures, restocking and mariculture of all commercial species, phasing out of commercial fisheries, increasing treatment of waste water, and recently, establishing total discharge controls. Past investigations into the use of market-based solutions and further integration using management models are included in this paper. Suggested improvements are based on consensus of multiple authors with different backgrounds that the situation is serious and the trends are alarming. The suggestions include careful reexamination of the business as usual approach, new research and management approaches that exploit the advantages of multiple perspectives and collaboration. This integration demands new ways of using plans, standards, indicators, monitoring and knowledge more generally. At the foundation is the information about the environment and management actions to ensure that new management approaches, including eco-compensation, are carefully planned and monitored. Integrated water research planned by various agencies will develop these ideas into actionable knowledge on one of the world's most rapidly developing coastlines.

AB  - Parasites of fishes vary in community structure and species abundance in response to environmental conditions and pollutants. As a result, the use of parasites as bioindicators of habitat degradation has been proposed and successfully applied in recent years. Here, helminth parasites of juvenile pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus from three streams representing a gradient of watershed development and habitat quality were examined to assess variation in parasite communities. Health assessment indices were also generated for each host to quantify the influence of habitat on the observed health of individuals. A total of 22 parasite taxa were recovered from examined fish, comprising 11 digeneans, 3 cestodes, 2 acanthocephalans, 5 monogeneans and 1 crustacean. In the most disturbed stream, parasite species richness was lowest and total abundance was highest, while parasite abundance was lowest and diversity highest in the least disturbed stream. There was no significant difference in health indices among streams. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in species composition (SIMPER) identified Posthodiplostomum spp. and Actinocleidus sp. as the species driving parasite community dissimilarity. These taxa are relatively easy to identify to genus level and thus could be appropriate for use as indicators of environmental health, where increased abundance would suggest negative changes in habitat quality. However, larger scale study including more streams would be necessary to establish baseline community data before such implementation would be feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environmental impacts of land use vary regionally. Differences in geomorphology, climate, landscape structure, and biotope inventories are regarded as the main causes of this variation. We present a methodological approach for identifying regional responses in land use type to large-scale changes and the implications for the provision of habitat for farmland birds. The methodological innovations of this approach are (i) the coupling of impact assessments with economic models, (ii) the linking of cropping techniques at the plot scale with the regional distribution of land use, and (iii) the integration of statistical or monitoring data on recent states. This approach allows for the regional differentiation of farmers' responses to changing external conditions and for matching the ecological impacts of land use changes with regional environmental sensitivities. An exemplary scenario analysis was applied for a case study of an area in Germany, assessing the impacts of increased irrigation and the promotion of energy cropping on farmland birds, evaluated as a core indicator for farmland biodiversity. The potential effects on farmland birds were analyzed based on the intrinsic habitat values of the crops and cropping techniques. The results revealed that the strongest decrease in habitat availability for farmland birds occurred in regions with medium-to-low agricultural yields. As a result of the limited cropping alternatives, the increase in maize production was highest in marginal regions for both examined scenarios. Maize production replaced many crops with good-to-medium habitat suitability for birds. The declines in habitat quality were strongest in regions that are not in focus for conservation efforts for farmland birds.

AB  - Skin lesions and spring mortality events of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and selected other species were first noted in the South Branch of the Potomac River in 2002. Since that year morbidity and mortality have also been observed in the Shenandoah and Monocacy rivers. Despite much research, no single pathogen, parasite, or chemical cause for the lesions and mortality has been identified. Numerous parasites, most commonly trematode metacercariae and myxozoans; the bacterial pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, and Flavobacterium columnare; and largemouth bass virus have all been observed. None have been consistently isolated or observed at all sites, however, nor has any consistent microscopic pathology of the lesions been observed. A variety of histological changes associated with exposure to environmental contaminants or stressors, including intersex (testicular oocytes), high numbers of macrophage aggregates, oxidative damage, gill lesions, and epidermal papillomas, were observed. The findings indicate that selected sensitive species may be stressed by multiple factors and constantly close to the threshold between a sustainable (healthy) and nonsustainable (unhealthy) condition. Fish health is often used as an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health, and these findings raise concerns about environmental degradation within the Potomac River drainage. Unfortunately, while much information has been gained from the studies conducted to date, due to the multiple state jurisdictions involved, competing interests, and other issues, there has been no coordinated approach to identifying and mitigating the stressors. This synthesis emphasizes the need for multiyear, interdisciplinary, integrative research to identify the underlying stressors and possible management actions to enhance ecosystem health.

AB  - Fouling of nanofiltration (NF) membranes by humic acids was investigated using bisphenol A (BPA) as an indicator chemical to differentiate between various mechanisms that may lead to a change in solute rejection. Three commercially available NF membranes were investigated and an accelerated fouling condition was achieved with a foulant mixture containing humic acids in an electrolyte matrix. The effects of membrane fouling on the rejection of BPA were interpreted with respect to the membrane pore sizes and the fouling characteristics. Results reported here indicate that calcium concentration in the feed solution could be a major factor governing the humic acid fouling process. Moreover, a critical concentration of calcium in the feed solution was observed, at which membrane fouling was most severe. Membrane fouling characteristics were observed by their influence on BPA rejection. Such influence could result in either an increase or decrease in rejection of BPA by the three different membranes depending on the rejection mechanisms involved. It is hypothesized that these mechanisms could occur simultaneously and that the effects of each might not be easily distinguished. However, it was observed that their relative contribution was largely dependent upon membrane pore size. Pore blocking, which resulted in a considerable improvement in rejection, was prominent for the more open pore size TFC-SR2 membrane. In contrast, the cake-enhanced concentration polarisation effect was more severe for the tighter NF-270 and NF-90 membranes. For hydrophobic solutes such as BPA, the formation of the fouling layer could also interfere with the solute-membrane interaction, and therefore, exert considerable influence on the separation process.

AB  - our specimen of the cultured Emiliania huxleyi strain (CCMP1742, also known as NEPCC55a) that provides the benchmark for U-37(K)'-based paleothermometry has started producing, for reasons yet unclear, major amounts of three new alkenones identified as omega 15,22-C-35 methyl ketone, omega 15,22-C-36 ethyl ketone and omega 16,23-C-36 methyl ketone. Comparison of these structures with those established now by the same OsO4 derivatization method applied to the di-unsaturated C-37, C-38 and C-39 alkenones typically found in this organism provides insight into the possible pathway for their biosynthesis. Isothermal batch culture experiments also show the content and composition of these new compounds change systematically and quite significantly in cells when subjected to environmental conditions such as nutrient depletion, variation in light availability and prolonged darkness. Alkenones of similarly unusual short-chain length are evident in suspended particulate materials from present day surface waters in the Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean) and in two different Holocene time horizons (Unit I and Unit II deposits) in Black Sea sediments. However, the positions of the double bonds are different from those that we now report in our culture, implying a different biosynthetic sequence. These alkenones are most likely derived from another, as yet unknown, haptophyte species. If this other organism accounts for all documented occurrences of these compounds in natural samples, then either it has a capacity for growth over a remarkably wide salinity range or surface water salinity in the early Holocene Black Sea may not have been as low as is currently believed.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive requires establishment of a typology of aquatic habitats, the determination of ecological quality in each type and the use of composition and abundance of flora in doing this. Experienced phycologists are often able to relate species or genera of diatoms to particular environmental conditions but there is a need to formalise this into mechanistic indices which, if they are to be used in statutory ways to define ecological quality, must have high reliability.
   Features of the epiphytic diatom communities on five freshwater macrophytes have been related to environmental factors reflecting morphometry, major ion (base) status, and nutrient status in statistically similar subsets of 13-19 lakes from a series of 46 relatively fertile shallow Polish and UK lakes. Principal components and redundancy analyses showed that functional groupings of the diatoms were more successfully related to environmental factors than taxonomic features but that even then only a small part of the variation was explained by the environmental drivers. More than half of the variance was attributable to other, likely biotic, features.
   Use of the diatom flora in determining ecological status must therefore employ very general features of the community. The discrepancy between perception of indicator species by experienced phycologists but not by multivariate statistics lies first in the fact that such indicators are usually of gross base status (and relevant more to typology) rather than to subtleties of fertility that may reflect ecological quality and secondly because a more complex set of algorithms is used by the human brain than yet available in mechanistic indices.

AB  - Attributing the term bioindicator to a species complex such as Austropotamobius pallipes is complicated, considering that the meaning given to a bioindicator can vary according to the geographic position, and that A. pallipes species complex has been divided into 2 species and 5 subspecies, the possibility of using A. i. meridionalis as a bioindicator in watercourses of Central Italy was evaluated. To this end, we analysed the structure and abundance of a number of crayfish populations and then compared them to the water quality of the corresponding watercourses, using E.B.I. (Extended Biotic Index). This index provides information on water quality through an analysis of the macrobenthos community. The watercourses are assigned to various classes (from I to V, increasing the degrees of alteration). This study was carried out in several watercourses near Rome. The abundance of crayfish was found to be greatest in those tracts that are assessed as class 1, where the populations seem well structured with individuals of various sizes and the sex ratio is approximately 1:1. In contrast, in class 11 we found a reduced presence of specimens, mostly in bad conditions. No crayfish specimens were observed in watercourses designated as class Ill. In light of these preliminary results, it does not seem possible to consider A. i. meridionalis as a bioindicator, given that one of the typical characteristics of a biological indicator (wide distribution) is not met. Though these results illustrate the possibility of using A. i. meridionalis populations as an excellent monitoring instrument in Central Italy.

AB  - Monitoring of air pollutants using satellite data has been largely improved over the past few decades, which can provide deeper insights into the effects of anthropogenic activities on the air quality. The observations and measurements of atmospheric NO2 are poorly investigated in North Africa, therefore, the current study applied a multi-proxy approach to better understand of the ambient environment. This approach is based on satellite observations, chemical and biological analyses, and investigative information during fieldworks. The Aura satellite provides the basic data for the current study with fine resolution of atmospheric NO2 and O-3 concentrations. The obtained results reveal noticeable increases of atmospheric NO2 values since the 2011, where its emission reaches the peak during summer season that is characterized by high anthropogenic activities. The study area has many sources for NO2 emissions, such as the urban region, traffic, as well as the NH3 emission that is in turn converted to NO2. Although the discharged and spreading wastewater (80,000 m(3)/day in summer) has a limited role in NO2 emissions, it represents an indicator of the anthropogenic activities. The wastewater analyses confirm the occurrence of nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), and ammonia (NH4+), which provide an appropriate condition for NO2 release. The analyses of multi-climate datasets (previous records and the expected scenarios) reveal an increase of temperature accompanied by decrease of precipitation which confirmed the existence of climate change. Therefore, the study presents a set of suggestions to mitigate the release of NOx gases and achieve Net-Zero emissions.

AB  - The article presents the results of 3-year measurements (2018-2020) of hydrophysical and hydrochemical indicators of the Vychegda River in places where effluent is discharged from the Mondi Syktyvkar JSC pulp and paper mill. At conditionally background stations and those exposed to wastewater, the water mineralization, content of ions of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, heavy metals, petroleum products, anionic surfactants, and benz(a)pyrene were recorded in concentrations significantly lower than the MPC (MPCFI), while suspended substances, COD, PO43-, Fe, and Mn were in excess of the MPCFI. Studies have shown that, in connection with the modernization of the treatment facilities of Mondi Syktyvkar JSC, there has been a noticeable improvement in the wastewater quality; the environmental load on the ecosystem of the Vychegda River at discharge points decreased. No significant excess over conditionally background values was detected at a high water level in the Vychegda River (2018-2019) for all studied hydrochemical indicators at the points of effluent discharge. Degradation of the water quality was recorded during the low-water period (2020), i.e., a decrease in the degree of dilution of effluent from treatment facilities by river waters. During this period, the wastewater-discharge points exhibited a significant excess over the conditionally background values of mass concentrations of suspended substances, Cl-, SO42-, PO43-, NH4+, S-tot, K, Na, and phenol, as well as the chemical oxygen demand, permanganate value, turbidity, and electrical conductivity. In terms of environmental, sanitary, and toxicological indicators, the waters of all surveyed observation stations were assigned to a water-quality class 3 of (satisfactory purity).

AB  - The anthropogenic discharges of inorganic nutrients impact water quality, affecting the macroinvertebrate assemblage and food safety. The main objective of this study was to examine the seawater quality and macroinvertebrate dynamics in muddy habitats of Buenaventura Bay, Colombian Pacific. Macroinvertebrates were captured using artisanal trawl nets during different seasons and along four sampling sites. Multivariate analyses (canonical correspondence analysis and generalized additive model) were used to assess the effects of variations in nitrite, nitrates, phosphate concentrations, and physicochemical variables (salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen [DO], temperature, and total dissolved solids [TDS]) of water on the macroinvertebrate assemblage. Richness was the highest at sites with high salinity and temperature and low concentrations of nitrites and TDS. The densities of the commercial shrimp species Xiphopenaeus riveti and Rimapenaeus byrdi were the highest at sites with higher DO and alkalinity, and lower nitrate concentrations. The swimming crab Callinectes arcuatus was dominant at sites with low water quality. In summary, in the transitional season and at the inner sites of Buenaventura Bay, it was observed the lowest water quality due to high nitrate concentration. High nitrate concentration was highlighted as the main anthropogenic factor that could decrease the capture of target macroinvertebrate species for food and livelihoods of artisanal fishermen and their families. Thus, macroinvertebrate communities may be vulnerable to increased inorganic nutrient inputs, which could affect estuarine water quality and ecosystems services.

AB  - Marine and freshwater microalgae belong to taxonomically and morphologically diverse groups of organisms spanning many phyla with thousands of species. These organisms play an important role as indicators of water ecosystem conditions since they react quickly and predictably to a broad range of environmental stressors, thus providing early signals of dangerous changes. Traditionally, microscopic analysis has been used to identify and enumerate different types of organisms present within a given environment at a given point in time. However, this approach is both time-consuming and labor intensive, as it relies on manual processing and classification of planktonic organisms present within collected water samples. Furthermore, it requires highly skilled specialists trained to recognize and distinguish one taxa from another on the basis of often subtle morphological differences. Given these restrictions, a considerable amount of effort has been recently funneled into automating different steps of both the sampling and classification processes, making it possible to generate previously unprecedented volumes of plankton image data and obtain an essential database to analyze the composition of plankton assemblages. In this review we report state-of-the-art methods used for automated plankton classification by means of digital microscopy. The computer-microscope system hardware and the image processing techniques used for recognition and classification of planktonic organisms (segmentation, shape feature extraction, pigment signature determination and neural network grouping) will be described. An introduction and overview of the topic, its current state and indications of future directions the field is expected to take will be provided, organizing the review for both experts and researchers new to the field.

AB  - A fundamental question in macroecology is how contemporary and historical environments, species interactions and evolutionary processes contribute to determining community structure and shape current large-scale taxa distributions.
   We used a novel perspective simultaneously considering taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity to elucidate how these factors have shaped regional diversity patterns in composition of Trichoptera (Insecta) at the genus level among 62 mountain stream reaches located across six regions from Morocco to Sweden.
   The biogeographical range paradigm postulates declining diversity with latitude, but our results showed that taxonomic diversity was unrelated to latitude and local richness was similar in both previously glaciated and unglaciated southern regions. Also, taxonomic beta-diversity across regions was mostly driven by turnover rather than the expected nestedness component. High taxonomic diversity and several indicator genera (i.e. genera characteristic of any specific region) were found in Mediterranean regions, but also in the Carpathians and across central-eastern Europe.
   Functional traits revealed phylogenetic trait conservatism. Phylogenetic diversity and functional richness did not decrease with latitude. Phylogenetic structure of central and eastern communities was clustered (i.e. communities composed by closely related genera), whereas south-western communities were phylogenetically overdispersed (i.e. less closely related than expected by chance).
   Overall, latitudinal patterns of taxonomic turnover and variable phylogenetic community structure indicate an important role of contemporary ecological conditions in structuring community composition, probably by environmental filtering. However, the signature of biogeographical history is also relevant to understanding the large-scale distribution of taxa. The permanence of caddisfly communities in temperate regions during Pleistocene glaciations demonstrates the presence of refugia there and, therefore, broadens the spatial extent of refugia beyond Mediterranean areas. This contrasts with theories which placed refugia exclusively in Mediterranean areas.

AB  - One of the major tasks in environmental protection is monitoring the coast for negative impacts due to climate change and anthropopressure. Remote sensing techniques are often used in studies of impact assessment. Topographic and bathymetric procedures are treated as separate measurement methods, while methods that combine coastal zone analysis with underwater impacts are rarely used in geotechnical analyses. This study presents an assessment of the bathymetry airborne system used for coastal monitoring, taking into account environmental conditions and providing a comparison with other monitoring methods. The tests were carried out on a section of the Baltic Sea where, despite successful monitoring, coastal degradation continues. This technology is able to determine the threat of coastal cliff erosion (based on the geotechnical analyses). Shallow depths have been reported to be a challenge for bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), due to the difficulty in separating surface, water column and bottom reflections from each other. This challenge was overcome by describing the classification method used which was the CANUPO classification method as the most suitable for the point cloud processing. This study presents an innovative approach to identifying natural hazards, by combining analyses of coastal features with underwater factors. The main goal of this manuscript is to assess the suitability of using bathymetry scanning in the Baltic Sea to determine the factors causing coastal erosion. Furthermore, a geotechnical analysis was conducted, taking into account geometrical ground change underwater. This is the first study which uses a coastal monitoring approach, combining geotechnical computations with remote sensing data. This interdisciplinary scientific research can increase the awareness of the environmental processes.

AB  - Food packaging is an important industrial sector that has great influence on food loss and waste. The search of optimal conditions to minimize the negative impacts of food packaging on the environment must promote the selection of the best available packages. This work has evaluated the environmental impact of the distribution of fruit and vegetables in the Spanish peninsular context using reusable plastic crates and single-use cardboard boxes. Discussion and decision at each phase and step of the methodology were provided, being an example to follow for similar studies in the future. For the analysis, five different impact categories were considered: global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential and photochemical oxidant creation potential. In addition, energy and water consumption were taken into account. According to the results of the analysis, the use of reusable plastic crates should be selected, since the values of all impact categories and energy consumption indicators were higher in the case of single-use cardboard boxes. The sensitivity analysis revealed a robust preference for plastic crates in comparison with cardboard boxes even in alternative scenarios, and only the hypothetic reduction of the quality of the cardboard resulted in significant lower impacts for cardboard boxes in comparison to plastic crates in photochemical oxidant creation potential, acidification potential, and energy consumption. This work demonstrates that plastic packaging should not be totally excluded or banned, since it can be the most environmentally friendly option in certain applications.

AB  - Routine analytical methods are constrained in the speed of application, sample throughput and inability to determine the right bioavailable loading of pollutants. Microbial biosensor technology resolved these constraints by offering the most rapid, sensitive, reliable and cost-effective technology, especially in a bioavailable context. This study describes the growth characterisation, optimisation and induction bioassay of three different lux-marked biosensors, thus testing their responses to doses of target hydrocarbons (naphthalene, toluene, Isopropylbenzene) and solution of mixed hydrocarbons. These biosensors, Pseudomonas fluorescence HK44, Escherichia coli HMS174 and Pseudomonas putida TVA8 harbours luxCDABE reporter genes coupled to induction by hydrocarbons. Biosensors harvested at optimal exponential phase and induced with hydrocarbon using the optimised assay conditions are highly sensitive and responsive to their inducers in a proportionate dose-dependent manner. The established dose responses of these catabolic biosensors signify the prospect of extrapolation for estimating the genuine contamination loading of pollutants for environmental relevance. However, several factors may contribute to the quenching effect at high concentration of inducers. Robust responsiveness to mixed hydrocarbon solution has been also realised accentuating its feasibility in analysing real environmental samples containing heterogenous pollutants. This study emphasises the suitability of bioluminescent bacterial biosensors for pollutants analysis and notably the detection of soluble bioavailable fractions of diverse hydrocarbons, hence, serves as a reliable bioindicator of hydrocarbon pollution in an environment. Even so, the real value of biosensors is for a suite of ecologically justified biosensors to be applied in complementary combinations with other focused analytical or chemical methods for broad and resourceful inference.

AB  - Metsulfuron methyl is typical sulfonylurea herbicides. The degradation of metsulfuron-methyl has aroused research interests because it was mobile in natural media, and raising environmental concerns about contamination of metsulfuron-methyl to surface water. However, conventional methods cannot remove these herbicides from water efficiently. This work proposed a rapid and efficient enzymatic degradation of metsulfuron-methyl by chloroperoxidase (CPO). The effect of reaction conditions, including pH, concentration of oxidant and enzyme, and degradation time on the degradation efficiency (eta) were studied and accordingly optimized. The optimum eta of 93.2% for 16.7 mu mol center dot L-1 metsulfuron-methyl was achieved after 10 min at 25 degrees C and weakly acidic pH. The required CPO is only 0.06 mu mol center dot L-1. The degraded products of metsulfuron-methyl were identified by HPLC-MS. The results indicated that metsulfuron-methyl molecule was decomposed, and five smaller molecular fragments were detected. Moreover, it was found that if this enzymatic degradation was combined with following activated sludge treatment, then, this bio-cascade treatment was more effective in removal of metsulfuron-methyl in wastewater than by activated sludge alone (which was used in most municipal sewage plant). The COD removal increased from 12.09% to 74.27%. Ecotoxicity tests of 72 h EC50 for degraded solution using a green alga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, as eco-indicator demonstrated the enzymatic degraded products had lower eco-toxicity than metsulfuron-methyl itself. Application of this bio-cascade treatment to real water sample and artificial wastewater containing metsulfuron-methyl was effectively.

AB  - Simple Summary It is well known that the thermal environment has an integral role in maintaining the health and productivity of cattle. Although cold stress has been identified to negatively influence cattle comfort and productivity, the predominant focus herein has been describing the influence of heat stress on bovines. The impact of heat stress is particularly important due to the changing global environment. Global warming is likely to occur, however, the nature and magnitude of environmental changes, both climatic and non-climatic, are difficult to elucidate. Therefore a predominant focus on the impact of hot environments on cattle is warranted. This review provides an overview of the dynamic relationship that exists between the thermal environment and bovines.
   Abstract Heat stress and cold stress have a negative influence on cattle welfare and productivity. There have been some studies investigating the influence of cold stress on cattle, however the emphasis within this review is the influence of heat stress on cattle. The impact of hot weather on cattle is of increasing importance due to the changing global environment. Heat stress is a worldwide phenomenon that is associated with reduced animal productivity and welfare, particularly during the summer months. Animal responses to their thermal environment are extremely varied, however, it is clear that the thermal environment influences the health, productivity, and welfare of cattle. Whilst knowledge continues to be developed, managing livestock to reduce the negative impact of hot climatic conditions remains somewhat challenging. This review provides an overview of the impact of heat stress on production and reproduction in bovines.

AB  - The sensitivity of deltas in response to evolutionary factors makes them important archives of the events that occurred in the entire river basin. Detailed knowledge of the stratigraphy and morphology, combined with a set of archaeological, palaeobotanical and historical information, make possible to reconstruct the diachronic changes of the landscape in the Tiber delta plain over the past 3000 years taking into account natural and anthropic forcing. The main factors that contributed to the delta landscape change are considered following a temporal scansion. Among the natural factors, we considered climate, sea level rise, tectonic and local subsidence. Among the human factors we considered the population density and several human activities, such as farming and breeding practices, reclamation, construction of ports, canals and salt works. To evaluate the amount of sediment involved in the delta evolution during different periods, the BQART model was used. Prior to Roman times anthropogenic forcing had a lower influence than natural forcing on the landscape evolution. During the Roman period (between third century BC-fourth century AD), the delta landscape was severely conditioned by the human activity. Throughout the Middle Ages and until the first half of the nineteenth century, a more natural landscape evolved in the delta, gradually and partially replacing the previous landscape. With the arrival of the new Italian State a new and impressive landscape change occurred. The evolution of the Tiber delta landscape appear particularly affected by anthropogenic forcing when socio-political organization allowed the control and planning of policy actions.

AB  - Pathogen transport through the environment is complicated, involving a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes. This study considered the transfer of microorganisms from soil into overland flow under rain-splash conditions. Although microorganisms are colloidal particles, they are commonly quantified as colony-forming units (CFUs) per volume rather than as a mass or number of particles per volume, which poses a modeling challenge. However, for very small particles that essentially remain suspended after being ejected into ponded water and for which diffusion can be neglected, the Gao model, originally derived for solute transfer from soil, describes particle transfer into suspension and is identical to the Hairsine-Rose particle erosion model for this special application. Small-scale rainfall experiments were conducted in which an Escherichia coli (E. coil) suspension was mixed with a simple soil (9:1 sand-to clay mass ratio). The model fit the experimental E. coli data. Although re-conceptualizing the Gao solute model as a particle suspension model was convenient for accommodating the unfortunate units of CFU ml(-1), the Hairsine-Rose model is insensitive to assumptions about E. coli per CFU as long as the assumed initial mass concentration of E. coli is very small compared to that of the soil particle classes. Although they undoubtedly actively interact with their environment, this study shows that transport of microorganisms from soil into overland storm flows can be reasonably modeled using the same principles that have been applied to small mineral particles in previous studies.

AB  - Aims: The knowledge of rice weed communities, their diversity, composition, dynamics and distribution is still inadequate. We present information on the plant diversity of rice fields in major Southeast Asian centres of rice cultivation, the prevailing life forms, the plant communities, the main environmental drivers, and phytogeographic patterns that shape these communities. Study area: Seven different regions of Vietnam and the Philippines, including lowland and mountain areas (0-1390 m a.s.l.). Methods: Altogether 115 vegetation releves using the Braun-Blanquet method were recorded during wet and dry seasons between 2013 and 2015. Soil samples were collected and farmers of surveyed rice fields were interviewed. Vegetation surveys were designed to detect possible effects of soil properties, climate, altitude, geographic location, landscape heterogeneity, seasonality, management and intensity of cultivation, and structural parameters on the paddy vegetation. Hierarchical cluster analysis UPGMA was applied and NMDS ordinations were performed to visualize differences in plant community composition along the different gradients. Results: We found 113 vascular plant species, with annual hydrophytes and therophytes being the prevailing life forms. Sixty of the recorded species appear to be globally rare. We revealed four clusters of plant communities which are explained mainly by soil acidity, crop height and temperature: Paspalum distichum-Hydrolea zeylanica community; Echinochloa crus-galli community, Rotala indica-Monochoria vaginalis community and Fimbristylis littoralis-Leptochloa chinensis community. The two latter communities were further classified into regional subunits. Conclusions: We conclude that the composition of weed communities provides valuable information on environmental and biogeographical conditions of the local rice landscapes, and that it is probably the most applicable and reliable indicator of management intensity.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) within an ecosystem is crucial for die water-limited environment that currently lacks adequate quantification in the arid region of Northwest China, mainly covered by phreatophytes, such as the Populus euphratica Oliv. tree and the Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. shrub species. Accordingly. ET was measured for an entire year using eddy covariance (EC) in P. euphratica stands in the lower Heihe River Basin, Northwest China. During the growing season, the total ET was 850 mm, with a mean of 4.0 mm/d, Which is obviously more than that observed at tree-level and stand level scales, which was likely due to the different level of soil evaporation induced by irrigation via water conveyance. Factors associated with ET fall into either environmental or plant eco-physiological categories. Environmental factors account for at least 79% variation of ET and the linear relationship between ET and the voundwater table (GWT) revealed the potential water use of P. euphratica forests under the non-water stress condition with die GWT less than 3 m deep. Plant eco-physiological parameters, specifically die leaf area 'index (LAI), have direct impact on the seasonal pattern of ET which provides a valuable reference to the wide-area estimates of ET for riparian forests by using LAI. In conclusion, P. euphratica forests have high water use after water conveyance, which may be the result of long-term adapting to local climates and limited water availability.

AB  - Owing to its impact on global ecosystem, climate change and related effects is being perceived as a serious issue worldwide especially in the arid and semi-arid regions. Climatic variability has been considered as a major cause for degradation of natural resources. Desertification caused by climatic or human-induced processes negatively affects the productivity of land within an ecosystem. It is noteworthy that depletion of vegetation cover plays a key role in land degradation; in fact reduction in plants and perennial cover is regarded as an indicator of the onset of desertification. Temporal analysis of satellite-based NDVI is one of the major remote sensing tools which can identify the depletion of vegetation cover. In the present study, rain-use efficiency (RUE) method has been used for monitoring vegetation degradation and, substantially, the process of desertification in western Rajasthan. RUE, the ratio between normalized growing season NDVI and rainfall, has been calculated for individual years (1983-2013). A correlation analysis was carried out by considering yearly RUE as dependent variable and time (years) as the independent variable. It shows that regression slope of RUE mainly depends upon the dynamic condition of integrated NDVI and rainfall. In order to monitor the areas under human-induced desertification, the residual trend method has been adopted. The correlation between rainfall and NDVI was found significant (p < 0.05) except some portion in the middle east. The study reveals that about 35% of the total area has experienced high human-induced desertification process.

AB  - Water scarcity is becoming one of the greatest challenges that human societies will face during this century. Monitoring water availability is expensive and technically challenging. In this regard, biological communities (e.g. aquatic insects) offer a cost-effective alternative, since they integrate temporal and spatial hydrological variability.
   Here we explore the potential of Chironomidae (Diptera), which have been usually neglected due to their complex taxonomy, as indicators of both local habitat condition and water scarcity. The study took place in 28 sites across seven dryland streams distributed within a 400 km(2) section of the Upper San Pedro River basin, southeastern Arizona. The selected streams covered a wide range of hydrological variability, which was continuously measured through the deployment of 15 electrical resistance (ER) sensors. Chironomidae taxa with no drought-resistance strategies were rarely found in streams that experienced frequent drying events (i.e. intermittent and ephemeral streams), suggesting that droughts have the potential to reduce species richness due to local extinctions of drought-intolerant taxa. Intermittent and ephemeral streams registered low canopy cover and a significantly higher abundance of scrapers (which mainly feed on algae) and shredders (feeding on poorly decomposed coarse organic material). This suggests that structural changes associated to drought (e.g. reduced canopy cover and decomposition rates) might lead to changes in the functional composition of the Chironomidae assemblages. We conclude that Chironomidae species can be used as indicators of hydrological variability and the impacts of drought on streams in the absence of flow gauges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation has been identified as a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. Several landscape metrics have been developed to quantify the extent of fragmentation, of which the Effective Mesh Size Index (m(eff)) is one of the most widely used. However, its relevance for analysing the effect of fragmentation on biodiversity patterns has been rarely tested. We analysed the explanatory power of m(eff) for richness patterns of different groups of vascular plant species (all species, and species groups by naturalisation and threat status) in Lower Saxony, Germany, by using a grid of 1386 analysis units. Since we assumed species richness to be influenced by abiotic conditions and spatial autocorrelation, we used variation partitioning to separate the effects of these variables from that of fragmentation. We tested five types of m(eff) based on various fragmentation geometries. We found that m(eff) largely influenced richness of neophytes and, to a lesser extent, that of archaeophytes whilst the richness of native species was only slightly affected and threatened species were not affected. All species groups, except threatened species, showed a negative correlation with m(eff), i.e. richness was highest in highly fragmented and lowest in less fragmented grid cells. We conclude that m(eff) is a meaningful tool to explain richness patterns of non-native plant species, if relevant fragmentation geometries are chosen, but not of native and threatened plant species. Our approach may help future studies to determine correct fragmentation geometries to use with m(eff) and may facilitate the unravelling of fragmentation impacts on the landscape-scale.

AB  - The advent of the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century increased the volume and variety of manufactured goods and enriched the quality of life for society as a whole. However, industrialization was also accompanied by new manufacturing and complex processes that brought about the use of hazardous chemicals and difficult-to-control operating conditions. Moreover, human-process-equipment interaction plus on-the-job learning resulted in further undesirable outcomes and associated consequences. These problems gave rise to many catastrophic process safety incidents that resulted in thousands of fatalities and injuries, losses of property, and environmental damages. These events led eventually to the necessity for a gradual development of a new multidisciplinary field, referred to as process safety. From its inception in the early 1970s to the current state of the art, process safety has come to represent a wide array of issues, including safety culture, process safety management systems, process safety engineering, loss prevention, risk assessment, risk management, and inherently safer technology. Governments and academic/research organizations have kept pace with regulatory programs and research initiatives, respectively. Understanding how major incidents impact regulations and contribute to industrial and academic technology development provides a firm foundation to address new challenges, and to continue applying science and engineering to develop and implement programs to keep hazardous materials within containment. Here the most significant incidents in terms of their impact on regulations and the overall development of the field of process safety are described.

AB  - Stocks of estuarine migrant species can be challenging to assess due to a relative lack of abundance data in offshore areas and complex interactions between spawning behavior and estuarine geomorphology. The blue crab Callinectes sapidus in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), USA, inhabits estuaries ranging from large semi-enclosed bays to narrow river mouths where estuarine conditions extend onto the continental shelf. Mature female reproductive status was used as an indicator to identify spawning habitat, and data from long-term fishery independent surveys were used to evaluate spatiotemporal trends in abundance of spawning females. Long-term data (1990-2011) were obtained from the Southeast Area Marine Assessment Program (SEAMAP) South Atlantic survey and the Georgia Ecological Monitoring Trawl Survey. Biological samples were obtained from estuarine and offshore areas of Georgia for a detailed analysis of habitat use. Reproductive status of mature female blue crabs (ovigery, ovary development, egg remnants) was indicative of a summer peak in spawning in Georgia that occurred primarily on the continental shelf as far as 13 km offshore. SEAMAP data provide strong evidence that blue crab females spawn on the continental shelf throughout the SAB, with substantial declines in spawner abundance over time. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of SEAMAP time series was indicative of regional spawning areas defined by biogeography which are poorly aligned with fishery management jurisdictions. Indicators of reproductive status provided a powerful method for identifying spawning habitats of an estuarine migrant species, especially when spawners may disperse over the continental shelf and occur at low density.

AB  - Despite many important success stories around the planet, there is general disappointment at the overall impact of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (hereinafter: UNCCD) during its first 20 years, with soil degradation still a challenge for land managers throughout much of the world's drylands. Calls for a new protocol under the UNCCD that will ensure "Zero Net Land Degradation" (ZNLD) have gained momentum since the tacit endorsement of the concept at the 2012 Rio + 20 summit. There is great conceptual appeal to a framework that implicitly allows for development by balancing associated soil fertility loss with commensurate gains resulting from restoration activities. Trading programs which seek to reach "zero net" degradation of other natural resources have been in place for many years now internationally and offer an important basis for assessing the practical and theoretical problems that are likely to arise under a ZNLD framework. This article summarizes the relevant experiences garnered in "offsetting" regulatory schemes in the areas of wetland preservation, biodiversity, forestry, greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, real estate zoning, and conventional air pollution control. While many of these initiatives take place in environments with completely different climatic conditions, they offer important lessons for ZNLD advocates. Pitfalls in offset programs are identified in the areas of: reliability of trades; clear quantifiable units of measure; equivalence given land heterogeneity; and delayed benefits. The article contains a series of recommendations for land degradation offsets based on this diverse international experience. Proven implementation strategies should inform any future ZNLD policies as part of national and regional regulatory programs to combat desertification and arid land soil degradation.

AB  - Production and resource use by intertidal taxa were studied in the estuarine fjord of Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Along nearly 100 km, salinity is similar, and intertidal habitat and immersion time were kept consistent, thus allowing a focus on other environmental variables such as temperature and resource availability that could influence growth. Primary producers (ulvoid and fucoid macroalgae) and suspension feeders (oysters and barnacles) were transplanted on three beaches in each of three regions and assessed for individual-level growth, carbon and nitrogen ratios, and stable isotopes. In most transplants, delta C-13 and C/N showed no regional variation but delta N-15 was enriched up-estuary. Among environmental variables, chlorophyll a, total suspended solids, and particulate organic matter had small and/or inconsistent regional variation, but temperature was higher up-estuary. For the most intensively studied species (Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas) transplanted four times over 2 years, seasonal and regional variation in growth were best predicted by temperature rather than resource availability. Growth rates continued to increase into Totten Inlet, a shallow finger inlet at the head of Puget Sound. As indicators of environmental conditions, the growth and tissue chemistry of intertidal study taxa affirm that sources and amounts of resources show no strong gradients along this estuarine fjord, and they also support temperature as a key factor for performance, with species-specific responses. Higher temperatures may also have community-level impacts, given prior evidence linking beach temperatures to reduced intertidal diversity and biomass into Puget Sound.

AB  - This study examines the effects of temporal changes on microbial parameters in a brackish aquatic ecosystem. To this aim, the abundances of prokaryotes and vibrios together with the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins by leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), polysaccharides by beta-glucosidase (GLU) and organic phosphates by alkaline phosphatase (AP), heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP), respiration (R), were seasonally investigated, during a 2-year period in the coastal area of Cape Peloro (Messina, Italy), constituted by two brackish lakes (Faro and Ganzirri). In addition, physical and chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, nutrients) and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC, PN) were measured. The influence of multiple factors on prokaryotic abundances and activities was analysed. The results showed that Cape Peloro area is characterised by high seasonal variability of the microbial parameters that is higher than the spatial one. Combined changes in particulate matter and temperature (T), could explain the variability in vibrios abundance, GLU and R activities in both lakes, indicating a direct stimulation of the warm season on the heterotrophic prokaryotic metabolism. Positive correlations between T (from 13.3 to 29.6 A degrees C) and HPP, LAP, AP, POC, PN are also observed in Ganzirri Lake. Moreover, the trophic status index and most of the microbial parameters show significant seasonal differences. This study demonstrates that vibrios abundance and microbial activities are responsive to the spatial and seasonal changes of examined area. The combined effects of temperature and trophic conditions on the microbial parameters lead us to suggest their use as potential indicators of the prokaryotic response to climate changes in temperate brackish areas.

AB  - The high water mark (HWM) is commonly used as a boundary for coastal management and planning. Due to the dynamic nature of the coastal environment, the determination of HWM can be difficult and may vary based on the indicators unique to the location.
   Using remote-sensing image analysis-techniques, this study evaluates the spatial and temporal variation of HWM based on several indicators. These include vegetation lines, frontal dune toe, mean high water spring (MHWS)/mean higher high water (MHHW), and high water lines (HWL). Other linear boundaries defined by agencies for various applications are also used as indicators.
   For improved coastal property management, this study also uses an enhanced Spatial Continuity of the Swash Probability (SCSP) model as a HWM indicator by excluding the runup parameter regarding the Spatial Continuity of Tide Probability (SCTP). In order to better account for sudden shape changes, the extended instead of the simple Hausdorff distance has been used to measure the seasonal variation of HWM position. Monte Carlo simulation of DEM data and Fractal Dimension (FD) techniques were used to examine spatial uncertainties due to both the precision of input data and the processing techniques used.
   Two case study areas in Western Australia with varying coastal conditions have been selected to evaluate the approach. These are Coogee Beach in South Fremantle and Cooke Point in Port Hedland. Results for both study areas indicate that spatial variations of HWM due to seasonal changes are about one order of magnitude larger than variations due to uncertainties in the input data. This behaviour, while present at both study areas, is more significant at Coogee Beach having a sandy beach with high wave energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wetland restoration is a commonly used approach to reduce nutrient loading to freshwater and coastal ecosystems, with many wetland restoration efforts occurring in former agricultural fields. Restored wetlands are expected to be effective at retaining or removing both nitrogen and phosphorus (P), yet restoring wetland hydrology to former agricultural fields can lead to the release of legacy fertilizer P. Here, we examined P cycling and export following rewetting of the Timberlake Restoration Project, a 440 ha restored riverine wetland complex in the coastal plain of North Carolina. We also compared P cycling within the restored wetland to two minimally disturbed nearby wetlands and an adjacent active agricultural field. In the restored wetland we observed increased soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations following initial flooding, consistent with our expectations that P bound to iron would be released under reducing conditions. SRP concentrations in spring were 2.5 times higher leaving the restored wetland than a forested wetland and an agricultural field. During two large-scale drawdown and rewetting experiments we decreased the water depth by 1 m in similar to 10 ha of inundated wetland for 2 weeks, followed by reflooding. Rewetting following experimental drainage had no effect on SRP concentrations in winter, but SRP concentrations did increase when the experiment was repeated during summer. Our best estimates suggest that this restored wetland could release legacy fertilizer P for up to a decade following hydrologic restoration. The time lag between restoration and biogeochemical recovery should be incorporated into management strategies of restored wetlands.

AB  - Bio-economic farm models are tools to evaluate ex-post or to assess ex-ante the impact of policy and technology change on agriculture, economics and environment. Recently, various BEFMs have been developed, often for one purpose or location, but hardly any of these models are re-used later for other purposes or locations. The Farm System Simulator (FSSIM) provides a generic framework enabling the application of BEFMs under various situations and for different purposes (generating supply response functions and detailed regional or farm type assessments). FSSIM is set up as a component-based framework with components representing farmer objectives, risk, calibration, policies, current activities, alternative activities and different types of activities (e.g., annual and perennial cropping and livestock). The generic nature of FSSIM is evaluated using five criteria by examining its applications. FSSIM has been applied for different climate zones and soil types (criterion 1) and to a range of different farm types (criterion 2) with different specializations, intensities and sizes. In most applications FSSIM has been used to assess the effects of policy changes and in two applications to assess the impact of technological innovations (criterion 3). In the various applications, different data sources, level of detail (e.g., criterion 4) and model configurations have been used. FSSIM has been linked to an economic and several biophysical models (criterion 5). The model is available for applications to other conditions and research issues, and it is open to be further tested and to be extended with new components, indicators or linkages to other models.

AB  - The distribution of the rare and endangered perennial herb Primulina tabacum Hance is restricted to eight karst caves in southern China. To conserve P. tabacum and to evaluate possible reintroduction, we studied its historical distribution and conducted field surveys of both its biotic and physical environment. We used detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis to investigate the plant community structure and to identify the major environmental factors associated with its presence at eight sites and absence from three other sites where it formerly grew. The results revealed differences in community structure among sites and close correlations between species composition and environmental conditions. The data indicate that P. tabacum has special ecological requirements, including alkaline soil, low soil content of N, P, K and organic matter, low light, a high soil water content and high relative humidity, and a high atmospheric CO(2) concentration. Soil K content, relative humidity and atmospheric CO(2) concentration were the three variables most strongly associated with the vegetation composition and structure of the 11 sites. It appears that as a result of reductions in humidity, some of the historical localities of P. tabacum may no longer be suitable for reintroduction. Pilea notata, Pteris cretica var. nervosa and two moss species, Heteroscyphus coalitus and Gymnostomiella longinervis, were strongly associated with P. tabacum. The first two plants could be useful as indicators of suitable environments for P. tabacum, and the moss species could be useful as nurse plants for the reintroduction of P. tabacum into wild habitats.

AB  - Landscapes exhibit various degrees of spatial heterogeneity according to the differential intensity and interactions among processes and disturbances that they are subjected to. The management of these spatially dynamical landscapes requires that we can accurately map them and monitor the evolution of their spatial arrangement through time. Such a mapping requires first the delineation of various spatial features present in the landscape such as patches and their boundaries. However, there are several environmental (spatial variability) as well as technical (spatial resolution) factors that impair our ability to accurately delineate patches and their boundaries as polygons. Here, we investigate how the spatial structure and spatial resolution of the data affect the accuracy of detecting patches and their boundaries over simulated landscapes and real data. Simulated landscapes consisted of two patches with parameterized spatial properties (patches' level of spatial autocorrelation, mean value and variance) separated by a boundary of known location. Real data allowed the investigation of a more complex landscape where there is a known transition between two forest domains with unknown spatial properties. Boundary locations are defined using the lattice-wombling edge detector at various aggregation levels and the degree of patch homogeneity is determined using Getis-Ord's G*. Results show that boundary detection using a local edge detector is greatly affected by the spatial conditions of the data, namely variance, abruptness of the spatial gradient between two patches and patches' level of spatial autocorrelation. They also suggest that data aggregation is not a panacea for bringing out the ecological process creating the patches and that indicators derived from local measures of spatial association can be complementary tools for analysing spatial structures affecting boundary delineation.

AB  - The impact of disasters, whether natural or man-made, not only has human dimensions, but environmental ones as well. Environmental conditions may exacerbate the impact of a disaster, and vice versa, disasters tend to have an impact on the environment. Deforestation, forest management practices, or agriculture systems can worsen the negative environmental impacts of a storm or typhoon, leading to landslides, flooding, silting, and ground/surface water contamination.
   We have only now come to understand these cyclical causes and impacts and realize that taking care of our natural resources and managing them wisely not only assures that future generations will be able to live in sustainable ways, but also reduces the risks that natural and man-made hazards pose to people living today. Emphasizing and reinforcing the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster management has become a critical priority, requiring the sound management of natural resources as a tool to prevent disasters and lessen their impacts on people, their homes, and livelihoods.
   As the horrors of the Asian tsunami of December 2004 continue to be evaluated, and people in the region slowly attempt to build a semblance of normalcy, we have to look to the lessons learnt from the tsunami disaster as an opportunity to prepare ourselves better for future disasters. This article focuses on findings and lessons learnt on the environmental aspects of the tsunami, and its implications on disaster preparedness plans.
   This article essentially emphasizes the cyclical interrelations between environments and disasters, by studying the findings and assessments of the recent Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004. It specifically looks at four key affected countries - Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus ( RHDV) escaped from quarantine facilities on Wardang Island in September 1995 and spread through South Australia to Queensland by December 1995. To determine the impact of this biological control agent on wild rabbit populations in Queensland, shot sample and spotlight count data were collected at six sites. RHDV spread across Queensland from the south-west to the east at a rate of at least 91 km month(-1) between October 1995 and October 1996. The initial impact on rabbit density appeared highly variable, with an increase of 81% (255 +/- 79 (s. e.) to 385 +/- 73 rabbits km(-2)) at one site and a decrease of 83% (129 +/- 27 to 22 +/- 18 rabbits km(-2)) at another during the first outbreak. However, after 30 months of RHDV activity, counts were at least 90% below counts conducted before RHDV arrived. Using a population model to account for environmental conditions, the mean suppression of rabbit density caused by rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) was estimated to be 74% ( ranging from 43% to 94% between sites). No outbreaks were observed when the density of susceptible rabbits was lower than 12 km(-2). Where rabbit density remains low for long periods RHDV may not persist. This is perhaps most likely to occur in the isolated populations towards the northern edge of the range of rabbits in Australia. RHDV may have to be reintroduced into these populations. Further south in areas more suitable for rabbits, RHDV is more likely to persist, resulting in a high density of immune rabbits. In such areas conventional control techniques may be more important to enhance the influence of RHD.

AB  - Mechanisms of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and methanethiol (MT) production and consumption were determined in moderately hypersaline mats, Guerrero Negro, Mexico. Biological pathways regulated the net flux of DMS and MT as revealed by increases in flux resulting from decreased salinity, increased temperature and the removal of oxygen. Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) was not present in these microbial mats and DMS and MT are probably formed by the reaction of photosynthetically produced low-molecular weight organic carbon and biogenic hydrogen sulphide derived from sulphate reduction. These observations provide an alternative to the notion that DMSP or S-containing amino acids are the dominant precursors of DMS in intertidal sediment systems. The major sink for DMS in the microbial mats was biological consumption, whereas photochemical oxidation to dimethylsulphoxide was the major sink for DMS in the overlying water column. Diel flux measurements demonstrated that significantly more DMS is released from the system during the night than during the day. The major consumers of DMS in the presence of oxygen were monooxygenase-utilizing bacteria, whereas under anoxic conditions, DMS was predominantly consumed by sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanethiol was consumed by methanogenic bacteria. Aerobic and anaerobic consumption rates of DMS were nearly identical. Mass balance estimates suggest that the consumption in the water column is likely to be smaller than net the flux from the mats. Volatile organic sulphur compounds are thus indicators of high rates of carbon fixation and sulphate reduction in these laminated sediment ecosystems, and atmospheric sulphur can be generated as a biogenic signature of the microbial mat community.

AB  - Elevated rates of sedimentation as a result of human activities is a recognised problem in many marine environments. Thus, it is important to develop a mechanistic understanding of the impact and subsequent recovery of terrestrial sediment deposits in these areas. This paper describes an experiment to investigate possible reasons for the slow recovery of intertidal soft-sediment macrofaunal communities following smothering by storm-associated terrestrial sediment deposits. We measured, and monitored changes in, a large number of physical and biogeochemical properties of terrestrially derived sediments, in order to identify those characteristics that were most important to potential colonists. Properties of the terrestrial sediments were remarkably different to those of the surrounding sandflat and showed little signs of change over the duration (4.5 mo) of the experiment. Despite this, we were able to identify that temporal changes in macrofaunal community composition were strongly correlated with the levels of chl a, total carbohydrate, phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and coarse sand in the sediments, We recommend that future studies of macrofaunal recolonisation following deposition of terrestrial sediment should include measurement of these sediment properties. In addition, analyses which isolate the biologically available portions of carbohydrate, P and N may provide even more insight as to the importance of these properties as settlement cues and indicators of recovery. We also assessed the influence on macrofaunal communities of the conditioning the sediment receives prior to being deposited on the sandflat (i.e. mixing with seawater or freshwater), and found no effect of this on the impact on existing macrofaunal communities or on the subsequent recovery of sediments or macrofauna.

AB  - Planning and architecture of modern housing projects should take into account the fact that human well-being depends very much on needs derived from the natural history of human evolutionary aspects, which include territoriality, security, and a balance between privacy and communal activity. Although model housing projects should consider space, all to often the need for privacy and the importance of the residential environment has been neglected. Putative consequences are a loss of social coherence, resulting in anonymity; vandalism and an, increase in crime rates. On a game theoretical basis, we predict that a tendency for cooperation grows with the increasing probability of future meetings among inhabitants. The higher the probability to re-meet ca-residents, the more interactions are to be expected. Frequent meetings Lead to reciprocal recognition and enable the inhabitants to control their environment by identifying straners. This mechanism results in the identification with a common, territory. Friendly interactions between residents are a motor for and an indicator of satisfactory living conditions. For this study, six different Viennese residential apartment blocks were selected and their quality measured using a checklist. The behavior of the residents was recorded using ethological standard methods (N = 1653), their subjective evaluation was assessed by on-site interviews (N = 300), and the frequency of physical incivilities was counted. The results support the hypotheses. The classification of urban environments relating to the presence of the above Listed features indicates that high habitat quality covaries with differences in preference for the site, extent of friendly interactions and familiarity with other residents, and occurrences of incivilities. One may conclude that the importance of the quality of the habitat environment cannot be overestimated, as its socially integrative potential is a means to counteract anonymity and crime incidence in cities.

AB  - Pocket beaches are a large part of the Greek coastline, with strong touristic, economic and natural interest. Their morphological characteristics and wave forcing are the main factors influencing their evolution, while the most commonly observed dynamic is beach rotation due to prevailing wave direction. Human activities and climate change call for a better management for these areas, necessitating, therefore, the identification of coastal geomorphodynamic processes. This paper focuses on the geomorphological and sedimentological dynamic processes of Platis Gialos Bay (Sifnos), which have given rise to the present setting. Beach orientation, slope, length, geology, Posidonia Oceanica, degree of embayment, sedimentology and closure are some parameters that must be considered to calculate the morphodynamic and stability indicators that prevail at the beach. Wave exposure forcing conditions, longshore - rip current direction, are also hydrodynamic processes to be determined, as they play a significant role in sediment transport. A number of methodologies took place in order to determine the level of disturbance of this dynamic equilibrium, which included morphological mapping, sedimentary classification, shoreline displacement/evolution monitoring, hydrodynamic and sedimentary modelling. The exposure of the coast to the southern waves, the reduced sediment supply from the local fluvial network, human activities and the construction of the fishing shelter have led the area to a continuous erosion and coastline retreat in its western and central part, in contrast to the eastern part, where there is a continuous deposition reflected by coastal accretion and the formation of a shallow environment.

AB  - Plant diversity is a known indicator of healthy ecosystems, therefore understanding interspecific relationships that structure plant communities is critical for invasive species management. A cryptic introduction of invasive macrophyte water chestnut (Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai) into the northeastern United States prompted investigation into potential competitive interactions between it and two common submersed species in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Vallisneria americana and Hydrilla verticillata. Because the congeneric invader Trapa natans co-occurs in the same watershed with a documented history of negative environmental impacts, it was included for comparison. Reciprocal pairwise competitive effects between water chestnut and resident species were determined by additive reciprocal design, plants were grow in monoculture and biculture under controlled greenhouse conditions for one year. Competitive reciprocal effects between species were evident. Vallisneria americana produced 1.7 X more ramets in monoculture than in combination with Trapa spp. and tuber production was reduced by 37 % in biculture, independent of Trapa competitor. Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai fruit production was reduced by 80 % when grown in biculture with V. americana, and no fruits were produced when grown with H. verticillata. Biculture T. natans fruit production was impacted with less production observed for H. verticillata (54 %) than V. americana (25 %). Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai produced nearly 150 % more biomass in monoculture than T. natans, suggesting increased impacts in species-poor or disturbed areas. Findings suggest established monocultures of V. americana and H. verticillata may be vulnerable to invasion by either species of Trapa, but long-term competitive effects of invasion may not preclude co-existence.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are widely found in coastal areas and oceans worldwide. The MPs are environmentally concerning due to their bioavailability and potential impacts on a wide range of marine biota, so assessing their impact on the biota has become an urgent research priority. In the present study, we exposed Crassostrea gigas oysters to irregular MPs of two polymer types (polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) at concentrations of 10 and 1000 mu g L-1 for 21 days. Accumulation of MPs, changes in metabolic enzyme activity, and histological damage were evaluated, and metabolomics analysis was conducted. Results demonstrated that PE and PET MPs were detected in the gills and digestive gland following exposure to both tested concentrations, confirming ingestion of MPs by the organisms. Moreover, both PE and PET MPs inhibited lipid metabolism, while energy metabolism enzyme activities were activated in the oysters. Histopathological damage of exposed oysters was also observed in this study. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) results showed that MPs toxicity increased with increasing MPs concentration, and the toxic effects of PET MPs on oysters was greater than PE MPs. In addition, metabolomics analysis suggested that MPs exposure induced alterations in metabolic profiles in oysters, with changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. This study reports new insights into the consequences of MPs exposure in marine bivalves at environmentally relevant concentrations, providing valuable information for ecological risk assessment of MPs in a realistic conditions.

AB  - Our goal was to identify soil, plant and climate attributes that are most closely related to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield variation in Pennsylvania. We studied 22 site-years over the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in two regions. The average yields were 3.4 Mg ha(-1) in 2016 (range 1.4 to 5 Mg ha(-1))and 5.5 Mg ha(-1) in 2017 (range 3.5 to 7.4 Mg ha(-1)). Solar radiation capture and water availability, both controlled by planting date, were the main predictors of soybean yield. Principal component analysis and Random Forest analysis revealed that the soil predictors of soybean yield were the content of zinc, copper, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, as well as A horizon depth and total soil depth. The yield response to nutrients is likely a surrogate for a more complex response to animal manure additions. Soybean yield correlated positively with the ratio of soil respiration to soil organic matter, but did not correlate with the physical and biological soil metrics in the comprehensive Cornell Assessment of Soil Health (CASH). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (k(sat)) and root depth correlated with both soybean yield and each other. Thus, while planting date sets the maximum achievable yield, only soils having the most water and nutrient availability (manured soils with high k(sat)) expressed yields exceeding 7 Mg ha(-1) The k(sat) appears to be a valuable indicator of soil condition that can be relevant well beyond its association with high soybean grain yield.

AB  - Coastal dunes are rich in habitats with a high heterogeneity in species composition. Though widely recognized as very fragile and dynamic ecosystems, they are systematically overexploited. In addition, mismanagement contributes making these habitats highly endangered, especially in the Mediterranean area. In this study, an impoverished dune system was used to investigate whether the lack of indicator species, including characteristic, main diagnostic, alien and non-typical, could mislead habitat assignment. Coastal dune plant communities used in this study are embedded into a high anthropogenic pressure territory, primarily due to the vicinity to a city and by hosting bathing facilities. A cluster analysis based on 49 vegetation plots (releves) was performed in order to assign dune vegetation units to EU habitats (92/43/EEC Habitat Directive) and corresponding phytosociological units. Eight habitat types were classified and two of them were of priority importance. Twelve plant communities belonging to eight different phytosociological classes were recognized. The plant cover value of characteristic, main diagnostic, alien and non-typical plant species, was used to assess the conservation status of each habitat type. Despite the presence of well-preserved plant community, almost all habitats were in unfavourable conservation status. Furthermore, a floristic impoverishment and a zonation interruption on the stabilized dunes were found. This study underlines the difficulty to identify typical coastal dune plant communities and associated habitats when anthropogenic disturbance dramatically changes the environmental conditions. Specific conservation and management actions for the sustainable maintenance of these endangered habitats are suggested.

AB  - Peatlands provide a range of ecosystem services but are sensitive to changes in climate and land-use, and many peatlands globally are degraded. We analyse a large-scale, unique and diverse dataset, collected over 15 years, as part of major landscape scale blanket peat restoration projects in the south Pennines, UK. Trajectories of ecosystem change after restoration were assessed by measuring key ecosystem responses including: vegetation cover and indicator species; water table, runoff, and water quality.
   The reactions of these metrics vary in their behaviour, both in the timing of first response and the rate of change towards a new stable state. Re-establishment of vegetation is a key driver in rapidly reducing particulate carbon loss and attenuating stormflow, while over time biodiversity is improved by the return of native species, and water tables gradually rise. The phasing of these ecosystem service responses indicates that there are different characteristic timescales for the improvement of peatland functions, driven by both surface and subsurface processes. The rapid establishment of vegetation cover over two years, and its importance in improving a broad range of functions, signify it as a key milestone for reporting project success within typical funding timeframes. This study supports the adoption of Lime-Fertiliser-Seed-Mulch restoration on eroding blanket peatlands globally. The trajectories developed are important to help guide practitioners of ecological restoration. Better understanding of the dynamics underpinning the slower response times of subsurface hydrological and biogeochemical function is identified as a key knowledge gap. An understanding of the limits of ecosystems recovery is important when target setting for restoration projects, especially where attaining pristine conditions is unachievable. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Due to excess nutrient loading, loss of submersed macrophytes is a worldwide phenomenon in shallow lakes. Phosphorus is known to contribute significantly to macrophyte recession, but the role of nitrogen has received increasing attention. Our understanding of how high nitrogen concentrations affect the growth of submersed macrophytes, particularly under natural conditions, is still limited. In this study, we conducted experiments with canopy-forming Potamogeton crispus in 10 ponds subjected to substantial differences in nitrogen loading (five targeted total nitrogen concentrations: control, 2, 10, 20, and 100 mg L-1) and compared the results with those of our earlier published experiments with rosette-forming Vallisneria natans performed 1 year before. Canopy-forming P. crispus was more tolerant than rosette-forming V. natans to exposure to high NH4 concentrations. This is probably because canopy-forming species reach the water surface where there is sufficient light for production of carbohydrates, thereby allowing the plants to partly overcome high NH4 stress. Both the canopy-forming P. crispus and the rosette-forming V. natans showed clear declining trends with increasing chlorophyll a in the water. Accordingly, shading by phytoplankton might be of key importance for the decline in submersed macrophytes in this experiment. Both experiments revealed free amino acids (FAA) to be a useful indicator of physiological stress by high ammonium but is not a reliable indicator of macrophyte growth.

AB  - Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) are commonly used to treat municipal wastewater in Arctic Canada. The biological treatment in the WSPs is strongly influenced by climatic conditions. Currently, there is limited information about the removal of fecal and pathogenic bacteria during the short cool summer treatment season. With relevance to public health, the objectives of this paper were to determine if treatment in arctic WSPs resulted in the disinfection (i.e., removal of fecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli) and removal of selected human bacterial pathogens from the treated effluent. The treatment performance, with focus on microbial removal, was assessed for the one-cell WSP in Pond Inlet (Nunavut [NU]) and two-cell WSP in Clyde River (NU) over three consecutive (2012-2014) summer treatment seasons (late June-early September). The WSPs provided a primary disinfection treatment of the wastewater with a 2-3Log removal of generic indicator E. coli. The bacterial pathogens Salmonella spp., pathogenic E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes, but not Campylobacter spp. and Helicobacter pylori, were detected in the untreated and treated wastewater, indicating that human pathogens were not reliably removed. Seasonal and annual variations in temperature significantly (p<0.05) affected the disinfection efficiency. Improved disinfection and pathogen removal was observed for the two-cell system in Clyde River as compared to the one-cell system in Pond Inlet. A quantitative microbial risk assessment should be performed to determine if the release of low levels of human pathogens into the arctic environment poses a human health risk.

AB  - The seagrass Thalassia testudinum harbors a high specific richness of epiphytic algae due to its morphology and abundance on the coast of the Mexican Atlantic. Epiphytic algae are an important component because of its taxonomic composition and functional groups; additionally, they can be employed as bioindicators. The composition of epiphytic algae of a common forophyte was compared in two ecoregions: Santa Rosa, Quintana Roo with oligotrophic waters and Penacho del Indio, Veracruz with eutrophic waters. Larger coverage of foliate and filamentous algae was expected in the Penacho del Indio prairie due to its eutrophic nature. Seventy seven species of epiphytes were determined, 43 in Penacho del Indio and 46 in Santa Rosa. Overall, 17 species belonged to Cyanobacteria, 38 to Rhodophyta, 11 to Phaeophyceae and 11 to Chlorophyta. Chondria pygmaea, Myrionema magnusii, Hecatonema floridanum, Rosenvingea sanctae-crucis and 7 cyanobacteria represent new registers for the Atlantic coast of Mexico. Centroceras hyalacanthum and Myrionema strangulans are new records for Veracruz. The functional groups were represented by: 39 filamentous algae, 20 microalgae, 9 corticated macrophytes, 5 foliose algae, 3 crustose and one calcareous articulated macrophyte. Red algae displayed the highest specific richness at both sites, followed by green algae in Penacho del Indio and microalgae in Santa Rosa. Epiphytism of foliate, filamentous, as well as corticated macrophytes, had larger coverage and biomass in Penacho del Indio. The prominent development of Ulva at this locality supports its eutrophic condition, whereas epiphytes composition in Santa Rosa suggests the existence of oligotrophic waters.

AB  - Increasing inputs of colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM), which is mainly composed of humic substances (HS), are a widespread phenomenon of environmental change in aquatic ecosystems. This process of brownification alters the chemical conditions of the environment, but knowledge is lacking of whether elevated cDOM and HS levels interfere with the ability of prey species to evade chemical predator cues and thus affect predator-prey interactions. We assessed the effects of acute and prolonged exposure to HS at increasing concentrations on the ability of freshwater zooplankton to avoid predator threat (imposed by fish kairomones) in laboratory trials with two calanoid copepods (Eudiaptomus gracilis and Heterocope appendiculata). Populations of both species clearly avoided water containing fish kairomones. However, the avoidance behavior weakened with increasing HS concentration, suggesting that HS affected the ability of copepods to perceive or respond to the predator cue. The behavioral responses of the two copepod populations to increasing HS concentrations differed, with H. appendiculata being more sensitive than E. gracilis in an acute exposure scenario, whereas E. gracilis responded more strongly after prolonged exposure. Both showed similar physiological impairment after prolonged exposure, as revealed by their oxidative balance as a stress indicator, but mortality increased more strongly for H. appendiculata when the HS concentration increased. These results indicate that reduced predator threat evasion in the presence of cDOM could make copepods more susceptible to predation in future, with variation in the strength of responses among populations leading to changes in zooplankton communities and lake food-web structure.

AB  - The role of beta-diversity of plant communities as a factor in its phytoindication significance has been revealed. We studied the continuously flooded semi-light elm-oakery with blackberry De'' 2-3 in the river Dnipro floodplain within the nature reserve of "Dnipro-Orelsky". Plant community relates to suballiance Ulmenion minoris Oberdorfer 1953 union Alnion incanae Pawlowski 1928 Null-order alfa diversity is 8.74 (95% confidence interval 8,62-8,91). Null-order beta-diversity is at the level of 6,86 (6,44-7,17), and gamma diversity is at the level of 60 (56,01-63,01). Environmental factors identified using phytoindication approach have been found to be correlated with each other, resulting in the formation of their regular complexes. The complex nature of the aggregate environmental factors that describes a multidimensional factor-1, can be identified as the result of forest pertinentia (according Visotsky). Less important multidimensional factors in their mathematical properties are close to ordinary phytoindicator factors. Structuring of beta-diversity indicates that the plant species differ in their informational value to indicate a variety of environmental factors. Established plants clusters represent a plurality of kinds, characterized by the highest information value to indicate certain factors. Indicator ability of the vegetation to display the action of environmental factors spatially heterogeneous. In condition when the neutral or random factors prevail over phytoindicator useful information, there is disinformation on the relevant factors. The disinformation zones established for all multi-dimensional factors and they have a specific spatial location.

AB  - The global methane ( CH4) emission of lakes is estimated at between 6 and 16 % of total natural CH4 emissions. However, these values have a high uncertainty due to the wide variety of lakes with important differences in their morphological, biological, and physicochemical parameters and the relatively scarse data from southern mid-latitude lakes. For these reasons, we studied CH4 fluxes and CH4 dissolved in water in a typical shallow lake in the Pampean Wetland, Argentina, during four periods of consecutive years ( April 2011-March 2015) preceded by different rainfall conditions. Other water physicochemical parameters were measured and meteorological data were reported. We identified three different states of the lake throughout the study as the result of the irregular alternation between high and low rainfall periods, with similar water temperature values but with important variations in dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, water turbidity, electric conductivity, and water level. As a consequence, marked seasonal and interannual variations occurred in CH4 dissolved in water and CH4 fluxes from the lake. These temporal variations were best reflected by water temperature and depth of the Secchi disk, as a water turbidity estimation, which had a significant double correlation with CH4 dissolved in water. The mean CH4 fluxes values were 0.22 and 4.09 mg/m(2)/h for periods with low and high water turbidity, respectively. This work suggests that water temperature and turbidity measurements could serve as indicator parameters of the state of the lake and, therefore, of its behavior as either a CH4 source or sink.

AB  - Antibacterial residues in the natural environment have been of increasing concern due to their impact on bacteria resistance development and toxicity to natural communities and ultimately to public health. China is a large country with high production and consumption of antibacterials for its population growth and economic development in recent years. In this article, we summarized the current situation of human-use antibacterial pollution in Chinese water (wastewaters, natural and drinking waters) and solid matrices (sludge, sediment, and soil) reported in 33 peer-reviewed papers. We found that, although there are adequate wastewater treatment systems in China, human-use antibacterial residues in the natural environment were reported almost throughout the whole country. Three most frequently prescribed classes of antibacterials in China, including quinolones, macrolides, and beta-lactam, were also the predominant classes of residues in Chinese environment, manifested as the high concentration and detection frequency. In view of this alarming situation, we have presented that ecopharmacovigilance (EPV) might be implemented in the antibacterial drug administration of China, as the active participation of the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory authorities from the diffuse source of antibacterial pollution. Considering EPV experience of developed countries together with the actual conditions of China, we have identified some approaches that can be taken, including:
   . Focus on education;
   . Further strengthening and persevering the antibacterial stewardship strategies and pharmaceutical take-back programs in China;
   . Designing greener antibacterials with better degradability in the environment;
   . Implementing environmental risk assessment prior to launch of new drugs;
   . Strengthening collaboration in EPV-related areas.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) content is considered as an important indicator of soil quality. An accurate spatial prediction of SOM content is so important for estimating soil organic carbon pool and monitoring change in it over time at a regional scale. Due to the unfavourable natural conditions in Tibetan Plateau, soil sampling with high density is time consuming and expensive. As a result, little research has focused on the spatial prediction of SOM content in Tibet because of shortage of data. We used a two-stage process that integrated an artificial neural network (ANN) and the estimation of its residuals by ordinary kriging to produce accurate SOM content maps based on sparsely distributed observations and available auxiliary information. SOM content data were obtained from a soil survey in Tibet and were used to train and validate the ANN-kriging methodology. Available environmental information including elevation, temperature, precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index were used as auxiliary variables in the ANN training. The prediction accuracy of SOM content was compared with those of ANN, universal kriging, and inverse distance weighting (IDW). A more accurate prediction of SOM content was obtained by ANN-kriging, with lower global prediction errors (root mean square error = 6.02 g kg(-1)) and higher Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (0.75) for validation sampling sites compared with other methods. Relative improvements of 26.94-37.10% over other methods were observed in the prediction of SUM content. In conclusion, the proposed ANN-kriging methodology is particularly capable of improving the accuracy of SOM content mapping at large scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent decades, eutrophication has been identified as a major problem in coastal and estuarine systems. Eutrophication can be due to cultural activities but can also be due to natural factors. This study explores the possible role of geomorphic change in the eutrophication history of Juag Lagoon, which is one of the sites with harmful algal blooms in the Philippines. Surface and sediment cores were acquired for this study to trace the paleoenvironmental changes that brought about the present day lagoon. Radiocarbon dates and Pb-210-based estimates of sedimentation rates provided age control. Sedimentological indicators and stable isotope signatures of organic matter were utilized to assess changes in the source of organic matter deposited in the lagoon whereas XRF-derived bulk sediment geochemistry was used as proxy for sediment input. Three phases of geomorphic state were identified over the lagoon history. Prior to 700 A.D., bulk geochemistry and isotopic measurements indicate a pre-lagoon environment. Subsequent drop in sea level led to the development of the lagoon, which persisted until 1100 A.D. The lagoonal condition transitioned to increased marine influence towards 1200 A.D., through several sandbar-breaching events that may have persisted in recent years. The present day lagoon maintains a continuous water exchange through a small tidal channel. The closing of the lagoon and the limited flushing of lagoon waters could have led to the nutrification of the lagoon. Moreover, anthropogenic impact through forest denudation, mariculture and fertilizer use in the neighboring islands is reflected, which could have also affected the nutrification of the lagoon in the last 100 years.

AB  - One of the more effective ways of managing high densities of adult mosquitoes that vector human and animal pathogens is ultra-low-volume (ULV) aerosol applications of insecticides. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses models that are not validated for ULV insecticide applications and exposure assumptions to perform their human and ecological risk assessments. Currently, there is no validated model that can accurately predict deposition of insecticides applied using ULV technology for adult mosquito management. In addition, little is known about the deposition and drift of small droplets like those used under conditions encountered during ULV applications. The objective of this study was to perform field studies to measure environmental concentrations of insecticides and to develop a validated model to predict the deposition of ULV insecticides. The final regression model was selected by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion and its prediction performance was evaluated using k-fold cross validation. Density of the formulation and the density and CMD interaction coefficients were the largest in the model. The results showed that as density of the formulation decreases, deposition increases. The interaction of density and CMD showed that higher density formulations and larger droplets resulted in greater deposition. These results are supported by the aerosol physics literature. A k-fold cross validation demonstrated that the mean square error of the selected regression model is not biased, and the mean square error and mean square prediction error indicated good predictive ability.

AB  - The Catalan Sea, located between the eastern Iberian coast and the Balearic Islands, is a representative portion of the western Mediterranean basin and provides a valuable case study for climate change effects on Mediterranean ecosystems. Global warming is reflected regionally by a rise in sea level over the last century, an increase in surface temperature of around 1.1 degrees C in the last 35 yr, a progressive salinisation of intermediate and deep waters and a strengthening of the stratification. A likely scenario of what we can expect in the Mediterranean Sea is a considerable decrease in rainfall and wind, warmer surface waters and a prolonged stratification period. The effects on Mediterranean ecosystems are evident in: (1) a meridionalisation of the algal, invertebrate and vertebrate species, which favours the more thermophilic species over the temperate species; (2) mass mortality events of sessile invertebrates of the coralligenous communities owing to anomalous warm waters during the period when food is scarce; (3) increases in the smallest phytoplankton due to the prolongation of the water stratification period; (4) proliferation of gelatinous carnivores, including jellyfish, due to the temperature rise and the lack of rainfall; (5) a faster acidification of seawater, compared with the global oceans, accompanied by a decrease in the capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2. In order to anticipate and mitigate these predicted changes, we recommend investing in research and observation, conserving areas that serve as indicators of climate change and reducing other anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, overfishing or pollution, which may act synergistically to accelerate these changes.

AB  - We investigated the response of ant species to landscape and geomorphologic parameters of a long-term (7-11 years) restoration project in the Jequitinhonha River (Northern State of Minas Gerais, Brazil) margins, previously dredged by a diamond mining company. Geomorphological changes from the dredging were severe and the area is unlikely to be adequately restored, mainly due to the negative effects of flooding. Our hypothesis is that ant species assemblages bioindicate successional stages and soil characteristics. We studied the association of effects from the river's flooding zone, the native vegetation, and sedimentary grain size with that of ant species diversity, abundance, and composition. An ant sampling program was conducted in April 2005, using three methods: baits, pitfall traps, and direct collection. Grain size was measured by sieving. In total, 10,784 ants were sampled, belonging to 7 subfamilies, 24 genera and 45 morphospecies. Ant species richness was greater in the undisturbed savanna area than in the restored habitats, and equivalently greater in the ecotone and intermediate zone habitats than on the river bank, the poorest habitat. Atta sexdens rubropilosa indicated a condition related to small forest remnants having well-structured soil. On the other hand, ants with a body length of under 0.5 cm (Dorymyrmex pyramicus and Pheidole fallax) predominated in sandy areas, where the majority of the granules were the finest. The lack of organic matter and soil structure for constructing suitable nests may prevent large ants from colonizing such areas, and thus inhibit the advance of natural succession.

AB  - In the Bolivian Altiplano, indigenous systems for dealing with weather and climate risk are failing or being lost as a result of migration, climate change, and market integration. Andean rural communities are particularly vulnerable to changing social and environmental conditions. Changing climate over the past forty years and current forecast models point to increasing temperatures and later onset of rains during the growing season. Current meteorological models are coarse grained and not well suited to the complex topology of the Andes-so local-scale information is required for decisions. This article outlines a process for developing new local knowledge that can be used to enhance adaptive processes. This is a three-step process that includes assessment of local knowledge, the development of future scenarios, and the use of participatory research methods to identify alternative adaptation strategies. Initial analyses based on the survey of 330 households in nine communities indicate that northern Alitplano communities are more vulnerable than central Altiplano ones. In both areas, losses from climate shocks are high, but the types of hazards vary by location. The use of local knowledge indicators of climate is declining, and downscaling of climate forecasts is unlikely to occur due to the lack of data points and the large number of microclimates. Participatory mapping and research, where knowledge is shared, are processes that enhance adaptive capacity and are critical to building resilience. This article outlines a strategy for linking science-based and indigenous methods to develop early warning systems that are an important part of coping strategies. This approach combines science and indigenous knowledge to enhance adaptive capacity.

AB  - The unique nature of the Starunia palaeontological site, where near-perfectly preserved large mammals were discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, and incomplete knowledge on the development of palaeoenvironment in the Velyky Lukavets River valley in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene were the reasons for undertaking new comprehensive palaeobotanical and malacological studies. Starunia is also one of the sites bearing Pleistocene fossil flora, rare in this part of Europe. The results of plant macrofossil analysis show that in the Weichselian Middle Pleniglacial the landscape was dominated by steppe and tundra plant communities, being represented mostly by various grass and sedge species. Areas of higher humidity were covered with shrub tundra with Betula nana. The temperature requirements of taxa which are cool climate indicators show that the minimum July temperature amounted to at least 10 degrees C. The record of Late Weichselian malacofauna confirms the dominance of all open landscape, mostly with steppe and steppe-tundra communities, as well as the presence of a dry, continental climate. At the beginning of the Holocene, an improvement of climatic and humidity conditions led to a fast local expansion of plant communities of the low and transition peat bog type, in the surroundings of shallow, periodically drying-up water pools. From the Middle Pleniglacial Lip to the present day, the area has been characterized by the presence of species tolerating an increased amount of salt in the environment. Their presence should be associated with natural brine effluences derived from Miocene strata in the bedrock.

AB  - To resolve conflicting field observations regarding the action of sexual selection, we used breeding experiments and paternity analysis of the 927 resulting offspring to assess how male size, condition, tail length, genetic similarity to the female, and variation in operational sex ratio (OSR) affected male reproductive success and the incidence of polyandry in northern watersnakes (Nerodia sipedon). Only size affected male mating success. Large males were more successful, but only when male size varied substantially and competition among males was intense (i.e., male-biased OSR). The conditional nature of the size advantage may explain why studies of free-living watersnakes have produced inconsistent results regarding the relationship between male size and mating success. Size differences between males did not affect the proportion of offspring each male sired within multiply sired litters. We found positive size-assortative mating, but only when the OSR was female biased, suggesting that smaller males had improved access to females when competition among males was reduced, but that competition with larger males still restricted mating opportunities of small males to less preferred, smaller females. Most litters (58%) were multiply sired and larger females were more likely to produce multiply sired litters, similar to free-living watersnakes. There was no association between the incidence of multiple paternity and OSR, however, suggesting that polyandry is not simply a function of opportunity, with females passively waiting for males to court them.

AB  - Tropical biodiversity researchers are working in ecological, social, and economic contexts that are completely different from those of 150 years ago. In the 1800s, scientists from developed nations studied tropical biodiversity as part of expeditionary work. The social and economic benefits from these studies went to citizens of the developed nations that funded the research. Benefits accrued to foreigners rather than the native inhabitants of tropical nations explored by natural historians. Today, the governments and citizens of tropical nations view biodiversity components as natural resources that can contribute to national cultural, social, and economic development. Modern biodiversity researchers therefore find themselves working under socio-economic conditions that are radically different from those experienced by Darwin, Wallace, Humboldt, Bates and their contemporaries. In the last quarter of a century, biodiversity researchers from developed nations have struggled to meet the changing focus for their research and have substantially modified research processes to meet some of the needs and directions of developing nations. In this essay, we discuss how developed nation biodiversity researchers are changing their approach to working in tropical countries. We illustrate this change by examining how researchers from developed country work in developing countries. We examine potential reasons for conflict between developed nation biodiversity researchers and citizens of developing nations, and suggest potential solutions to these conflicts. In particular, we suggest that developed nation biodiversity researchers continue to place a strong emphasis on outputs that benefit the countries in which they work. We also suggest that biodiversity researchers should seek input from representatives of developing nations in planning projects so that research efforts can meet the needs of the host-country. We use experiences in Guyana, South America, to illustrate collaborative approaches to biodiversity research.

AB  - Munitions manufacturing, disposal, testing, training and other operations at military sites have produced elevated levels of explosives and related materials in soil. Insufficient data were available on the toxicity of the explosives, RDX and HMX to soil invertebrates, necessitating toxicity testing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in conjunction with stakeholders, is developing Ecological Soil Screening Level (Eco-SSL) benchmarks for ecological risk assessment (ERA) of contaminants at Superfund sites to identify those contaminants in soil that warrant additional evaluation in a baseline ERA, and to eliminate those that do not. Eco-SSLs are developed from literature values whenever sufficient quantity and quality of data exist.Tests were conducted under conditions preferred for Eco-SSL benchmarks, using a sandy loam soil that supports relatively high bioavailability of test compounds. Earthworm (Eisenia fetida) toxicity was assessed using a standardized earthworm reproduction test in freshly amended soil and weathered/aged amended soil. RDX or HMX had no effect on adult survival. Cocoon production EC20 values for RDX were 1.2 and 19 mg kg(-1) in freshly amended and weathered/aged soils, respectively. Juvenile production EC20 values were 1.6 and 4.8 mg kg(-1) in freshly amended and,weathered/aged soils, respectively. Cocoon production and juvenile production EC20 values for HMX were 2.7 and 0.4 mg kg(-1) in freshly amended soil. Both cocoon production and juvenile production in weathered/aged HMX treated soils were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from control soils. Results of these toxicity studies will be submitted to the Eco-SSL Task Group and will be included in the Eco-SSL database for Eco-SSL derivation.

AB  - In 1988 a long-term study was started of the isopod fauna associated with surface drift material off Helgoland (German Eight, North Sea). In the summer of 1994 specimens of Idotea metallica Bose were recorded for the first time. There is no evidence that this species has ever been present in the German Eight before. The samples contained males, both gravid and non-gravid females, and juveniles, indicating that the species reproduced successfully in the Helgoland region. Interbreeding of specimens from Helgoland and the western Mediterranean produced fertile offspring. As a neustonic species, I. metallica shows a high natural capacity for dispersal. It thus seems unlikely that the arrival of the species in the North Sea resulted from an accidental introduction by man. We are probably witnessing an extension of the species' geographical range by natural means of dispersal, as a response to recent changes in the ecological conditions of the German Eight. Temperature data measured by the Biologische Anstalt Helgoland since 1962 show that the last decade (except 1996) was characterized by unusually mild winters. Following the severe winter of 1996, I. metallica was again absent from the Helgoland region. After the subsequent mild winters (1997 and 1998), however, the species reappeared in the summer of 1998 with higher numbers than ever before. This suggests that the observed phenomena are closely connected with the recent temperature anomalies. I. metallica can be regarded as a potential immigrant to a warmer North Sea, and may be useful as a sensitive indicator of the predicted long-term warming trend.

AB  - Five bacterial strains (Chryseomonas luteola, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella oxytoca and and unidentified Gram-negative rod) were grown on raw baker's yeast effluent to assess the influence of environmental factors on biodegradation processes. A 3x4x3 factorial design was used to determine the effects of time, pH and COD concentration, at four different temperatures. Total volatile fatty acid production was chosen as the most representative indicator of biodegradation. Results showed that the strains differed greatly in their ability to produce anaerobic digester intermediary metabolites, under defined environmental conditions. The study showed that the degradation of the complex compounds in baker's yeast effluent could be enhanced by changing environmental factors. The most positive responses were obtained at the higher COD concentrations (30 g l(-1)), the higher pH values (6.0), and after 24 to 48h incubation time and at the higher temperatures (35 degrees C). The most positive effect (+355.00) was found for Chryseomonas luteola at a 48h incubation time, COD concentration of 30 g l(-1), pH of 6.0 and temperature of 35 degrees C. The volatile fatty acid yields obtained by the strains differ from the statistical indications, but provide a valuable reference of the actual concentrations obtained by the experimental study. The factorial design represented the effects of environmental changes, while the quantitative TVFA data set gave experimental data. This study showed that the manipulation of various environmental factors in biologically controlled systems, such as anaerobic digesters, could further enhance the biodegradation efficiency of the microbial population in the raw effluent.

AB  - Membrane electrodes are relatively simple electrochemical devices that can be used for the direct measurement of ions, gases, and biomolecules in complex samples. Selectivity for one species over another is determined by the nature and chemical composition of the membranes and associated reaction layers used to fabricate the devices. All membrane electrode probes employ at least one ion-selective membrane as the ultimate transduction element. This indicator membrane serves as an additional component of a classic two-electrode galvanic cell. The potential developed at the membrane/sample interface is directly or indirectly related to the activity or concentration of analyte in the sample. Because cell potentials are detected under essentially zero-current conditions, analytical measurements with these probes are generally not subject to the mass transfer and electron transfer kinetic limitations that often plague voltammetric or amperometric techniques.
   In this report, we review the current state of the art with respect to development and application of potentiometric membrane electrode probes. As a starting point, we provide a brief introduction to the fundamentals of membrane-based galvanic cell potentials and their measurement. Subsequent sections summarize the various membranes now in use for direct ion sensing, the approaches taken to miniaturize these same ion-selective systems, and the use of such membranes in conjunction with secondary membranes to devise a variety of potentiometric gas sensing systems. Finally, we conclude with an overview of the approaches being employed presently to devise potentiometric bioprobes suitable for the selective, in situ detection of biologically important molecules.

AB  - The deteriorating conditions in stream ecosystems are detrimental for society as far as its health, and development is concerned if the underlying factors continue to operate without regular monitoring. In order to maintain the health of a stream ecosystem, assessment of spatiotemporal changes in its physicochemical attributes and identification of all factors that could alter its hydrological regime is an essential component for managing it. The current 2-year study (October-2017 to September-2019) assessed the physicochemical regime of lower stretches of the Vishav stream, a major left-bank tributary of river Jhelum on a spatiotemporal basis. The physicochemical data was analyzed through linear regression, ANOVA (followed by Duncan's test), multivariate statistical analysis, viz., principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Linear regression pointed out the nature and magnitude of the relationship between different physicochemical variables (p < 0.05). PCA showed that WT, pH, EC, NO3-N, TDS, TH, and DO are the major factors reflecting the water quality of the Vishav stream. The range in water quality parameters of the Vishav stream was found conducive for the inhabitant fishes. Two well-defined clusters were obtained, wherein Cluster-I comprising of Site-III (a downstream pollution prone site) and Cluster-II comprising of Site-II and Site-I (mid- and upstream site respectively) are less prone to human interferences. The present study could serve as baseline information to manage and conserve this precious element of the aquatic ecosphere in terms of better water quality for humans and its inhabitant faunal elements especially fish which play a significant role in the economy of that region.

AB  - Pocket beaches are a large part of the Greek coastline, with strong touristic, economic and natural interest. Their morphological characteristics and wave forcing are the main factors influencing their evolution, while the most commonly observed dynamic is beach rotation due to prevailing wave direction. Human activities and climate change call for a better management for these areas, necessitating, therefore, the identification of coastal geomorphodynamic processes. This paper focuses on the geomorphological and sedimentological dynamic processes of Platis Gialos Bay (Sifnos), which have given rise to the present setting. Beach orientation, slope, length, geology, Posidonia Oceanica, degree of embayment, sedimentology and closure are some parameters that must be considered to calculate the morphodynamic and stability indicators that prevail at the beach. Wave exposure forcing conditions, longshore - rip current direction, are also hydrodynamic processes to be determined, as they play a significant role in sediment transport. A number of methodologies took place in order to determine the level of disturbance of this dynamic equilibrium, which included morphological mapping, sedimentary classification, shoreline displacement/evolution monitoring, hydrodynamic and sedimentary modelling. The exposure of the coast to the southern waves, the reduced sediment supply from the local fluvial network, human activities and the construction of the fishing shelter have led the area to a continuous erosion and coastline retreat in its western and central part, in contrast to the eastern part, where there is a continuous deposition reflected by coastal accretion and the formation of a shallow environment.

AB  - Mangrove forests are extremely productive ecosystems, are sources and sinks of organic carbon, and provide essential services both to the marine environment and people. We have studied the composition and species richness of modern benthic foraminiferal assemblages from mangrove swamps along the Mamanguape River in Paraiba, northern Brazil. Sampling points for foraminifera were selected to acquire information on the composition of foraminiferal assemblages from dense mangrove stands collected along a river transect. Almost 100 species of benthic foraminifera were identified within the shallow mangrove habitats. The large number of identified mangrove taxa is the highest recorded so far for true mangrove habitats. The high species richness rivals shallow-water assemblages recorded from nearby offshore and reef environments and indicates that a particularly large number of species is capable of growing and flourishing under multiple stressor conditions. Numerical analysis of the faunal assemblages shows that specific taxa, which were previously known to be uncommon in mangrove environments, are abundant in the Mamanguape River estuary. The atypical foraminiferal fauna found in the Mamanguape River estuary resembles shallowwater offshore assemblages, is characterized by high percent abundances of perforate and miliolid taxa, and contains only very few of the otherwise typical and numerically abundant agglutinated mangrove taxa. The unusual structure of the assemblages recorded provides insight into what combination of environmental variables controls their composition and novel perspectives to reconstruct past mangrove environments. Distribution, diversity, and species-specific analysis will provide guidance on the use of Brazilian mangrove foraminifera as indicators for the strength of tidal activity, pollution, and anoxia in coastal waters and sea-level reconstructions.

AB  - Urban green areas (UGA) in arid regions potentially offer ecosystem services such as the regulation of biogeochemical cycles (water and carbon), which can help make efficient use of water and mitigate climate change in these areas. However, the type of vegetation (native or exotic) in a given area can directly influence the ability of UGAs to provide these services. Arid zones are characterized by water scarcity, so making efficient use of water in UGAs is relevant, especially in a climate change scenario. In order to understand the influence of xerophilous native and exotic vegetation on the hydrological and carbon cycles of UGAs in arid zones, we used two approaches: field observations in UGAs and greenhouse experimentation to simulate drought in mesocosms with the native and exotic vegetation of arid zones. We determine plant water use to maintain the aesthetical appearance (amount of irrigation, evapotranspiration rate, and water efficiency), for climate regulation influence, measure the carbon released to the atmosphere (soil respiration: RS), and the soil carbon storage as an indicator of support service. The results show that in arid zones, the UGAs with xerophilous native vegetation use water more efficiently and their soil carbon release is lower, even in periods of drought, mainly due to their adaptation to climate conditions. The results of this study can be used by decision-makers who should encourage the use of native species in the UGAs in arid zones since they offer more environmental services than exotic species do.

AB  - Remanufacturing has been regarded as an environmentally friendly way to dispose of End-of-Life (EOL) products to like-new condition, which can effectively save resources, energy and greatly prolong the service life of products. After entering the remanufacturing system, EOL products are disassembled into individual parts that may have different failure types and degrees, thus not all of them are suitable for remanufacturing. Remanufacturability needs to be conducted to determine the feasibility of remanufacturing. Due to the products' structural complexity and customer demand uncertainty, many factors need to be considered when evaluating the remanufacturing feasibility of waste products. In this article, we take three pillars of sustainable development as decision factors and make a comprehensive literature review on the technical performance indicator (TPI), economic cost indicator (ECI) and environmental benefits indicator (EBI) of remanufacturability to emphasize the importance of remanufacturability. The purpose of this literature review is to conduct critical review on the current literature and establish a contemporary understanding of the status of remanufacturability study by assessing the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods in this field. The research results demonstrated that there was relatively a lack of research on technical feasibility assessment, more on economic and environmental assessments. Most of remanufacturability assessment approaches are comprehensive, considering multiple factors. This article summarizes the limitations of previous evaluation methods, proposes the challenges and future development trends. It is concluded that design for remanufacturing, finding it will be one of the hot topics in the future remanufacturing research, which will provide valuable insights for academia and industry.

AB  - Soil microbial and enzymatic activities are sensitive to environmental change. To assess variations in soil properties, six prominent rainfed land-use systems were undertaken in Shiwalik foothills of Punjab, India. In soil samples (0-0.15 m), pH, EC, SOC, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, DTPA-Zn, DTPA-Fe, DTPA-Mn and DTPA-Cu varied from 7.3-7.9, 0.31-0.61 ds m(-1), 0.20-0.63%, 110-381 kg ha(-1), 29.8-32.6 kg ha(-1), 99-196 kg ha(-1), 9.5-15.1 mg kg(-1), 9.0-25.2 mg kg(-1), 0.31-1.02 mg kg(-1) and 0.71-0.96 mg kg(-1), respectively. In soil biochemical properties, dehydrogenase activity varied from 5.4-10.9 mu g TPF g(-1) h(-1), acid and alkaline phosphatase from 17.0-36.5 mu g pNP g(-1) h(-1) and 36.3-61.3 mu g pNP g(-1) h(-1), urease from 4.05 to 4.80 mu g NH4-N g(-1) soil min(-1), basal soil respiration from 0.13-0.27 mu g CO2 g(-1) soil h(-1), MBC from 34.9 to 184.5 mu g g(-1) soil, total and easily extractable glomalin from 4.19 to 8.80 g kg(-1) and 1.70 to 8.32 g kg(-1), respectively. PCA identified SOC, EC, total extractable glomalin, DTPA-Zn and available potassium as most sensitive and reliable indicators for soil quality. Agri-horticulture and forestry system are considered as sustainable ecosystem in Shiwalik foothills of Punjab.

AB  - Thermal indices based on canopy temperature (T-c) measurements have been widely used to monitor plant water stress. Such applications have mainly been on homogeneous agriculture crops. Few studies with continuous observations have been conducted on plants in natural ecosystems. Here we examine if the commonly used crop water stress index (CWSI) applies for vegetation in non-managed ecosystems. Two types of parameterization, determined empirically from vapour pressure deficit (CWSI_e) and theoretically from Penman-Monteith equation (CWSI_t), are evaluated on the potential of indicating plant water stress based on T-c and concurrent air temperature (T-a) measurements on three sites under a Mediterranean climate. Results show that although requiring more weather data inputs, CWSI_t does not perform better than CWSI_e, which only requires T-c, T-a and vapor pressure deficit. Weather conditions of wind speed less than 3.0 m s(-1) and solar radiation over 600 W m(-2) are recommended for T-c for the index calculations. Midday is the optimal time for T-c measurements to estimate water stress for most of the trees. An exponential relationship is found between CWSI_e and soil water content (theta), and a linear relationship exists between CWSI_e and soil water potential (psi). Values of theta and psi inverted from CWSI_e agree well with the observations (R-2 is about 0.7), indicating that with appropriate measurements of T-c, CWSI_e provides a reliable and non-contact manner for assessing plant water stress in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Little attention has been given to the nature and sources of airborne dust affecting northeastern Iran. The objectives of this study were to examine the concentrations of selected potentially toxic elements (i.e., Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), distinguish geogenic from anthropogenic sources, and assess the pollution intensity. A total of 600 samples were collected at 50 locations 12 times between May 2014 and April 2015 for fallout rate; 250 of these samples were selected for geochemical analysis. Mean dust concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn were found to be higher in autumn compared to spring as well as higher in the most populous cities. Results suggested that Ni, Cr, Mn, and Fe have come from mainly natural geologic sources, while concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in the dust were associated with anthropogenic sources. Enrichment factors showed minimal to significant enrichment for Cu and Pb and moderate to very high enrichment for Cr, Ni, and Zn. The mean geo-accumulation index revealed that the contamination levels for Cu, Pb, and Zn peaked during autumn. In addition to industrial and traffic sources, seasonal differences in meteorological conditions can create frequent and persistent thermal inversions that at ground level can result in increases in Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations during autumn. Because of the diversity of geology and terrain in combination with significant seasonal shifts in winds over this region, this study highlights the need to consider both geogenic and anthropogenic sources in evaluating pollution risks in northeastern Iran.

AB  - Water quality in Galapagos has been deteriorating by increased human impacts over the past few decades. Water quality is a key environmental component and issue in need to be evaluated in the Pelican Bay Watershed, the biggest urban and economic development of Santa Cruz Island, for better management and regulation of water resources. This study assesses coastal and ground water bodies of Pelican Bay by employing a 9-year dataset obtained during a local water quality monitoring program conducted by the Galapagos National Park. Physical-chemical and microbial parameters were evaluated with respect to national and international water quality standards. A statistical integrated approach was performed to calculate environmental background levels of water quality parameters and to explore their seasonal and spatial variation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of changes in tourism and residents in San Cruz Island in the degradation of water sources. Results highlighted are: (a) water is not suitable for drinking and domestic use at some inland sites; (b) saline water is used for irrigation in the highlands; (c) the presence of parameters of concern at coastal sites represent a risk for human and ecosystem health; (d) background levels may serve for defining site-specific limits to control water quality, and; (e) the influence of population change on water quality conditions varied at each site with a higher effect at coastal sites relatively to inland sites. This study provided valuable information of the water quality status in Santa Cruz Island and can serve as a baseline for effective water management and control of pollution.

AB  - The introduction of species to multiple continents creates natural experiments suited to the evaluation of ecological hypotheses. For the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH), which postulates that the success of invasive populations hinges upon release from the effects of their natural enemies, assessments of parasite loss during invasion across independent geographical replicates are scarce. This study is the first to test the ERH for a globally invasive amphibian, Xenopus laevis, a successful invader on four continents with a well-described parasite fauna. In this study, the metazoan parasite communities of X.laevis from 20 invasive and 27 native sites in five countries and three continents were compared. An overall pattern of reduced parasite diversity in invasive X. laevis was not yet countered by acquisition of novel parasites. Invasive X. laevis harboured impoverished parasite communities that were distinct from those of native X. laevis from undisturbed habitats. Conversely, parasite communities from native X. laevis from disturbed habitats were similar to those from the invasive range. Accompanying parasites were common in the native range and included both generalists with indirect and specialists with direct life cycles. Our findings emphasise that parasite loss is characteristic of the invasion process of X. laevis and possibly contributes to its success as a global invader. The ERH is supported in terms of metazoan parasites as natural enemies, irrespective of the geographical origin, climatic conditions and invasion history of the host populations. This study also draws attention to parasites that co-invade with their hosts as invaders in their own right.

AB  - With continuing of urbanization, improving of life quality as well as combating against air pollution, China is facing comprehensive challenges to supply modem clean heating to a majority of its citizens. For space heating solutions, currently in urban areas of north China, coal based district heating is prevalent. In urban areas of south China, distributed heating solutions are used. In rural areas, de-centralized coal stoves and biomass stoves are still commonly used. As renewable building heating solution, ground source heat pumps are installed for large scale applications. Building floor areas heated by ground source heat pumps increased tremendously during past ten years. Air source heat pump is being promoted in north Chinese rural areas as part of coal to clean heating project. Solar water heater and electric water heater for domestic hot water supply is widely used in north China and gas water boiler is widely used in south China. A series of policies have encouraged clean fossil fuel district heating in north China. National development plans are also supporting and subsidizing renewable heating technology such as heat pumps. Different building heating technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The choice of building heating solutions for different geolocations of China is strongly affected by spatial parameters such as local climate condition, population distribution, natural resource availability etc. Therefore, a spatial data analysis method is essential to help stakeholders decide proper building heating solutions in different parts of China by key performance indicators reflecting lower primary energy use, economic affordability and lower environmental impact.

AB  - Cover crops could provide many interesting environmental services for vineyards, but French Mediterranean winegrowers mostly avoid permanent cover cropping because they fear too much competition and consequently a reduction in grapevine yield. To better understand the effect of cover cropping management on vine growth and yield, we carried out our study in a vineyard of Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) in the Mediterranean region of France over three consecutive years. Three cover crop strategies were monitored (30CC, 60CC and 100CC corresponding respectively to 30%, 60% and 100% of cover crop soil coverage) on two types of soils (shallow and deep), and compared with bare soil (0CC corresponding to 0% cover crop, controlled with chemical weeding). Grapevine growth, yield and soil moisture were measured and the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) was simulated using a water balance model. Grapevine yields decreased as the cover crop soil coverage increased, and these yield reductions were found to be more severe in the shallow soil. Nevertheless, the 30CC treatment appeared to be both feasible and useful for ecosystem services such as soil protection whatever the soil depth. Moreover, FTSW was found to be relevant as an early yield indicator that could be useful to adapt the cover crop strategy to seasonal climate characteristics. The findings support the feasibility of a cover crop -based strategy, even in the Mediterranean region, as an effective measure to reduce the use of herbicides and fossil fuels without significantly decreasing the grape yield, provided that the winegrowers adapt their strategy to the soil depth and to the seasonal climatic conditions.

AB  - In the early 1900s, breed society herdbooks had been established and milk-recording programs were in their infancy. Farmers wanted to improve the productivity of their cattle, but the foundations of population genetics, quantitative genetics, and animal breeding had not been laid. Early animal breeders struggled to identify genetically superior families using performance records that were influenced by local environmental conditions and herd-specific management practices. Daughterdam comparisons were used for more than 30 yr and, although genetic progress was minimal, the attention given to performance recording, genetic theory, and statistical methods paid off in future years. Contemporary (herdmate) comparison methods allowed more accurate accounting for environmental factors and genetic progress began to accelerate when these methods were coupled with artificial insemination and progeny testing. Advances in computing facilitated the implementation of mixed linear models that used pedigree and performance data optimally and enabled accurate selection decisions. Sequencing of the bovine genome led to a revolution in dairy cattle breeding, and the pace of scientific discovery and genetic progress accelerated rapidly. Pedigree-based models have given way to whole-genome prediction, and Bayesian regression models and machine learning algorithms have joined mixed linear models in the toolbox of modern animal breeders. Future developments will likely include elucidation of the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and epigenetic modification in key biological pathways, and genomic data will be used with data from on-farm sensors to facilitate precision management on modern dairy farms.

AB  - The Portoviejo River, located in the central western part of Ecuador, has been heavily impacted by damming, intensive agriculture and untreated wastewater discharge. Unfortunately, detailed information on the water quality and the ecological status of the Portoviejo River is not available, inhibiting decision-making and the development of water management plans. Therefore, the aims of this study were (1) to assess the ecological water quality, (2) to investigate the point along the environmental gradient where the most significant change in macroinvertebrate community occurs and (3) to find potential macroinvertebrate taxa that significantly change in abundance and frequency of occurrence along the Portoviejo River. To this end, macroinvertebrate and physico-chemical data were collected and hydro-morphological conditions were recorded at 31 locations during the dry season of 2015. The results showed that the ecological water quality of the sampling sites ranged from good to bad. In addition, the Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis was used to examine changes in macroinvertebrate communities and revealed significant community change points for sensitive taxa declining at a conductivity value of 930 (mu S.cm(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of 0.6 mg.L-1. In addition, the thresholds estimated for tolerant taxa were set at a conductivity value of 1430 mu S.cm(-1) and nitrate-nitrogen concentration of 2.3 mg. L. Atyidae, Corbiculidae, Thiaridae, Acari, Baetidae and Leptohyphidae can be considered indicator taxa, showing shifts in the community. This study suggests that values of conductivity and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations should not exceed the threshold levels in order to protect macroinvertebrate biodiversity in the Portoviejo River.

AB  - Green roofs provide ecosystem services through evapotranspiration and nutrient cycling that depend, among others, on plant species, substrate type, and substrate depth. However, no study has assessed thoroughly how interactions between these factors alter ecosystem functions and multifunctionality of green roofs. We simulated some green roof conditions in a pot experiment. We planted 20 plant species from 10 genera and five families (Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Crassulaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae) on two substrate types (natural vs. artificial) and two substrate depths (10 cm vs. 30 cm). As indicators of major ecosystem functions, we measured aboveground and belowground biomasses, foliar nitrogen and carbon content, foliar transpiration, substrate water retention, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrates in leachates. Interactions between substrate type and depth strongly affected ecosystem functions. Biomass production was increased in the artificial substrate and deeper substrates, as was water retention in most cases. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon leaching was higher in the artificial substrates. Except for the Fabaceae species, nitrate leaching was reduced in deep, natural soils. The highest transpiration rates were associated with natural soils. All functions were modulated by plant families or species. Plant effects differed according to the observed function and the type and depth of the substrate. Fabaceae species grown on natural soils had the most noticeable patterns, allowing high biomass production and high water retention but also high nitrate leaching from deep pots. No single combination of factors enhanced simultaneously all studied ecosystem functions, highlighting that soil-plant interactions induce trade-offs between ecosystem functions. Substrate type and depth interactions are major drivers for green roof multifunctionality.

AB  - This research investigated how the strength of vegetation-soil-topography couplings varied along a gradient of biogeomorphic succession in two distinct fluvial systems: a forested river floodplain and a coastal salt marsh creek. The strength of couplings was quantified as tri-variance, which was calculated by correlating three singular axes, one each extracted using three-block partial least squares from vegetation, soil, and topography data blocks. Within each system, tri-variance was examined at low-, mid-, and high-elevation sites, which represented early-, intermediate-, and late-successional phases, respectively, and corresponded to differences in ongoing disturbance frequency and intensity. Both systems exhibited clearly increasing tri-variance from the early- to late-successional stages. The lowest-lying sites underwent frequent and intense hydrogeomorphic forcings that dynamically reworked soil substrates, restructured surface landforms, and controlled the colonization of plant species. Such conditions led vegetation, soil, and topography to show discrete, stochastic, and individualistic behaviors over space and time, resulting in a loose coupling among the three ecosystem components. In the highest-elevation sites, in contrast, disturbances that might disrupt the existing biotic-abiotic relationships were less common. Hence, ecological succession, soil-forming processes, and landform evolution occurred in tight conjunction with one another over a prolonged period, thereby strengthening couplings among them; namely, the three behaved in unity over space and time. We propose that the recurrence interval of physical disturbance is important to-and potentially serves as an indicator of-the intensity and mechanisms of vegetation-soil-topography feedbacks in fluvial biogeomorphic systems.

AB  - The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is a key engineering species structuring coastal marine systems throughout much of the Mediterranean basin. Its decline is of concern, leading to the search for short- and long-term indicators of seagrass health. Using ArcGIS maps from a recent, high-resolution (1-4km) modelling study of 18 disturbance factors affecting coastal marine systems across the Mediterranean (Micheli etal. 2013, ), we tested for correlations with genetic diversity metrics (allelic diversity, genotypic/clonal diversity and heterozygosity) in a meta-analysis of 56 meadows. Contrary to initial predictions, weak but significantly positive correlations were found for commercial shipping, organic pollution (pesticides) and cumulative impact. This counterintuitive finding suggests greater resistance and resilience of individuals with higher genetic and genotypic diversity under disturbance (at least for a time) and/or increased sexual reproduction under an intermediate disturbance model. We interpret the absence of low and medium levels of genetic variation at impacted locations as probable local extinctions of individuals that already exceeded their resistance capacity. Alternatively, high diversity at high-impact sites is likely a temporal artefact, reflecting the mismatch with pre-environmental impact conditions, especially because flowering and sexual recruitment are seldom observed. While genetic diversity metrics are a valuable tool for restoration and mitigation, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of correlative patterns as found in this study, because the exceptional longevity of individuals creates a temporal mismatch that may falsely suggest good meadow health status, while gradual deterioration of allelic diversity might go unnoticed.

AB  - The potential of microvertebrate remains for reconstructing the paleoecology of urban sites remains largely untapped except for extensive research carried out at Roman and medieval sites in Britain. We apply taphonomic and ecological approaches to analyzing an assemblage of microvertebrate remains from the Iron Age IIA of Tel Megiddo, Israel. Sampling in a dense residential area including house floors and various fills produced 1080 identifiable specimens including fish, mammal, reptile and bird remains. The mammalian remains show a number of distinct patterns pointing to accumulation from the community of small animals which lived and died on-site. These patterns include evidence for fragmentation due to trampling and presence of burned specimens. The mammalian remains also differed in their taphonomy from an assemblage from Early Bronze Age II Megiddo which originated from predator accumulation during a period of abandonment. These analyses point to an especially low taxonomic diversity in the Iron Age residential assemblage suggesting that the urban environment of Megiddo supported a unique community of small mammalian animals. This differs markedly from ecological conditions in modern day cities which in some cases show greater than background levels of diversity and suggests a dense, homogenous urban environment. We suggest that reconstructing the evolution of urban fauna in greater detail will provide a sensitive tool for tracing historical processes of growth, decline and increasing complexity of urban sites in the Near East as well as other regions of the world.

AB  - Following the Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements, we designed a new multimetric index (I2M2) for the invertebrate-based ecological assessment of French wadeable streams. This index should be able to identify impaired reaches for 17 anthropogenic pressure categories potentially leading to water quality alteration or habitat degradation. Based on a national database, we defined an iterative procedure to select taxonomy- and trait-based metrics exhibiting the best trade-off between (i) high discrimination efficiency, (ii) low specificity and (iii) high stability in least impaired conditions. The I2M2, defined as the best combination of such metrics, has been composed by: (i) Shannon diversity index, (ii) original ASPT score, (iii) the relative abundance of polyvoltine taxa, (iv) the relative abundance of ovoviviparous taxa and (v) taxonomic richness. The I2M2 was tested against an independent data set. It exhibited good and robust pressure-impact relationship for all the pressure categories, correctly identifying in average 82% of reaches impaired by water quality alterations or habitat degradation. The I2M2 significantly improved the detection of impaired reaches by at least 17% for nitrogen compounds and up to 35% for organic micropollutants and clogging risk, when compared to the normalized French biotic index (IBGN). The I2M2 has been proposed for future use in the national biomonitoring of wadeable reaches in the context of the WFD implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations(1,2). Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size(3-6) whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities(7). Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades(8), the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive(9). Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (similar to 8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general(10-12).

AB  - A proactive sampling strategy was designed and implemented in 2000 to document changes in streams whose catchment land uses were predicted to change over the next two decades due to increased building density. Diatoms, macroinvertebrates, fishes, suspended sediment, dissolved solids, and bed composition were measured at two reference sites and six sites where a socioeconomic model suggested new building construction would influence stream ecosystems in the future; we label these "hazard sites." The six hazard sites were located in catchments with forested and agricultural land use histories. Diatoms were species-poor at reference sites, where riparian forest cover was significantly higher than all other sites. Cluster analysis, Wishart's distance function, non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicator species analysis, and t-tests show that macroinvertebrate assemblages, fish assemblages, in situ physical measures, and catchment land use and land cover were different between streams whose catchments were mostly forested, relative to those with agricultural land use histories and varying levels of current and predicted development. Comparing initial results with other regional studies, we predict homogenization of fauna with increased nutrient inputs and sediment associated with agricultural sites where more intense building activities are occurring. Based on statistical separability of sampled sites, catchment classes were identified and mapped throughout an 8,600 km(2) region in western North Carolina's Blue Ridge physiographic province. The classification is a generalized representation of two ongoing trajectories of land use change that we suggest will support streams with diverging biota and physical conditions over the next two decades.

AB  - Variation in fish abundance across systems presents a challenge to our understanding of fish populations because it limits our ability to predict and transfer basic ecological principles to applied problems. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) is an ideal species for exploring environmental and biotic correlates across system because it is widely distributed and physiologically tolerant. In 16 small, adjacent systems that span a wide range of environmental and biotic conditions, yellow perch were sampled with a standard suite of gear. Water quality, morphometry, vegetation, invertebrates and fish communities were concurrently measured. Multimodel inference was used to prioritise regressors for the entire yellow perch sample and three size groups (35-80, 81-180, >= 181 mm TL). Across systems, pH and fish richness were identified as the key drivers of yellow perch abundance. At very low pH (< 4.0), few fish species and few yellow perch individuals were found. At ponds with moderately low pH (4.0-4.8), numbers of yellow perch increased. Ponds with high pH (> 4.8) had many other species and few yellow perch. Similar patterns for pH and fish community were observed for the two largest-size classes. Negative interactions were observed between the medium- and large-sized yellow perch and between the largest and smallest yellow perch, although interspecific interactions were weaker than expected. This examination of variability for an indicator species and its component-size classes provides ecological understanding that can help frame the larger-scale sampling programs needed for the conservation of freshwater fish.

AB  - The importance of soil organic carbon (SOC) under forests in the global carbon cycle depends on the stability of the soil carbon and its availability to soil microbial biomass. We investigated the effects of successive rotations of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) plantations on the stability of SOC and its availability to microbes by adopting the two-step hydrolysis with H2SO4 and density fractionation. The results showed that successive rotations of Chinese fir decreased the quantity of total SOC, recalcitrant fraction, and carbohydrates in Labile Pool I (LP I), and microbial properties evidently, especially at 0-10 cm horizon. However, cellulose included in Labile Pool II (LPII) and the cellulose/total carbohydrates ratio increased in successive rotations of Chinese fir. The non-cellulose of carbohydrates included in LP I maybe highly available to soil microbial biomass. Hence the availability of SOC to microbial biomass declined over the successive rotations. Although there was no significant change in recalcitrance of SOC over the successive rotations of Chinese fir, the percentage of heavy fraction to total SOC increased, suggesting that the degree of physical protection for SOC increased and SOC became more stable over the successive rotations. The degradation of SOC quality in successive rotation soils may be attributed to worse environmental conditions resulted from disturbance that related to "slash and bum" site preparation. Being highly correlated with soil microbial properties, the cellulose/total carbohydrates ratio as an effective indicator of changes in availability of SOC to microbial biomass brought by management practices in forest soils.

AB  - Run-off containing increased concentrations of sediment, nutrients, and pesticides from land-based anthropogenic activities is a significant influence on water quality and the ecologic conditions of nearshore areas of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia. The potential and actual impacts of increased pollutant concentrations range from bioaccumulation of contaminants and decreased photosynthetic capacity to major shifts in community structure and health of mangrove, coral reef, and seagrass ecosystems. A detailed conceptual model underpins and illustrates the links between the main anthropogenic pressures or threats (dry-land cattle grazing and intensive sugar cane cropping) and the production of key contaminants or stressors of Great Barrier Reef water quality. The conceptual model also includes longer-term threats to Great Barrier Reef water quality and ecosystem health, such as global climate change, that will potentially confound direct model interrelationships. The model recognises that system-specific attributes, such as monsoonal wind direction, rainfall intensity, and flood plume residence times, will act as system filters to modify the effects of any water-quality system stressor. The model also summarises key ecosystem responses in ecosystem health that can be monitored through indicators at catchment, riverine, and marine scales. Selected indicators include riverine and marine water quality, inshore coral reef and seagrass status, and biota pollutant burdens. These indicators have been adopted as components of a long-term monitoring program to enable assessment of the effectiveness of change in catchment-management practices in improving Great Barrier Reef (and adjacent catchment) water quality under the Queensland and Australian Governments' Reef Water Quality Protection Plan.

AB  - [ 1] Ammonium and amino acid fluxes were examined as indicators of N and microbial food web dynamics in southern Lake Michigan during spring. Either (NH4+)-N-15 or a mixture of N-15-labelled amino acids (both at 4 muM N final concentration) was added to Lake Michigan water. Net fluxes were measured over 24 h under natural light and dark conditions using deck-top incubators and compared to microbial food web characteristics. Isotope dilution experiments showed similar light and dark NH4+ regeneration rates at lake ( 6 versus 5 nM N h(-1)) and river-influenced ( 20 versus 24 nM N h(-1)) sites. Ammonium uptake rates were similar to regeneration rates in dark bottles. Dark uptake ( attributed mainly to bacteria) accounted for -70% of total uptake ( bacteria plus phytoplankton) in the light at most lake sites but only -30% of total uptake at river-influenced sites in or near the St. Joseph River mouth (SJRM). Cluster analysis grouped stations having zero, average, or higher than average N-cycling rates. Discriminant analysis indicated that chlorophyll concentration, oligotrich ciliate biomass, and total P concentration could explain 66% of N-cycling rate variation on average. Heterotrophic bacterial N demand was about one third of the NH4+ regeneration rate. Results suggest that, with the exception of SJRM stations, bacterial uptake and protist grazing mediated much of the N dynamics during spring transition. Since NH4+ is more available to bacteria than NO3-, regenerated NH4+ may have a strong influence on spring, lake biochemical energetics by enhancing N-poor organic matter degradation in this NO3--replete ecosystem.

AB  - The Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), one of the most widely used bioindicators of persistent organic pollutants, trace metals and radionuclides in several worldwide freshwater ecosystems, has been used to monitor DDT contamination trends in Lake Maggiore since 1996, caused by industrial effluents on a tributary of the River Toce, one of the major affluents of the lake. Dreissena specimens were collected at two sampling sites, one within the Baveno Bay, where the River Toce flows, and the other outside (Villa Taranto). Total DDT levels (3119.6 ng/g lipids at Baveno and 1351.2 ng/g lipids at Villa Taranto) in the soft tissues of the Zebra mussel decreased at both stations by about 30-50% in the first year after the closure of the chemical plant reaching an almost steady-state condition. The high concentrations measured in Zebra mussel specimens of Baveno Bay in 2000 (1947 ng/g lipids) and the percentage of pp'DDE in comparison with total DDT concentration, which showed a slight increase in the last years, clearly indicate that a contamination source is still present, deriving probably from the lacustrine sediments and the River Toce. Data show that the environmental risk is very high within the Baveno Bay and the recovery time should be longer than in the other parts of the lake, where DDT levels in Dreissena are presently two times higher than those measured in the other Italian subalpine lakes.

AB  - Vitellogenin (Vtg) is a folk protein produced in the liver of oviparous animals in response to estrogen. Vitellogenesis is normally observed only in sexually mature females, but it can be induced in male and juvenile animals by exposure to exogenous estradiol (E-2) or substances that mimic estrogens. The abnormal production of Vtg by males can, therefore, be used as a biological indicator for exposure to xenoestrogens. In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measuring Vtg in English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus) was developed and validated. Plasmatic Vtg was purified from E-2-injected male English sole using DEAE ion-exchange and Sepharose size-exclusion chromatography, and polyclonal antibodies against the purified Vtg protein were generated in rabbits. In this assay, a competition for the Vtg antibody was established between Vtg coated onto microtiter plate wells and free Vtg. Detection of adsorbed antigen-antibody complexes was achieved using a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody whose enzyme activity was revealed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate. Assay conditions provided a detectable Vtg range of 10-450 ng ml(-1) (85-20% of binding) of diluted sample. Plasma dilution curves from vitellogenic female and E-2-treated male English sole showed parallelism with the standard dilution curve. We are presently conducting field and laboratory studies to investigate estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity resulting from exposure to contaminants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - As a reaction to the lack of information concerning ranges of a 'normal xenobiotic burden' within the population and also the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric environments, the sampling and storage of environmental materials in Germany in 1974 as a possible tool for environmental observation and early recognizing of hazards was proposed. During subsequent years the collection of human specimens was undertaken in Munster. In a pilot phase (1978-1983) conditions of optimized storage were investigated, including reliable storage temperature and container materials. Since 1985 the Environmental Specimen Bank for Human Tissue in Munster has been institutionalized under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Protection and Nuclear Safety as well as the Federal Environmental Agency in Berlin. Up to 1991 about 300 000 samples had been collected and stored at -85-degrees-C in a walk-in deep-freezer of 34 m3 comprising autopsy material as well as 'available' organs form living persons (e.g. blood, urine, hair, human milk, saliva, seminal plasma, sweat). Having fulfilled the tasks within the scope of environmental banking the Munster institution has proved to be an adequate scientific tool. It has been integrated into the logistic system of the Environmental Specimen Bank in Germany having the following main tasks (a) the development of Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) for sampling and sample handling, (b) evaluation of reliable analytical methods for inorganic and organic sample characterization, (c) collection of a sufficient data pool for reference ranges of xenobiotics, which are essential for environmental risk assessment, and (d) the evaluation of the efficacy of legislative xenobiotic restrictions: this could be proved for lead and some organochlorine pesticides.

AB  - Coral reef metabolism underpins ecosystem function and is defined by the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and calcium carbonate dissolution. However, the relationships between these physiological processes at the organismal level and their interactions with light remain unclear. We examined metabolic rates across a range of photosynthesising calcifiers in the Caribbean: the scleractinian corals Acropora cervicornis, Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea siderea, and crustose coralline algae (CCA) under varying natural light conditions. Net photosynthesis and calcification showed a parabolic response to light across all species, with differences among massive corals, branching corals, and CCA that reflect their relative functional roles on the reef. At night, all organisms were net respiring, and most were net calcifying, although some incubations demonstrated instances of net calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution. Peak metabolic rates at light-saturation (maximum photosynthesis and calcification) and average dark rates (respiration and dark calcification) were positively correlated across species. Interspecies relationships among photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification indicate that calcification rates are linked to energy production at the organismal level in calcifying reef organisms. The species-specific ratios of net calcification to photosynthesis varied with light over a diurnal cycle. The dynamic nature of calcification/photosynthesis ratios over a diurnal cycle questions the use of this metric as an indicator for reef function and health at the ecosystem scale unless temporal variability is accounted for, and a new metric is proposed. The complex light-driven dynamics of metabolic processes in coral reef organisms indicate that a more comprehensive understanding of reef metabolism is needed for predicting the future impacts of global change.

AB  - Urban expansion not only results in land use transformation, but also introduces extra anthropogenic emissions over the expanded urban areas, which is usually neglected in existing studies. In this study, we consider both the changes in land use categories and added anthropogenic emissions from 2001 to 2018 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) which we define as the city of Shanghai and the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui, China and explore the individual and combined impacts of these factors on air pollution using the WRF-Chem model. Calibrated by available observations, the model performs well (IOA (index of agreement) > 0.8) in reproducing the meteorological fields and ambient PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations in September 2018. We show that the land use transformation from non-urban to urban and the introduced anthropogenic emissions over new urban areas exert opposite influences on ambient PM2.5 concentrations over YRD, particularly in the expanded urban areas, and the PM2.5 decrease due to land use changes is significantly offset by the increase due to added emissions. The response of ambient O-3 concentration to these two factors is highly variable in space, which is dependent on the chemical regime of tropospheric O-3 formation and influenced by the chemistry-meteorology feedback. As the total effect, strong increases in O-3 concentration occur over the central areas of YRD. These results highlight that it is essential to take into account the additional anthropogenic emissions over expanded urban areas in the assessment of environmental impacts of urban expansion.

AB  - Study region: Northeast Poland, Biebrza Basin.
   Study focus: Studying reference ecosystems and their specific features provides information to be used as background principles for ecosystem management. In the case of riparian wetlands, these are hydrological indicators (such as average water levels, flooding extents and flood duration) that are either used as criteria for ecosystem conservation or remain easy-to-measure targets for habitat restoration. We focused on revealing whether any trends in flood extents and durations of inundation exist within near-natural temperate floodplains persisting under the natural lowland river flow regime. We analysed whether the fraction of inundation time in a year (FIT) changed over time. River discharge data from 1951 to 2011 applied as boundary conditions in a 1D hydrodynamic model were used to generate flood extents and durations in the Lower Basin of the Biebrza Valley.
   New hydrological insights for the region: We found no substantial trends in flood extents and flood durations in both time-dependent mean and standard deviation. We revealed that the average, long-term values of the FIT, influencing the persistence of Caricetum approprinquatae, Caricetum gracilis, Glycerietum maximae and Phragmitetum communis, reached, respectively, 0.33, 0.43, 0.49 and 0.53 and did not present trends. Variability of the FIT within particular plant communities was high. The main challenges in conservation of temperate riparian wetlands are likely related to appropriate management addressing nonlinear climatic pressures.

AB  - The development of construction processes is one of the main causes that generates the emission of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases (GHG), which cause serious consequences for the planet and in turn socioeconomic problems reflected in human health, food security, migrations, financial impacts among others. For this reason, it is very important to create indicators that provide information on the amount of Ton-CO2 generated in construction processes in general and especially, now that many of these processes have stopped as a result of the Covid-19 health emergency. Therefore, the present work seeks to describe how the construction processes are carried out and the Carbon Dioxide emissions that influence the socio-economic results of Mexico, especially during the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. The authors who support the theoretical aspects of this research are: Hepburn & Stern (2008); Moreno Sanchez and Urbina Soria (2008), Magrin, et al, (2007), among others. The methodology applied is descriptive, documentary in nature, taking the "Cantabria" subdivision of Ciudad Obregon de Mexico as the study population. Where it was possible to determine among the results that the amount of carbon dioxide that is produced during the construction of a fractionation is equivalent to a total of 10.5 TonCO2 / m2 under normal conditions, however, with the pandemic this amount of gases decreased considerably, given the paralysis of many economic activities including construction. With which it is recommended to identify the materials that cause the generation of these gases and through public policies establish control measures for the construction sector on the use of these polluting materials in order to minimize the emission of GHG to the environment..

AB  - Hibernation has been selected for increasing survival in harsh climatic environments. Seasonal variability in temperature may push the body temperatures of hibernating animals across boundaries of alternative states between euthermic temperature and torpor temperature, typical of either hibernation or summer dormancy. Nowadays, wearable electronics present a promising avenue to assess the occurrence of criticality in physiological systems, such as body temperature fluctuating between attractors of activity and hibernation. For this purpose, we deployed temperature loggers on two hibernating edible dormice for an entire year and under Mediterranean climate conditions. Highly stochastic body temperatures with sudden switches over time allowed us to assess the reliability of statistical leading indicators to anticipate tipping points when approaching a critical transition. Hibernation dynamics showed flickering, a phenomenon occurring when a system rapidly moves back and forth between two alternative attractors preceding the upcoming major regime shift. Flickering of body temperature increased when the system approached bifurcations, which were also anticipated by several metric- and model-based statistical indicators. Nevertheless, some indicators did not show a pattern in their response, which suggests that their performance varies with the dynamics of the biological system studied. Gradual changes in air temperature drove transient between states of hibernation and activity, and also drove hysteresis. For hibernating animals, hysteresis may increase resilience when ending hibernation earlier than the optimal time, which may occur in regions where temperatures are sharply rising, especially during winter. Temporal changes in early indicators of critical transitions in hibernation dynamics may help to understand the effects of climate on evolutionary life histories and the plasticity of hibernating organisms to cope with shortened hibernation due to global warming.

AB  - Habitat disturbance, a common consequence of anthropogenic land use practices, creates human-animal interfaces where humans, wildlife, and domestic species can interact. These altered habitats can influence host-microbe dynamics, leading to potential downstream effects on host physiology and health. Here, we explored the effect of ecological overlap with humans and domestic species and infection with the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis on the bacteria of black and gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya), a key sentinel species, in northeastern Argentina. Fecal samples were screened for Giardia duodenalis infection using a nested PCR reaction, and the gut bacterial community was characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Habitat type was correlated with variation in A. caraya gut bacterial community composition but did not affect gut bacterial diversity. Giardia presence did not have a universal effect on A. caraya gut bacteria across habitats, perhaps due to the high infection prevalence across all habitats. However, some bacterial taxa were found to vary with Giardia infection. While A. caraya's behavioral plasticity and dietary flexibility allow them to exploit a range of habitat conditions, habitats are generally becoming more anthropogenically disturbed and, thus, less hospitable. Alterations in gut bacterial community dynamics are one possible indicator of negative health outcomes for A. caraya in these environments, since changes in host-microbe relationships due to stressors from habitat disturbance may lead to negative repercussions for host health. These dynamics are likely relevant for understanding organism responses to environmental change in other mammals.

AB  - Exianliumi is a newly developed pesticide for controlling diseases caused by microbes or meloidogynes during plant vegetable and reproductive stages. To date, little is known about the environmental behavior and fate of its residues in soil. To explore its potential environmental risks to crop production and food safety, three typical Chinese agricultural soils were examined by analyzing adsorption, mobility leaching, and degraded metabolites of exianliumi in soils. Exianliumi inclined to bind more to Heilongjiang soil (HLJS), followed by Nanjing soil (NJS) and Jiangxi soil (JXS). Soil thin-layer chromatography and column leaching tests showed a weak migration in HLJS and strong mobility in JXS. Under the same condition, exianliumi rapidly decayed in NJS, followed by HLJS and JXS. The differential degradative capacity for exianliumi in the soils was related to chemical, physical and biological interactions basically through organic matter content, temperature, soil moisture and microorganisms. The half-normal, normal and pareto effect plots demonstrated that temperature, microorganisms and soil moisture dominantly influenced the degradation of exianliumi. We further characterized metabolites of exianliumi catabolized in NJS using High Resolution Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer/Mass Spectrometer (HRLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Eight degradation products and three conjugates of exianliumi were detected and the possible degradative pathways were highlighted. This is the first report about exianliumi degradation in soils with multi-pathways, which provides the basic data for environmental risk assessment of crop production and food security.

AB  - From an embodied and enactive point of view, the mind-body problem has been reformulated as the relation between the lived or subject body on the one hand and the physiological or object body on the other ("body-body problem"). The aim of the paper is to explore the concept of circularity as a means of explaining the relation between the phenomenology of lived experience and the dynamics of organism-environment interactions. This concept of circularity also seems suitable for connecting enactive accounts with ecological psychology. It will be developed in a threefold way: (1) As thecircular structure of embodiment, which manifests itself (a) in the homeostatic cycles between the brain and body and (b) in the sensorimotor cycles between the brain, body, and environment. This includes the interdependence of an organism's dispositions of sense-making and the affordances of the environment. (2) As thecircular causality, which characterizes the relation between parts and whole within the living organism as well as within the organism-environment system. (3) As thecircularity of process and structurein development and learning. Here, it will be argued that subjective experience constitutes a process of sense-making that implies (neuro-)physiological processes so as to form modified neuronal structures, which in turn enable altered future interactions. On this basis, embodied experience may ultimately be conceived as the integration of brain-body and body-environment interactions, which has a top-down, formative, or ordering effect on physiological processes. This will serve as an approach to a solution of the body-body problem.

AB  - The present field study aimed to assess the water quality of the Itacaiunas River, located at the eastern part of the Brazilian Amazon, using water's physicochemical parameters, ecological risk assessment in sediments, biomarkers and metal bioaccumulation in piranhas at two points: upstream (P1) and downstream (P2), and the type of season (Dry and Rainy). We revealed a significant difference between the points and the seasons. Concerning, the concentration of metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Cr, and Hg) in sediment and water, we reported significant concentrations of Cd and Cu especially on P2 at dry season. The fish gills collected in P2 showed various types of damages (moderate and severe), furthermore, the Degree of Tissue Change (DTC) reported a significant difference between points, highlighting the dreadful condition in animals' health originated from this point. In terms of the biotransformation enzyme, the GST activity was higher in fishes from P2 in both seasons. The obtained results showed clear signs of stress in fish from the downstream point. Linear correlation analysis exhibited that the biomarkers' response could be linked to the detected metals bioaccumulation. This field investigation provides baseline data on pollution status in this region and the results showed that although the overall potential ecological risks of the metals were considered low at our sampling sites including cadmium, however, Cd posed a noteworthy monomial potential ecological risk factor. Strong evidence of correlation was obtained between Cd in the environment with the gills' damage in fishes from P2. The results also indicated that S. rhombeus could be useful for biomonitoring species for assessing metal contamination.

AB  - The diversity of soil erosion prevention (SEP) indicators may cause the incomparability of different research results. In this study, we first classified the six most commonly used methodological approaches for estimating SEP service into three broad categories. Then, we used the following three indicators: (1) amount of soil con- servation (C-s), (2) amount of soil loss (L-s), and (3) the ability of vegetation to prevent soil erosion (V-a) as ecosystem service (ES) proxies for SEP. A methodological framework was developed for analyzing the possible relationships between the three SEP indicators and their combination features at local scales to test the validity of the three hypotheses regarding the relationships among these indicators. Afterward, the mountainous area of southern Ningxia was chosen as the experimental area for testing the application of our framework. Results show the following: (1) the hypotheses regarding their associations are only valid under certain conditions when the corresponding indicators can be substituted for each other in the correlation analysis with other ESs; (2) the combinations of C-s, L-s, and V-a at local scales are conducive to the discovery of the local soil ecological problems and can help in the formulation of relevant improvement measures. Accordingly, when formulating regional soil conservation measures, we should consider not only the current situation of soil loss but also the trend of climate change. Meanwhile, when analyzing the impact of soil conservation policies, attention should be provided to distinguishing whether the changes in soil loss are due to changes in vegetation cover or potential soil loss.

AB  - Enchytraeids and earthworms were studied in a reclaimed sand mine, at a combustion waste disposal site and in natural forest stands in the Bieszczady Mountains. The study verifies the influence of three alder species (Alnusincana, A. viridis, A. glutinosa), reclaimed mine soil substrates (RMS) and combustion waste (CW) on annelid communities. Earthworms were absent in RMS and CW. Enchytraeid densities varied, from almost 2000 ind. m(-2) (individuals per m(2)) to > 9000 ind. m(-2) in RMS and CW and to 30,000-60,000 ind. m(-2) in natural forest soils. Soil properties strongly correlated with enchytraeid density were pH, silt content and organic carbon content. In total, eight genera and thirteen species were recorded. In combustion waste technosols, species tolerating dry conditions and high pH predominated (e.g. Henlea ventriculosa). In sand mine soils, species diversity was very low (Shannon index 0.16), but Hemifridericia bivesiculata was recorded, a species that was known within Europe only from Hungary. Alder trees, especially A. glutinosa, allowed enchytraeids to reach high population density. In soil afforested by A. glutinosa the succession stage was more advanced than in soil under A. incana because, in variants with A. glutinosa, more species classified as belonging to the transitional stage of succession (Fridericia spp.) or even preliminary climax stage of succession (Cognettia sphagnetorum), were recorded. In the variant with A. incana, Enchytraeus spp. predominated. These are considered pioneer species. The study of enchytraeids confirmed that alders should be recommended for biological reclamation.

AB  - Improving biodegradation of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment is critical to control the release of emerging micropollutants to natural waters. In this study, biodegradation of six model pharmaceuticals was investigated at different initial concentrations in two discrete activated sludge systems, and moreover, the correlation was explored between the biodegradation rate and key molecular properties of the contaminants. First, the biodegradation rates of the pharmaceuticals were measured fitting a pseudo first-order kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data. The degradation rate constants (k(bio)) were found to negatively correlate to the initial concentration of the chemicals, indicating an inhibitory effect on the microorganisms by the pharmaceuticals. Further examinations of the rate data against the key molecular properties of the pharmaceuticals revealed, for the first time, that the electrophilicity index (omega), a measure of electrophilic power, served as a better indicator of the biodegradability and predictive parameter for the k(bio) than the conventional log K-ow (a measure of hydrophobicity) in the two discrete aerobic activated sludge systems. However, the correlation strength (goodness-of-fit) between omega and k(bio )deteriorated when the reactor turned from aerobic to anoxic and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that electron transfer from pharmaceutical molecules to enzymes was inhibited when dissolved oxygen was deficit or absent. Our results show that omega can potentially serve as a straightforward and robust indicator for predicting the biodegradability of pharmaceutical in conventional activated sludge processes.

AB  - Recruitment dynamics are challenging to assess or predict because of the many underlying drivers that vary in their relevance over time and space. Stock size, demographic and trait composition, condition and distribution of spawning fish and the spatio-temporal dynamics of trophic and environmental interactions all influence recruitment processes. Exploring common patterns among stocks and linking them to potential drivers may therefore provide insights into key mechanisms of recruitment dynamics. Here, we analysed stock-recruitment data of 64 stocks from the north-east Atlantic Ocean for common trends in variation and synchrony among stocks using correlation, cluster and dynamic factor analyses. We tested common trends in recruitment success for relationships with large-scale environmental processes as well as stock state indicators, and we explored links between recruitment success and demographic, environmental and ecological variables for a subset of individual stocks. The results revealed few statistically significant correlations between stocks but showed that underlying common trends in recruitment success are linked to environmental indices and management indicators. Statistical analyses confirmed previously suggested relationships of environmental-ecological factors such as the subpolar gyre and Norwegian coastal current with specific stocks, and indicated a large relevance of spawning stock biomass and demographics, as well as predation, whereas other suggested relationships were not supported by the data. Our study shows that despite persistent challenges in determining drivers of recruitment due to poor data quality and unclear mechanisms, combining different data analysis techniques can improve our understanding of recruitment dynamics in fish stocks.

AB  - Several studies about the disposition of the community of Formicidae in the soil when facing different conditions of the agroecosystems were performed given the advance of the agricultural frontier. The abundance of tolerant species is common in these environments with negative consequences in wealth and diversity, although there are experiments with observations to the contrary. The hypothesis of this study was that characterizing the structure of the community allows detecting differences in the response of these insects towards diverse types of agricultural activity. The objective was to carry out an ecological analysis of the composition and abundance of the species of ants in two crops with different level of agricultural management: a plantation with aloe, Aloe vera (L.) Burm F. and another with maize, Zea mays L., and the reference was an area of secondary vegetation (uncultivated area). The study was performed in the ejido of San Lorenzo, municipality of Jaumave, state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. For sampling, 30 "pitfall" traps were used per site, between July and August 2013, with four repetitions every 15 d. Characterization of the structure of the ant communities in the three environments was obtained through measurements of wealth, diversity, indicator value and multivariate methods. The results showed 32 species of ants. The highest wealth was in the uncultivated area, the highest diversity in the maize crop, and the highest abundance in the aloe crop. Two species were indicators of the aloe crop and four species of the uncultivated area. The multivariate analyses showed significant association in the frequency of ants captured with the type of crop and the species. The structure of the ant community depended on the site and the season.

AB  - The aim of ecotoxicology is to study toxic effects on constituents of ecosystems, with the protection goal being populations and communities rather than individual organisms. In this ecosystem perspective, the use of in vitro methodologies measuring cellular and subcellular endpoints at a first glance appears to be odd. Nevertheless, more recently in vitro approaches gained momentum in ecotoxicology. In this article, we will discuss important application domains of in vitro methods in ecotoxicology. One area is the use of in vitro assays to replace, reduce, and refine (3R) in vivo tests. Research in this field has focused mainly on the use of in vitro cytotoxicity assays with fish cells as non-animal alternative to the in vivo lethality test with fish and on in vitro biotransformation assays as part of an alternative testing strategy for bioaccumulation testing with fish. Lessons learned from this research include the importance of a critical evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity and exposure conditions of in vitro assays, as well as the availability of appropriate in vitro-in vivo extrapolation models. In addition to this classical 3R application, other application domains of in vitro assays in ecotoxicology include the screening and prioritization of chemical hazards, the categorization of chemicals according to their modes of action and the provision of mechanistic information for the pathway-based prediction of adverse outcomes. The applications discussed in this essay may highlight the potential of in vitro technologies to enhance the environmental hazard assessment of single chemicals and complex mixtures at a reduced need of animal testing.

AB  - Accumulating remotely sensed and ground-measured data and improvements in data mining such as machine-learning techniques open new opportunities for monitoring and managing algal blooms over large spatial scales. The goal of this study was to test the accuracy of remotely sensed algal biomass determined with machine-learning algorithms and Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery. We used chlorophyll-a concentration data from the 2007 National Lake Assessment (NLA) (lake N = 1157) by the US Environmental Protection Agency to train and test Landsat TM/ETM+ algorithms. Results showed significant improvements in chlorophyll-a retrieval accuracy using machine-learning algorithms compared with traditional empirical models using linear regression. Specifically, the results from boosted regression trees and random forest explained, respectively, 45.8% and 44.5% of chlorophyll-a variation. Multiple linear regression could only explain 39.8% of chlorophyll-a variation. The chlorophyll-a concentration derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ and a simple to use Google Earth Engine application, accurately characterized a 2009 algal bloom in western Lake Erie to show the model worked well for the analysis of temporal changes in algal conditions. Compared with chlorophyll-a data from the NLA, chlorophyll-a measurements with our Landsat TM/ETM+ model had almost the same correlation with lake's total phosphorus concentrations, especially when using multiple Landsat images. Therefore, Landsat measurements of chlorophyll-a have value for ecological assessments and managing algal problems in lakes. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, a close relationship exists between groundwater and supergene eco-environmental issues such as swampiness, soil salinization, desertification, vegetation degradation, reduction of stream base flow, and disappearance of lakes and wetlands. When the maximum allowable withdrawal of groundwater (AWG) is assessed, an ecology-oriented regional groundwater resource assessment (RGRA) method should be used. In this study, a hierarchical assessment index system of the supergene eco-environment was established based on field survey data and analysis of the supergene eco-environment factors influenced by groundwater in the Tuwei River watershed, Shaanxi Province, China. The assessment system comprised 11 indices, including geomorphological type, lithology and structure of the vadose zone, depth of the water table (DWT), total dissolved solids content of groundwater, etc. Weights for all indices were calculated using an analytical hierarchy process. Then, the current eco-environmental conditions were assessed using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE). Under the imposed constraints, and using both the assessment results on the current eco-environment situation and the ecological constraint of DWT (1.5-5.0 m), the maximum AWG (0.408 x 10(8) m(3)/a or 24.29 % of the river base flow) was determined. This was achieved by combining the groundwater resource assessment with the supergene eco-environmental assessment based on FCE. If the maximum AWG is exceeded in a watershed, the eco-environment will gradually deteriorate and produce negative environmental effects. The ecology-oriented maximum AWG can be determined by the ecology-oriented RGRA method, and thus sustainable groundwater use in similar watersheds in other arid and semi-arid regions can be achieved.

AB  - Shark nurseries are susceptible to environmental fluctuations in salinity because of their shallow, coastal nature; however, the physiological impacts on resident elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) and school sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) use the same Tasmanian estuary as a nursery ground; however, each species has distinct distribution patterns that are coincident with changes in local environmental conditions, such as increases in salinity. We hypothesized that these differences were directly related to differential physiological tolerances to high salinity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed wild, juvenile school and gummy sharks to an environmentally relevant hypersaline (120% SW) event for 48 h. Metabolic rate decreased 20-35% in both species, and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was maintained in gummy sharks but decreased 37% in school sharks. We measured plasma ions (Na+, K+, Cl-) and osmolytes [urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO)], and observed a 33% increase in plasma Na+ in gummy sharks with hyperosmotic exposure, while school sharks displayed a typical ureosmotic increase in plasma urea (similar to 20%). With elevated salinity, gill TMAO concentration increased by 42% in school sharks and by 30% in gummy sharks. Indicators of cellular stress (heat shock proteins HSP70, 90 and 110, and ubiquitin) significantly increased in gill and white muscle in both a species- and a tissue-specific manner. Overall, gummy sharks exhibited greater osmotic perturbation and ionic dysregulation and a larger cellular stress response compared with school sharks. Our findings provide physiological correlates to the observed distribution and movement of these shark species in their critical nursery grounds.

AB  - Although studies on edge effects on species richness and abundance are numerous, the responses of ecosystem processes to these effects have received considerably less attention. How ecosystem processes respond to edge effects is particularly important in temperate forests, where small fragments and edge habitats form a considerable proportion of the total forest area. Soil fauna are key contributors to decomposition and soil biogeochemical cycling processes. Using the bait lamina technique, we quantified soil fauna feeding activity, and its dependence on soil moisture and distance to the edge in a broad-leaved forest in Southern England. Feeding activity was 40% lower at the forest edge than in the interior, and the depth of edge influence was approximately 75 m. A watering treatment showed that moisture limitation was the main driver of the reduced feeding activity at the edge. In England, only 33% of the forest area is greater than 75 m from the edge. Therefore, assuming that the results from this single-site study are representative for the landscape, it implies that only one- third of the forest area in England supports activity levels typical for the forest core, and that edge effects reduce the mean feeding activity across the landscape by 17% (with lower and upper 90% confidence intervals of 1.3 and 23%, respectively). Changing climatic conditions, such as summer droughts may exacerbate such effects as edges lose water faster than the forest interior. The results highlight the importance of taking edge effects into account in ecological studies and forest management planning in highly fragmented landscapes.

AB  - The conventional view of pollution monitoring is that any choice is a trade-off between realism and precision, as the control over confounding variables decreases with the increasing degree of organization of the test system.
   Dublin Bay is subject to considerable anthropogenic pressures and there have been many attempts to quantify the status of the system at organizational levels from DNA strand breaks (Comet) to the system itself (Ecological Network analysis, ENA).
   Using Dublin Bay as an example, the data show there was considerable variability at all levels of organization. At intracellular level, Lysosome Membrane Stability (LMS, assessed by Neutral Red Retention, NRR) varied almost 4-fold with season and individual condition, while the community level AZTI Marine biotic Index (AMBI) had a similar range within a single, supposedly homogeneous, site. Overall, there was no evidence that biomarkers of the lower levels of organisation reduced the variability of the measure, despite the extra control over influencing variables, nor was there any evidence that variability was additive at higher levels of organisation.
   This poses problems for management, especially given the fixed limits of Ecological Quality Standards (EQSs). Clearly while the integrated approach to pollution monitoring does offer the potential to link effects across the organizational range, it should also be possible to improve their capability by widening the database for reference values, particularly at the higher level of organization, and by process models, including the confounding variables found in the field, for those at lower level.

AB  - Streamflow variability is a major determinant of basin-scale distributions of benthic invertebrates. Here we present a novel procedure based on a probabilistic approach aiming at a spatially explicit quantitative assessment of benthic invertebrate abundance as derived from near-bed flow variability. Although the proposed approach neglects ecological determinants other than hydraulic ones, it is nevertheless relevant in view of its implications on the predictability of basin-scale patterns of organisms. In the present context, aquatic invertebrates are considered, given that they are widely employed as sensitive indicators of fluvial ecosystem health and human-induced perturbations. Moving from the analytical characterization of site-specific probability distribution functions of streamflow and bottom shear stress, we achieve a spatial extension to an entire stream network. Bottom shear stress distributions, coupled with habitat suitability curves derived from field studies, are used to produce maps of invertebrate suitability to shear stress conditions. Therefore, the proposed framework allows one to inspect the possible impacts on river ecology of human-induced perturbations of streamflow variability. We apply this framework to an Austrian river network for which rainfall and streamflow time series, river network hydraulic properties, and local information on invertebrate abundance for a limited number of sites are available. A comparison between observed species density versus modeled suitability to shear stress is also presented. Although the proposed strategy focuses on a single controlling factor and thus represents an ecological minimal model, it allows derivation of important implications for water resource management and fluvial ecosystem protection.

AB  - The use of wastewater for irrigation in arid or semiarid regions, where shortage of fresh water restricts agricultural production, has been well established in the last decades. However, the effect of this irrigation practice on the retention on soil of pesticides applied for pest control has been mostly approached by laboratory assays. More realistic approaches are needed because soil pollution with pesticides may cause a serious risk to the environment and to human health due to direct exposure or through the food chain. Therefore in this study a field experiment was run with three pesticides with contrasting properties: the insecticide thiacloprid and the herbicides chlorotoluron and pendimethalin. Three different treatments were considered: non-amended soil irrigated with well water (WL), with treated wastewater (TW) and organic-amended soil (3.2 kg per plot) irrigated with treated wastewater (F+TW). Pesticide decay kinetic models showed that chlorotoluron residues were adequately explained by the hi-exponential first-order equation whereas the other two pesticides were fitted to a single first-order equation. The short-term pesticide persistence (DT50) was always higher for TW, reflecting that irrigation with TW slightly increased pesticide persistence in surface soil. Addition of an organic fertilizer (F+TW) did not modify the long-term thiacloprid persistence (DT90) with respect to irrigation with TW, decreased that of pendimethalin (almost 10 days) but increased that of chlorotoluron (12 days). The biological soil indicators measured showed contradictory results, with soil respiration increasing and dehydrogenase activity decreasing with TW irrigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane is a very important economic crop in Brazil. The effects of abiotic stresses cause negative reduction of the productivity in the sugarcane industry. In order to identify indicators of stresses tolerance, two physiological variables were evaluated, nitrate reductase activity and chlorophyll contents in young plants of sugarcane, cv. IAC91-5155. The simultaneous effect of abiotic stresses of high occurrence in Brazilian soils are, water deficiency and aluminum toxicity. The plants were submitted to three treatments of water availability (% field capacity, FC): no stress (70% FC), moderate stress (55% FC), and extreme stress (40% FC); and three acidity treatments in the soil (base saturation, V%): no acidity (V=55%), average acidity (V=33%), and high acidity (V=23%). The experiment was carried out in greenhouse, with 29.7 +/- 4.3 degrees C and 75 +/- 10% RH. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in 3x3 factorial arrangement, with four replicates. After 60 days, nitrate reductase activity and chlorophyll contents were evaluated in the diagnostic leaf. The results demonstrate that the response of plants to a combination of drought and aluminum toxicity, similar to the conditions in many natural environments, is different from the response of plants to each of these stresses applied individually, as typically tested in the laboratory. The nitrate reductase activity can be used as a biochemical-physiological marker of water deficiency while chlorophyll contents can be used as a biochemical-physiological marker of both of them, water deficiency or aluminum toxicity in soil. Both parameters can not be as a biochemical-physiological marker for acclimation of young plants of sugarcane cv. IAC91-5155, under the combined stresses.

AB  - Ongoing anthropogenic eutrophication of Jiaozhou Bay offers an opportunity to study the influence of human activity on bacterial communities that drive biogeochemical cycling. Nitrification in coastal waters appears to be a sensitive indicator of environmental change, suggesting that function and structure of the microbial nitrifying community may be associated closely with environmental conditions. In the current study, the amoA gene was used to unravel the relationship between sediment aerobic obligate ammonia-oxidizing Betaproteobacteria (Beta-AOB) and their environment in Jiaozhou Bay. Protein sequences deduced from amoA gene sequences grouped within four distinct clusters in the Nitrosomonas lineage, including a putative new cluster. In addition, AmoA sequences belonging to three newly defined clusters in the Nitrosospira lineage were also identified. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that the studied Beta-AOB community structures correlated with environmental parameters, of which nitrite-N and sediment sand content had significant impact on the composition, structure, and distribution of the Beta-AOB community. Both amoA clone library and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses indicated that continental input from the nearby wastewater treatment plants and polluted rivers may have significant impact on the composition and abundance of the sediment Beta-AOB assemblages in Jiaozhou Bay. Our work is the first report of a direct link between a sedimentological parameter and the composition and distribution of the sediment Beta-AOB and indicates the potential for using the Beta-AOB community composition in general and individual isolates or environmental clones in the Nitrosomonas oligotropha lineage in particular as bioindicators and biotracers of pollution or freshwater or wastewater input in coastal environments.

AB  - Identification of valid indicators of biodiversity is a critical need for sustainable forest management. We developed compositional, structural and functional indicators of biodiversity for five taxonomic groups-bryophytes, vascular plants, spiders, hoverflies and birds-using data from 44 Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantation forests in Ireland. The best structural biodiversity indicator was stand stage, defined using a multivariate classification of forest structure variables. However, biodiversity trends over the forest cycle and between tree species differ among the taxonomic groups studied. Canopy cover was the main structural indicator and affected other structural variables such as cover of lower vegetation layers. Other structural indicators included deadwood and distances to forest edge and to broadleaved woodland. Functional indicators included stand age, site environmental characteristics and management practices. Compositional indicators were limited to more easily identifiable plant and bird species. Our results suggest that the biodiversity of any one of the species groups we surveyed cannot act as a surrogate for all of the other species groups. However, certain subgroups, such as forest bryophytes and saproxylic hoverflies, may be able to act as surrogates for each other. The indicators we have identified should be used together to identify stands of potentially high biodiversity or to evaluate the biodiversity effects of silvicultural management practices. They are readily assessed by non-specialists, ecologically meaningful and applicable over a broad area with similar climate conditions and silvicultural systems. The approach we have used to develop biodiversity indicators, including stand structural types, is widely relevant and can enhance sustainable forest management of plantations.

AB  - The role of positive interactions is often crucial in communities with intense abiotic stress such as intertidal environments. Grasses acting as ecosystem engineers, for example, may ameliorate intertidal harsh physical conditions and modify the community structure. The mud snails Heleobia australis d'Orbigny frequently inhabit the SW Atlantic marshes, mainly associated to intertidal marsh plants (mainly the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel) probably due to the plant indirect effects. The purpose of this work was to investigate the magnitude of these association and the processes that generate the pattern. Samples of the snail abundance in six SW Atlantic coastal marshes show that H. australis is associated to coastal areas of low energy and low or none freshwater input. This result is important because this species is being used as bioindicator of coastal estuarine systems during the Holocene. Thus the paleontological interpretation based on this species should be revised. Within the studied areas, snails are associated to intertidal marsh plants. However, stable isotope analysis shows that neither plant nor their epiphytes are their main food sources. Field experiments show that snails actively select areas with plants, although tethering experiments show that plants do not provide shelter from predators. However, plants do buffer physical stress factors such as temperature, which generate important mortality outside plants covered areas. These positive interactions have large effects on H. australis distributions in marsh communities; increasing the habitats available for colonization and affecting their local distribution.

AB  - A 20 d seawater mesocosm experiment was conducted to study microbial loop and carbon cycling dynamics in 3 experimental systems of different trophic status. Two mesocosms were supplemented with phytoplankton (Phaeocystis in one mesocosm and diatoms in another). This report details the variations in bacterial community composition and in carbon utilization potential investigated via assays measuring the hydrolysis of complex polysaccharides and a simple peptide compound. The first half of the study period was dominated by bacterial growth and large shifts in community composition coinciding with utilization of the organic carbon present at the beginning of the experiment, as shown by hydrolysis of specific polysaccharides and drawdown of labile dissolved organic carbon. During the second half of the experiment, bacterioplankton abundance, composition, and enzymatic activities changed in response to the experimental treatments. Multiple correlation analyses implicated co-variation between rRNA gene DGGE phylotypes (e.g. Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and specific combinations of environmental parameters and carbon resources, indicating phylotypic specialization to the experimental mesocosm conditions. Similarly, hydrolysis of 3 polysaccharides (xylan, chondroitin, and Isochrysis extract) correlated significantly with particular phylotypes, providing evidence of species-specific influences on carbon utilization that varied temporally over the experiment period. Aminopeptidase activity mirrored biomass accumulation, as indicated by positive correlations (>0.80) with most biomass indicators determined. These results illustrate that combined molecular and biochemical analysis of active microbial communities can illuminate linkages between specific organisms and important ecosystem processes such as carbon utilization. Additionally, our findings show that trophic status was reflected in community composition and carbon utilization activities.

AB  - Many aquatic species use chemosensory information to assess predation risk. The cues used in such risk assessment can come either from. the predator (predator odour) or from injured prey (alarm cues). The information conveyed through chemicals may, however, be inaccurate both spatially and temporally, as chemicals may persist in the environment long after the predator is gone. Thus, the level of accuracy of the cues for risk assessment may depend on the persistency of the chemicals in the habitat. Here, we investigated the persistency of alarm cues of a larval amphibian, the woodfrog (Rana sylvatica) in a ephemeral pond, their natural habitat. We introduced either alarm cues or control water in enclosed sleeves (similar to 10 L) installed in the pond. The sleeve water was then sampled after 5 min and every two hours for eight hours. We used the behavioural response of woodfrog tadpoles to alarm cues as a bioassay to assess how long the alarm cues persisted in the environment. We found that tadpoles responded with an antipredator response to the pond water containing alarm cues 5 min after the injection of the cues in the sleeves but did not respond to that same pond water after two hours. Our results indicate that biodegradation and/or photodegradation of alarm cues in natural habitats might occur relatively quickly as the loss of a response to the cues in our experiment was independent of a dilution effect. This contrasts with previous laboratory results indicating that chemicals may be active after several hours.

AB  - "Indicator" slates have long been considered to represent a useful exploration guide for turbidite-hosted mesothermal lode gold mineralization in central Victoria. This assumption has been based on an apparent close spatial relationship between high gold grades and the proximity of thin, commonly pyritic and carbon-rich marker units, Detailed studies in a number of gold deposits throughout central Victoria, however, reveal that highest gold grades do not necessarily coincide with the presence of carbonaceous units. In many places where gold mineralization is associated with carbon-rich matter, the high C accumulations are the result of epigenetic remobilization during hydrothermal alteration and ore genesis. Petrographic, geochemical, and stable isotope IC. O, Si investigations into the origin and nature of the carbonaceous matter-mainly amorphous bitumens and pyrobitumen of organic origin, with biological fragments and rare graphite of both detrital and metamorphic origin-demonstrate that black shales within the Cambro-Ordovician succession ill central Victoria lacked the vital constituents to provide (1) a primary sink for precious metals, and (2) whereas the presence of carbonaceous matter was likely to affect the evolution of epigenetic hydrothermal fluids and, locally, may have facilitated gold enrichment, carbon-rich sedimentary rocks were not crucial for ore genesis on the deposit scale. Instead, the size of the hydrothermal cell, physicochemical conditions of the ascending fluids, and dynamic fault-valve behavior played far more significant roles in controlling gold precipitation. The importance of these processes has implications for exploration targeting sediment-hosted, lode- and disseminated-style gold mineralization in the western Lachlan orogen and in slate belt provinces elsewhere.

AB  - A study to test the use of hydrogeochemical methods for gold prospecting was carried out in the Osilo area, northern Sardinia. The study area, covering about 30 km(2), is characterised by Tertiary andesitic rocks. Gold concentrations up to several ppm, associated with abundant pyrite, arsenopyrite, stibnite, tetrahedrite and electrum, and subordinate galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite, are present in quartz veins associated with a polyphase, incipient and pervasive alteration of the andesitic rocks.
   Forty-eight water samples(17 streams, 29 springs and 2 boreholes) were analysed for Au and a wide range of major and trace elements, both in solution (< 0.4 mu m) and in suspension. Background values for dissolved Au were below the detection limit of the methods used (between 0.3 and 0.5 ng L(-1) Au). Gold concentrations in solution up to 3 ng L(-1) were found in waters draining the mineralised vein system. The observed dispersion of Au in surface waters was restricted to about 500 m from the auriferous veins. Dissolved Au anomalies do not vary significantly in water samples, taken monthly over a one year period, suggesting that the dispersion of Au is unaffected by seasonal conditions in the Osilo area. For samples where Au was detected both in solution and in suspension, the Au content of the suspended matter was usually lower than that in solution.
   The best indicators of Au mineralisation, apart from Au itself both in solution and in suspension, were As and Sb which showed a dispersion clearly related to the known auriferous veins.

AB  - Some steps of the soil nitrogen (N) cycle are sensitive to environmental pressures like soil moisture or contamination, which are expected to evolve during the next decades. Individual stresses have been well studied, but their combination is not yet documented. In this work, we aimed at assessing the importance of the soil moisture on the impact of copper (Cu) contaminations on the N cycling soil function using the potential nitrification activities (PNA) as bioindicator. A two-step experiment was performed. First, a loamy soil was incubated 5 weeks in either 30, 60, or 90% of its water holding capacity (WHC) or alternating drought and rewetting periods. Thereafter, soil samples were exposed to a gradient of Cu concentrations through a bioassay involving nitrification. The dose-response curves of PNA in function of added Cu were modeled to calculate the effective Cu concentrations, namely ECx with x being the percentage of PNA inhibition. These values were then compared between experimental conditions to highlight differences in threshold values. The preincubation moisture treatments significantly affected the PNA responses to the secondary Cu stress with, for instance, hormetic responses in all cases except for the dry-rewetting treatment. Small PNA inhibitions were estimated for high Cu doses in the soils with low water contents (30% WHC) or submitted to dry-rewetting cycles, contrarily to the patterns observed for the soils with high water contents (90% WHC) or submitted to a single period of drought. Overall, significant differences were found in estimated ECx values between moisture treatments.

AB  - Acid rain is a long-standing environmental issue that affects ecosystem properties. Great attempts have been made to clarify how acid rain affects soil physiochemical and microbial properties, but soil mechanical properties in response to acid rain conditions have rarely been investigated. This microcosm experiment was conducted to study how simulated acid rain (SAR) with different acidity levels would affect soil mechanical properties and the associated physiochemical indicators of three agricultural soils (Humic Acrisol, Haplic Ferralsol and Rhodic Ferralsol) with different soil properties. The results showed that the soil plasticity index was significantly decreased by the strongly acidic SAR treatments (pH < 3.5) for all the three soils, while the soil penetration resistance was not significantly changed by any of the SAR treatments. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses suggested that sand content with negligible changes under the SAR treatments contributed substantially to the stable soil penetration resistance. Furthermore, we observed that in comparison to the other two soils, the Haplic Ferralsol appeared to be more vulnerable to acid rain. Such a high sensitivity of the Haplic Ferralsol to the acid rain treatments might have been associated with its relatively poor soil structure and quality, which were indicated by a high sand content and low soil organic matter content. These results suggest that in comparison to high-quality soils, low-quality soils may have experienced greater stress under acid depositions, and the results highlight the necessity of studying in situ how soil mechanical properties would change under acid rain scenarios.

AB  - The productivity susceptibility analysis (PSA) is a widely used method to rapidly assess species risk to fishing activities in data-poor fisheries. A step in ecological risk assessments and used in data-poor assessment for sustainable fisheries certification programmes (e.g. MSC) and recommendation lists (e.g. Seafood Watch), the PSA is semi-quantitative, yet little attention has been given to the theoretical basis of this analysis. Current thresholds designating low-, medium- and high-risk categories divide the PSA plot by equal area, assuming area corresponds to likelihood. We show that plot area does not correspond to likelihood, however, and existing thresholds need revision due to the non-uniform distribution of vulnerability scores on the PSA plot. The probability of medium risk assignment increases with the number of attributes used to characterize productivity and susceptibility. Here, we present a novel and statistically robust method to derive vulnerability, where threshold values between the risk categories are adjusted with the number of attributes used in the assessment. Our comprehensive framework accounts for all variations in the method, including logarithmic scaling of axes, weighting of attributes and scoring procedures. Simulated results across a range of conditions and comparative evaluation of 302 species in five studies show that one-third of species may be re-categorized with the new PSA approach. Importantly, the existing PSA approach underestimates risk by up to 35% when compared with the new method. These findings have strong implications for management of data-poor fisheries. We recommend adoption of this approach to the PSA to better resolve species' risk.

KW  - SEVERITY INDEX
KW  - MODEL
KW  - PRECIPITATION
AB  - Drought is understood as both a lack of water (i.e., a deficit compared to demand) and a temporal anomaly in one or more components of the hydrological cycle. Most drought indices, however, only consider the anomaly aspect, i.e., how unusual the condition is. In this paper, we present two drought hazard indices that reflect both the deficit and anomaly aspects. The soil moisture deficit anomaly index, SMDAI, is based on the drought severity index, DSI (Cammalleri et al., 2016), but is computed in a more straightforward way that does not require the definition of a mapping function. We propose a new indicator of drought hazard for water supply from rivers, the streamflow deficit anomaly index, QDAI, which takes into account the surface water demand of humans and freshwater biota. Both indices are computed and analyzed at the global scale, with a spatial resolution of roughly 50 km, for the period 1981-2010, using monthly time series of variables computed by the global water resources and the model WaterGAP 2.2d. We found that the SMDAI and QDAI values are broadly similar to values of purely anomaly-based indices. However, the deficit anomaly indices provide more differentiated spatial and temporal patterns that help to distinguish the degree and nature of the actual drought hazard to vegetation health or the water supply. QDAI can be made relevant for stakeholders with different perceptions about the importance of ecosystem protection, by adapting the approach for computing the amount of water that is required to remain in the river for the well-being of the river ecosystem. Both deficit anomaly indices are well suited for inclusion in local or global drought risk studies.

AB  - A pit lake arises as a consequence of anthropogenic activities in opencast mining areas. These water bodies may be enriched in hazardous stable contaminants and/or in naturally occurring radionuclides depending on the local geological conditions. Mining legacy in Sweden produced hundreds of these pit lakes and most of them are used for recreational purposes in the southern part of the country. In this paper, one pit lake was selected for having enhanced levels of natural radionuclides. Physico-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen and depth), elemental composition (via Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and radiometric characterization (via alpha spectrometry of Ra-226, Po-210 and Pb-210) were carried along the depth of a 60 m depth pit lake, with the main aim to describe how natural radionuclides and elements behaves with depth in a non-uraniferous pit lake.
   Based on observed changes in physico-chemical parameters, a thermocline and a chemocline region were identified at around 10 and 30 m depth respectively. Concerning radionuclides, Ra-226 ranged from 75 +/- 3 up to 360 +/- 12 mBq/kg while Po-210 ranged from 11 +/- 1 up to 71 +/- 3 mBq/kg. Pb-210 distribution with depth was also determined via secular equilibrium with Po-210 after 2 years and also stable Pb was measured. Disequilibrium Ra-226-Pb-210 was found and the residence time of Pb-210 in the water column was assessed. Additionally, different vertical distributions between Pb-210 and Pb were found which points out different sources for different lead isotopes in the water body.

AB  - Gastropod mollusks have achieved an eminent importance as biological indicators of environmental quality. In the present study, we applied a multibiomarker approach to evaluate its applicability for the pond snailLymnaea stagnalis, exposed to common industrial and agricultural pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations. The snails were exposed to copper (Cu2+, 10 mu g L-1), zinc (Zn2+, 130 mu g L-1), cadmium (Cd2+, 15 mu g L-1), or the thiocarbamate fungicide "Tattoo" (91 mu g L-1) during 14 days. Metal treatment and exposure to "Tattoo" caused variable patterns of increase or decrease of metal levels in the digestive gland, with a clear accumulation of only Cd and Zn after respective metal exposure. Treatment with Cu and "Tattoo" caused an increase of cytochrome P450-related EROD activity. GlutathioneS-transferase was inhibited by exposure to Cu, Zn, and "Tattoo." Treatment with the "Tattoo" led to an inhibition of cholinesterase activity, whereas Cu and Cd increased its activity. Caspase-3 activity was enhanced by up to 3.3 times in all treatments. A nearly uniform inhibitory effect for oxidative stress response parameters was observed in all kinds of exposure, revealing an inhibition of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) activity, a depression of glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and of protein carbonyl levels. Pollutant-specific effects were observed for the catalase activity, superoxide anion production, and lipid peroxidation levels. Due to the high response sensitivity ofLymnaea stagnalisto chemical impacts, we suggest our study as a contribution for biomarker studies with this species under field conditions. Graphic

AB  - Watershed data, climate and stable data collected over a 16-year period from a network of 50 lakes in northeastern Alberta, are provided to allow for broader incorporation into regional assessments of environmental impacts, particularly hydrologic and geochemical processes under changing climate and land use development. Oxygen-18 and deuterium analyses of water samples are provided from late summer surveys of 50 lakes with varying land cover and permafrost conditions. Six sub-groups of lakes are represented, including Stony Mountains, West Fort McMurray, Northeast Fort McMurray, Birch Mountains, Caribou Mountains and Shield. This dataset includes 1582 isotopic analyses made on 791 water samples and 3164 isotope mass balance model outputs, as well as 800 lake/watershed parameters, 5600 climate parameters, and 800 modelled values for isotopic composition of precipitation used in the computations. Model data are provided to facilitate evaluation of transferability of the model for other applications, and to permit more sophisticated spatial analysis and intercomparison with geochemical and biological datasets. Details and further discussion on the isotope mass balance approach are provided in "Regional trends in water balance and runoff to fifty boreal lakes: a 16-year isotope mass balance assessment including evaluation of hydrologic drivers" [1]. Overall, the data are expected to be useful, in comparison with local and regional datasets, for water resource management and planning, including design of monitoring networks and environmental impact assessments for oil sands projects.

AB  - The resistance of economically important crops to abiotic environmental stresses can be increased by overexprescion of genes associated with the adaptation of plants to adverse factors. Most adaptive reactions in plants are aimed at stabilizing and protecting cellular structures by synthesizing compounds with osmoprotective properties. Metabolic, adaptation through the accumulation of compatible osmolytes is considered as one of the main strategies for the protection and survival of plants in extreme conditions. The purpose of the work is an experimental verification of the hypothesis of the ability of the bacterial codA cholinoxidase gene to weaken the sensitivity of plants to the toxic effect of aluminum in acidic soil. The object of the study is tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L.) with the codA gene responsible for the synthesis of glycine betaine, a compatible osmolyte that helps stabilize cells under abiotic stresses. Samsun tobacco and the independent transgenic lines CodA7 (codA (-)) and CodA17 (codA(+)) were grown in a pot culture on a peat-humus soil mixture (control) and on natural acidic sod-podzolic soil with aluminum (stress). A comparative assessment of the reaction of the initial variety and transgenic lines was carried out according to morphometric indicators, characteristics of antioxidant protection, and the content of photosynthetic pigments. There was no decrease in CodA17 sensitivity to increased soil acidity and aluminum toxicity. The lack of a protective effect of the introduced construct with the codA gene can be explained by the accumulation of glycine betaine in the leaves, while the oxidative stress caused by aluminum is associated mainly with the roots of the plant.

AB  - Due to the extensive presence of phthalate esters (PAEs) in the environment, it is very important to develop highly efficient methods for determining their environmental concentrations and for risk assessment. In this study, europium (Eu3+) and samarium (Sm3+) were employed as fluorescent labels to develop a dual-labeled time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) for the sensitive detection of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in aquatic environments. Under optimum conditions, the half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) and limit of detection (LOD, IC10) of the TRFIA were 28.1 and 4.9 ng/mL for DEP, and 33.4 and 3.9 ng/mL for DBP, respectively. The cross-reactivities of the TRFIA between these two phthalates and with their analogues were negligible. The proposed method indicated satisfactory accuracy with recoveries of 78.30-120.13% for DEP and 78.58-113.07% for DBP, which were in good agreement with the gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis results of the same samples. Meanwhile, the results of the immunoassay were used to evaluate the presence and environmental risk of those pollutants in the inner rivers of Zhenjiang city. The concentrations of DEP and DBP ranged from non-detectable to 61.31 ng/mL and from non-detectable to 94.57 ng/mL, respectively. The results of the potential ecological risk assessment by the risk quotient method showed that there were some sampling points exceeding risk limits, and the total ecological risk of DBP was higher than that of DEP.

AB  - The region of Cobalt in Ontario, Canada has been affected by arsenic (As) and trace metals contamination since the early twentieth century due to unconfined dumping of high As-containing tailings. The concentrations of total dissolved As in lakes and streams have exceeded Canadian drinking water quality guidelines. The present study was focused on the examination of conditions that could influence chemical transformations of As(III) to As(V) and As speciation in lakes and stream waters and sediment of this area, as toxicity and mobility differ between different forms of As. Laboratory results showed that the stability of As(III) is strongly influenced by temperature, light, the presence of nitrate and chloride and by pH. The study shows that although total As concentrations were relatively high in the water samples collected in the area, As(V) was the predominant species in almost all water samples, and the most toxic form of As (III) was low, often < 1% of total dissolved. The concentrations of total and bioavailable As in sediment/tailing core samples of two studied lakes varied greatly with the depth and sampling sites, but the extracted form was generally in a lower proportion (< 35%). Iron oxides and organic matter likely play an important role in As transformation and mobilization in the sediment. Field observations showed a partial recovery of the two lakes where the ecosystem has adapted to the tailings. The presence of fish communities in both high As-containing lake invites the questions on whether As (III) should be a more appropriate parameter than total As in eco-toxicity and environmental assessments.

AB  - Microorganisms play a significant role in mineral precipitation, but detecting them in the fossil record is still a challenge. Here we offer an example of how the detection of biological activity in the sedimentary environment can modify a classical depositional model. This study describes the activity of microorganisms in sedimentary structures and the iron mineral formation during the last Paleozoic Ice Age in southwestern Gondwana, recorded by the "Itu rhythmites", Parana Basin, Brazil. The Itu rhythmites have been considered to be varve-type deposits that present alternating dark laminae (clay/silt-size sediments) and light layers (sand/gravel-size sediments) of varied thickness, forming couplets. Earlier studies focused on abiotic processes of these structures. We applied different techniques and analytical approaches were used, such as synchrotron-based techniques and rock magnetic techniques, in order to test the biogenicity of iron minerals contained in putative microbially-induced sedimentary structures. By detecting biominerals in this rock succession, the depositional model had to be reconsidered, taking into account the biological activity, the limitations on the specific conditions for bacterial growth, and for mineral precipitation. Therefore, we offer a new depositional model that considers the role of microorganisms in formation of these laminae, and this model can be considered for other iron-rich rhythmic deposits in other places of the world. Considering the effects of temperature and other factors in the bacterial productivity, the deposition of the latest couplets in the outcrop occurred in different seasons and by different depositional processes, corroborating with the non-periodicity of 1 year per lithological couplet.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as risk markers for environmental stress are widely used to predict changes in the health and fitness of many animals exposed to pollutants. However, from the perspective of protecting declining amphibians, it remains to be verified which one would be a reliable indicator for amphibians exposed to long-term heavy metal pollution under natural conditions. In this study, the OS and FA of Bufo raddei exposed to natural heavy metal pollution were analyzed to determine which marker is more accurate for indicating heavy metal-induced stress. Three years of data were collected during the breeding season of B. raddei from Baiyin (BY), which has been mainly contaminated with Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd compounds for a long period, and from Liujiaxia (LJX), which is a relatively unpolluted area. Unexpectedly, although significant accumulation of the four heavy metals was found in the kidney and liver of B. raddei from BY, the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde in these two organs were found to be irregular, with low repeatability in both BY and LJX. However, significant differences in the levels of FA were observed in B. raddei populations from these two areas over the past 3 years (P < 0.01). The degrees of FA in B. raddei populations from BY and LJX were assessed as degree 4 and 1, respectively. In short, this study suggested that FA was a more reliable and effective indicator than OS to monitor and predict long-term environmental stress on anuran amphibians.

AB  - A lake sediment record from the north-eastern European Russian Arctic was examined using palaeolimnological methods, including subfossil chironomid and diatom analysis. The objective of this study is to disentangle environmental history of the lake and climate variability during the past 2000years. The sediment profile was divided into two main sections following changes in the lithology, separating the limno-telmatic phase between similar to 2000 and 1200cal. yr BP and the lacustrine phase between similar to 1200cal. yr BP and the present. Owing to the large proportion of semi-terrestrial chironomids and poor modern analogues, a reliable chironomid-based temperature reconstruction for the limno-telmatic phase was not possible. However, the lacustrine phase showed gradually cooling climate conditions from similar to 1200cal. yr BP until similar to 700cal. yr BP. The increase in stream chironomids within this sediment section indicates that this period may also have had increased precipitation that caused the adjacent river to overflow, subsequently transporting chironomids to the lacustrine basin. After a short-lived warm phase at similar to 700cal. yr BP, the climate again cooled, and a progressive climate warming trend was evident from the most recent sediment samples, where the biological assemblages seem to have experienced an eutrophication-like response to climate warming. The temperature reconstruction showed more similarities with the climate development in the Siberian side of the Urals than with northern Europe. This study provides a characteristic archive of arctic lake ontogeny and a valuable temperature record from a remote climate-sensitive area of northern Russia.

AB  - The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Delta) is the confluence of two major watersheds draining the Western Sierra Nevada mountains into the Central Valley of California, ultimately terminating into San Francisco Bay. We sampled 88 sites once a month for two years (2006-2008) over 87 separate sampling events for a total of 1740 samples. Water samples were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, enterococci and fecal coliforms), and 53 other physiochemical, land use, and environmental characteristics. The purpose of the study was to create a baseline of microbial water quality in the Delta and to identify various factors (climatic, land use, tidal, etc.) that were associated with elevated concentrations of indicator bacteria. Fecal indicator bacteria generally had weak to modest relationships to environmental conditions; the strength and direction of which varied for each microbial indicator, drainage region, and across seasons. Measured and unmeasured, site-specific effects accounted for large portions of variance in model predictions (p = 0.086 to 0.255), indicating that spatial auto correlation was a major component of water quality outcomes. The effects of tidal cycling and lack of connectivity between waterways and surrounding landscapes likely contributed to the lack of association between local land uses and microbial outcomes, though weak associations may also be indicative of mismatched spatiotemporal scales. The complex nature of this system necessitates continued monitoring and regular updates to statistical models designed to predict microbial water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There has been a surge of interest by geographers in contemporary South African small towns. This paper reports on the sale of municipal land in small towns from 1974 to 2014 in selected municipalities of the Western Cape. Attention is focused on the sale of municipal golf courses as an example of privatized municipal land that has not contributed to undoing apartheid spatial legacies or integrating small-town communities. The rate of municipal land sales increased appreciably after the introduction of the neoliberal Growth Employment and Redistribution macro-economic strategy in South Africa. Neoliberal processes have adapted to local conditions and morphed into what is known as the Third Way: essentially a marriage between the neoliberal agenda and postapartheid egalitarian principles. The divisive nature of privatized, once municipally owned, spaces is supposed to be offset by investment in social development funds for some small towns. It is intended that these funds be managed by municipalities and spent on projects identified in the Integrated Development Plan. Documentation of environmental impact assessments of privatized golf courses provides insights into the logic of the privatization of small-town municipal golf courses and the addition of residential components to them. It is concluded that the secure, gated and fortified housing spaces of the golf estates are aimed at the monied classes and have become enclaves of wealth within the broader small-town milieu. The developmental dilemma is that while municipalities may benefit from such land sales and their subsequent revenues, socio-spatial integrative opportunities are being sacrificed for monetary gain.

AB  - The paper presents the results of a research project aiming at determining the economic value of selected ecosystem services in the Eastern Ore Mountains. The use of the dynamically evolving concept of economic services, used to identify economically utilisable services provided by undamaged ecosystems, can thus contribute to dealing with the issues of optimum landscape management. The primary data collection took place in the summer of 2013; a total of 216 questionnaires were collected. The research focused on three ecosystems, namely montane meadows, clearance cairns and quasi-natural mountain streams. The paper presents and discusses primarily the results of a choice experiment that was used to determine the willingness to pay for defined changes in the ecosystems examined. The research showed that visitors to the Eastern Ore Mountains unambiguously prefer a natural (authentic) or quasi-natural condition of the landscape and that people are able to distinguish among the different situations well (e.g., different appearance of montane meadows, mountain streams, clearance cairns, etc.). People prefer montane meadows scythed without farm animals, clearance cairns not overgrown, and streams with a quasi-natural character. The authors point out the finding that the research results indicate a strong connection of the local population to the local landscape and ecosystems, the potential of which in relation to nature protection and landscape management is totally unutilised at the moment. Special attention is paid to a specific ecosystem, not studied yet in the Czech Republic - the clearance cairns, which showed (contrary to expectations) a noticeably higher willingness to pay for their good management compared to the other ecosystems examined.

AB  - The antioxidant responses in saplings of Tibouchina pulchra (a native tree from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest) exposed around an oil refinery in the city of Cubatao (SE Brazil), varied during the exchange of its power generation source, from boilers fueled with oil to a thermoelectric fueled with natural gas. The redox potential changed in response to an interaction of air pollution and meteorological parameters, indicating that the pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance was not reached after the exchange of the power generation system. The gain in environmental quality in the region was not achieved as expected due the technological modernization, at least relative to oxidative stressors. These conclusions were based on results of analyses of enzymatic antioxidants: superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR); non-enzymatic antioxidants: reduced, oxidized and total ascorbic acid (AsA, DHA, totAA) and glutathione (GSH, GSSG, totG), their redox state (AsA/totAA and GSH/totG) and an indicator of lipid peroxidation (MDA). We also applied exploratory multivariate statistics in order to verify if the temporal sequence of changes in the plant redox capacity coincided with changes in the profile of air pollution, climatic conditions or with their interactions and if the environmental benefits that would supposedly be promoted by the mentioned exchange of power generation system were achieved in the region.

AB  - We present a social-ecological framework to provide insight into climate adaptation strategies and diverse perspectives on interventions in protected areas for species experiencing climate-induced impacts. To develop this framework, we examined the current ecological condition of a culturally and commercially valuable species, considered the predicted future effects of climate change on that species in a protected area, and assessed the perspectives held by forest users and managers on future adaptive practices. We mapped the distribution of yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) and examined its health status in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve by comparing forest structure, tree stress-indicators, and associated thermal regimes between forests inside the park and forests at the current latitudinal limit of the species dieback. Yellow-cedar trees inside the park were healthy and relatively unstressed compared to trees outside the park that exhibited reduced crown fullness and increased foliar damage. Considering risk factors for mortality under future climate scenarios, our vulnerability model indicated future expected dieback occurring within park boundaries. Interviews with forest users and managers revealed strong support for increasing monitoring to inform interventions outside protected areas, improving management collaboration across land designations, and using a portfolio of interventions on actively managed lands. Study participants who perceived humans as separate from nature were more opposed to interventions in protected areas. Linking social and ecological analyses, our study provides an interdisciplinary approach to identify system-specific metrics (e.g., stress indicators) that can better connect monitoring with management, and adaptation strategies for species impacted by climate change.

AB  - Prescribed fire and timber harvest are anthropogenic disturbances that modify resource availability and ecosystem structure, and can affect wildlife both directly and indirectly. Terrestrial salamanders are effective indicators of forest health due to their high abundance and sensitivity to microclimatic conditions. Given their ecological importance, it is critical to understand how forest salamanders respond to management-related disturbances. We predicted that timber harvest and prescribed fire would decrease salamander abundance and availability, and increase salamander cover object use. We surveyed for southern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon serratus) over 9 sampling periods from 2010 to 2014 in a Missouri Ozark (USA) forest, and used binomial mixture models to estimate abundance and detectability in a large-scale Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) experiment. Five replicate 5-ha units were randomly assigned to each treatment (prescribed burn, shelterwood harvest, midstory herbicide) and control. We compared abundance, surface activity, detectability, and microhabitat use among treatments. Abundance and surface activity decreased post-treatment in shelterwood, midstory, and burn units. Abundance estimates in midstory and burn units rebounded in the second post-treatment year but declined further in shelterwood harvest units. Overall, treatments had stronger effects on salamander availability than on actual abundance. We also found a higher proportion of salamanders under cover objects after prescribed fire, further illustrating the importance of accounting for imperfect detectability. Our findings foster a more robust understanding of the mechanisms underlying population-level responses to management practices, ultimately increasing our ability to manage terrestrial salamanders effectively.

AB  - Crop simulation models have emerged as powerful tools for estimating yield gaps, forecasting production of agricultural crops and analysing the impact of climate change. In this study, the genetic coefficients for Bt hybrids established from field experiments were used in the InfoCrop-cotton model, which was calibrated and validated earlier to simulate the cotton production under different agro-climatic conditions. The model simulated results for Bt hybrids were satisfactory with an R-2 value of 0.55 (n = 22), d value of 0.85 and a root mean square error of 277 kg ha(-1), which was 11.2% of the mean observed. Relative yield index (RYI) defined as the ratio between simulated rainfed (water-limited) yield to potential yield, was identified as a robust land quality index for rainfed cotton. RYI was derived for 16 representative benchmark (BM) locations of the black soil region from long-term simulation results of InfoCrop-cotton model (based on 11-40 years of weather data). The model could satisfactorily capture subtle differences in soil variables and weather patterns prevalent in the BM locations spread over 16 agro-ecological sub-regions (AESRs) resulting in a wide range of mean simulated rainfed cotton yields (482-4393 kg ha(-1)). The BM soils were ranked for their suitability for cotton cultivation based on RYI. The RYI of black soils (vertisols) ranged from 0.07 in Nimone to 0.80 in Panjari representing AESR (6.1) and AESR (10.2) respectively, suggesting that Panjri soils are better suited for rainfed cotton.

AB  - Success of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project will be evaluated in part by monitoring populations of wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). These two waterbird guilds were integral components of the pre-channelization river-floodplain ecosystem, and both declined substantially following channelization. Restoration is expected to attract wading birds and waterfowl by reintroducing naturally fluctuating water levels, seasonal hydroperiods, and historic vegetation communities. Post-construction aerial surveys (November 2001 to May 2008) within the Phase I restoration area indicate that the abundance and species richness of both wading birds and waterfowl have shown a positive restoration response thus far. Dry season abundance of aquatic wading birds and waterfowl has exceeded restoration expectations (30.6birds/km2 and 3.9birds/km2, respectively) each year since the completion of restoration Phase I in 2001. While there has been a significant positive restoration effect on waterfowl abundance, waterfowl species richness (n=6) has not yet reached the restoration expectation of 13 species. Abundance of the terrestrial cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), which increased dramatically after the majority of floodplain wetlands were converted to cattle pastures in the channelized system, has shown a significant negative response to restoration. It is anticipated that completion of the remaining phases of restoration (II/III), and implementation of the Kissimmee River Headwaters Revitalization water regulation schedule by 2019, will further increase and improve habitat for wading birds and waterfowl by reestablishing floodplain hydrology that more closely mimics historical conditions.

AB  - Dust and metal deposition are of important significance as an indicator of local air quality. However, their vertical deposition characteristics at greater heights are not well known. Settling dust samples were collected at four heights and at both sides of a 40 meters high building next to a busy urban road in Budapest, Hungary. In this study, concentrations and monthly deposition rates of nine elements are (Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr, Zn) evaluated. The study site can be characterized by average settling dust load showing a slight seasonal variation. Highest contamination was found for Cu, Pb and Zn. The sources of these metals could be the traffic and the weathering of materials of the built environment. The enrichment of these metals is generally the highest at the road-side of the building and at lower sampling heights, but Pb and Zn may show strong enrichment even at 33 m and at the low-traffic side of the building. This is generally the highest in the dry and windy periods suggesting the dominance of the resuspension of urban soil and road dust in the metal deposition. The vertical dust and metal deposition patterns mostly correspond to the supposed air-flow model but just in case of highest chance of resuspension a special model is needed to clearly describe the deposition patterns. This is probably due to the simultaneous effect of weather conditions and the morphology of natural and built environment.

AB  - The loss of species is an ongoing process threatening the services provided by ecosystems for humanity. In agricultural areas, which globally occupy the largest areas, species diversity is strongly dependent on the farmers' management. If management allows for a landscape structure with many remnants of natural or semi-natural vegetation, the diversity and amount of flora and fauna is higher compared to intensive agricultural landscapes with large, continuous field parcels and a low crop variety. Knowledge of agricultural management is crucial for the development and monitoring of political strategies that aim to enhance or conserve species in agricultural areas. Remote sensing is a cost effective way to acquire this knowledge for large spatial areas with high temporal resolution. Since 2008, modern satellite-based radar sensors deliver images of unprecedented high quality. Since the acquisition of radar images is not restricted by atmospheric conditions, it is very capable of multitemporal classifications. In the presented study, possibilities for supervised multitemporal classification of non crop areas are investigated based on TerraSAR-X images and two different classifiers (Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest). The best results were achieved for the classification of woody structures where producer's accuracies are above 80%. Despite lower values for the other classes (flower strips 75%, grasslands 75.8% and herbaceous 57%), these classes are easily recognized. This is illustrated by different map examples. The presented results can contribute essentially to the monitoring, investigation and increasing of habitat structures in agricultural areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Flocculent material (floc) is an important energy source in wetlands. In the Florida Everglades, floc is present in both freshwater marshes and coastal environments and plays a key role in food webs and nutrient cycling. However, not much is known about its environmental dynamics, in particular its biological sources and bio-reactivity. We analysed floc samples collected from different environments in the Florida Everglades and applied biomarkers and pigment chemotaxonomy to identify spatial and seasonal differences in organic matter sources. An attempt was made to link floc composition with algal and plant productivity. Spatial differences were observed between freshwater marsh and estuarine floc. Freshwater floc receives organic matter inputs from local periphyton mats, as indicated by microbial biomarkers and chlorophyll-a estimates. At the estuarine sites, the floc is dominated by mangrove as well as diatom inputs from the marine end-member. The hydroperiod (duration and depth of inundation) at the freshwater sites influences floc organic matter preservation, where the floc at the short-hydroperiod site is more oxidised likely due to periodic dry-down conditions. Seasonal differences in floc composition were not consistent and the few that were observed are likely linked to the primary productivity of the dominant biomass (periphyton in the freshwater marshes and mangroves in the estuarine zone). Molecular evidence for hydrological transport of floc material from the freshwater marshes to the coastal fringe was also observed. With the on-going restoration of the Florida Everglades, it is important to gain a better understanding of the biogeochemical dynamics of floc, including its sources, transformations and reactivity.

AB  - Unsuitable agricultural practices can cause loss in soil quality and erodibility to thus increase or trigger desertification under Mediterranean conditions. A field experiment was performed at the El Teularet-Sierra de Enguera Experimental Station (eastern Spain) to assess the influence during a 5-yr period of different agricultural practices on physical and chemical indicators of soil quality (total and water-soluble carbohydrates, glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP), total organic carbon, aggregate stability (AS), vegetation cover and soil erosion). The management practices included residual herbicide use, ploughing, ploughing + oats, addition of oat straw mulch and a control (land abandonment). Adjacent soil under natural vegetation was used as a reference for local, high-quality soil and as a control for comparison with the agricultural soils under different management practices. Oat straw mulching led to higher levels of water-soluble carbohydrates, GRSP and AS and lower soil erosion rates, resulting in values similar to those in the soil under native vegetation. The lowest levels of carbohydrates and GRSP were for the plots that were treated with herbicide or were ploughed. The maintenance of and increases in stable aggregates promoted by the different agricultural management practices over the years were attributed to increases in labile organic fractions such as carbohydrates and to the GRSP content. The results demonstrate that land abandonment (control plot) or the use of a cover (plants or straw) contributes to increases in soil quality and reduces the risk of erosion. The research also shows that sustainable agricultural management allows soil to recover and that the use of straw mulching is the most effective management strategy.

AB  - Fish parasites are used to monitor long-term change in finfish grouper mariculture in Indonesia. A total of 210 Epinephelus fuscoguttatus were sampled in six consecutive years between 2003/04 and 2008/09 and examined for parasites. The fish were obtained from floating net cages of a commercially run mariculture facility that opened in 2001. The fauna was species rich, consisting of ten ecto-and 18 endoparasite species. The ectoparasite diversity and composition was relatively stable, with the monogeneans Pseudorhabdosynochus spp. (83-100% prevalence, Berger-Parker Index of 0.82-0.97) being the predominant taxon. Tetraphyllidean larvae Scolex pleuronectis and the nematodes Terranova sp. and Raphidascaris sp. 1 were highly abundant in 2003/04-2005/06 (max. prevalence S. pleuronectis 40%, Terranova sp. 57%, Raphidascaris sp. 1 100%), and drastically reduced until 2008/09. These parasites together with the prevalence of Trichodina spp., ecto-/endoparasite ratio and endoparasite diversity illustrate a significant change in holding conditions over the years. This can be either referred to a definite change in management methods such as feed use and fish treatment, or a possible transition of a relatively undisturbed marine environment into a more affected habitat. By visualizing all parameters within a single diagram, we demonstrate that fish parasites are useful bioindicators to monitor long-term change in Indonesian grouper mariculture. This also indicates that groupers can be used to monitor environmental change in the wild. Further taxonomic and systematic efforts in less sampled regions significantly contributes to this new application, supporting fish culture and environmental impact monitoring also in other tropical marine habitats.

AB  - Estuaries serve as nursery grounds for many marine fish species. However increasing human activities within estuaries and surrounding areas lead to significant habitat loss for the juveniles and decrease the quality of the remaining habitats. This study is based on the data of 470 beam trawls from surveys that were conducted in 13 French estuaries for the purpose of the European Water Framework Directive. It aimed at testing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the nursery function of estuaries. With a multispecific approach based on ecological guilds, two fish metrics, abundance and species richness of Marine juvenile migrant fishes, were used as proxies for the estuarine nursery function. Indices of heavy metal and organic contaminations were used to estimate anthropogenic disturbances impacting these estuaries. Fish metrics were described with statistical models that took into account: (a) sampling protocol, (b) estuarine features and (c) contamination. The results of these models showed that the fish metrics highly depend on the sampling protocol, and especially type of gear, depth and salinity, which highlights the necessity of considering such metrics at the sampling (trawl haul) scale. Densities and species richness of Marine juvenile fishes appeared to be strongly and negatively correlated to contamination indices. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that human disturbances impact the nursery function of estuaries. Finally, the densities of Marine juvenile migrant species appeared as a potential robust and useful fish indicator for the assessment of the ecological status of estuaries within the Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Natural resources models serve as important tools to support decision making by predicting environmental indicators. All model predictions have uncertainty associated with them. Model predictive uncertainty, often expressed as the confidence interval around a model prediction value, may serve as important supplementary information for assisting decision making processes. In this article, we describe a new method called Dual Monte Carlo (DMC) to calculate model predictive uncertainty based on input parameter uncertainty. DMC uses two Monte Carlo sampling loops, which enable model users to not only calculate the model predictive uncertainty for selected input parameter sets of particular interest, but also to examine the predictive uncertainty as a function of model inputs across the full range of parameter space. We illustrate the application of DMC to the process-based, rainfall event-driven Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM). The results demonstrate that DMC effectively generated model predictive uncertainty from input parameter uncertainty and provided information that could be useful for decision making. We found that for the model RHEM, the uncertainty intervals were strongly correlated to specific model input and output parameter values, yielding regression relationships (r(2) > 0.97) that enable accurate estimation of the uncertainty interval for any point in the input parameter space without the need to run the Monte Carlo simulations each time the model is used. Soil loss predictions and their associated uncertainty intervals for three example storms and three site conditions are used to illustrate how DMC can be a useful tool for directing decision making.

AB  - Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas that is produced in different subsurface environments. Its main biological sink, microbial CH4 oxidation, can be quantified in situ in the vadose zone using gas push-pull tests (GPPTs). This field method is based on the comparison of breakthrough curves of the reactant CH4 and a nonreactive tracer. Under diffusion-dominated transport conditions, previously employed noble gases are unsuitable as tracers to calculate rate constants for CH4 oxidation due to differing diffusion coefficients. Here, we show that by performing two consecutive GPPTs and coinjecting acetylene (C2H2) as an inhibitor of CH4 oxidation in the second test, the reactant CH4 can be used as a substitute tracer. Applying this procedure, apparent first-order rate constants for CH4 oxidation ranging from 0.38 to 0.82 h(-1) were obtained in the vadose zone of three hummocks in an alpine peat bog near Lucerne, Switzerland. Corresponding estimates of in situ rates ranged from 4 to 299 ng CH4 g dry weight(-1) h(-1). In all but one GPPT, strong stable carbon isotope fractionation due to diffusion masked isotope fractionation due to microbial oxidation. Therefore, stable carbon isotope fractionation is suitable only to a limited extent as an indicator of microbial CH4 oxidation during a GPPT with diffusion-dominated gas transport. In contrast, the presented procedure for the quantification of microbial CH4 oxidation using GPPTs can be applied without restrictions even in systems with high porosity. Furthermore, the presented method may be useful for quantifying other processes for which suitable inhibitors but no suitable tracers are available.

AB  - Increasing pea (Pisum sativum) seed nutritional value and particularly seed protein content, while maintaining yield, is an important challenge for further development of this crop. Seed protein content and yield are complex and unstable traits, integrating all the processes occurring during the plant life cycle. During filling, seeds are the main sink to which assimilates are preferentially allocated at the expense of vegetative organs. Nitrogen seed demand is satisfied partly by nitrogen acquired by the roots, but also by nitrogen remobilized from vegetative organs. In this study, we evaluated the respective roles of nitrogen source capacity and sink strength in the genetic variability of seed protein content and yield. We showed in eight genotypes of diverse origins that both the maximal rate of nitrogen accumulation in the seeds and nitrogen source capacity varied among genotypes. Then, to identify the genetic factors responsible for seed protein content and yield variation, we searched for quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed traits and for indicators of sink strength and source nitrogen capacity. We detected 261 QTL across five environments for all traits measured. Most QTL for seed and plant traits mapped in clusters, raising the possibility of common underlying processes and candidate genes. In most environments, the genes Le and Afila, which control internode length and the switch between leaflets and tendrils, respectively, determined plant nitrogen status. Depending on the environment, these genes were linked to QTL of seed protein content and yield, suggesting that source-sink adjustments depend on growing conditions.

AB  - The Riverstrahler model of ecological functioning of large drainage networks validated on the Seine river system has been used for calculating the seasonal variations of Production and Respiration at various spatial scales (e.g. according to river orders). Based on the measurements of biological processes, the P/R ratio has led to an evaluation of the "ecological functioning", beyond the notion of "good ecological status". Furthermore, the effects, on the P/R ratio, of the geomorphological and climate factors characterizing the Hydro-Eco-Regions (HER) of the Seine watershed have been quantitatively explored with the model. Whereas one finds a typical upstream-downstream pattern of the P/R ratio variations under the traditional rural conditions that prevailed in the Seine basin until the end of the 18th century, this pattern is strongly affected by the changes in urban populations and the implementation of wastewater collection and treatment, more than by the specificity of the physical factors characterizing the different HER. We have also found that autotrophy (a P/R ratio >1) might leads to eutrophication symptoms when P exceeds 1-2 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and that heterotrophy of the system (P/R ratio< 1) would reveal organic pollution when R exceeds 1-2 mg C m-2 d(-1), stocks and fluxes of organic matter being expressed in carbon unit.
   Consequently, the P/R ratio appears as a good indicator of the perturbations caused by human activities in the watershed. The Riverstrahler model is able to quantify this effect. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The Eastern Mediterranean Sea hosts several deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) such as the Bannock, L'Atalante, Discovery, and Urania which, due to strong salinity gradients, have a limited exchange with the overlying seawater. In the present study, a series of environmental variables associated with the origin and quality of organic matter were thoroughly investigated in an attempt to understand the function of these unique ecosystems. The redox potential of sediments collected from the brines as well as from reference sites varied from -136 to 543 mV and salinity varied from 38 to 380 psu. Principal component analysis of chemical characteristics, including salinity, redox potential, organic carbon and nitrogen content, and C/N ratio grouped the sediments into two major clusters according to their redox state. Aliphatic hydrocarbon analysis revealed that the organic matter in the DHABs was predominantly of terrestrial origin but there was also evidence for petroleum inputs and for organic matter of phototrophic origin. Phospholipid linked fatty acids (PLFA) which were employed to assess the composition of microbial communities were found in greater abundance in stations situated inside the anoxic basins providing also strong evidence for the presence of methanotrophs and sulfate reducers. These results may represent an enhanced preservation of organic matter and an accumulation of microorganisms in these extreme environments. Heterogeneity in microbial community fatty acid profiles was documented between the anoxic sediments and the oxic and suboxic stations. However there were no significant correlations between PLFA and organic matter parameters. Redox conditions appear to influence microbial community composition, highlighting the role of the redox state as a regulator of organic matter preservation and microbial community accumulations in these ancient hypersaline anoxic lakes.

AB  - Fish community metrics and diversity indices have often been proposed as indicators to support an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. The response of eight fish community indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort was studied by comparing the rate of change in (i) areas subject to different levels (high, medium, and low) of fishing effort and (ii) areas inside and outside a closed area (the plaice box) where management measures led to changes in fishing effort over time. Several indicators showed broadly consistent responses to fishing effort (slope of the biomass-size spectra, mean weight, and mean maximum length) while a range of biodiversity indices and biomass did not. The response of the indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort showed that, with the exception of the slope of the biomass-size spectra, none of the indicators reliably detected the effects of spatial management measures at the scales of time and space that were used for these analyses. While some of the size-based indicators we tested did provide evidence for fishing impacts on communities, the response of the indicators to fishing was not straightforward and may have depended on environmental conditions and historic fishing regimes. Therefore, the indicators would provide limited support for assessing the effects of short-term and small-scale management actions and must be applied with caution until we have an improved theoretical understanding of their response to fishing and the environment.

AB  - Lesotho has only one wetland designated as a Ramsar site, found at Letseng-la-Letsie, which is located within the Maloti-Drakensberg region. Despite its designation as a wetland of international importance, little is known about its ecology and biodiversity. Information on wetland biodiversity is crucial for monitoring and conservation planning. This study investigated the vegetation-environment relationships in the Letseng-la-Letsie Wetland, Lesotho. Vegetation and environmental data were collected using the Braun-Blanquet approach and standard methods, respectively. The data were analysed using cluster analysis and ordination techniques. The study recorded a total of 68 plant species from 50 genera and 23 families in the wetland, with Cotula paludosa, Eragrostis caesia, Haplocarpha nervosa and Trifolium burchellianum as some of the most dominant species. Three distinct plant communities were described: Potamogeton pusillus-Ficinia cinnamomea, Helichrysum glaciale-Eragrostis caesia and Cotula paludosa-Trifolium burchellianum. The communities and species richness recorded revealed high diversity in this wetland when compared to similar wetlands within the Maloti-Drakensberg region. Ordination revealed that species diversity and the plant communities are mainly influenced by altitude, inundation depth, mottling depth, longitude and various edaphic attributes (potassium, total organic carbon, sodium and cation exchange capacity). This study provides the baseline information, which is essential for planning, monitoring and managing this wetland of international importance. In addition, the presence of introduced invasive species suggests the need to practically protect this wetland by implementing the developed management strategies. This will ensure the conservation of biodiversity, sustainable ecosystem service delivery and compliance with the Ramsar Convention requirements.

AB  - In a multiregional river system, environmental features such as natural conditions and anthropogenic activities vary among regions, resulting in spatiotemporal variations in water quality. Therefore, a robust water quality assessment method (e.g., water quality index [WQI]) that considers various environmental features is essential for water resources management. This study developed a min/max autocorrelation factor analysis (MAFA) based WQI framework (MAFAWQI). The statistical procedure reduces the bias of expert opinions. The MAFAWQI characterizes impaired water quality variables as indicators and assesses appropriate weighting values of indicators at each sampling site to reflect site-specific environmental features. The MAFAWQI was successful for assessing water quality in the middle and down streams of Han River in central China with site-specific pollution features such as nitrogen and phosphorus pollution related to multiple-source in tributaries, impacts of tributaries on the main stream, and phosphorus pollution related to nonpoint-source in agricultural regions. The MAFAWQI exhibited a balanced rating of water quality compared to the strict assessment method using a single indicator and the lenient assessment method using stationary weighting values of indicators. The MAFAWQI scores indicated that the water quality in tributaries and during the spring were significantly worse than those in and during the other regions and seasons in the middle and down streams of Han River, respectively. The framework and application of the MAFAWQI may provide a new perspective for developing WQIs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LA  - English
AB  - The site of Norba is located in the Latium Region, about 90 km S of Rome, Italy. The city is one of the best example of urban town planning, with a regular layout dating back to antiquity. Over the years, many studies and archaeological excavations have brought to light important remains of several buildings, which are still very well preserved. To enhance the knowledge of the unexcavated portions of the archaeological site and to locate the position of the unknown and hypothesized buried structures, extensive geophysical surveys employing the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Gradiometric methods were planned and conducted between 2017 and 2018. For the measurements, a GPR system SIR3000 (GSSI), equipped with a 400 MHz bistatic antenna with constant offset, was used to survey 27 different sectors close to few excavated areas. Taking into account the environmental conditions of the site and the nature of the buried structures, some areas were surveyed with a spacing interval between parallel profiles of 0.25 m while other areas were investigated with a spatial interval between closed parallel profiles of 0.50 m. Furthermore, fluxgate differential magnetic (Gradiometric) surveys were carried out using the geoscan FM256 in two areas, overlapping the GPR areas. In order to have a better understanding of the subsurface, methods of qualitative and quantitative integration of the results have been employed: maps overlays and RGB color composites (graphical integration), binary data analysis and cluster analysis (discrete data integration), and data sum, data product and principal component analysis (continuous data integration). The results obtained from the geophysical surveys were interpreted together with the archaeologists to define the meaning of the structures identified and to enhance the knowledge of the ancient town's layout and mapping.

AB  - Vultures (Cathartidae and Accipitridae) play an important role in ecosystem balance by rapidly disposing animal carcasses and thus preventing the potential spread of pathogens. Blood chemistry values provide a means of assessing the health of wildlife and wild animal populations; however, there are significant differences in chemistries among species and when comparing captive and free-living New and Old World vultures. In 2007, we collected blood serum from 30 female and 14 male wild, healthy black vultures (Coragyps atratus) live-trapped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services from a power substation in Lowndes County, Mississippi, USA. We analyzed the blood serum to provide serum chemistry base values for use in clinical pathology. The chemical analytes we measured included sodium, chloride, potassium, carbon dioxide, anion gap, glucose, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and aspartate aminotransferase. In general, blood chemistry values of black vultures were similar to those found in New and Old World vultures and raptor species. Average chemistry values for males were lower than females for sodium, chloride, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin. The serum chemistry values we describe in this paper can be important indicators of avian health by gender for the black vulture. Our study provided important blood chemistry values from a large sample size, which is rarely available in free-ranging black vultures. These values could be used by scientists, veterinary pathologists, wildlife rehabilitation centers, and other researchers for baseline data for wild and free-ranging birds. Furthermore, the use of such parameters in assessing population health may enable conservationists to further research environmental conditions affecting species reproduction and survival.

AB  - Currently, the habitats ofCystoseirain the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait are concentrated in the southern part of the Gulf of Taman on the eastern part of Tuzla, Cape Achillion, and the Kerch Peninsula-between Cape Khroni and Kazantip. It is shown that the main vector ofCystoseirasettlement is directed to the southwestern part of the Sea of Azov, which is facilitated by the compensatory bottom current from the Black Sea, which at the entrance to the Sea of Azov from the Kerch Strait deviates to the west. In studies of 2014-2017,Cystoseira barbatawas discovered in 2014 in the area of Cape Zyuk (village of Kyrortnoe) and in 2017 at Cape Chagani (village of Zolotoe) in the Kazantipsky Gulf. In expeditions of 2018 in the area of the actual Cape Kazantip, representatives ofCystoseirawere not detected. Probably, the findings ofCystoseiraat Cape Kazantip can be expected in the near future, but further progression of brown algae will be limited to loose soils. The conditions of the Sea of Azov are an ecological boundary of the range of the genusCystoseira, and for these algae, pulsation of the range border is characteristic. Factors that cause the expansion of the range of algae of the genusCystoseirain the Sea of Azov are an increase in salinity, transparency, and temperature of the seawater. The factors causing the narrowing of theCystoseirarange in the Sea of Azov are a decrease in salinity and water transparency and an increase in the number of severe winters with ice. Algae of the genusCystoseiraare good biological indicators for long-term observations of changes in the hydrological regime of the sea. But to consider them invaders in the Sea of Azov is hardly competent.

AB  - Energy production systems such as nuclear reactors and coal-burning power plants produce a multitude of waste contaminants including radionuclides, trace elements, and heavy metals. Among invertebrates, much of the effort to understand the impact of these contaminants has focused in aquatic environments, while relatively less attention has been on terrestrial communities. We investigated the effects of trace element and radionuclide contamination on assemblages of beetles that are drawn to vertebrate carrion. Samples were collected from riparian sites at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina to compare trap catches (i.e., measure of relative abundance) of beetles and species diversity along a habitat gradient (0300 m) away from an aquatic habitat and between uncontaminated and contaminated sites. We collected 17,800 carrion-associated beetles representing 112 species in nine families, which were classified as either scavenger or predatory beetles. Beetle catches and species diversity were generally higher at contaminated than uncontaminated sites. These trends were likely driven by scavenger species, which showed similar patterns between sites, whereas patterns of catches and species diversity were variable between sites for predatory beetles. Species compositions of contaminated and uncontaminated sites were generally distinct, however habitat edges appeared to substantially affect beetle assemblages. Overall, our study suggests carrion beetle assemblages are sensitive to edge effects and may exhibit variable responses to the presence of anthropogenic contaminants or disturbances associated with energy production systems. Such results reflect the inherent variability among individual beetle species, populations, and communities to local environmental conditions, and underscores the need for multi-taxa approach in environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Groundwater is the environmental compartment very often involved in the broader issues related to contaminated sites characterization and reclamation. It is not uncommon to find areas in which some substances directly linked to the petrographic composition of the aquifer reach high values exceeding the limits set by the regulations. These concentrations are defined as Natural Background Levels (NBL) and the need to quantify their real contribution, in areas subject to strong anthropogenic pressures, represents an emerging problem. Global statistical analyses and laboratory testing are proposed here to distinguish between the impacts of different forcing influencing water quality in hydrogeological systems. The study focus on the application of a methodology based on the Component Separation analysis for the NBL estimation of selected chemical species in potentially contaminated aquifers flowing in the proximity of landfill areas, and on the subsequent validation of the results through experimental studies of field samples. A site located in Calabria, Italy, and constituting a typical example of an aquifer which has been subjected to possible contact with the leachate produced by waste degradation is considered. The work is keyed to NBLs characterization of aluminum, iron and manganese and to the identification of their natural component for a proper environmental assessment of the site. Estimated NBLs are consistent with the geochemical composition of site samples. The adopted methodology can represent a useful instrument to distinguish effective anthropogenic contamination from natural conditions and to define realistic environmental clean-up goals.

AB  - The interaction between intensive animal production and the environment is complex and depends on the location and management practices. The waste generated from intensive animal production may represent a triggering factor for environmental pressures in the function of the volume and the characteristics, degrading environmental quality and affecting ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the environmental description of the impacts caused by the accumulation of the waste from intensive animal production, integrating the causal-chain approach of the driver-pressure-status-impact-response (DPSIR) model with the causal network and ecosystem services. Therefore, a conceptual framework was developed that makes possible a comprehensive description of a set of structures and functions that interact in complex ways. The conceptual framework was validated through a case study performed within the scope of a hydrographic microbasin with intensive pig production. The conceptual framework developed made it possible to establish connections among the DPSIR components, including environmental perceptions and changes in the socioeconomic system. The impacts caused by the waste were considered as changes in the provision of ecosystem services and the socioeconomic system, identifiable in the proposed conceptual framework. The application of the conceptual framework identified the primary drivers that exert pressure on the system and has an impact on the ecosystem services, affecting the provision and regulation services. The development of this environmental conceptual framework contributes to the selection of the indicators and ecosystem services involved. This can aid in the promotion of environmental sustainability, providing subsidies for more adequate environmental policies obtained from indicators that reflect local conditions.

AB  - Military training areas, where ecosystems are shaped under a complex disturbance regime, are recognized to be favourable pieces of land for maintaining high biological diversity. Our study focused on explosion craters - a small-scale disturbance type of high severity, and their effect on species diversity including vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. The research was carried out on an active military training area in Nowa Dgba (SE Poland). The examined vegetation represented open communities on nutrient-poor soils with a wide range of soil moisture conditions. We compared 76 pairs of vegetation samples, each pair consisting of a crater and a closely located control plot of the same size. Out of 135 species recorded (72 vascular plants, 33 mosses, 9 liverworts, 22 lichens), 37 were found only in craters, while 19 occurred only in control plots. Both, species number and diversity were significantly higher for craters than controls. In general, the positive effect of cratering on all studied groups rises from dry to wet habitats. The highest increase of diversity was observed in relation to bryophytes in the moist habitats. Moreover, craters within habitats of higher moisture turned out to be more resistant to alien colonization and at the same time were characterized by significantly higher number of red-listed species compared to the control plots. Differences in species composition between craters and undisturbed plots were most visible in moderately moist habitats. We found several species with a strong preference for craters, and the plants of the highest indicative value are Atrichum tenellum and Dicranella cerviculata.

AB  - We investigated climate niches of grasses at regional scales and quantitatively reconstruct Asian monsoon precipitation at the sand-loess transitional zone in northern China. Our results provide direct evidence that certain grass lineages have been specialized in specific habitats: Pooideae grasses stand out and occupy a much cooler environment than all other subfamilies; Pooideae, Aristidoideae, and Chloridoieae occupy dry environments. Pooideae grasses occupy the coldest and driest environments compared to all other subfamilies, with a mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) of similar to 13.6 to similar to 15.3 degrees C and 224 to similar to 1674 mm, respectively, at a regional scale. We built a database for grasses and their corresponding climate parameters. Based on this database, past climate parameters at the margin of the Asian summer monsoon since similar to 70 ka were quantitatively reconstructed by phytolith assemblages. They show that this area was dominated by cold- and dry-adapted grasses since similar to 70 ka with a MAT and MAP of similar to 3.3 to similar to 11.0 degrees C and similar to 442 to similar to 900 mm, respectively, generally consistent with the results of phytolith-based transfer function reconstructions and with the results of previous nearby pollen-based quantitative reconstructions. With the improvement of the species-climate and ecosystem dataset, our database-based method is a promising quantitative reconstruction approach to past climatic change in the monsoon region.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assay changes in blood biochemical parameters that resulted from exercise-induced muscle fatigue in horses participating in the two races (1,250 and 1,400 meters). Six male Arabian horses (3 to 6 years old) were used in this study. Blood samples were collected at time intervals including 1 hour before the race, immediately after the race, 1 and 24 hours after the end of race. Catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities, the blood level of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured, as well as muscle damage biomarkers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) activities, and myoglobin were measured. The results showed that CAT activity and plasma TAC in the horse increased immediately after the race and then gradually decreased. The highest GPX activity in red blood cells was recorded 1 hour before the start of the race. Superoxide dismutase showed an incremental pattern after the race. Immediately after the race, there was a significant increase in the plasma levels of AST, which continued until 1 hour after the race. The activity of LDH and CK reached its highest value 1 hour after the race. According to our findings, it can be concluded that the horses were tired and antioxidant enzymes altered under fatigue conditions. Muscle damage biomarkers have increased, but these increases were in their natural ranges and did not indicate muscle damage in horses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Characterising the successional stages of secondary forests recovery is key to understanding and aiding forest landscape restoration. To determine the successional stages - and recovery pathways - for mixed dipterocarp forest in Dong Nai Biosphere Reserve (DNBR), Southern Vietnam, we used a dataset of 61 pairs of 1000 m(2) plots, representing a range of recovery times (21-38 years), disturbances, and soil types with five categories: (1) Agent Orange affected + Logging (AO + Logging), (2) Logging, (3) Logging + Inundated, (4) Assisted Natural Regeneration + Logging (ANR + Logging) and (5) Protection. We first grouped recovered forest stands based on structure, composition, and dominant species. Each group was then identified by the dominant species types (bamboo, deciduous or evergreen) and indicator species. The forest stand characteristics, including species composition, basal area, tree size distribution, and species biodiversity were assessed for correlation with three site factors: soil type, disturbance type, and recovery time. Our results show that after 27 years recovery, logged mixed dipterocarp forest in DNBR can recover back to evergreen mixed dipterocarp forest, or change to bamboo or deciduous forests. The change in forest community depended on soil characteristics, especially soil water conditions, which are strongly correlated with topography. In addition, the recovered forest structures varied according to disturbance type and recovery time. By determining recovery stage, and the major drivers of the recovery process, site-specific ecological restoration techniques for seasonal tropical forest management can be suggested. Most recovered forest in DNBR is in a late or intermediate stage of vegetation development. However, retrogression and recovery deceleration were associated with invaders, such as grasses, climbers and bamboos, suggesting that their control is necessary in order to accelerate the natural development of native vegetation.

AB  - Seagrass habitats provide a range of goods and benefits to coastal communities by supporting ecosystem functioning, food provisioning, and cultural values. However, they are at risk worldwide from anthropogenic activities, climate change impacts and limited resources, which hamper efforts to protect them. Effective conservation planning requires prioritisation of sites based on multiple factors, including their relative value and vulnerability (VU). The current study examines the efficacy of combining two well-established approaches-ecosystem service assessments and habitat VU analyses-to test a method for determining conservation priority for selected seagrass meadows in Southeast Asia. Seven seagrass meadows around Southeast Asia were selected and scored by the authors based on (1) the cumulative contribution of 12 ecosystem services (ES) and the condition of the meadows, (2) VU from 16 anthropogenic threats, which were each ranked against five factors (spatial scale, frequency, functional impact, resistance and recovery time) and (3) the combination of the two approaches to create a single numerical index. Prioritisation of sites differed when meadows were scored solely for the ES they provide, compared to how vulnerable they are to anthropogenic threats. The new combined analysis brought the two metrics together to give conservation priority to sites where management intervention will yield maximum conservation benefits from conservation effort, and resulted in the prioritisation of three sites: Barrang Lompo (Indonesia), Cape Bolinao (Philippines) and Beting Tanjung Kupang (Malaysia). This method is easy to use and does not require great technical expertise. It is also auditable, allowing for clear and transparent understanding of decision-making process.

AB  - Forest conservation contributes to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation. To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia.
   This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously.

AB  - Escherichia coli is classified as a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium in the family Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterium mainly inhabits the lower intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans, and is often discharged into the environment through faeces or wastewater effluent. The presence of E.coli in environmental waters has long been considered as an indicator of recent faecal pollution. However, numerous recent studies have reported that some specific strains of E.coli can survive for long periods of time, and potentially reproduce, in extraintestinal environments. This indicates that E.coli can be integrated into indigenous microbial communities in the environment. This naturalization phenomenon calls into question the reliability of E.coli as a faecal indicator bacterium (FIB). Recently, many studies reported that E.coli populations in the environment are affected by ambient environmental conditions affecting their long-term survival. Large-scale studies of population genetics revealed the diversity and complexity of E.coli strains in various environments, which are affected by multiple environmental factors. This review examines the current knowledge on the ecology of E.coli strains in various environments with regard to its role as a FIB and as a naturalized member of indigenous microbial communities. Special emphasis is given on the growth ofpathogenic E.coli in the environment, and the population genetics of environmental members of the genus Escherichia. The impact of environmental E.coli on water quality and public health is also discussed.

AB  - Pollution of the aquatic environment by heavy metals has become a worldwide problem. Most heavy metals exhibit toxic waste on aquatic organisms. Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic metal which affects aquatic organisms acutely and chronically. Planktonic calanoid copepods are the secondary dominant producers of pelagic ecosystems and play a considerable role in the transfer of energy and organic matter from primary producers to higher trophic levels. We investigated the effect of cadmium chloride on biochemical responses of the planktonic calanoid copepods Centropages ponticus which is a key species in the Mediterranean Sea. The response of copepods to cadmium chloride was examined under laboratory-controlled conditions during a 72-h exposure. Catalase (CAT), Glutathion Reductase (GR), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were analyzed for cadmium chloride treatments (0, 0.2 and 0.4 mu g/L) after 24, 48 and 72 h. Additionally, the thiobarbituric reactive species assay was used to evaluate lipid peroxidation (LPO) level of the copepod. In this study, it is observed that contents of protein increased gradually with an increase in concentrations of metals and exposure time. Our findings showed that cadmium chloride directly influenced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the treated copepods hinting that the copepods had suffered from oxidative damage. During exposure, the Cd treatments significantly influenced the biochemical markers (CAT, GR, GPx, GST and AChE). Thus, Centropages ponticus could be used as a suitable bioindicator of exposure to Cd using biochemicals markers. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Understanding relationships between vegetation and environments is of importance for ecosystem restoration and management. However, information on how environments influence the floristic patterns of shrublands is lack, especially in the subtropical China. In this study, we explored how environments regulate species composition of shrublands at landscape scale in mid-subtropical China.
   We investigated species composition and measured the climate and soil environments for 207 shrubland plots in mid-subtropical China (24A degrees 39'aEuro"30A degrees 08'N, 108A degrees 47'aEuro"114A degrees 15'E). We applied a hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index to identify the main shrubland types and employed principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to explore the relationship between floristic composition and environment.
   We identified four shrubland types occurring in different environmental conditions. Montane shrubland, dominated by species suitable for cool climates (e.g. Rhododendron simsii), were distributed in steep areas at comparatively high altitudes; foothill shrubland, dominated by mesophilous species (e.g. Loropetalum chinense), were distributed in low mountains and hills; pioneer shrubland, dominated by fast grow and short-life cycles species (e.g. Rhus chinensis), were distributed at low altitudes with dense population; and finally, limestone shrubland, dominated by calcicole plants (e.g. Coriaria nepalensis), were distributed in the extensive karst areas. Communities occurring in high pH soils were completely separated from those in low pH soils according to the hierarchical cluster analysis. PCoA ordination associated the four types with distinct edaphic and climatic gradients. Soil pH explained 63.3% of variation in PCoA, followed by soil depth and soil bulk density.

AB  - Classification of phenotypic variability in forest dwelling arthropods, especially in applied bioindication, remains difficult due to the complex and synergic ecological interactions. Ecologically, it corresponds with the concept of alternative ontogenies in order to maintain high population fitness. The research on the geobiont Haplothrips subtilissimus (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) morphometric plasticity alongside selected ecological gradients (temperature, humidity, food availability) and the environmental impact in the xerothermous hilly oak wood (MartinskY les, SW Slovakia), have revealed that (MAN(C)OVA and Kruskal-Wallis test) the head width (p < 0.001) and anterior pronotum width (p <= 0.002) as the only statistically significant variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test (non parametric ANOVA) revealed significant variation (more noticeable in males) in ecologically more diverse ecotone stands. A significant correlation (p < 0.001) could be shown between the morphometric parameter pairs "head width" and "anterior pronotum width" for both sexes (0.729 for females and 0.822 for males) and between anterior and posterior pronotum width only for males (0.859). Pillai's statistics revealed an interaction of soil humidity and soil temperature which confirms female body parameters depend on habitat conditions (p = 0.011). Females responded mainly to soil temperature (p = 0.018) and food availability (p = 0.030). Soil humidity interacts with the male's morphology (soil humidity p = 0.040), while the relationship to food availability (Acarina) was not statistically significant (p = 0.350). No body parameter has been significantly affected by environmental stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate variability and change have adverse effects on agricultural production and other livelihood strategies of the rural households. The paper hypothesizes that rural households naturally devise means of overcoming the challenges currently posed by climate variability. The research article addresses the question of how rural households apply local knowledge of weather forecasting in adapting to climate variability in the Okavango Delta. It specifically probes, among others, the extent to which climate variability has affected agricultural production over the last 10 years in the area. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select a total of 592 households from eight rural communities. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and a stakeholder workshop were used to obtain demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and climatic information. Households used both natural animate and inanimate indicators to predict the weather. To enhance household adaptation to climatic events, indigenous knowledge weather forecasters (ethnometeorologists) engaged in discussions with community members on their observation and interpretation of local weather conditions. Households devised adaptation strategies including the selection and preservation of drought-resistant, early maturing seeds, and shift in farming calendars to overcome the vagaries of weather patterns. Local and farming communities had a favorable perception about the accuracy of indigenous knowledge in weather forecasting (ethnometeorology) and therefore continue to utilize this knowledge system in weather forecasting. Most households perceived that change in weather patterns had a direct relationship with the decline in agricultural outputs over the last 10 years. Households' experiential knowledge and ability to quantify their losses in farm yields as a result of climate-related problems provide an important insight for policy makers on how to address the impact of climate variability in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, and in similar social ecological contexts.

AB  - Context Policy decisions form a major driver of land use change, with important implications for socially and environmentally susceptible regions. It is well known that there can be major unintended consequences, especially where policies are not tailored to regionally specific contexts.
   Objectives In this paper we assess the implications of 60 years of agricultural policies on soil erosion prevention (SEP) by vegetation, an essential regulating ecosystem service in Mediterranean Europe.
   Methods To assess these implications we produced and analysed a time series of land cover/use and environmental conditions datasets (from 1951 to 2012) in relation to changing agricultural policies for a specific region in the southern Portugal. A set of indicators related to SEP allowed us to identify that land use intensification as increased soil erosion in the last 60 years.
   Results Particularly in the last 35 years, as a consequence of headage payments for cattle, the agricultural policy had a significant effect in the density and renewal of the tree cover, resulting in drastic effects for the provision of the SEP service. These are more significant after 1986, coinciding with the implementation of several Common Agricultural Policy instruments focused on increasing the modernization and productivity capacity of farm systems.
   Conclusions The results show some unintended effects of agricultural policy mechanisms on ecosystem service provision and highlight the need for context-based policies, tailored to the environmental constrains and potentials of each region.

AB  - The Zhetysu (Junggar) Alatau mountain system consists of mainly two parallel, high mountain ranges: the northern and the southern. The natural border between the ranges is the Koksu river and the Boro Tala river (located in China). Climate conditions, water resources, soil cover, altitudinal zonality of plant cover vary in the northern and the southern ranges (macro slopes). The aim of the research was to give phytocoenotic characteristic of meadow vegetation, to determine the ecological-physiognomic types of meadows, to identify the species composition of natural communities and indicators of anthropogenic influence. Meadow vegetation inhabits a wide altitudinal range from piedmont deserts and low-hill terrains to subalpine and alpine belts, with a high degree of species and phytocoenotic diversity. According to ecological-physiognomic classification, 6 vegetation types of meadows are found in the Zhetysu Alatau Mountains: halophytic on meadow-serozem saline soils, flood-plain-valley (forb-grass typical, grass-forb on floodplain meadow and meadow-chernozem soils; swamp meadows on paludal-meadow soils), steppe on meadow-chernozem and meadow-kastanozem soils, mid-mountain rich grass-forb on ordinary and leached chernozems, high-mountain subalpine on mountain-meadow subalpine turf soils, high-mountain alpine on mountain-meadow alpine turf soils. The meadows of the northern range are most diverse, those of the southern, more arid one, are fragmentary. Meadow vegetation is mostly used for grazing and haying, sometimes for tillage. Oftentimes, river valleys are significantly impacted by recreation. The degree of human-induced degradation is assessed as moderate, with sites of severe degradation of vegetation cover. Within the limits of the "Zhongar Alatau" and "Altyn Emel" National Parks remain natural samples of the Zhetysu Alatau meadow vegetation.

AB  - Environmental management has progressed from a tenure-based process, where each tenure is established for a single purpose, to one that considers multiple, often conflicting, uses across multiple tenures at the landscape scale. Here we consider the history of management, contestation and conservation of humid tropical rainforests of north-east Australia, Australia's Wet Tropics, and investigate the unfolding expression of new and diverse values attached to the region. We show that 1) for environmental managers, the task of understanding and giving expression to diverse human values attached to environmental resources is an on-going, complex and transdisciplinary task, ii) there is no 'moment' when a landscape, and the human values which make it legible, are 'secured', and iii) by locating dynamic social values as central to the project of environmental (or in this case, forest) management, we begin to understand managing for concurrent values as a central challenge for contemporary natural resource management. Three examples of multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to forest management for concurrence are examined: 1) managing the diverse impacts of rainforest tourism, 2) managing competing demands on a rapidly changing coastal community, and 3) bridging the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous indicators of forest condition. Our analysis supports the current theory of nested adaptive policy cycles that change in response to exogenous factors, rather than the Multi-Level Perspective which attributes causality to endogenous forces. We suggest that 21st Century environmental problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss will lead to further major social transformations and the path generation to increasing complexity will continue.

AB  - In Israel Eruca sativa has a geographically narrow distribution across a steep climatic gradient that ranges from mesic Mediterranean to hot desert environments. These conditions offer an opportunity to study the influence of the environment on intraspecific genetic variation. For this, we combined an analysis of neutral genetic markers with a phenotypic evaluation in common-garden experiments, and environmental characterization of populations that included climatic and edaphic parameters, as well as geographic distribution. A Bayesian clustering of individuals from nine representative populations based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) divided the populations into a southern and a northern geographic cluster, with one admixed population at the geographic border between them. Linear mixed models, with cluster added as a grouping factor, revealed no clear effects of environment or geography on genetic distances, but this may be due to a strong association of geography and environment with genetic clusters. However, environmental factors accounted for part of the phenotypic variation observed in the common-garden experiments. In addition, candidate loci for selection were identified by association with environmental parameters and by two outlier methods. One locus, identified by all three methods, also showed an association with trichome density and herbivore damage, in net-house and field experiments, respectively. Accordingly, we propose that because trichomes are directly linked to defense against both herbivores and excess radiation, they could potentially be related to adaptive variation in these populations. These results demonstrate the value of combining environmental and phenotypic data with a detailed genetic survey when studying adaptation in plant populations.

AB  - Protists are key players in microbial communities, yet our understanding of their role in ecosystem functioning is seriously impeded by difficulties in identification of protistan species and their quantification. Current microscopy-based methods used for determining the abundance of protists are tedious and often show a low taxonomic resolution. Recent development of next-generation sequencing technologies offered a very powerful tool for studying the richness of protistan communities. Still, the relationship between abundance of species and number of sequences remains subjected to various technical and biological biases. Here, we test the impact of some of these biological biases on sequence abundance of SSU rRNA gene in foraminifera. First, we quantified the rDNA copy number and rRNA expression level of three species of foraminifera by qPCR. Then, we prepared five mock communities with these species, two in equal proportions and three with one species ten times more abundant. The libraries of rDNA and cDNA of the mock communities were constructed, Sanger sequenced and the sequence abundance was calculated. The initial species proportions were compared to the raw sequence proportions as well as to the sequence abundance normalized by rDNA copy number and rRNA expression level per species. Our results showed that without normalization, all sequence data differed significantly from the initial proportions. After normalization, the congruence between the number of sequences and number of specimens was much better. We conclude that without normalization, species abundance determination based on sequence data was not possible because of the effect of biological biases. Nevertheless, by taking into account the variation of rDNA copy number and rRNA expression level we were able to infer species abundance, suggesting that our approach can be successful in controlled conditions.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that bacteria are capable of creating specific redox conditions which are visible as species-specific continuous redox potential (E (h)) measurements. It has been demonstrated that continuous measurements of E (h) are valuable for tracking bacterial metabolic activities of bacterial species in liquid cultures. However, it remains uncertain whether this phenomenon is widespread among bacterial species and whether E (h) measurements reflect similar mechanisms in more complex systems such as soils and sediments. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate whether bacteria that naturally occur in sediments have the capacity to control E (h) and assess the relative partitioning of biological processes involved in E (h) in natural sediments. To this end, continuous E (h) measurements are linked to growth of bacteria in liquid cultures and bacterial metabolic activity in aquatic sediment microcosms containing the bioturbator Tubifex spp., in which we evaluate bacterial partitioning in microcosms treated with the bacteriocide formalin. The tested bacterial species (Micrococcus luteus, Paracoccus pantotrophus and Aminobacter aminovarans) appeared to have specific stable E (h) signals during linear-exponential growth phase, suggesting that these species are capable of exerting an extracellular control on E (h) measurements, thereby supporting the notion that species-specific E (h) signals may be widespread among bacterial species. Formalin treatment reduced temporal variability of E (h) in sediment microcosms. This outcome suggests that bacterial metabolism and inherent relative contributions of members of bacterial community principally determine development of E (h) in sediment systems and that quantitation of sediment electrochemical properties may offer a potential indicator that characterizes bacterial processes.

AB  - Sediment resuspension is an important factor in controlling the impact of any localised point source impacts such as salmon farms; at high-flow (dispersive) sites, resuspension can significantly reduce potential effects. Depositional modelling (DEPOMOD) is widely used to predict localised seabed impacts and includes an optional flow-related resuspension module. This study examined the observed impacts at 5 farms with contrasting flow regimes to evaluate the role of modelled resuspension dynamics in determining impacts. When resuspension was included in the model, net particle export (i.e. no significant net downward flux of organic material) was predicted at the most dispersive sites. However, significant seabed effects were observed, suggesting that although the model outputs were theoretically plausible, they were inconsistent with the observational data. When the model was run without resuspension, the results were consistent with the field survey data. This retrospective validation allows a more realistic estimation of the depositional flux required, suggesting that approximately twice the flux was needed to induce an effect level at the dispersive sites equivalent to that at the non-dispersive sites. Moderate enrichment was associated with a flux of similar to 0.4 and similar to 1 kg m(-2) yr(-1), whilst highly enriched conditions occurred in response to 6 and 13 kg m(-2) yr(-1), for low and dispersive sites, respectively. This study shows that the association between current flow, sediment resuspension and ecological impacts is more complex than presently encapsulated within DEPOMOD. Consequently, where depositional models are employed at dispersive sites, validation data should be obtained to ensure that the impacts are accurately predicted.

AB  - In this paper we present models of relationship between the diatoms community diversity indices (DIs) and the physico-chemical parameters using machine learning techniques. By taking relative abundances into account, a diversity index depends not only on species richness but also on the evenness, or equitability, with which individuals are distributed among the different time and space. Diversity indices provide important information about rarity and commonness of species in a community. Because the physical-chemical conditions of the environmental influence on the several diversity indices of the diatoms community at once, it is more reliably to model all the diversity indices together.
   For modelling of the DIs models we use the raw; as measured, values of the concentrations for the physical-chemical parameters and the diversity indices of the diatoms abundance. The well known machine learning techniques are used to express this relationship: regression trees (RTs) and multi-target regression trees (MTRT's). The MTRT are more general than the RT, which predictive target is only one variable. The diversity indices are calculated for all diatoms of one measurement for 16 months, monthly and then are placed with the given physico-chemical parameters in one table. The results from the model have captured the ecological information with correlation between 0.9 and 0.92 for unseen (test) data. Diversity indices have proved to be a reliable indicator for the influence of the environment on the diatoms community. Temperature and conductivity components together with the Zn concentration are most influenced factors on the diatoms biodiversity. This could lead to more widely research broad view in this direction of ecological modelling.

AB  - Bythotrephes longimanus is an invasive pelagic crustacean, which first arrived in North America from Europe in early 1980s and can now be found throughout the Great Lakes and in many inland lakes and waterways. Determining the suitability of lakes to Bythotrephes establishment is an important step in quantifying its potential habitat range and environmental risk. Lake environmental conditions, planktivorous fishes, sport fishes and Bythotrephes occurrence data from 179 south-central Ontario lakes were used in this study to model lake characteristics suitable for its establishment. The performance of principal component analysis and different predictive models was used to determine the habitats that are suitable for the survival of Bythotrephes and the factors that may regulate its spread. Four modeling approaches were employed: linear discriminant analysis; multiple logistic regression; random forests; and, artificial neural networks. Ensemble prediction based on the four modeling approaches was also used as an indicator for predicting Bythotrephes occurrence. Bythotrephes appears to establish more readily in larger, deeper lakes with lower elevation, that have more sport fishes. Bythotrephes occurrence can be best predicted by artificial neural networks when including the measures of fish data, in addition to lake environmental data. Lake elevation, surface area and sport fish occurrence were ranked as the most important predictors of Bythotrephes invasion. The inclusion of biotic variables (occurrence or diversity of sport or planktivorous fishes) enhanced cross-validated models relative to analyses based on environmental data alone.

AB  - To inform the design and implementation of land-use policies that consider the variety of goods and services people derive from ecosystems, it is essential to understand spatial patterns of individual services, how multiple services relate to each other, and how these relationships vary across spatial scales and localities. Despite the importance of freshwater as a determinant of regional economic and human demographic patterns, there are surprisingly few studies that map the provision of a range of services associated with the quality of the aquatic environment. Here we examine relationships between indicators of riverine water and associated habitat quality, freshwater biodiversity, three terrestrial ecosystem services, and terrestrial biodiversity across England and Wales. The results indicate strong associations between our indicators of freshwater services. However, a comparison of these indicators of freshwater services with other ecosystem services (carbon storage, agricultural production, recreation) and biodiversity of species of conservation concern in the surrounding terrestrial landscape shows no clear relationships. While there are potential policy "win-wins" for the protection of multiple services shown by associations between indicators of freshwater services and carbon storage in upland areas of Britain, the other ecosystem services showed either negative or no relationships with the indicators of freshwater services. We also consider the influence that spatial scale has on these relationships using River Basin Districts. Our results indicate that relationships between indicators of services can change dramatically depending on the societal pressures and other regional conditions. Thus, the delivery of multiple ecosystem services requires the development of regional strategies, or of national strategies that take account of regional variation.

AB  - In this paper, I develop an optimization model for integrated urban planning for land use at the municipality level, in which decisions arise from an area-based weighted-GDP maximisation algorithm whose weights represent the sustainability and implementability of the land uses. The model favours the involvement of stakeholders in urban governance, but does not use complicated assessment procedures for non-economic indicators or relative weights to combine economic, social and environmental indicators; instead, the integration between economic activities and environmental status is represented objectively and non-linearly by referring to initial and sustainability conditions. The model accounts for both human and environmental dynamics by adopting a spatial structure that permits compromises between economic information (available at a macro level) and ecological information (available at a micro level). A single value is attached to each urban governance, with an elicitation of future decisions (including acceptance of the status quo) and the ability to provide an evaluation of past decisions: some environmental policies are considered. The model's predictions are based on reasonably reliable knowledge that can be easily collected, with reliability determined by calculating the confidence level. The resulting urban governance can then be presented and further analysed within a geographical information system. A case study of the model's application to Algeria's Regha < a and Heraoua municipalities provides insights into optimal urban governance, with and without water quantity or quality policies, in terms of resource sustainability, sectoral development, and pollution sustainability. I also assess the previous master plan in terms of the land uses suggested by the model.

AB  - Glyoxal, CHO.CHO, is produced during the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, VOC, released by anthropogenic activities, biogenic processes and biomass burning. It has a short chemical lifetime of a few hours in the boundary layer and lower troposphere and therefore serves as an indicator and a marker of photochemical hot-spots and their response to changing atmospheric conditions around the globe. For this reason more than five years of CHO.CHO observations (2002-2007), retrieved from the radiances measured by the satellite instrument SCIAMACHY, were obtained and analyzed both temporally and spatially. The largest columns of CHO.CHO (> 6.10(14) molec cm(-2)) are found in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, associated with high biological activity and the plumes from vegetation fires. The majority of the identified hot spots are characterized by a well-defined seasonality: the highest values being observed during the warm and dry periods as a result of the enhanced biogenic, primarily isoprene, emissions and/or biomass burning from natural or man-made fires. The regions influenced by anthropogenic pollution also encounter enhanced amounts of glyoxal. The ratio 'CHO.CHO to HCHO, R-GF' over the biogenically influenced photochemical hot-spots is approximately 0.045. For the studied regions, the presence of pyrogenic and anthropogenic emissions increases and decreases this number respectively. Although the 2002-2007 period of observation is limited, over the northeastern Asia a significant annual increase in CHO.CHO in addition to a seasonal cycle is reported.

AB  - Heterotrophic protozoa have a global distribution in terrestrial habitats. The functional groups significantly represented are zooflagellates, ciliates, gymnamoebae and testate amoebae. Their range extends into the Antarctic zone, but the species richness of the communities is rarely of the same order of magnitude as those in temperate latitudes. Species diversity is usually very low owing to dominance of the communities by single, or a few, species which are best adapted to the Antarctic terrestrial environment. This is characterized by seasonal, diurnal or unpredictable fluctuations in moisture, temperature and bacterial food supply of high amplitude. The fauna shows pauperization with latitude and climatic severity. Nearly all records of species distribution are consistent with the model that community composition is determined by local conditions. An important exception is the distribution of the testate amoeba genus Nebela whose species distribution is influenced by biogeographical factors. Successional changes in community composition in fellfield habitats are characterized by the sequence: pioneer microflagellate colonizers, larger flagellates and small ciliates, and finally testate amoebae. The succession is most closely correlated with the accumulation of organic matter. A model of the strategies of dominant microflagellate species can be constructed by ordinating them on a two-dimensional habitat template of A-r-K selection continuum. The globally ubiquitous microflagellate Heteromita globosa emerges as the most strongly A-selected and K-selected. The occurrence of terrestrial protozoa near their latitudinal limits of distribution can serve as sensitive indicators of the biological effects of climatic change. Having short generation times and effective means of cyst dispersal, changes in the gross distribution can provide rapid warning of critical changes in thermal regimes.

AB  - The role of the accompanying microbiota in the presence of Listeria monocytogenes on meat processing surfaces is not yet understood, especially in industrial production conditions. In this study, 300 conveyor belt samples from the cutting room of a swine slaughterhouse were collected during production. The samples were subjected to the detection of L. monocytogenes. Recovered strains were characterized by serogrouping-PCR, InlA Sanger sequencing and for their ability to form biofilm. A selection of isolates was compared with core genome multi-locus sequence typing analysis (cgMLST). The sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S RNA gene of the microorganisms harvested from each sample was carried out in parallel using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Diversity analyses were performed and MaAsLin analysis was used to assess the link between L. monocytogenes detection and the surrounding bacteria. The 72 isolates collected showed a low genetic diversity and important persistence characteristics. L. monocytogenes isolates were not stochastically distributed on the surfaces: the isolates were detected on three out of six production lines, each associated with a specific meat cut: the half carcasses, the bostons and the picnics. MaAsLin biomarker analysis identified the taxa Veillonella (p & LE; 0.0397) as a bacterial determinant of the presence of L. monocytogenes on processing surfaces. The results of this study revealed a heterogenous contamination pattern of the processing surfaces by L. monocytogenes and targeted a bacterial indicator of the presence of the pathogen. These results could lead to a better risk assessment of the contamination of meat products.

AB  - Current understanding of species capacities to respond to climate change is limited by the amount of information available about intraspecific variation in the responses. Therefore, we quantified between- and within- population variation in larval performance (survival, development, and growth to metamorphosis) of the shore crab Carcinus maenas in response to key environmental drivers (temperature, salinity) in 2 populations from regions with contrasting salinities (32-33 PSU: Helgoland, North Sea; 16-20 PSU: Kerteminde, Baltic Sea). We also accounted for the effect(s) of salinity experienced during embryogenesis, which differs between populations. We found contrasting patterns between populations and embryonic salinity conditions. In the Helgoland population, we observed a strong thermal mitigation of low salinity stress (TMLS) for all performance indicators, when embryos were kept in seawater. The negative effects of low salinity on survival were mitigated at increased temperatures; only at high temperatures were larvae exposed to low salinity able to sustain high growth rates and reduced developmental time, thereby metamorphosing with comparable levels of carbon and nitrogen to those reared in seawater. By contrast, larvae from the Kerteminde population showed a detrimental effect of low salinity, consistent with a maladaptive response and a weak TMLS. Low salinity experienced during embryogenesis preempted the development of TMLS in both populations, and reduced survival for the Kerteminde population, which is exposed to low salinity. Our study emphasises the importance of evaluating species responses to variation in temperature and salinity across populations; the existence of maladaptive responses and the importance of the maternal habitat should not be underestimated.

AB  - Background: Birthweight is an indicator of fetal growth and environmental-related alterations of birthweight have been linked with multiple disorders and conditions progressing into adulthood. Although a few studies have assessed the association between birthweight and the totality of exogenous exposures and their downstream molecular responses in maternal urine and cord blood; no prior research has considered a) the maternal serum prenatal metabolome, which is enriched for hormones, and b) non-linear and synergistic associations among exposures. Methods: We measured the maternal serum metabolome during pregnancy using an untargeted metabolomics approach and birthweight for gestational age (BWGA) z-score in 410 mother-child dyads enrolled in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort. We leveraged a Bayesian factor analysis for interaction to select the most important metabolites associated with BWGA z-score and to evaluate their linear, non-linear and non-additive associations. We also assessed the primary biological functions of the identified proteins using the MetaboAnalyst, a centralized repository of curated functional information. We compared our findings with those of a traditional metabolite-wide association study (MWAS) in which metabolites are individually associated with BWGA z-score. Results: Among 1110 metabolites, 46 showed evidence of U-shape associations with BWGA z-score. Most of the identified metabolites (85%) were lipids primarily enriched for pathways central to energy production, immune function, and androgen and estrogen metabolism, which are essential for pregnancy and parturition processes. Metabolites within the same class, i.e. steroids and phospholipids, showed synergistic relationships with each other. Conclusions: Our results support that the aspects of the maternal metabolome during pregnancy contribute linearly, non-linearly and synergistically to variation in newborn birthweight.

AB  - The paper focuses on the interactions among the components of urban natural complex (surface soil layer, rhizosphere, and aboveground phytomass of herbaceous plants) polluted by motor vehicles. The goal of this study is to identify the zone of pollution sources impact and the specific features in accumulation of pollutants in soil-plant systems with different levels of load. The distribution and migration of marker compounds-14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (polyarenes, or PAHs)-are analyzed in the southwest of Moscow (the campus of the RUDN University and the adjacent area of the Southwest Forest Park) in functional zones differing by the volumes of technogenic loads. The soils of the examined territory according to WRB belong to Albic Retisols (Ochric). The spatial distribution of polyarenes in the system "surface soil layer-rhizosphere-aboveground part of plants" is modeled using data analysis procedures and visualized with the help of the ArcGIS software (Topo-to-Raster tool). The effects of aerial mass transfer of polyarenes into the soil-plant system as the main pathway for the entry of pollutants are evaluated. The prevalent polyarenes and the factors determining the volumes of their accumulation in the functional zones of the studied area are identified. The genesis of polyarenes is assessed according to the abundance ratios of their groups. The differences in the conditions and dynamics of PAH accumulation in soil and plant components are shown. The results are particularly useful to formulate the requirements to soil monitoring in the studied area, to analyze the dynamics of the state of urban territory, and to justify the measures for protection of urban areas under a traffic load.

AB  - Green manure as a source of soil organic matter is an important indicator of potential agricultural ecosystems capable of preventing erosion, reducing runoff, increasing soil permeability, improving ventilation, ameliorating the temperature, and enhancing the function of microorganisms. Therefore, to investigate the effects of green manure Sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) and nitrogen fertilizer on maize yield in Kermanshah, an experiment was carried out as split-plot in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The main factor was the use of Sula in two levels, namely application and non-application, while, the sub-factor was the application of N fertilizer at four levels of zero, 200, 400 and 500 kg/ha. The highest leaf area index was observed by 400 kg/ha N application along with green manure. Grains per ear determined using green manure and nitrogen fertilizer at levels of 0, 200, 400 and 500 kg/ha increased by 8, 10, 15, and 15%, respectively. The result showed that the Sulla green manure treatment increased the grain yield by 10% compared to the control treatment. Furthermore, the highest grain yield was obtained under two treatments of 400 and 500 kg N/ha which was significantly different from other levels of N applications. The application of green manure application also increased the maize protein content by 8% with a rise in the highest levels of nitrogen fertilizer. Meanwhile, the application of Sulla as a green fertilizer or pre-planting had a positive impact on increasing soil organic matter and maize yield. Therefore, cultivation of Sulla can be considered a positive task towards sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Abundant species are typically also viewed as ecologically dominant, and are frequently used to characterize the communities in which they live. Such characteristic assemblages may also be used as indicators of environmental conditions, such as relative stability. Fossil and modern turritelline gastropods are often the most abundant species in the marine assemblages and communities in which they occur, forming 'turritelline-dominated assemblages' (TDAs). We use data on modern Turritella bacillum from waters around Hong Kong as a case study to analyse fluctuations in abundance over 25 years. While turritellines were not always dominant in the area surveyed (similar to 1650 km(2)), populations were notably persistent, and rebound after decline of abundances occurred within similar to 5 years at some sites. delta O-18 sclerochronology suggests that individuals were similar to 1-2 years old. It is also notable that T. bacillum was found to be abundant at salinities as low as 10-15 psu, despite the general characterization of turritellines as fully marine. Comparison with data on modern T. communis in the western English Channel corroborates this pattern, as localized sites of high abundance also appear transient. These results have implications for the interpretation of TDAs in the fossil record: they may signify the cumulative result of short-lived, spatially restricted populations, possibly resulting from essentially stochastic larval settlement. This suggests that the palaeoenvironmental setting of fossil TDAs does not always control their occurrence on short temporal scales.

AB  - Renewable natural gas (RNG) is a fuel comprised of essentially pure methane, usually derived from climate-neutral (e.g. biogenic or captured) carbon dioxide (CO2). RNG is proposed as a climate friendly direct substitute for fossil natural gas (FNG), with the goal of enabling diverse natural gas users to continue operating without substantial infrastructure overhauls. The assumption that such substitution is climate friendly relies on a major condition that is unlikely to be met: namely, that RNG is manufactured from waste methane that would otherwise have been emitted to the atmosphere. In practice, capturable waste methane is extremely limited and is more likely to be diverted from a flare than from direct atmospheric release in a climate-conscious policy context, which means that RNG systems need to be more destructively efficient than a flare to provide climate benefits versus the likely alternative management strategy. Assuming demand levels consistent with the goal of using existing FNG infrastructure, RNG is likely to be derived from methane that is either intentionally produced or diverted from a flare, so essentially any methane leakage is climate additional. Further, in a decarbonizing system, RNG will likely compete with lower-emissions resources than FNG and thus provides fewer net emissions benefits over time. Anticipated leakage is climatically significant: literature estimates for methane leakage from biogas production and upgrading facilities suggest that leakage is in the 2%-4% range (mass basis), up to as much as 15%. Policy makers should consider that under reasonable leakage and demand assumptions, RNG could be climate intensive.

AB  - The use of Technosols for the restoration of limestone quarries overcomes the usual "in situ" scarcity of soil and/or its poor quality. The use of mine spoils, improved with mineral and/or organic amendments, could be an efficient and environmentally friendly option. Properly treated sewage sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants could be a suitable organic amendment and fertilizer (rich in N and P) whenever its pollutant burden is low (heavy metals and/or organic pollutants). Its appropriate use could improve essential soil physical and chemical properties and, therefore, promote key ecosystem services of restored areas, such as biomass production and carbon sequestration, as well as biodiversity and landscape recovery. However, the mid-term impacts of these restoration practices on soil functioning and their services have rarely been reported in the available literature. In this study we assess the mid-term effects (10 years) of the use of sewage sludge as a Technosol amendment on soil organic carbon (SOC), nutrient status, and plant development in several restored quarries. Soils restored using sewage sludge showed a threefold increase in SOC compared to the corresponding unamended ones, despite the moderate sludge dosage applied (below 50 tonnes/ha). Plant cover was also higher in amended soils, and recruitment was not affected by sludge amendment at these doses. This study demonstrates that, used at an appropriate rate, sewage sludge is a good alternative for the valorization of mine spoils in quarry restoration, improving some important regulatory ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, without compromising woody plant encroachment.

AB  - Black truffle is a highly appreciated edible fungus that grows wild in southwestern Europe, although its cultivation has recently spread to other continents. In Spain the widespread exploitation of wild truffles began only after 1950, whereas plantations play a relevant role in truffle production from the late 1990s. However, most plantations continue to apply empiric practices not taking into account local environmental conditions. The identification of environmental factors driving black truffle distribution and yield could help to optimise cultivation practices, but no agro-climatic zoning is currently available for this fungus in Spain. This study characterises the climate of Spanish forests naturally producing black truffle, defines an agro-climatic zoning for the fungus and examines the climatic patterns across its spatial distribution. The examined forests presented climatic ranges coherent with the available experts' surveys, except for an extended low end in annual precipitation. The clustering identified three agro-climatic zones, with dry environments tending to be dominant. The principal components analysis indicated that the examined forests tended to cluster along water availability and temperature gradients. Only in one of the zones mean precipitations during the vegetative period were similar to those characterising optimum years for black truffle fruiting, thus suggesting that plantations could benefit from practices increasing soil water content. Similarly, the results suggested that in two of the zones plantations could benefit from practices increasing soil temperature in winter and early spring. The study provides a basis for large-scale planning of truffle cultivation and identification of research priorities in Spain.

AB  - The paper discusses the long-term variability of maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) air temperature variations, both occurring from one day to the next and over several consecutive days (3-4), in Krakow (Poland, Central Europe) from 1826 to 2015 (i.e., over a period of 190 years). The authors analyzed the seasonal variability of short-term variations in air temperature, looking at the most significant changes (+/- 10 degrees C), as well as at their dynamics and trends over the analyzed multi-annual period. A clear decrease has been observed both in the values of short-term Tmax and Tmin variations and in the number of cases with their significant fluctuations. The decrease has been gradual, without clear abrupt changes to the overall trend. The greatest short-term variations in temperature were most frequent in the cooler half-year, being smaller and less frequent in the summer months. If the observed trend persists, in the upcoming years we can expect a further decrease in the dynamics of variations in thermal conditions, i.e., short-term variations in temperature may more frequently be small, i.e., +/- 0.1-4.0 degrees C. However, it is worth noting that Tmax more frequently increased from one day to the next and over several consecutive days, while Tmin more frequently decreased. The reasons for the analyzed changes remain unclear. It seems that natural factors, mainly including the advection of air masses, have a significant impact on short-term variations in air temperature, coupled with local factors, which have been strengthened by the human impact on the environment, including the urban heat island.

AB  - This study focused on the seasonal and spatial analysis of the mesozooplankton community in a human-impacted subantarctic bay in Argentina and aimed to detect assemblages associated with environmental variability. Mesozooplankton samples and environmental data were obtained in the Ushuaia Bay (UB) seasonally, from August 2004 to June 2005, and spatially, from coastal (more polluted), middle (less influenced) and open sea water (free polluted) sampling stations. Remarkable seasonal changes on the mesozooplankton community were observed. Nitrogenated nutrients, chlorophyll a, salinity and temperature were the prevailing environmental conditions likely associated with the different mesozooplankton assemblages found in the bay. The copepods Eurytemora americana, Acartia tonsa, Podon leuckarti and Nematoda were particularly observed on the northwest coast of the bay, characterized by the highest level of urban pollution, eutrophicated by sewage and freshwater inputs from the Encerrada Bay which is connected to it. The stations situated in the northeast area, mostly influenced by freshwater input from rivers and glacier melting, showed low mesozooplankton abundances and an important contribution of adventitious plankton. The copepods Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus brevipes and Drepanopus forcipatus were mostly observed at the stations located near the Beagle Channel, characterized by open sea and free polluted waters. Our findings suggest that the variations observed in the mesozooplankton assemblages in the UB seem to be modulated by environmental variables associated with the anthropogenic influence, clearly detected on the coast of the bay. Certain opportunistic species such as A. tonsa and E. americana could be postulated as potential bioindicators of water quality in subantarctic coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Bacteriophage-functionalized surfaces are a new class of advanced functional material and have been demonstrated to be applicable for use as antimicrobial surfaces in medical applications (e.g., indwelling medical devices or wound dressings) or as biosensors for bacterial capture and detection. However, the complex composition of many real life samples (e.g., blood, natural waters, etc.) can potentially interfere with the interaction of phage and its bacterial host, leading to a decline in the efficiency of the phage-functionalized surface. In this study, the bacterial capture efficiency of two model phage-functionalized surfaces was assessed in the presence of potential environmental and biomedical interferents. The two phage bacteria systems used in this study are PRD1 with Salmonella Typhimurium and T4 with Escherichia coli. The potential interferents tested included humic and fulvic acids, natural groundwater, colloidal latex microspheres, host extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), albumin, fibrinogen, and human serum. EPS and human serum decreased the host capture efficiency for immobilized PRD1 and T4, and also impaired the infectivity of the nonimmobilized (planktonic) phage. Interestingly, humic and fulvic acids reduced the capture efficiency of T4-functionalized surfaces, even though they did not lead to inactivation of the suspended virions. Neither humic nor fulvic acids affected the capture efficiency of PRD1. These findings demonstrate the inadequacy of traditional phage selection methods (i.e., infectivity of suspended phage toward its host in clean buffer) for designing advanced functional materials and further highlight the importance of taking into account the environmental conditions in which the immobilized phage is expected to function.

AB  - Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is a valuable tool to support the use of mathematical models that characterise technical or natural systems. In the field of wastewater modelling, most of the recent applications of GSA use either regression-based methods, which require close to linear relationships between the model outputs and model factors, or screening methods, which only yield qualitative results. However, due to the characteristics of membrane bioreactors (MBR) (non-linear kinetics, complexity, etc.) there is an interest to adequately quantify the effects of non-linearity and interactions. This can be achieved with variance-based sensitivity analysis methods. In this paper, the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (Extended-FAST) method is applied to an integrated activated sludge model (ASM2d) for an MBR system including microbial product formation and physical separation processes. Twenty-one model outputs located throughout the different sections of the bioreactor and 79 model factors are considered. Significant interactions among the model factors are found. Contrary to previous GSA studies for ASM models, we find the relationship between variables and factors to be non-linear and non-additive. By analysing the pattern of the variance decomposition along the plant, the model factors having the highest variance contributions were identified. This study demonstrates the usefulness of variance-based methods in membrane bioreactor modelling where, due to the presence of membranes and different operating conditions than those typically found in conventional activated sludge systems, several highly non-linear effects are present. Further, the obtained results highlight the relevant role played by the modelling approach for MBR taking into account simultaneously biological and physical processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To develop a long-term volunteer-based system for monitoring the impacts of climate change on plant distributions, potential indicator plants and monitoring sites were assessed considering habitat prediction uncertainty. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to project potential habitats for 19 popular edible wild plants in Japan. Prediction uncertainties of SDMs were assessed using three high-performance modeling algorithms and 19 simulated future climate data. SDMs were developed using presence/absence records, four climatic variables, and five non-climatic variables. The results showed that prediction uncertainties for future climate simulations were greater than those from the three different modeling algorithms. Among the 19 edible wild plant species, six had highly accurate SDMs and greater changes in occurrence probabilities between current and future climate conditions. The potential habitats of these six plants under future climate simulations tended to shift northward and upward, with predicted losses in potential southern habitats. These results suggest that these six plants are candidate indicators for long-term biological monitoring of the impacts of climate change. If temperature continuously increases as predicted, natural populations of these plants will decline in Kyushu, Chugoku and Shikoku districts, and in low altitudes of Chubu and Tohoku districts. These results also indicate the importance of occurrence probability and prediction uncertainty of SDMs for selecting target species and site locations for monitoring programs. Sasa kurilensis, a very popular and widespread dominant scrub bamboo in the cool-temperate regions of Japan, was found to be the most effective plant for monitoring. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alpine timberline is a proper indicator of climate change and has received much attention in ecological research during the past decades. In this study, variations of alpine timberlines and their biogeographic characteristics were investigated by a combination of field surveys, climate indices, and soil nutrient analyses in the northern Tianshan Mountains (NTM) of northwest China. The timberline altitudes were probed to range from 2,530 to 2,800 m a.s.l. in the NTM, gradually descending from west to east along the V-shaped Ili valley (from Zhaosu to Xinyuan), and ascending from west to east across the northernmost range of the study area (from Bole to Balikun). The vertical widths between the upper and lower limits of the timberlines were widest in the middle NTM (Kuytun to Changji) and the Ili valley (Zhaosu to Xinyuan). Interactions between the terrain and air currents resulted in variant climates within the NTM, which contributed to significant timberline distribution differences. Although vertical width was positively correlated to soil nutrient (especially organic matter, r = 0.78), and timberline altitudes were positively related to the soil pH values, the temperature during the growing season primarily determines both altitude and vertical width. In conclusion, timberline altitudes were dominated by the combined effects of local topography, soil nutrient properties, water, and thermal conditions. Identifying the dominating influencing factors of NTM timberlines provided potential insights to better understand the effects of climate change on the alpine ecosystem over central Asia.

AB  - Forest degradation is broadly defined as a reduction in the capacity of a forest to produce ecosystem services such as carbon storage and wood products as a result of anthropogenic and environmental changes. The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales.

AB  - Free-living wild rodents are usually used as indicators of pollution, with elements being determined in either whole body or in specific organs. In the present study, the accumulation of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in kidney, liver, testis, uterus and bone of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) trapped in a polluted area of Novaky, Slovakia was investigated. Yellow-necked mice and bank voles were collected using standard theriological methods for wood ecosystems. All animals were adults in good physical condition. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, Fe, and Zn in all analyzed organs were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest concentrations of Cd and Zn were found in the bone of both species while Cu and Fe accumulated most in the uterus. Significantly higher concentrations of Cd and Cu were detected in the liver of the bank vole in comparison with the yellow-necked mouse (P<0.05). Similar significantly higher levels of Cd and Zn were found in the bone of the bank vole (P<0.05) than in the yellow-necked mouse, while these rodents had significantly higher Cu and Fe concentrations (P<0.05) in the kidney. Significantly higher levels of Fe and Zn were detected in the testis and uterus of bank voles, respectively. On the other hand, significantly higher concentration of Cu was found in the testis of yellow-necked mice. Results of this study suggest that bank voles are more sensitive heavy metal loaded bioindicators than yellow-necked mice.

AB  - Ramet distribution, leaf morphometry and elemental composition of Caltha palustris L. were studied along a hydrologic gradient in Nyarias marsh, N. E. Hungary, to identify patterns associated with water depth. Water-table height was linearly correlated with distance over most of the plant's distribution range. Caltha ramets were not dispersed uniformly but appeared in an aggregated pattern of a 12 m scale. However, no clear relationship was found between water depth and the density of ramets, leaf number per ramet, aspects of plant performance (leaf blade and petiole dry weight), water status (water content of leaf parts), or leaf morphometry (lamina length and breadth, petiole length). Leaf size decreased towards both ends of the transect, and was highest at intermediate position. Contrastingly, foliar concentrations of several elements (e.g. Na, Mn, Cu) and especially the Fe: Mn ratio were strongly correlated with water-table height. Principal components analysis revealed two groups of elements: one discriminating between the lamina and the petiole but uncorrelated with the gradient (Ca, S, Fe, P, Al, K), and another not discriminating but positively correlated with the gradient (Na, Mn, ME).
   The complex patterns of Caltha population traits in Nyarias demonstrate the ecologic importance of small-scale spatial (i.e. microtopographic) differences in wetlands. Besides water depth and duration per se, biotic factors such as gradients of standing crop, species richness or competition intensity may have intricate effects on single populations. Foliar Fe: Mn ratios, however, seem to be directly determined by water-table height and associated soil chemistry, thus can be a subtile indicator of wetland water conditions.

AB  - Avermectins and their metabolites are excreted mainly in the faeces; they do not readily move from the site of dung deposition because of their low solubility in water and their tight binding to organic matter. Avermectins degrade in the environment through photodegradation and aerobic breakdown by soil organisms. The dung mesofauna potentially exposed to avermectin residues includes insects, earthworms, springtails, mites and nematodes. These organisms occupy a variety of different niches within the ecosystem and the faunal composition changes as the pats age. Some members of this fauna act in concert with soil microbial flora and assist in the breakdown of dung and consequent nutrient re-cycling on pasture. There are marked seasonal patterns of faunal abundance and behaviour which affect their relative importance in the decomposer community. Some species of the coprophagous insect fauna, particularly in the larval stages, can be adversely affected by the presence of avermectin residues in the faeces. Veterinary use patterns of avermectins in temperate regions indicate that peak periods of insect activity and peak times of avermectin use are often asynchronous. When avermectin usage and insect activity do coincide, the heterogeneous patterns of administration to livestock and the focus of treatment on young animals result in the deposition on pasture of faeces which are predominantly free of avermectin residues. Results of large scale, long term studies indicate that, even under conditions of relatively high levels of avermectin use in cattle, the impact on non-target insect populations and their function is limited.

AB  - The demand for food based on intensive agriculture has decreased soil quality, posing great challenges such as increasing agricultural productivity and promoting environmental sustainability. Thus, researchers have focused on developing models for estimating soil quality based on artificial intelligence techniques for the processing of multidimensional data from agro-industrial systems, which provide useful information for farmers about soil management and crop conditions. However, a model for the application of these new technologies in medium and low-scale agricultural systems has not been identified. Therefore, a review of recent studies of crop yield prediction based on the estimation of chemical, physical, and biological soil quality indicators (SQI), which incorporate different machine learning (ML) techniques to process data from remote sensing (RS) systems, is presented. The advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed for: SQI estimates at regional and local scale, spectral bands used for analysis of plowed soils (bare soils) of cultivation plots, selection of minimun data set (MDS), use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms, data pre-processing, and selection of ML algorithms for processing biological systems databases (agro-industrial systems). Finally, we present a model to help estimate soil quality in agricultural systems at a local scale, based on ML to process RS data, in the model the inputs to the ML unit come from four different class data sets (RS, SQI, environmental data and crop management data). Crop management uses the production of the ML unit to adjust agricultural management practices and therefore improve crop yield.

AB  - Globally, gas flaring caused 350 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018. In addition to climate change, this burning practice also has other negative consequences for humans (e.g., respiratory problems) and the environment. The aim of this paper is to quantify the impact of flaring on human health (at the global and country level) via the calculation of the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by the combustion of associated gas. For this quantification, gas flaring emissions were linked with midpoint indicators (e.g., climate change) in life cycle assessment (LCA) for all selected countries. Regionalised characterisation factors (CFs) were applied in the impact assessment to allow for spatial differentiation. The global impact on human health caused by flaring was obtained by taking the sum for all countries. The results show that these flaring emissions globally cause 4.83 x 10(5) DALYs or 6.19 x 10(-5) DALYs/person on an annual basis. This amounts to 0.12% of the total DALYs related to air pollution (from PM2.5) caused by all polluting sectors and 6.51% of the total DALYs related to climate change. To quantify these impacts, this study uses a country perspective rather than considering local characteristics. Thus, if more precise information at a more local level (e.g., city level) is sought, additional factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) should be taken into account. Finally, future research should also focus on the benefits of gas flaring reduction techniques to enable the selection of the most promising technologies for the elimination of gas flaring and its effects.

AB  - Two of the main principles of global and national conservation strategies consist in focusing on the most speciesrich and most vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the Orthoptera species assemblages of species-rich grasslands in the southern Black Forest, one of 30 German biodiversity hotspots. Across a moisture gradient, we considered the three dominant grassland types within the study area: (i) dry, (ii) mesic and (iii) wet grasslands. In order to analyze the drivers of biodiversity in a landscape of high conservation value, we related (i) differences in Orthoptera assemblage composition between the three grassland types and (ii) the relationship of Orthoptera assemblage composition within each grassland type to environmental conditions. In our study, we detected considerable variation in land-use intensity which dropped from high in mesic to low in dry and again to near-zero in wet grasslands. Land-use intensity was the only predictor of Orthoptera species richness in the multivariable Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models. The mean number of both all and threatened species was highest in the grassland type with low land-use intensity, dry grasslands, differing from those of mesic (high landuse intensity) and wet (mostly abandoned) grasslands. Additionally, dry grasslands had the highest number of all, threatened and exclusive indicator species. Both (i) intensive land use in mesic grasslands and (ii) abandonment of land use in wet grasslands led to a homogenization of the habitat structures and the species assemblages. In contrast, dry grasslands with low land-use intensity and high habitat heterogeneity were hotspots of Orthoptera species richness.

AB  - The excessive nutrients discharge from industrial and domestic sources have been contributing to the establishment of eutrophication conditions, particularly in chocked lagoons in the Neotropical region. This study evaluates the influence of organic matter on the foraminiferal and ostracode assemblages by combining biopolymers concentrations, sediment grain size, and physical and chemical parameters in the Marica-Guarapina Lagoon System (MGLS, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The physical-chemical parameters show a well-defined confinement gradient from the channel to the innermost region. The biopolymers analysis indicates that the Guarapina and Barra Lagoons are characterized by the highest values of organic matter from anthropic origin. Living organisms are absent or poorly represented in most of these regions of Marica and Barra lagoons. Seventeen living species of foraminifera and five of ostracodea are identified in the MGLS. Foraminifera and ostracodea exhibit a negative relationship with organic matter as evidenced by statistical analysis. Quinqueloculina seminula (foraminifera) and Cyprideis spp. (ostracodea) are associated with shallow and sandy regions and Ammonia spp. to eutrophic areas. The cluster analysis identifies six distinct regions in the MGLS based on species distribution and their relationship with environmental parameters: I - a region under the influence of marine waters; II - shallow and sandy region with high concentrations of proteins; III - a region characterized by high aerobic microorganisms activity; IV - an impacted region that is the channel passage between the lagoons; V - the most stressed region of the lagoons; and VI - the most confined area of the MGLS.

AB  - Dietary improvement not only benefits human health conditions, but also offers the potential to reduce the human food system's environmental impact. With the world's largest population and people's bourgeoning lifestyle, China's food system is set to impose increasing pressures on the environment. We evaluated the minimum environmental footprints, including carbon footprint (CF), water footprint (WF) and ecological footprint (EF), of China's food systems into 2100. The minimum footprints of healthy eating are informative to policymakers when setting the environmental constraints for food systems. The results demonstrate that the minimum CF, WF and EF all increase in the near future and peak around 2030 to 2035, under different population scenarios. After the peak, population decline and aging result in decreasing trends of all environmental footprints until 2100. Considering age-gender specific nutritional needs, the food demands of teenagers in the 14-17 year group require the largest environmental footprints across the three indicators. Moreover, men's nutritional needs also lead to larger environmental footprints than women's across all age groups. By 2100, the minimum CF, WF and EF associated with China's food systems range from 616 to 899 million tons, 654 to 953 km(3)and 6513 to 9500 billion gm(2)respectively under different population scenarios. This study builds a bridge between demography and the environmental footprints of diet and demonstrates that the minimum environmental footprints of diet could vary by up to 46% in 2100 under different demographic scenarios. The results suggest to policymakers that setting the environmental constraints of food systems should be integrated with the planning of a future demographic path.

AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify heavy metal pollution for environmental assessment of soil quality using a flexible approach based on multivariate analysis. The study was conducted using 241 soil samples collected from agricultural, urban and rangeland areas in northwestern Iran. The heavy metals causing soil pollution (SP) in the study area were determined. The efficiency of principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminate analysis (DA) were compared to identify the critical heavy metals causing SP. Fourteen soil pollution indices were developed using non-linear and linear scoring equations and different integration methods. The indices were validated using the integrated pollution and potential ecological risk indices and by comparing their ability to detect soil pollution risk levels. Chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were identified as the significant pollutant elements using PCA, and the main pollutant elements identified using DA comprised cadmium (Cd), Zn and Pb. DA yielded a better data set for indexing SP and indicated high pollution risks for Cd > Pb > Zn. Sources of heavy metals were reliably identified using PCA, variation assessment and interrelationship evaluation of soil variables. Cr, nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) were found to have geogenic sources, and anthropogenic sources controlled the accumulation of Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu in soil. Linear function and additive integration were the best scoring and integrating methods for indexing HMP. The multivariate analysis provided a reliable and rapid method for indexing and mapping soil HMP.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most commonly used herbicide worldwide. Although glyphosate is known to be toxic to aquatic organisms, it can also have stimulatory effects on small-size (empty set <2 mm) cyanobacteria (Pcy) able to metabolize and degrade glyphosate and AMPA. Several previous experimental studies in micro- and mesocosms reported increases of Pcy abundance in response to glyphosate additions, but comparable field evidence is presently unavailable. We surveyed a large geographical area in order to collect information on Pcy abundance from lakes within the Pampa region (with over three decades of glyphosate usage) and lakes from Patagonia (with virtually no history of glyphosate usage). Fifty-two Pampean lakes and 24 Patagonian lakes were surveyed. We used three indicators of glyphosate impact: herbicide concentration, the presence of phosphonate metabolism genes (responsible for glyphosate and AMPA degradation) in environmental DNA samples, and descriptors of land use in the surrounding area of each lake. We addressed three questions: (1) is there field evidence of stimulatory effects of glyphosate on picocyanobacteria abundance? (2) is the magnitude of the effects of glyphosate in natural systems comparable to that reported under controlled experimental conditions? and (3), how do the effects of glyphosate compare to the effects of other potential environmental drivers of Pcy biomass? The collected evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that long-term agricultural practices relying on glyphosate-based technologies had important effects on freshwater microbial communities, particularly by promoting increases in picocyanobacteria abundance.

AB  - Interpretation of bioassay results of both mono-contamination and complex multifactorial ones is carried out on the basis of comparison with the data of chemical analysis. Quite often, chemical analysis data correlate poorly with bioassay indicators of toxicity, which depend on both the bioavailability of pollutants, and the entire set of conditions of the contaminated area. In addition, in case of contamination with a pollutant of unknown properties or complex, multi-component contamination, it is difficult to select the necessary chemical analyses and obtain a complete picture of chemical contamination. However, the nature and source of the toxic effect may remain unexplained. Bioassay (test culture of Enchytraeus albidus) was carried out in the laboratory experiments with solutions and water extracts from the compost of sewage sludge. Lab experiments studied the possibility for the use of the antidote-1 (1-methylnicotinaniide iodide) to determine the presence of metaphos, and antidote-2 (dimercaprol sodium) to determine the presence of Cd. Test organ - icmc (E. albidus) used for ecological studies to determine the toxicity in test samples by bioassay undergo adaptation by preliminary treatment with specific antidotes. It was determined that use of adapted test organisms to evaluate the toxicity of sample that has substance sensitive to the particular antidote leads to the decrease of toxicity. Thus the use of antidotes for bioassay may close the gap to our understanding of etiology and causes of toxicity of the sample under study. Further development of the study requires meticulous approach not only because of the change to bioassay but due to requirements for recultivation procedures for contaminated samples as well.

AB  - We analysed the chemical compositions of snow, soil, and bioindicators (pine bark Pinus sylvestris, Sphagnum fallax moss bags) to assess atmospheric pollution in the vicinity of the Severonickel copper-nickel industrial complex in the Kola Peninsula. We conducted a comparative analysis of mineralogical, geochemical, and physicochemical parameters as well as the metal contents (Ca, Fe, Pb, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Cd, Sc, V, Co, and Ba) of environmental components across a 32-km pollution gradient. The mineralogical and chemical composition of soil, snow aerosols, and Sphagnum fallax moss bags all corresponded to the metallogeny of the research area and the ore specialisation of the enterprise (Ni, Cu, Co, and V). Solid aerosols consisted of rock-forming and accessory minerals as well as technogenic formations (slag particles and aggregates composed of Ni-Fe-Co +/- Cu). The concentration of metals in soils, aerosols, snow water, and pine bark significantly exceeded their background values. The reconstruction of new technologies in the Severonickel smelter and recent reduction in emissions did not significantly improve the state of the different landscape components. The calculation of dust, metal, and ionic loads from snow surveys and moss bags showed comparable results. Technogenic emissions were higher in summer due to the increase in atmospheric dust. The low pH of soils and snow water reflected the geochemical conditions of the landscape and increased metal mobility in the environment. The high total content of Ni, Cu, and Co and their mobile forms in soils contributed to the high accumulation of metals in pine bark; this method can therefore be used as an accurate indicator of environmental degradation.

AB  - The search for more sustainable construction materials, capable of complying with quality standards and current innovation policies, aimed at saving natural resources and reducing global pollution, is one of the greatest present societal challenges. In this study, an innovative recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is designed and produced based on the use of a coarse recycled aggregate (CRA) crushing concrete with electric arc furnace slags as aggregate. These slags are a by-product of the steelmaking industry and their use, which avoids the use of natural aggregates, is a new trend in concrete and pavement technology. This paper has investigated the effects of incorporating this type of CRA in concrete at several replacement levels (0%, 20%, 50% and 100% by volume), by means of the physical, mechanical and durability characterization of the mixes. The analysis of the results has allowed the benefits and disadvantages of these new CRAs to be established, by comparing them with those of a natural aggregate concrete (NAC) mix (with 0% CRA incorporation) and with the data available in the literature for concrete made with more common CRA based on construction and demolition waste (CDW). Compared to NAC, similar compressive strength and tensile strength values for all replacement ratios have been obtained. The modulus of elasticity, the resistance to chloride penetration and the resistance to carbonation are less affected by these CRA than when CRA from CDW waste is used. Slight increases in bulk density over 7% were observed for total replacement. Overall, functionally good mechanical and durability properties have been obtained.

AB  - In the vicinity of a tipping point, critical transitions occur when small changes in an input condition cause sudden, large, and often irreversible changes in the state of a system. Many natural systems ranging from ecosystems to molecular biosystems are known to exhibit critical transitions in their response to stochastic perturbations. In diseases, an early prediction of upcoming critical transitions from a healthy to a disease state by using early-warning signals is of prime interest due to potential application in forecasting disease onset. Here, we analyze cell-fate transitions between different phenotypes (epithelial, hybridepithelial/mesenchymal [E/M], and mesenchymal states) that are implicated in cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. These transitions are mediated by a mutually inhibitory feedback loop- microRNA-200/ZEB-driven by the levels of transcription factor SNAIL. We find that the proximity to tipping points enabling these transitions among different phenotypes can be captured by critical slowing down-based early-warning signals, calculated from the trajectory of ZEB messenger RNA level. Further, the basin stability analysis reveals the unexpectedly large basin of attraction for a hybrid-E/M phenotype. Finally, we identified mechanisms that can potentially elude the transition to a hybridE/M phenotype. Overall, our results unravel the early-warning signals that can be used to anticipate upcoming epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal transitions. With the emerging evidence about the hybrid-E/M phenotype being a key driver of metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor relapse, our results suggest ways to potentially evade these transitions, reducing the fitness of cancer cells and restricting tumor aggressiveness.

AB  - The work was addressed to study the sensitivity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to chemical pollution in the hepatopancreas of the bioindicator organism Mytilus galloprovincialis in the context of a multimarker approach in view of ecotoxicological biomonitoring and assessment application. The study was carried out by means of a transplanting experiment in the field, using caged organisms from an initial population exposed in the field in two areas of interest: Augusta-Melilli-Priolo, an heavy polluted industrial site (eastern Sicily, Italy), and Brucoli (eastern Sicily, Italy) an area not affected by any contamination and selected as a reference site. Mussels in Augusta presented a significant increase in the digestive gland CA activity and gene expression compared to the animals caged in the control site of Brucoli. The CA response in animals from the polluted site was paralleled by proliferation/increase in the size of lysosomes, as assessed by Lysosensor green charged cells, induction of metallothionein, up-regulation of hif-alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor), metabolic changes associated with protein metabolism, and changes in the condition factor. Biological responses data were integrated with information about sediment chemical analysis and metal residue concentration in animal soft tissues.
   In conclusion, obtained results highlighted the induction of CAs in the hepatopancreas of Mytilus galloprovincialis following to pollution exposure, and demonstrated its suitability to be integrated into a multimarker approach for the detection and characterization of the stress status induced by pollution exposure in this bioindicator organism.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test whether the water quality phytoplankton assemblage index adapted for rivers (Qr index) is useful to characterize the water quality of a neotropical stream. We were interested also in inferring the main pollutants through a phytoplankton functional trait characterization and assessing the phytoplankton groups which may influence the Qr index final estimations. Monthly sampling of environmental variables and phytoplankton were done in three sites (S1, S2, and S3). Phytoplankton was classified according to Reynolds Functional Groups (RFG) and water quality estimation was performed using the Qr index. Principal coordinates (PCO) and PERMANOVA were applied to identify the main pollutants through the RFG. RFG linkage to Qr values was assessed by general linear models (GLM). "Moderate" water quality was found in S1 the whole year, in all sampling stations during the winter, and in summer-autumn in S2. "Regular" water quality was found in S3 during the summer-autumn, and S2-S3 during the spring. S1 and S2 showed eutrophic, standing, or mix waters whereas S3 had high organic matter content and eutrophic conditions. Despite some RFG (X-1 and MP) being linked to high Qr values and some other (M, S1 and Z) to low, their dominance did not influence water quality estimation performed by the Qr. We conclude that the Qr index was useful for assessing the water quality. Though RFG were valuable for inferring eutrophication, organic pollution, and mixing, but their dominance does not necessarily have a direct effect on the final Qr estimation.

AB  - The broken phosphorus (P) cycle has led to widespread eutrophication of freshwaters. Despite reductions in anthropogenic nutrient inputs that have led to improvement in the chemical status of running waters, corresponding improvements in their ecological status are often not observed. We tested a novel combination of complementary statistical modeling approaches, including random-effect regression trees and compositional and ordinary linear mixed models, to examine the potential reasons for this disparity, using low-frequency regulatory data available to catchment managers. A benthic Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) was linked to potential stressors, including nutrient concentrations, soluble reactive P (SRP) loads from different sources, land cover, and catchment hydrological characteristics. Modeling suggested that SRP, traditionally considered the bioavailable component, may not be the best indicator of ecological impacts of P, as shown by a stronger and spatially more variable negative relationship between total P (TP) concentrations and TDI. Nitrate-N (p < 0.001) and TP (p = 0.002) also showed negative relationship with TDI in models where land cover was not included. Land cover had the strongest influence on the ecological response. The positive effect of seminatural land cover (p < 0.001) and negative effect of urban land cover (p = 0.030) may be related to differentiated bioavailability of P fractions in catchments with different characteristics (e. g., P loads from point vs. diffuse sources) as well as resilience factors such as hydro-morphology and habitat condition, supporting the need for further research into factors affecting this stressor-response relationship in different catchment types. Advanced statistical modeling indicated that to achieve desired ecological status, future catchment-specific mitigation should target P impacts alongside multiple stressors.

AB  - The recurrence of fires has increased considerably due to human activity, affecting even forests where traditionally fire is uncommon. In this study, we verify the effects of degradation caused by fire in the Canarian laurel forests, which is a subtropical forest formation restricted to the humid montane areas of these Macaronesian islands. We evaluated the effect of fire by comparing a series of burned plots corresponding to fires from 1960, 1984, 1995, to 2012 with geographically proximate and comparable unburned plots in the Garajonay National Park (La Gomera Island, Spain). We focused on three aspects that are immediately altered by fire: forest structure, floristic composition, and microclimate. These aspects have been quantified using (a) tree density, the Pielou index using tree height classes, and DBH for the vertical structure of the forest; (b) DCA, the Bray Curtis dissimilarity index, and a species indicator analysis for the floristic composition; and (c) temperature and relative humidity for microclimate under three canopy cover conditions. Our results reveal that, overall, structural complexity and its composition in the burned areas have barely reached 40% and 35%, respectively, when compared with unburned areas, and recovery mainly depends on time since fire. Additionally, burned plots presented more pioneer species, a higher density of trees, and climatic variables tend to have a wider range throughout the day. These data reveal the long time span that this ecosystem needs for recovery to a prefire state and how it may be more prone to subsequent fire events.

AB  - Whereas research primarily focuses on understanding under what conditions sudden transitions in the dynamics and functioning of ecological systems may occur, the scale and complexity of ecosystems limit our capacity to achieve this. Indicators of resilience may help circumvent such limitation by signalling the proximity of ecological systems close to an abrupt transition. However, their successful application strongly depends on the ecosystem under question. Therefore, if we aim to use resilience indicators for ecological management in practice, we need to understand where and how they can be reliably monitored. Here, we test the performance of resilience indicators across species in simple modules of competition to help recognize best-indicator species in a community. We show that differences in species sensitivity to disturbances in a community is affected by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized system at equilibrium, We then use simulated time series to compare trends in variance and autocorrelation across species and at community level. We found high heterogeneity in the strength of the indicators across species, while community-based indicators scored better on average than indicators at species level. Looking at species features, we found that collapsing and invading species showed strongest trends, but we observed no relationship between the number of species interaction links and indicators. Lastly, we explored whether it is possible to identify best-indicator species based on their contribution to community variability using eigenvector decomposition methods Our results suggest that successfully identifying a best-indicator species for critical transitions in multispecies communities is not an easy task.

AB  - Water-level variations are an internal aspect of lake ecosystems that play a key role in structuring aquatic diversity and providing ecosystem services. In this study, the hydrologic alteration of Dongting Lake induced by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) was assessed using indicators of hydrologic alteration and range of variability approach. The results demonstrate a declining trend in autumn water level (0.52-2.26m) and 5-35days' advancement for date of minimum annual water level because of the impound of water by the TGD in early autumn. The spatial patterns in the degree of the indicators of hydrologic alteration were different among the sub-lake regions. Annual minimum water level and timing of annual extreme water level suffered a high degree of alteration in the eastern part of the lake, whereas autumn water level, date of minimum water level, and number of reversals in the western part of the lake showed a high degree of alteration. The average integrated degree of hydrologic alteration (D-0) for Dongting Lake was 50.40%, indicating that the hydrologic regime suffered a moderate alteration. The most ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators are critical for understanding eco-hydrology. On the basis of principal component analysis, the five selected ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators were 90-day minimum, date of minimum, high pulse duration, date of maximum, and May water level. Further studies are required to understand the impact of the TGD on water conditions in Dongting Lake, especially related to the response of the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - A human-made environmental disaster due to the shipwrecked of Costa Concordia cruise vessel on the Tuscan Island of Giglio (Italy) coast and the possible pollutants release has been feared, so requiring the activation of removal operations and the monitoring of the marine environment. In the present study, the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile was used as a bioindicator for the impact of the Costa Concordia accident on the marine and coastal habitat. Different P. oceanica samples were collected in the shipwrecked site under different light conditions. Using high-performance thin-layer chromatography, metabolic analysis of the samples was carried out in order to highlight possible changes in the secondary metabolism due to the permanent shading and the presence of pollutant traces. Moreover, sample mutagenicity, as a consequence of the possible absorption of environmental toxicants leaked by the wreck, was assessed by the Ames test. The results highlighted the permanence of the Concordia-induced alteration in the plant secondary metabolites. However, absorption of chemical pollutants and carcinogens was not reported; this point was confirmed by the lack of mutagenic effects found for the samples tested. Our results clearly evidence that the environmental impact of Costa Concordia wreck and removal operations on P. oceanica was mainly due to the lack of light in the marine habitat. Present methodological approach, which combines metabolomic and genetic ecotoxicological analysis, could represent a suitable strategy to evaluate the impact of human disasters on the ecosystem and to monitor the environmental changes.

AB  - The distribution of wetland vegetation is significantly influenced by soil environmental factors. Few studies have been conducted on the restoration processes used on the degraded wetlands of the Tarim River. We surveyed the vegetation communities of the Tarim River Basin, and their responses to soil environmental factors using two methods of indicator species classification (TWINSPAN): detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) ordination. Results showed that Tarim River wetland species were limited, the community structure was simple, and there were no endemic species. There were only 34 plant species in the study area, and 12 families were represented by only 1 species. Wetland flora in the Tarim River Basin consisted mainly of herbaceous plants, with only a few shrub and tree species. These results show that the degradation of the Tarim River wetland is severe. The vegetation community was divided into 4 formations using TWINSPAN, and 3 formations using DCA. Both methods showed clear distribution boundaries, and the DCA also provided a good reflection of the vegetation and soil environment. The DCCA ordination showed that the distribution of vegetation in the study area was affected by a combination of elevation, salinity, and soil moisture. Pairwise correlations also showed that vegetation diversity was significantly correlated with elevation. Therefore, we suggest that the process of restoring the degraded wetland cannot solely rely on restoring the hydrological conditions in the Tarim River Basin, as topography and soil salinity must also be taken into account. These results should be integrated into the vegetation restoration and management plans of the Tarim River wetland and could be important for the ecological management of the Tarim River Basin.

AB  - Crop yields in southern African sugar industries are frequently limited by unfavourable chemical and biological conditions in soils. In addressing these problems, growers make use of various organic and inorganic products, depending on the nature of the limitation. However, the efficacies of numerous products currently in use remain untested. This investigation involved the evaluation of 12 products in a short-term (8 weeks) pot incubation study using a sandy, acid Cartref topsoil. The organic products included were chicken litter (CL), mushroom compost substrate (SMS), flyash, filterpress, vermicast, liquid CMS (CMS_L), and granular CMS (CMS_G). Inorganic products were the liming agents, dolomitic lime and Calmasil, and gypsum, Langfos, and quarry dust. Short term (3-day) CO2 release, a sensitive indicator of biological activity, increased significantly with the application of the liming agents, filterpress, CL and flyash. Mineral N levels were increased significantly by liming agents, CL and CMS_G. Potassium levels were unaffected by inorganic products but increased with the application of CL and CMS_L. Resin-extractable P levels increased with CL, filterpress and CMS_G; Calmasil, too, increased resin P levels, with this being probably due to the Si in the product promoting P release from soil colloids. Of all the products tested, only lime and Calmasil increased pH significantly. Acid saturation was decreased by liming agents, gypsum and quarry dust, while CMS_G increased acid saturation, probably due to nitrification of the ammoniacal N in the product. It is concluded that short-term incubation studies of this kind provide a useful alternative to more costly field trials for characterising the efficacies and modes of action of various soil ameliorants.

AB  - The flow regulation that results from the implantation of dams causes consequences to the river ecosystems due to the modification on the characteristics of the hydrologic regime. The investigation of these changes become relevant, mainly in semi-arid regions where there is a great amount of these hydraulic structures and lack of such analyzes. Considering the above, this paper aims to evaluate the Dundee Hydrological Regime Alteration Method (DHRAM) through the classification of the degree of impact of dams located on rivers Itapicuru, Paraguacu and their tributaries, verifying the adequacy of its use to represent the semi-arid hydrologic regime. Thereby, the DHRAM was applied in three versions: considering the thresholds that define the scores to classify the degree of impact in its original set (accordingly to Black et al. (2005)); with the adjustment of those thresholds to local conditions; and, with the regrouping of variables and adjustment of thresholds. The results showed that the method in its original set is applicable to semi-arid rivers, however it tends to be very restrictive against the high natural hydrologic variability characteristic of these rivers, and it ends up pointing to a high degree of alteration for dams that are known for not causing a very siginifcant flow regulation. The DHRAM with the regrouping of variables and the adjustment of thresholds presented the classification that approached the most to the known characteristics of the studied dams, being useful for the evaluation of the impact of dams still in project, and also to guide the adoption of operating rules that minimize the most significant hydrologic alterations that are identified.

AB  - Most populations of large herbivores are hunted over much of their distribution. The size of these populations over time must be monitored to detect responses to management actions and environmental changes. Here, I first review the limits in precision and accuracy of most methods used to estimate population size in wild herbivores. I then show how density-dependence of age structure can be used to monitor harvested populations, using simulated and empirical data. Accurate estimates of population size are difficult, costly in time and effort, and mostly impracticable at a large scale. Indices are widely used to monitor population size at a large scale, but are rarely tested, and assumptions of constant detection rates over years are questionable. In a recent approach, the effects of population density on habitat quality and individual performance were used as ecological indicators to infer changes in population size over time. Populations of large mammals are strongly age structured. In harvested populations, density dependence and harvest affect age structure through changes in age-specific vital rates. Because age and sex-specific vital rates are density-dependent, changes over time in age structure should reflect the response of population to changes in environmental conditions such as density and harvest rate. Time series of age-structure may be used as an ecological indicator to monitor harvested populations, and to infer their demographic trajectory, especially when used within a set of ecological indicators. However, attention needs to be paid in the use of ecological indicators because of the potential bias introduced in data collection by hunter selectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative indicators are a common means of assessing the complex dimensions of a sustainable freshwater system, and framing scientific knowledge for policy and decision makers. There is an abundance of indicators in use, but considerable variation in terms of what is being measured and how indicators are applied, making it difficult for end-users to identify suitable assessment methods. We review 95 water-related indices and analyze them along their normative, procedural, and systemic dimensions to better understand how problems are being defined, highlight overlaps and differences, and identify the context(s) in which a particular index is useful. We also analyze the intended use, end-users, and geographic scale of application for each index. We find that risk assessment is the most common application (n = 25), with indices in this group typically focusing either on hazard identification (biophysical assessments) or vulnerability of human populations. Indices that measure freshwater ecological health are not explicitly linking these indicators to ecosystem services, and in fact the concept of ecosystem services is rarely (n = 3) used for indicator selection. Resource managers are the most common group of intended end-users (n = 25), but while 28 indices involved consultation with potential end-users, 11 did not specify an intended use. We conclude that indices can be applied as solution-oriented tools, evaluating scenarios and identifying tradeoffs among services and beneficiaries, rather than only assessing and monitoring existing conditions. Finally, earlier engagement of end-users is recommended to help researchers find the right balance among indices' salience, legitimacy, and credibility and thus improve their decision relevance.

AB  - Squat lobsters are highly diversified and widespread decapods, of which only three species form pelagic swarms. Here we infer the expansion of Munida gregaria populations in the Beagle Channel and the Argentine Patagonian Shelf by means of acoustic surveys of pelagic swarms. We also describe the habitat characteristics in which these swarms occur. Acoustic data was collected during three multidisciplinary scientific cruises on board of the RN Puerto Deseado during 2009, 2012 and 2014. Despite differences in the environmental conditions between the two surveyed areas, between 2009 and 2014 pelagic swarms increased their occurrence and abundance both in the Beagle Channel and on the Argentine Patagonian Shelf. Towards the end of the studied period, pelagic swarms of M. gregaria occurred in new locations, supporting the notion of a population expansion. Within the Beagle Channel swarm expansions were more marked than on the Patagonian Shelf. We here postulate that M. gregaria expansions occur in association with productive areas of the Argentine continental shelf, such as frontal zones, favoured by the squat lobster phenotypic plasticity that permit to exploit resources in both the neritic and benthic environments. At a regional scale on the Patagonian Shelf, three main groups of pelagic swarms of M. gregaria were clearly associated to respective frontal zones. The information presented here is necessary to understand fluctuations in both distribution and abundance patterns of a key species on the Argentine continental shelf. These fluctuations could be direct or indirect indicators of changes in the ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - More and more silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been released into the aquatic environment due to their widespread use, which may result in harmful effects on aquatic organisms. Environmental risk assessments of AgNPs on aquatic organisms in the natural environment (including light, sound, etc.) are indispensable. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the influence of light on the toxicity of AgNPs to Tetrahymena pyriformis. Silver nanoparticles, which were synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate with sodium borohydride, ranged in size from 5 to 20?nm with most particles approximately 10?nm. The authors performed AgNPs toxicity assays under a simulated natural environment with sunlight. The results indicated that the toxicity of AgNPs is higher than silver ion in the environment without light, but under the light condition, the toxicity of AgNPs decreased greatly. After 24?h of incubation with AgNPs, the inhibition ratio was 69.2 +/- 7% in the dark and 35.5 +/- 2% in the light, and the degree of inhibition was reduced by 33.7%. However, the effect of light on Ag+ could be negligible. Further investigation indicated that the light irradiation could induce the growth of AgNPs and sequentially form bulk agglomeration. This decreased the surface area and the number of bare Ag atoms, resulting in a slower release rate and less Ag+ ions released from AgNPs. At the same time, bulk agglomeration induced the deposition of part of the AgNPs to the aquatic bottom, which decreased the amount of AgNPs existing in water. All these phenomena led to the weakened toxicity of AgNPs in a light irradiation environment. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 16301638. (C) 2012 SETAC

AB  - Marine cage aquaculture has the potential to severely impact Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows and its associated fauna. In order to assess the impact of fish farming in a littoral bay of Corsica, France, physico-chemical (mud and organic matter) and biological (density and compactness of P. oceanica beds and associated macrofauna) variables have been examined in two stations putatively impacted to different degrees (St1 and St2) and in two unimpacted stations (Controls: C1 and C2). Principal Component Analysis of meadow structural variables (shoot density and compactness of matte) and abiotic variables (mud and organic matter percentage into sediment) highlighted differences among stations and, particularly, differences between impacted stations and controls. Results from C1 and C2 totally overlapped. St1 was the station which differed the most from controls. Compared with control stations, St1 and St2 were characterized by higher values of organic matter and mud and by lower values of shoot density and matte compactness. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) did not show significant differences between C1 and C2 in the structure of macrofauna assemblages, whereas significant differences between the two impacted sites and between these and the control conditions emerged. Differences in assemblages were well correlated with the measured abiotic variables. The analysis showed that the species most responsible for difference among stations were typical of muddy sediment with high organic matter content. These species had higher mean abundance values at impacted stations than at controls. This study suggests fish farming determines an increase of organic matter and sedimentation, which resolve in changes in structural properties of the seagrass meadows and, consequently, changes in the associated macrofauna assemblages.

AB  - The marine primary producers assimilate the atmospheric CO2 to form the organic carbon in surface water. The organic carbon then settles down through the water column and is removed from the oceans by final preservation in sediments in the form of petroleum or nature gases. The reconstruction of paleoproductivity will thus improve our understanding of the biological processes in the formation of fossil energy resource and help to locate new sites for future exploration. In this study, biorelated elements P, Cd, Al, Ba, as well as redox sensitive element Mo, were analyzed in the 448 rock samples collected from Permian strata at the Shangsi Section, Guangyuan, Northeast Sichuan in China. On the basis of the Ti content, the nondetrital contents of P, Ca, and Al, denoted as P-xs, Cd-xs, and Al-xs, were calculated and found to coincide with the TOC content throughout the whole section, with some enrichment intervals being found in the middle part of Chihsia Formation, topmost Maokou Formation, and Dalong Formation. This suggests that the biorelated elements could be used as proxies for the paleoproductivity here in this section. Ba-xs, a paleoproductivity indicator widely used in the paleoceanography, shows insignificant correlation with TOC, P-xs, Cd-xs, and Al-xs, probably arising from the loss of biological barium in anoxic conditions. Compiled with the data of TOC content and P-xs, Cd-xs, and Al-xs, three episodes of enhanced paleoproductivity were identified in Permian strata including the middle part of Chihsia Formation, topmost Maokou Formation, and Dalong Formation.

AB  - The head capsules of chironomids (Insecta: Diptera) are well preserved in sediments and can be recognised to a high taxonomic level, usually genus and sometimes species. Work on lake sediments has shown that they can be accurate indicators of water temperature, oxygen regimes, and nutrient status (particularly total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a), as well as heavy metal pollution. No systematic chironomid analyses, however, have previously been undertaken on archaeological deposits. In order to address this we assessed the use of chironomids in three types of archaeological deposit; firstly, a lake core at the edge of a lake settlement (crannog), secondly, a palaeochannel infill adjacent to a multi-period settlement site and lastly, a Roman well deposit from a floodplain environment. The chironomid assemblages are shown to vary significantly both between and within the sites and reflect the immediate environment and the adjacent area. The lake sediment assemblage reflects the construction of the crannog through elevated levels of organic detritus, wood and woody debris. The palaeochannel assemblage reveals changing natural conditions and nutrient enrichment probably associated with settlement during the Saxon period. The well assemblage is taxonomically restricted and indicative of organic debris, dead plant material, animal dung and possibly human effluent deposited after abandonment of the well. Dry storage of the palaeochannel and well sediments for several years did not appear to affect the concentration or state of preservation of the head capsules. The chironomid reconstructions are shown to provide an additional indicator of human activity which has the potential to provide quantitative data on the character of aquatic environments associated with archaeological sites.

AB  - Forest genetic resources are considered here in a global perspective, including both cultivated and wild populations. Human interference on global genetic resources results from the impact of different activities: (i) breeding and selection, (ii) seed transfer, (iii) plant population management activities, (iv) alteration of the environment. Expected genetic consequences of these activities were reviewed and revised according to the recent literature. Research on domestication in crop plants reveals that drastic selection can still retain a significant level of genetic diversity including diversity of some genes involved in the selected traits. More important than the impact of breeding and selection in trees, the impact of seed transfer on the whole resource is complex, depending on the origin and genetic diversity of the transplanted material, as well as on the environmental conditions and genetic diversity of the local population in the destination site. Among silvicultural practices, the regeneration phase has a great potential for reducing genetic diversity, but various regeneration practices may result in high genetic diversity. Other treatments, like thinning, may also interfere with the demographic parameters which shape genotic diversity. Thus, different silvicultural systems will have different impacts on the genetic resources of target species but no simple ranking can be made in that respect. Attention should also be given to the genetic resources of non-target species which may be severely affected. Finally, a major impact is suspected from modifications in the biotic and abiotic environment: this should be further investigated. Monitoring the genetic resources globally requires the development of criteria and indicators: some, recent research orientations serving this objective were listed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The studies completed in our subproject focused on the research subject "Austria - space and society" and dealt both with regional differences of modernization processes as well as variable future perspectives of agriculture. It has been characteristic that since World War II both the agricultural population as well as the amount of farms have continuously decreased. However the number of farm enterprises have diminished much slower due to full-time farms being transformed into part-time farms with additional or subsidiary income before finally being abandoned. The results of these surveys reveal that these developments, that can be easily compared to "silent revolutions" (Fassmann 1995) in other al eas, are closely tied to other changes in society. The natural disadvantages and the unfavourable business structures have additionally caused a delay of agricultural modernization. Today most of the farmers are aware of the fact that they must be flexible and will have to struggle rigorously in order for their farms to remain in existence. Therefore in the last decade above all small farms and farms in mountainous areas have been willing to convert to biofarming. However they lack the necessary (financial) conditions for profound changes.
   The acceptance of high-tech, full-time farms by the population is extremely small. Accordingly the local farms in Austria will continue to remain in the foreground. This is not only an economic structure but also a very obvious lifestyle, its evolution will have an effect on the development of the entire society. With this in mind the social decline of the farmers in the rural areas is especially alarming. This is suggested by several indicators investigated by us, e.g. marriage behavior. In spite of this the next better educated generation of farmers is still willing to continue and to adapt an ecologically oriented land-use.

AB  - The problem of diagnosis in the early and preclinical stages of diseases is important in the prevention of occupational diseases and their complications, because this is the key to the timely initiation of treatment, the implementation of preventive measures. Chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy (CLSR) or low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common diseases in the structure of occupational pathology in Ukraine, which usually develops in those of working professions associated with physical activity, forced work posture, effect of high levels of general vibration, etc. The highest levels of occupational morbidity are recorded in the coal industry, which accounts for about 80% of occupational pathology in Ukraine. Above 1600 cases of CLRS are diagnosed annually in the country. A risk factor for the development of the CLSR is osteoporosis, which arises due to the impairment of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of bone tissue and is characterized by a decrease in its strength, an impairment of microarchitecture with a further increase in risk of fractures. One of the modern methods of assessing condition of bone tissue is determination of the content of macro- and trace elements (MaE and ME) in the biological environments of patients. Ca, Al, Mg, B, P are the most important in the formation and development of bone and connective tissue. To date, studies of bone tissue status in patients with CLSR of professional etiology have not been conducted (small in numbers). Goal to determine the role of essential elements Ca, Al, Mg, B, P in serum and urine in the formation of occupational CLSR in miners. The research was conducted in 20 miners with CLRS (slaughterer, mining worker of a clearing face (MWCF), drifter) of coal mining industry of Donbass and Lviv-Volyn basins. The results were analyzed in two groups: I group consisted ofpatients with 10-15 years of work experience (n=10), II group with 16-32 years of work experience (n=10). The control group included 22 patients without pathology of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy method (ICPAE) was used to determine the MaE and ME concentrations. The study revealed that the average serum aluminum (Al) concentration in miners with occupational CLSR (115.07 mu mol/l) exceeded control group level (3.3 mu mol/l) by almost 30 times (p<0.05). Serum boron (B) concentration in both age groups (25.90 mu Mol/l and 19.43 mu Mol/l, respectively) were lower than in the control (62.90 mu Mol/l), (p<0.05). The average serum calcium (Ca) concentration in patients with occupational CLSR (2.82 mmol/l) was 1.3 times higher than the same indicator in the control group (2.16 mmol/l), with a significant difference between the two age groups (p<0.05). It was revealed that the average level of phosphorus (P) in the urine of patients with occupational CLSR (19.0 mmol/l) significantly exceeded its content in patients of control group (11.96 mmol/l) (p<0.05). The concentration ofAl in the urine ofpatients with CLSR in both age groups (1.26 mu Mol/l and 1.334 mu Mol/l, respectively) was higher that in control (0.85 mu Mol/l), (p<0.05). Reduction of Ca and Mg levels in the serum of miners in increasing work experience in harmful working conditions, exceeding average concentration of aluminum in patients' blood compared to the normative value and indicators of the control group patients was established.

AB  - The paper presents the analysis of changes in land function and in total surface coverage of local development plan in Skorzewo in the years 1995-2012.
   The area of study included Skorzewo geodesic precinct located in direct neighborhood of Poznan city, where intense changes associated with the process of suburbanization take place, e.g. population growth rate in the years 1995 2012 was about 394.
   Principles modifying the spatial policy of local government bodies and central government bodies, as well as the scope and procedures in land function allocation for specific uses, and identification of principles of their management and development are specified in the Act of 27 March 2003 on spatial planning and land development (SPaLD Act) (The Journal of Law "Dziennik Ustaw" of 2012, item 647 with later amendments).
   Studies on conditions and directions of spatial management (hereinafter referred to as the communes studies) and local spatial development plans (local plans) are developed at the local level of spatial planning. Communes studies determine the spatial policy of a given commune, including e.g. principles of spatial development, while not being an act of local law, and its stipulations are binding for the organs of the commune when preparing local plans (art. 9. of SPaLD Act).
   Land function, allocation of public investments as well as types of management and conditions of land building development are specified in the local plan (art. 4. of SPaLD Act), which is an act of local law. Moreover, local spatial development plans obligatorily specify e.g. principles of environmental protection, nature conservation and protection of cultural landscape, boundaries and types of land development or protected objects, specified on the basis of separate regulations, including e.g. those at risk of floods.
   The analysis carried out in the work was based on planning, statistical and registration data of two decades from 1992 to 2012. The main research concerned changes in land function residential buildings. Moreover, local spatial development plans prepared for Skorzewo, Dopiewo community study and the project of its change have been analized in terms of quality and quantity.
   The primary source material in the work were local development plans adopted in the years 1992-2012 for the village Skorzewo. According to the recent history of Poland, the analyzed spatial planning documents were divided into three groups:
   I. The general plan of 1992,
   II. Local development plans, which have been repealed (enacted before 1995, or plans that have lost power as a result of the adoption of the new local development plans),
   III. Current local development plans (enacted in 1996-2012).
   In connection with the application over the years a variety of indications in the Local Development Plan, for the purpose of analysis, they have been standardized by the Minister of Infrastructure on the required scope of the draft local development plan (Journal of Laws of 2003, No. 164, poz.1587).
   Analysis of local development plan were made with the use of software company IMAGIS Mapinfo version 10.5. Therefore, the research methodology was due in large part to the tools used in the form of geographic information system.
   Qualitative analysis of planning documents from the years 1992-2012 showed that, depending on the date of enactment, their details and entry form changes. The existing local plans are used accurate records and is given the more number of urban indicators, than in the plans, which had lost power. This show undertaken by the commune attempt to manage the process provides of suburbanization through local plans. Negatively about the spatial planning in Skorzewo geodesic district provides low average area of enacting local plans (3.3 ha for the years 1995-2012) and advantage plans smallest up to 1 ha (42%).

AB  - The intensity of disturbance plays a key role in shaping the biodiversity and hence it is a good tool for assessing community changes occurring in the Western Bieszczady, an area depopulated after World War II. Based on sampling of acidophilous mountain beech forest phytocoenosis repeated after 50 years, an analysis of plant biodiversity changes was conducted. The study focused on changes in the number of species, Shannon's indicator, spatial distribution and coverage of specific ecological groups of species. The results confirm an undergoing process of regeneration of straitened phytocoenoses from 1958-1961, in which a slow improvement of the trophic conditions can be observed.

AB  - A multi-objective optimization method was developed for the design of trigeneration plants. The optimization is carried out on technical, economical, energetic and environmental performance indicators in a multi-objective optimization framework. Both construction (equipment sizes) and discrete operational (pricing tariff schemes and operational strategy) variables were optimized based on realistic conditions. The problem is solved using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. An example of a trigeneration system in a 300 bed hospital was studied in detail in order to demonstrate the design procedure, the economic and energetic performance of the plant, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed approach even under fluctuating energy prices.

It is important to have a good understanding of the ecological quality of Venice Lagoon sediments, in order to: i) define and locate areas where a threat to the environment is present and therefore an intervention is needed (i.e. in situ assessment and management); and ii) define sustainable and environmentally correct ways of managing sediments which are to be dredged for navigational purposes or in relation to other interventions (i.e., ex situ management).
   Methods. To examine how various, regional and international SQGs 'classed' screening risk in Venice Lagoon sediments, data on median contaminant levels in surface sediments in Venice Lagoon resulting from a literature review were compared to a range of local and international sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). Then data on sediment contaminant levels in various areas and sub-basins of Venice Lagoon (main Lagoon, Porto Marghera and Venice City Canals) and in other regional and international transitional and coastal ecosystems with various levels of human impact (urbanization and industrialization) were evaluated based upon a selected consensus-based SQG. Finally, screening sediment quality for all of Venice Lagoon was mapped and contoured, relative to this consensus-based SQG and briefly compared with direct toxicity measurement through a battery of bioassays.
   Results. SQGs allow the sediment areas to be put in terms of potential, or screening, risk. Although there were some differences depending upon which specific SQGs were applied, the Venice SQGs and other international SQGs provided the same general picture of screening risk in Venice Lagoon despite geographic differences. Venice Lagoon South has the lowest screening risk levels, Venice Lagoon Central/North has the highest (and is nearest to the Porto Marghera and Venice City Canals sites).
   Discussion. The Venice Lagoon sediments have hazard quotients on the low end of the range of moderately urbanized and industrialized sites and higher than background case studies reviewed. Hg levels in the Venice Lagoon were generally higher than equivalent sites, while other contaminants were either equivalent or lower. In Porto Marghera (PM) and Venice City Canals (VC), for many contaminants of interest, PM, and for some, VC sediments have the highest levels of any case study reviewed. Ranges are high, so in all cases, remedial or disposal decisions should be based upon site-specific (and preferably tiered) data.
   Conclusions. The use of hazard quotients makes it possible to compare screening risks due to different mixes of contaminants within and between sites, but results should be interpreted with caution. How these sites rank when compared to some of the other highly industrialized sites depends upon how data are synthesized and communicated. Actual risk must be evaluated using a weight of evidence (WOE) approach, as site-specific bioavailability and background levels will differ both regionally and internationally.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Whilst there are subtle differences, the current Venice sediment classifications (A, B and C) 'performed' in a similar manner to SQGs in similar classes, suggesting that regions of Venice Lagoon would not be classified much differently if other SQGs such as TEL, ERL, PEL, ERM or AET were adopted. The Italian sediment quality objectives, on the other hand, are significantly more conservative than any other SQGs examined, with the exception of the Flemish Reference values. A number of European nations are considering criteria based upon contaminant levels in relatively pristine modern sites, or based upon derivations of historical (pre-anthropogenic) contaminant levels. When used as a standard, such an approach tacks discriminating power, designating almost all sediments within an urbanized or industrialized region as of concern, or even, in many cases, mandating action or prohibiting various management approaches in a large percentage of sediments. While generally based upon the laudable desire to return sites to unimpacted levels, there is a risk that overprotective criteria have the opposite effect: by designating too large a percentage of sediments as requiring management or control, limited resources may be improperly allocated. Which set of SQGs is most 'appropriate' for the Venice Lagoon sediments depends upon the questions being asked. However, the Venice classifications are currently being used as pass-fail criteria, without consideration of site-specific conditions. The fact that they performed similarly to SQGs in similar classes suggests that any work to develop more site-specific SQGs (with the same general decision classes) would probably not make much difference in how sediments were ultimately classified and managed unless the fundamental approach was changed from a pass-fail to a tiered and WOE approach integrated in a comprehensive decision framework. For Venice Lagoon, and for other regions, although SQGs should be developed with care, in a scientifically defensible and risk-based manner, an equally or more important issue to be addressed is their role in overall decision frameworks.

Materials were collected during the breeding season in three consecutive years.. Based on the indicators of fluctuating asymmetry in both species, grades characterizing the developmental stability of their populations are identified. These grades are indicative for the quality of the environment and are used for assessment of the biotope, carried out parallel and independently from the physicochemical analysis.

TI  - An approach for relating total performance improvement with financial results
T2  - TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - For decades, top and middle managers have been conditioned to evaluate performance mainly with financial indicators. However, for a business to survive and succeed in today's complex and uncertain environment, it is imperative to monitor performance on the basis of measures that relate to quality, response time to market changes and productivity. Such indicators are the 'vital signs' that determine competitiveness, because they reflect the effectiveness of efforts to improve the performance of business processes through total quality management or other approaches. Today, we have no methods to relate improvements in business processes to economic results. This paper proposes such an approach, to assist management in evaluating more reliably the impact of process improvements that lead to greater customer satisfaction on economic results.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess, whether organic dairy farming has increased the biological diversity of field boundary vegetation when compared to conventional dairy farming, and if increasing organic farming duration affected diversity. The diversity of plant species in field boundaries was found to be higher under organic than under conventional farming. Analysis of community patterns revealed that ruderal species and species with affinity to nutrient rich conditions were most common in conventional field borders, whereas stress-tolerant species were more abundant around organic farming. These differences occurred only 3-4 years after conversion to organic farming. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the past 50 years the treatment possibilities have drastically improved, but the treatment results achieved under everyday care conditions mainly lag far behind those that could actually be achieved. This efficacy-effectiveness gap is at present the main obstacle to achieving optimal outcome in psychiatry. In this editorial, several causative factors for this gap are named and suggestions are made as to what should be done to fulfil the outcome that is achievable according to today's state of knowledge. Estimates indicate that at least a 25% improvement of important outcome indicators (e.g. yearly relapse rates) could be achieved.

Large numbers of the disadvantaged live in rural areas, yet most research attention has been focused on conditions in urban Britain, and in particular on the main cities of England. This research employs a multi-scale multi-indicator approach and data extracted from the latest Census of Population to identify the nature, intensity and incidence of disadvantage in rural Scotland. The empirical findings are of both academic and policy relevance. Finally, a five-dimensional conceptual framework is presented as a guide for future research into the geography of rural disadvantage.

AB  - Central Asia is one of the world largest regions, which has been relatively poorly studied from the microbiological point of view. The lakes of this region have a broad range of ecological conditions, from lowmineral to hypersaline ones. Long-term observations revealed that microbial communities of these lakes reflect the climatic and ecological changes in this region. Genomic research showed that some microbial species were found only in Central Asian lakes, but not in other regions of the world. The combination of these factors makes Central Asian lakes a promising subject for microbiological investigation.

AB  - In 2002, world leaders committed, through the Convention on Biological Diversity, to achieve a significant reduction in the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. We compiled 31 indicators to report on progress toward this target. Most indicators of the state of biodiversity (covering species' population trends, extinction risk, habitat extent and condition, and community composition) showed declines, with no significant recent reductions in rate, whereas indicators of pressures on biodiversity (including resource consumption, invasive alien species, nitrogen pollution, overexploitation, and climate change impacts) showed increases. Despite some local successes and increasing responses (including extent and biodiversity coverage of protected areas, sustainable forest management, policy responses to invasive alien species, and biodiversity-related aid), the rate of biodiversity loss does not appear to be slowing.

T2  - HOMO
LA  - English
AB  - The paper is dedicated to the investigation of the mineral content of excavated bones (general mineralization, concentrations of chemical elements: Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sr) and some histological characteristics. It is based on 14 osteological series from the first c. B.C. to the 20th c. A.D. from various parts of Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Central Asia. Chemical, radiological and other analyses show the state of preservation of the bone matter to be satisfactory. Thus, some aspects of sex and age-related changes in the bone mineral content were investigated as well too. Different tendencies in the distribution of bone mineral content characteristics were considered to be a reaction of the population to specific geochemical, dietary conditions.

AB  - Real time oil quality monitoring techniques help to protect important industry assets, minimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs. The measurement of a lubricant's complex permittivity is an effective indicator of the oil degradation process and it can be useful in condition based maintenance (CBM) to select the most adequate oil replacement maintenance schedules. A discussion of the working principles of an oil quality sensor based on a marginal oscillator to monitor the losses of the dielectric at high frequencies (>1 MHz) is presented. An electronic design procedure is covered which results in a low cost, effective and ruggedized sensor implementation suitable for use in harsh environments.

AB  - Toxaphene, a mixture of chlorinated bornanes and camphenes with a high proportion of enantiomers, can be used as an indicator for the investigation of environmental conditions which lead to the compositional pattern of toxaphene in environmental samples. Due to its persistence and long range transport, toxaphene is distributed throughout the world. The changes in composition after biotic or abiotic transformation are visible in the gas chromatograms of different environmental samples. These are important clues to translocation and degradation pathways. The results of enantioselective residue analysis and of degradation experiments with single toxaphene components suggest the dominance of photolysis over other abiotic or biotic processes in air, water, and fish.

AB  - A formal statistical framework is proposed for synthesis of text information into sentiment indicators. Each text document is treated as an exchangeable collection of stems of words (tokens), and used in conjunction with a multinomial inverse regression approach to efficiently synthesize the information content in text documents. The proposed methodology is illustrated through the buildup of sentiment indicators using Twitter news outlet text information. These synthesizing indicators, quantitative in nature, can be built across disciplines to capture changes in the economic, financial, and social conditions, and also serve to reveal heterogeneity across countries, sectors, or markets. The proposed approach is computationally fast and allows for time variation in the indexes.

AB  - Monthly changes in marginal increments, determined front alternation of macroscopic opaque and translucent bands, of Zosterisessor ophiocephalus sagittae were examined. The time of annulus completion proved to be annual, occurring around June both for females and males, and coinciding with the end of the breeding season and a period of larger body condition. The translucent band is likely to start depositing in summer. Since Sr/Ca peaks coincided with annulus completion, the most likely hypothesis is that the Sr/Ca ratio is influenced by the reproductive season.

AB  - In this essay I argue that despite Arendt's dislike of psychology, she, like all political theorists, relies on a particular understanding of human nature. Her account, which can be discovered with a careful reading of her work, including Eichmann in Jerusalem, The Human Condition and The Origins of Totalitarianism, resonates with the explicitly psychoanalytic one of Jessica Benjamin. When the two accounts are considered together one can find the outline of a very interesting conception of the self which is neither the deconstructed, discontinuous self of postmodernism nor the strongly unified, rational subject of liberalism. This account also points to a way of understanding both the allure of evil and the political remedies that can stymie its realization.

AB  - Undesirable outputs are increasingly considered in data envelopment analysis (DEA) for environmental performance assessment because of hot environment issues. However, many practical conditions are not considered during modeling undesirable output together with desirable outputs and inputs. In this paper, we presented several new approaches with considering weight constraints between undesirable outputs and inputs. Then we constructed cross-efficiency models for measuring eco-efficiency. Finally, we applied the developed models to evaluate the performance of 25 OECD nations in the time interval 2007-2009 so as to illustrate the usefulness of the new presented models. Some interesting finds are described as resulting from this application.

AB  - The application of available nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (MD) algorithms to simulate radiationless interband transitions in non-metallic materials is discussed. As a first step, and before investigating enhanced effects under extreme conditions, the model should describe the electronic populations in the excited states for a system equilibrated at temperature T. It is found that the electronic temperature cannot be described simply from surface-hopping simulations associated with phenomenological relaxation rates. Thus, it might prove necessary to account for environment-induced decoherence as well. On the other hand, the qualitative description of the response to a shock provided by this approach is consistent with physical expectations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous reports indicate that fir woods in central and northern Europe have recently been damaged by increasing pollution. It has been demonstrated that fungi can be good bioindicators of forest health status. In polluted areas the production of fruit bodies generally declines and the fungal biodiversity, especially of symbiotic species, is reduced. Here we report the results of a survey of the fungal and plant communities in woods of Abies alba Miller in central-southern Tuscany, already studied in the past. Certain changes were observed in the study areas, but they seem more likely to be due to other factors than pollution, such as the weather conditions, the age and natural evolution of the forests towards their climax.

AB  - Long-chain methyl and ethyl alkenones (C-37-C-40) containing two to four double bonds have been detected in sediments from Qinghai Lake, China. This is the first report of the alkenones in lake sediments, deposited under a variety of salinity conditions, where the lake has not encountered any marine incursions. The presence of the alkenones suggests the presence of Prymnesiophyceae in the lake which may have reached the lake via eolian transportation or seabirds. Sediment samples from the more saline areas of the lake contained higher concentrations of the more highly unsaturated compounds. Widespread use of these compounds as paleotemperature indicators in marine sediments introduces the possibility of extrapolating this approach to lacustrine environments if appropriate calibrations can be undertaken.

AB  - Gestational factors play a role in the development of several neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism. In utero conditions influence future mental health through epigenetic mechanisms, which alter gene expression without affecting DNA coding sequence. Environmental factors account for at least 60% of the risk for developing major depression, and earlier onset of depressive illness has been observed over the past decades. I speculate that gestational factors may play a greater role in programing depression than previously recognized. Here, I examine recent evidence for a role for gestational factors in programing mood disorders, and how epigenetic mechanisms mediate this effect.

AB  - In the daily practice of science for policy, as experienced by governmental agencies which inform the policy and the public on the state and outlook of the environment, there is a pressing need for guidance in assessing and communicating uncertainties. This need extends beyond the quantitative assessment of uncertainties in model results, and focuses on the entire process of environmental assessment, running from problem framing towards reporting the results of the study. Using the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (RIVM/MNP) as a case, the development, structure and content of such a guidance system is highlighted. Conditions for a successful implementation of the guidance system are discussed, and some prospects for future work are outlined.

AB  - Chiral epoxides are important intermedi- ates in chemistry and: biology. The high-throughput screening of asymmetric epoxidation conditions requires fast determination of the absolute configurations and ee values of chiral epoxides. Herein, we report molecular recognition and chiroptical sensing of epoxides in water using endo-functionalized molecular tubes. The absolute configurations and ee values were simultaneously determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. In addition, real-time monitoring as well as the application to real asymmetric epoxidation was demonstrated. The method is simple, environmentally friendly, and amenable to high throughput screening.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to test the impact of various potential causes of unofficial economy in new member states (NMS). The hypothesis of the paper is that the most significant factors in NMS are the tax burden and the overall institutional environment. Paper uses unofficial economy estimates based on MIMIC and exhaustiveness of national account approaches over a longer period. A panel data method is used in econometric models in which various indicators of the intensity of regulations, tax burden, institutional framework and labour market conditions are used as potential factors able to explain cross-country differences in the sizes and trends in the unofficial economies.

AB  - To better understand the long-term effects of rapid boom growth, we reexamine four subjective indicators of community satisfaction and social integration in Delta, Utah, that were originally analyzed by Brown, Geertsen, and Krannich in 1989. With 24 years of longitudinal data, we find that within approximately a decade of the boom period three of the four indicators returned to or exceeded pre-boom levels. We argue that we need to modify our theories and vocabulary regarding boomtowns to account for a "boom-bust-recovery cycle" that better takes into consideration the dynamic nature of communities and their residents and how they subjectively adjust to shifts in objective conditions.

AB  - Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a ubiquitous feature of cells in which these proteins cope with stress-induced denaturation of other proteins. Among the different families of Hsps, the 70 kDa family (hsp70) is the most highly conserved and has been most extensively studied. Apart from their primary role in cellular defense under stress condition, a number of studies in recent years have shown the immense potential of hsp70 in pollution monitoring using even transgenic approach both in vivo and in vitro. This article reviews the recent developments in the widespread application of hsp70 in environmental risk assessment. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The results of this study show a mutagenic effect of low-dose ionizing radiation in male germ cells. The damage of male germ cells was assessed by the frequency of abnormal sperm heads in tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus Pall.), bank voles (Myodes glareolus Schreb.), and field mice (Apodemus agrarius Pall.) from the 30 km exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power station and for laboratory animals (mice and rats) under chronic gamma-irradiation. The abnormal sperm head detection method used appeared to be sensitive to conditions of low-dose irradiation and can consequently be recommended as a bioindicator to monitor environmental radiation pollution.

AB  - Forest fire has profound impacts on atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem structure. This feedback interaction may be hastened in climate change scenarios. In view of this, the present day knowledge about the forest fire condition in India has been reviewed. Operational monitoring, geospatial modelling and climate change uncertainties are discussed. Indicators for forest fire assessment and the role of geoinformatics tools in developing those parameters are identified. The need for developing an adaptive management strategy from the existing experience is emphasized, and specific points are recommended sector-wise with short- and long-term visions.

AB  - The Lower Old Red Sandstones in northern Strathmore have favourable hydrogeological conditions for groundwater development. A scheme was proposed to abstract water in the north Esk catchment in order to augment water supplies to local villages, and a production borehole was drilled into the Edzell Sandstones to give a design yield of 2420 m(3)/d. However, this scheme has been abandoned because of concern that the abstraction would significantly reduce the flow in a nearby stream which is an important salmonid fishery.
   This study demonstrates the potential value of using a stream-aquifer numerical model in an environmental risk assessment for the proposed scheme.

Zero point of charge methods, indicator reactions of heterogeneous hydrolysis, drop titration, and thermography were used in the study. The properties of the zirconogels are very close to those of ferro- and titanogels obtained under similar conditions. The composition of zirconogels, the activation energies of the indicator reactions of heterogeneous hydrolysis, and the dependences of the rate constants of these reactions on the nature and concentration of the ionic medium were determined.

AB  - The activity of a P450-dependent enzyme, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), was measured in liver of fish from a watershed exposed to pesticide runoff from nearby vineyards. A correlation was observed between pesticide runoff and enzyme activity. This is the first field trial on the use of the cytochrome P-450 system as a biochemical indicator for assessing potential exposure to trace levels of complex mixtures of pesticides in the aquatic environment. The results might be useful for agencies designing monitoring assessment programs for ecotoxicological risk.

TI  - Rural housing adequacy and civic structure
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA  - English
AB  - One persistent problem that many small rural towns face is housing adequacy, which encompasses interior and exterior structural conditions; assessments of heating, cooling, and sanitation systems; and residence size relative to space needs. The creation and reproduction of vibrant rural communities is grounded in the capacity of citizens to solve local housing problems. We posit that towns with strong norms of mutuality, high information flows, and inclusive behaviors have a civic structure that produces the capacity to frame and resolve housing concerns. We find that perceptions of civic structure are a significant factor in explaining the variation in rural housing adequacy, net of income, age, and tenure. This implies that the social and political environment is an important influence on the quality of housing stock found in rural places.

AB  - A case study of Vietnamese pagodas operating in Warsaw and its surroundings in the past 25 years shows the strength with which local social and spatial conditions affect adaptation strategies of migrant institutions. Taking into account, the ecological perspective and the discourse of Vietnamese community concerning the role of temples enabled us to answer the question about the role of pagodas in maintaining local and transnational intragroup bonds and interactions with the majority society. This article shows how a process of local social and cultural integration that was beginning to emerge was significantly slowed down by spatial separation of the Vietnamese community and by this community's transnational connections getting on intensity.

AB  - Since 1974 the Canadian government has required that any federally sponsored project which poses a significant environmental risk be subject to a full environmental impact assessment (EIA). Of the 38 projects so assessed to date, 13 have included substantial marine components. A review of the recommendations in these latter assessments places an increasing reliance on government departments to fill in the knowledge and data gaps as pre-conditions for the approval for these projects to proceed. A continuation of this trend will raise serious questions concerning the role and capacity of government scientists in the EIA process. If the Canadian experience is reflective of trends in other countries, it could have serious implications for government research programmes in the long term.

TI  - SANDSTONES BLOWOUT RISK IN THE SOUTH-WESTERN REGION OF LVIV-VOLYN COAL BASIN
T2  - VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY
LA  - Russian
AB  - The aim of the research. Investigation of coal-containing sandstones of the Tyagliv and Lyubelya fields of the Lviv-Volyn Coal Basin (LVB) has shown their potential ability for rapid blowout of rocks and gas.
   Methodology. Studies of structural-textural peculiarities of sandstones, determination of complex indication of blowout risk "B", construction of lithological-stratigraphic sections, focus on the situation of blowout risk.
   Results. In the Tyagliv and Lyubelya fields the rocks of Buzhanka Suite of the Lower Carboniferous and the rocks of the Morozovychi Suite of the Bashkirian stage of the Middle Carboniferous have been studied. On the basis of the structural-textural peculiarities of sandstones, studies of their reservoir properties and gas presence it has been possible to prove the probability of the existing rock blowouts at depths more than 700 m for the South-Western coal-bearing region of the LVB. By structural-textural indexes, transformation stages of certain minerals indicators, presence of secondary contacts between grains and values of the metamorphism coefficient "C", it has been established that sandstones R, PVR and PM of South-Western coal-bearing region belong to the stages of initial and deep catagenesis. Occurrence of sudden blowouts of rocks is possible for the sandstones of deep catagenesis stage under certain determined conditions.
   Layers and lenses of sandstones, potentially capable for sudden blowouts, are distinguished by the complex index of blowout danger "B" in the coal-bearing sequence of Tyahliv and Lyubela fields in deep horizons.
   For the rocks of Tyahliv field, which is more gas-bearing within the basin, the potential danger of blowouts is greater. Especially this refers to the local anticline highs, which complicate sections of the Tyahliv syncline.
   Lenses of potentially blowout dangerous sandstones have been distinguished also in unevenly degassed sequence of the Lyubela field. By their structural-textural features they are dense with great amount of rigid secondary incorporation and suture contacts between grains. Combination of increased stress of tectonic nature with significant brittleness of the sandstone is a sufficient condition for sudden release of highly stressful conditions in rocks.
   Scientific novelty. Application of the complex approach to the study of rock layers together with structural-textural peculiarities, determination of stages of catagenetic transformation is an important factor for establishment of reasons, factors of blowout risk phenomenon in coal-bearing rocks on the whole.
   Practical significance. Investigation of occurrence and spread of the gas-dynamic phenomena (blowouts of coal, rocks and gas, mountain shocks) are an integral part of gas-coal fields study.
   Investigation of the sandstones in South-Western coal-bearing region of LVB, allocation of the layers and lenses of sandstones, potentially capable for sudden blowouts, are relevant from the point of view of increasing the mineral-resource base of the basin by developing new deep horizons.

AB  - Existing data on Walecki barbel are very scarce and need a complement to the quantitative description of its habitat conditions. This fish is a subspecies of the Pontic species B. cyclolepis Heckel which occurs in some coastal rivers of the Black Sea or, as evidenced by some results of studies on initochondrial DNA, it is a hybrid originating from natural crossing between the common barbel Barbus bat-bus (L.) and spotted barbel B. carpalhicus Kotlik, Tsigenopoulos, Rab et Berrebi. Until now the Walecki barbel was reported from 26 sites in the river basins of the Upper Vistula and the Dniester in SE Poland (49 degrees 09'-49 degrees 49'N, 21 degrees 28'-22 degrees 50'E, altitude 200-590 m). Seventeen of these sites were studied in autumn 2002 and summer 2003 to collect data on habitat parameters of stream channels. The main characteristics of their morphology (i.e. length, width, depth, and gradient) were calculated on the basis of a set of field measurements. Current velocity was measured using float method. The composition of bottom substratum was estimated using a simple scale based on Wentworth scale. Additionally, two biotic characters were included, i.e. the occurrence of macroscopic aquatic vegetation and the species composition of fish community. According to the obtained results the habitat conditions appropriate for Walecki barbel may be defined as follows: 1) The stream should be medium-sized, at least 10-m or better 20-m wide. 2) The mean channel depth should exceed 20 cm, while the maximum depth should be greater than DO cm. The channel morphology with the zone of medium depth (i.e. that extending over the half of bottom) in range between at least 15 and 40 cm seems to be favorable. 3) The mean stream velocity of 0.30 in s(-1) or more is desired. It seems that the zone of fast current (0.50-1.00 m s(-1)) sharing a considerable portion of the channel is an important habitat feature. 4) Most of the bottom area should be covered by mediumsized particles (2-200 mm) with the mode within range of fine pebbles (20-50 mm). 5) In general, the stream should be rather oligotrophic than eutrophic with poorly developed macroscopic algae and the absence of vascular plants, and with flow fluctuations periodically disturbing structure of bottom substratum. 6) The abundant occurrence of spotted barbel, especially within lower part of its distribution area and in the zone of its co-occurrence with common barbel may be regarded as a good indicator of the stream habitat appropriate for Walecki barbel. 7) Other frequent and abundant species accompanying Walecki barbel are minnow Phoxinus phoxinus (L.), stone loach Barbatula barbatula (L.), chub Leuciscus cephalus (L.) and schneider Alburnoides bipunctatus (Bloch).

AB  - Amino acids (AA) and, more recently, amino sugars (AS) in marine or lacustrine sediments have been increasingly used as paleoproxies. In order to assess AA and AS compositional changes during simulated microbial degradation, as well as to understand the importance of amino-compound re-synthesis by microbes during early diagenesis, decomposition experiments (300 days) were performed with algal ( Fragilaria crotonensis ) organic matter (OM)/quartz-sand mixtures under controlled redox conditions. Despite expected greater overall degradability under oxic conditions, decomposition kinetics of the bulk algal OM, as well as the total particulate AA and AS were similar under oxic and anoxic conditions, following exponential decay kinetics consistent with the observed mobilization and transfer of large parts of the particulate organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) into the dissolved inorganic and organic C and N pools. Carbon-normalized AA and AS yields suggest relative enrichment of amino compounds during partial decomposition, indicating the production and accumulation of microbial biomass during early diagenesis, independent of the redox environment. Moreover, AA and AS compositional changes, such as the relative enrichment of the AA glycine and the AS muramic acid (MurA), and the decrease in the molar ratio of glucosamine and galactosamine (GlcN:GalN) during degradation in both redox systems, were consistent with significant bacterial re-synthesis and the preferential preservation of bacterial biomaterial with increasing diagenesis. Large disparities between different bacterial amino-sugar based estimates of bacterial contribution indicate that bacterial end-member compositions are not currently known well enough to make these bacterial-biomarker constraints quantitative. However, the overall trends are consistent, indicating substantial turnover of eukaryotic into bacterial OM on short time scales of weeks to months. Together these results suggest that the influence of bacterial reworking in conserving sedimentary OM via its transfer into more refractory OM pools may be substantially greater than previously appreciated. We also investigated established amino-compound based indicators of OM degradation, bacterial synthesis, and sediment reactivity. Despite discrepancies, which we attribute to different susceptibilities of the respective indicators towards degradational changes on different time-scales, the tested indices were overall consistent with past data. These results therefore confirm their value as universal indicators of OM diagenesis. Together, our data highlight the vital role of bacterial reworking on the composition of sedimentary OM, with important implications for the alteration of primary geochemical signatures during early sedimentary diagenesis and their use as proxies in paleoenvironmental studies.

AB  - The diurnal courses of leaf water relations and gas exchange of long-term regulated deficit-irrigated field-grown almond trees (Primus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) were investigated at three different times of the growing season (Spring, Summer and Autumn) under different irrigation conditions (surface and subsurface drip irrigation) during the year 2000 in a semiarid region of SE Spain. Leaf water relations and stomatal behaviour were altered significantly more by irrigation treatment than by irrigation system (surface or subsurface). Leaf water status and gas exchange parameters responded diurnally and seasonally to variations in soil water status and evaporative demand. Leaf, xylem water potential (psi(1), psi(x)) and leaf relative water content (RWC) were closely correlated with air vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in well-irrigated periods (Spring and Autumn), but not under severe water stress (Summer). Leaf photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (g,) and transpiration (E) were also positively correlated with air VPD, with a threshold level for stomatal closure around 2kPa. Mesophyll water status and gas exchange activity were more affected by factors related to soil water availability than by atmospheric factors under severe water stress. A low correlation between daily changes of leaf water status parameters (psi(x), psi(1) and RWC) and g(s) and A in the three seasons was also observed. Soil water deficit reduced significantly psi(1), psi(x), RWC and gas exchange levels during the day and the maximum daily peak of gas exchange was moved to earlier in the mornina. This increased significantly gas exchange efficiency in the deficit treatments compared to the control in the early and mid-morning. Daily stomatal behaviour was modified in the treatment watered the least, as a consequence of long-term cumulative water stress effect. Preconditioning to water stress may also play a main role in diurnal gas exchange responses of field-grown almond trees under long-term regulated deficit irrigation (RD1). After four years of RDI, this treatment maintained, at post-harvest, similar mean daily levels of photosynthesis and gas exchange efficiency than the control, with a 50% irrigation reduction, optimising water use. Intrinsic gas exchange efficiency (A/g(s)) was less variable during the day and less influenced by VPD compared to A/E, being better indicator of the regulation of plant water use at the leaf level.

AB  - The strontium contents of primary marine gypsum facies were studied in Messinian (Upper Miocene) basins of SE Spain and Sicily, and in the Badenian (Middle Miocene) Carpathian foreland basin of Poland, The results obtained were interpreted on the basis of the findings reported for the gypsum facies of recent salinas in the western Mediterranean coast,
   The strontium profile obtained from the lower part of the gypsum deposit of the Sorbas basin (SE Spain) has homogeneous strontium contents, reflecting deposition under conditions of hydrological stability and relatively deep waters, but the upper part has a more variable strontium content related, in accordance with other sedimentological criteria, to a shallowing of the basin, This is consistent with data reported from other Messinian basins of SE Spain (San Miguel de Salinas and Palma de Mallorca), In the Caltanissetta basin (Sicily), the section studied in Eraclea Minoa (Upper Evaporite) is made up of 6-8 gypsum cycles that have a facies evolution from fine-grained laminar gypsum at the base of each cycle to selenites at the top, accompanied by increasing strontium values, This evolution is attributed to increasing salinity conditions and is consistent with geochemical data reported in the Literature,
   In the Badenian basin the six gypsum sections studied are from different subbasins, The gypsum deposits comprise two members, In the lower member, which is mainly selenitic, two parts can be differentiated and a significant strontium increase (attributed to a rise in salinity) was recorded in the transition from the lower to the upper part, In the upper member, which is mainly elastic gypsum, a general strontium decrease indicates a fall in salinity linked to a deepening or freshening of the platform, In the Badenian selenitic layers a lateral variation in the strontium contents exists: higher and less homogeneous strontium contents were recorded in the marginal zones, suggesting variable salinity conditions, whereas in the deeper areas the gypsum layers show more homogeneous strontium values, expected from more stable and less concentrated brines, This distribution is in agreement with data reported from the Messinian basin of San Miguel de Salinas (SE Spain),
   The strontium contents in both the Messinian and Badenian selenitic samples are lower than those in the selenitic crusts of the recent salinas, These lower contents may be a result of a lower salinity of the mother brines at the steady state achieved during the precipitation of the thick selenitic sequences, with respect to the highly concentrated (with no reflux) brines of the recent salinas,
   Our findings highlight the relevance of studying strontium contents in primary gypsum facies of marine formations as a tool for interpreting the paleogeography and the paleosalinity of the evaporitic environments and for correlating cyclic selenite formations, This method could be especially helpful when combined with other geochemical indicators (i.e., isotopic and/or fluid inclusions composition).

AB  - From managerial aspects such as site mapping, silviculture and long term management planning requests for research are derived and tasks are addressed to growth and yield research. Methods of site mapping capable to forcast growth potential of a specific tree species on a well defined site are to be based on knowledge of stand growth in pure and mixed stands. Therefore site specific relations between the growth of an ''indicator species'' and water balance, thermal and nutrient dynamics are a prerequisite. To keep these relations comparable despite of different methods and countries they have to be based on quantitative values, such as field capacity and nutrient budgets.
   Site classifications of different regions and current changes in site conditions due to immissions ask for variable and flexible growth models. As a long term basis for these models that may be looked upon as essential components of an information system for site and growth a network of long term monitoring plots should be established.
   To reach silvicultural objectives such as well structured, mixed and multifunctional forests data on site specific growth conditions within different layers of stuctured stands are urgently requested. To transpone results from selection forests to high forests may be misleading and consequently may cause production losses in volume and value.
   Little is known about differentiation processes in natural regeneration under shelter trees specifically as far as light demanding tree species are concerned. As natural regeneration is an increasingly important issue in silviculture knowledge gaps concerning stability of shaded trees and root development under reduced light consumption have to be filled with priority. The same is true for lacking knowledge on the effects of crown expansion of aged trees on diameter growth or root architecture specifically for light demanding tree species. Management decisions on crop tree strategies and optimal harvesting age need a sound quantitative basis. Tending of young stands has to be conducted in an effective way and at low cost. That implicitly means that with a minimal number of tending measures the increment has to be concentrated on the future crop trees resulting in mature trees in relatively shore time. Preliminary results of crop tree oriented tending measures need further confirmation. Long term management planning faces increased inhomogenity of mixed, structured and uneven aged forests. Inventory methods have to be adapted to this situation and cooperation with growth and yield research is very much welcomed.
   The development of growth simulators is highly appreciated. They should be structured as dynamic information systems to allow simulation of changing site or growth conditions as well as calculation of economic parameters.
   Single tree data are increasingly important due to crop tree oriented silvicultural strategies. Age class methods and yield tables are no longer adequate tools for inventory and planning purposes. New methods and models therefore should focus on the individual tree. Interdisciplinary research is necessary to produce results that are acceptable and valuable in practice.

AB  - This research aimed at testing the use of present and past climosequences to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and related physical quality indicators under future climatic conditions. The influence of climate on soil features was studied for four combinations of typical Mediterranean soil types and cropping systems, placed along climosequences of the past (P1: 1961-1990), present (P2: 1981-2010) and future (P3: 2021-2050). The four test areas were located in Italy, each one characterized by the same soil typology and cropping system, placed on similar morphological position and parent material, wide enough to cross climatic boundaries. Legacy soil profiles that were sampled in the P1 time-period were re-sampled in 2010-2011, to check for possible variations in soil characteristics. Besides SOC content and stock (C-stock), we examined some physical quality indicators for which the existence of relations with SOC is well-known, namely soil compaction and soil crusting susceptibility, soil erodibility, and soil loss by water erosion.
   Among several climatic indexes, the de Martonne index (IDM) resulted the most correlated with SOC. The IDM vs. SOC relationship was significant and not different in both P1 and P2 climosequences, highlighting the temporal stability of the relation between climate and SOC content. In the Vertisols of Sicily, cultivated under cereals, the P3 climosequence predicted a SOC reduction of more than 11%. This will lead to an increase of soil erodibility, susceptibility to compaction, and surface crust formation. On the contrary, in the Luvisols under forage crops of the Po Plain, a substantial C-stock increase (28.8%) is expected, with a consequent improvement in soil physical indicators. For the Luvisols under meadows of Sardinia, an increase in erosion of 13.5% is expected, because of increased precipitation volume (7.4%) and aggressiveness. In the Andosols under olive trees of Campania there is a predicted reduction in the C-stock (-6.3%) and an associated increase in soil loss (4.6%), while no marked variation is expected for the other soil physical indicators.
   We can conclude that climosequences are a useful tool to predict the future dynamics of some soil physical characteristics affected by climate change. C-stock and soil loss by water erosion are expected to change significantly under future climatic conditions, while minor changes are observed for erodibility, compaction and crusting susceptibility, even when SOC variations are significant. In the climosequences, the considered soil physical quality indicators resulted proportionally more affected by the cropping system than by the climate and, within the same cropping system, more variable according to the climate than the time. This outcome confirms the fundamental role of soil physics in controlling the resilience of the soil system to climate change.

AB  - This study investigated the relationships between dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and bacterial dynamics on short time scale during spring mesotrophic (March 2003) and summer oligotrophic (June 2003) regimes, in a 0-500 in depth water column with almost no advection, at the DYFAMED site, NW Mediterranean. DOM was characterized by analyzing dissolved organic carbon (DOC), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and lipid class biotracers. Bacterial dynamic was assessed through the measurement of in situ bacterial lipase activity, abundance, production and bacterial community structure. We made the assumption that by coupling the ambient concentration of hydrolysable acyl-lipids with the measurement of their in situ bacterial hydrolysis rates (i.e. the free fatty acids release rate) would provide new insights about bacterial response to change in environmental conditions. The seasonal transition from spring to summer was accompanied by a significant accumulation of excess DOC (+5 mu M) (ANOVA, p<0.05, n = 8) in the upper layer (0-50 m). In this layer, the free fatty acids release rate to the bacterial carbon demand (BCD) ratio increased from 0.6 +/- 0.3 in March to 1.3 +/- 1.0 in June (ANOVA, p<0.05, n = 8) showing that more uncoupling between the hydrolysis of the acyl-lipids and the BCD occurred during the evolution of the season, and that free fatty acids contributed to the excess DOC. The increase of lipolysis index and CDOM absorbance (from 0.24 +/- 0.17 to 0.39 +/- 0.13 and from 0.076 +/- 0.039 to 0.144 +/- 0.068; ANOVA, p < 0.05, n = 8, respectively), and the higher contribution of triglycerides, wax esters and phospholipids (from < 5% to 12-31%) to the lipid pool reflected the change in the DOM quality. In addition to a strong increase of bacterial lipase activity per cell (51.4 +/- 29.4-418.3 +/- 290.6 Ag C cell(-1) h(-1)), a significant percentage of ribotypes (39%) was different between spring and summer in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer in particular, suggesting a shift in the bacterial community structure due to the different trophic conditions. At both seasons, in the chlorophyll layers, diel variations of DOM and bacterial parameters reflected a better bioavailability and/or DOM utilization by bacteria at night (the ratio of free fatty acids release rate to bacterial carbon demand decreased), most likely related to the zooplankton trophic behaviour. In mesotrophic conditions, such day/night pattern was driving changes in the bacterial community structure. In more oligotrophic period, diel variations in bacterial community structure were depth dependent in relation to the strong summer stratification. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Silurian bedrock aquifer constitutes a major aquifer system for groundwater supply across the Ontario province in Canada. The application of natural and industrial fertilizers near urban centers has led to groundwater NO3--N concentrations that sometimes have exceeded the drinking water limit, posing a threat to the usage of groundwater for the human consumption. Therefore, there is a growing interest and concern about how nitrate is being leached, transported and potentially attenuated in bedrock aquifers. This study assesses the local distribution of groundwater NO3- in the up-gradient area of two historically impacted municipal wells, called Carter Wells, in the City of Guelph, Canada, in order to evaluate the potential nitrate attenuation mechanisms, using both groundwater geochemical and isotopic analysis (H-3, delta N-15-NO3, delta O-18-NO3, delta O-18-SO4, delta S-34-SO4) and a detailed vertical hydrogeological and geochemical bedrock characterization. The results indicate that probably the main source of nitrate to the Carter Wells is the up-gradient Arkell Research Station (ARS), an agricultural research facility where manure has been historically applied. The overburden and bedrock groundwater with high NO3 concentrations at the ARS exhibits a manure-related delta N-15 and delta O-18 signature, isotopically similar to the high nitrate in the down-gradient groundwater from domestic wells and from the Carter Wells. The nitrate spatial distribution appears to be influenced and controlled by the geology, in which more permeable rock is found in the Guelph Formation which in turn is related to most of the high NO3- groundwater. The presence of an underlying low permeability Eramosa Formation favors the development of oxygen-depleted conditions, a key factor for the occurrence of denitrification. Groundwater with low NO3--N concentrations associated with more oxygen-limited conditions and coincident with high SO42- concentrations are related to more enriched delta N-15 and delta O-18 values in NO3- and to more depleted delta S-34 and delta O-18 values in SO42-, suggesting that denitrification coupled with pyrite oxidation is taking place. The presence of macro crystalized and disseminated pyrite especially in the Eramosa Formation, can support the occurrence of this attenuation process. Moreover, based on tritium analysis, some denitrification can occur in shallow bedrock and within relatively short residence times, associated with less permeable conditions in depth which facilitates oxygen consumption through sulfide oxidation. The role of denitrification mediated by organic carbon cannot be discarded at the study site. This study suggests that the geological configuration and particularly the presence of low permeability Eramosa Formation can play an important role on nitrate natural attenuation, which may serve as a decision factor on defining the bedrock water supply system for both domestic and municipal purposes.

AB  - This paper describes the occurrences, mineralogical assemblages and environmental relevance of iron-rich precipitates derived from acidic (pH < 4) waters containing dominantly schwertmannite from a diverse range of six physical settings across the Lower Murray Reclaimed Irrigation Area (LMRIA) in Australia, comprising: (1) suspended flocculated precipitates in ponded drain water, (2) moist coatings or pastes in drying ponds and drains, (3) hard cemented crusts and aggregates amongst Phragmites roots and stems, (4) dry coatings on concrete and wooden structures, (5) dry coatings on surface soils and vegetation and (6) suspended flocculated precipitates in the mixing zone of drain discharge into the River Murray. Schwertmannite formed in these acid drain environments following exposure and oxidation of deep (similar to 0.5 -> 3.5 m) clayey hypersulfidic material (pH > 4) that dried, cracked and acidified to form deep sulfuric materials (pH < 4) due to river and groundwater levels falling by nearly 2 m during the latter part of the Millennium Drought (2007 to 2010). Reflooding events occurred between 2011 and 2015. All samples displayed X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns typical for schwertmannite. In some samples, additional weak reflections from small amounts of jarosite, natrojarosite, gypsum, hexahydrite, konyaite and halite indicated deposition under variable pH conditions and sulfate concentrations due to different flow or evaporation stages. SEM images indicated that morphological and compositional features of schwertmannite were dominated by: (1) framboid-like spheroidal clusters with Fe/S ratio > 5 that were preserved after crystallization and likely formed by dissolution of pyrite and microbial oxidation of Fe2+ by acidophilic bacteria and (2) fibrous spheres (0.3-3 mu m) with filamentous morphology and a high degree of porosity. Speciation calculations (PHREEQC) using the dissolved metal and major ion concentrations in drain waters supported the XRD results as the saturation index (SI) exceeded zero for schwertmannite in many drains. The precipitates contained high concentrations of metals (Al > Cu > As > Zn > Pb > Co) and nutrients (e.g. P) due to co-precipitation/scavenging of these elements during the formation of schwertmannite. There was also spatial variability in concentrations of metal (loids) in precipitates between drains. A conceptual model explains and summarizes the morphological properties, mineralogy, geochemistry and environmental processes influencing the formation and relative stabilities of schwertmannite-rich precipitates from six diverse physical settings. The environmental relevance, which has significant implications for rehabilitation options is shown in three perspectives: (1) the conditions for schwertmannite formation have persisted in irrigation drains for over 7 years, (2) the ability for schwertmanniterich precipitates to reveal acid sulfate conditions and therefore act as a mineralogical indicator in irrigation systems and (3) the pollution potential of metals and metalloids scavenged by schwertmannite-rich precipitates.

AB  - Cooperativity is one of the most important properties of molecular interactions in biological systems. It is the ability to influence ligand binding at one site of a macromolecule by previous ligand binding at another site of the same molecule. As a consequence, the affinity of the macromolecule for the ligand is either decreased (negative cooperativity) or increased (positive cooperativity). Over the last 100 years, O-2 binding to hemoglobin has served as the paradigm for cooperative ligand binding and allosteric modulation, and four practical models were developed to quantitatively describe the mechanism: the Hill, the Adair-Klotz, the Monod-Wyman-Changeux, and the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer models. The predictions of these models apply under static conditions when the binding reactions are at equilibrium. However, in a physiological setting, e. g., inside a cell, the timing and dynamics of the binding events are essential. Hence, it is necessary to determine the dynamic properties of cooperative binding to fully understand the physiological implications of cooperativity. To date, the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model was applied to determine the kinetics of cooperative binding to biologically active molecules. In this model, cooperativity is established by postulating two allosteric isoforms with different binding properties. However, these studies were limited to special cases, where transition rates between allosteric isoforms are much slower than the binding rates or where binding and unbinding rates could be measured independently. For all other cases, the complex mathematical description precludes straightforward interpretations. Here, we report on calculating for the first time the fast dynamics of a cooperative binding process, the binding of Ca2+ to calretinin. Calretinin is a Ca2+ binding protein with four cooperative binding sites and one independent binding site. The Ca2+ binding to calretinin was assessed by measuring the decay of free Ca2+ using a fast fluorescent Ca2+ indicator following rapid (<50-mu s rise time) Ca2+ concentration jumps induced by uncaging Ca2+ from DM-nitrophen. To unravel the kinetics of cooperative binding, we devised several approaches based on known cooperative binding models, resulting in a novel and relatively simple model. This model revealed unexpected and highly specific nonlinear properties of cellular Ca2+ regulation by calretinin. The association rate of Ca2+ with calretinin speeds up as the free Ca2+ concentration increases from cytoplasmic resting conditions (similar to 100 nM) to approximately 1 mu M. As a consequence, the Ca2+ buffering speed of calretinin highly depends on the prevailing Ca2+ concentration prior to a perturbation. In addition to providing a novel mode of action of cellular Ca2+ buffering, our model extends the analysis of cooperativity beyond the static steady-state condition, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the dynamics and functional significance of cooperative binding in general.

AB  - Peatland rewetting is a widely used restoration technique, yet the recovery of anaerobic processes is poorly characterized. Microbes involved in anaerobic processes, especially methanogens, could reflect the stabilization of anaerobic conditions, vegetation succession and overall restoration success.
   We investigated the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and CH4 production potential in bogs and spruce swamp forests. Additionally, the substrate limitation of methanogens was tested with a focus on original peatland plant species and their spreading after rewetting by addition of natural substrates.
   Drainage strongly reduced the abundance and diversity of the methanogenic community. After rewetting, methanogenic abundance and community composition reached almost a pristine-like state, however their CH4 production remained as low as in the drained sites. Substrate addition confirmed the substrate limitation of methanogens due to strongly decomposed peat and the slow spreading of original peatland vegetation. The addition of natural substrates supported methanogenesis close to a pristine-like level. The limited CH4 production reflected not fully recovered anaerobic microbial community composition and vegetation structure 7-16 years after rewetting, although anaerobic conditions seemed to stabilize. Thus, the reestablishment of peatland vegetation structure is crucial for the recovery of methanogenic activity and microbial processes in rewetted peatlands. Moreover, methanogenic community composition, abundance and activity could be used as indicators of restoration success.
   Originality significant statement: Peatland drainage is increasingly recognized as a major problem affecting the status of valuable natural habitats, water quality and global carbon balance. Rewetting projects are set up to combat and mitigate the losses; yet not enough is known about the recovery of anaerobic processes, especially methanogenesis, which are assumed to reflect stabilization of anaerobic conditions and overall restoration success. Forestry-drained spruce swamp forests and bogs, common in northern Europe, are currently rewetted for both nature conservation purposes and for their anticipated function as hydrological buffers, but information on the recovery of anaerobic microbial communities and especially methanogens are only partly known.
   Our study concerns the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and activity (CH4 production potential) in undrained, drained and rewetted bogs and spruce swamp forests in the Bohemian Forest, Central Europe. We searched for a reason of limited methanogenic activity in rewetted sites by addition of natural substrates simulating the spreading of original peatland plants (Sphagnum, sedges). This paper contributes to scientific understanding on how long it takes for rewetted peatlands to recover anaerobic microbial communities, anaerobic processes and what are the crucial factors in this process. These results provides a basis for further studies on the trophic relations between anaerobic microbes and recovery of the drained peatlands after rewetting. This study can also extend a set of indicators which should be use for restoration progress evaluation.

AB  - The paper presents findings of a research, the goal of which was to evaluate the effectiveness of state measures aimed to promote the birth rate in Russia and its northern regions, their impact on the increase of birth rate intensity in 2007-2015. The relevance of choosing these territories for the study is determined by the high migration outflow of the population of reproductive age in most regions of the North, aggravating the growing adverse effects that the changes in the age structure have on fertility, the changes are due to the country's demographic history. Scientific novelty of the study consists in the fact that it determines the total demographic effect of current measures of pro-family policy, evaluates the results of enhancing its activities and makes a contribution to scientific studies on identifying the impact of the behavioral component of fertility on the formation of the final number of children in the family in terms of government incentives provided to families. This goal was achieved with the use of the method of standardization by age-specific birth rates for 2006. The authors have found out that in all of the territories the intensity of the birth rate increased most significantly in the women of middle and older reproductive age, but there exist regional specifics and differences in the nature of the transformation of the age-specific birth rate pattern. A 1.3-fold increase in the total fertility rate that was planned to coincide with the second phase of action of the Demographic Policy Concept of the Russian Federation until 2025 has reached the target indicators before the deadline nationwide and in the majority of Russia's northern regions. In the conditions of implementation of the demographic policy the number of births in Russia's northern regions was bigger by 195.6 thousand people or 18.8% compared to the number that would have been observed if the intensity of birth rate remained at the level of 2006. The article makes an attempt to substantiate the differences in the increase in the birth rate intensity in the context of Russia's northern regions. In the period from 2010 to 2015, when there was a growing negative impact of the age structure factor on the one hand, and the intensification of demographic policy measures on the other, an increase could be observed in the contribution of a behavioral component to the formation of the resulting birth rate. The increase in birth rate intensity is associated with the fact that families with children are in need of improving their living conditions, the subjective assessment of these conditions as poor is the factor constraining the number of births in societies where small families prevail.

AB  - The Es-4 shale, namely the fourth member of the Shahejie Formation deposited during the Eocene, is one of the most important hydrocarbon source rocks widely distributed in the Bohai Bay Basin. Twenty-nine samples with TOC ranging from 1.59% to 7.50% were gathered from the Es-4 shale at the Damintun Sag. Compositions of mineralogy, major oxides, trace elements and REEs were analyzed to study their provenance, paleo-environment and tectonic setting. The Es-4 shales show (La/Yb)(N) ratios ranging from 10.98 to 14.24 with an average of 12.45, and have similar Cl-chondrite normalized REE + Y distribution to intermediate similar to mafic igneous rocks developed at the northeast NCC (North China Craton) during the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. Weight ratios of Al2O3/TiO2, TiO2/Zr and Cr/Th of the Es-4 shales show values of 12.76-18.81, 71.2-147.8 and 12.96-19.91, which reveal a common source of detritus from intermediate igneous rocks. The Es-4 shales present values of K2O/Al2O3, ICV (Index of Compositional Variability), PIA (Plagioclase Index of Alteration) and CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration) locating at 0.07-0.21, 0.80-2.04, 39.82-83.85 and 44.76-76.15, respectively. These weathering proxies imply that the Es-4 shales underwent moderate to intense weathering. Sensitive redox indicators, pyrite (1.7% similar to 12.6%) and TOC (1.59% similar to 7.50%), indicate a reduced depositional condition. TOC of the Es-4 shales is positively correlated with U/Th and negatively correlated with (La/Yb)(N), which indicates that organic matters were largely preserved at more reduced conditions and could be diluted by detritus influx. Absolute ratios of U/Th (0.11-0.25), V/Cr (0.80-1.46) and Ni/Co (2.42 similar to 4.40) suggested an oxic environment, which is contrary to the conclusion supported by high TOC content and existence of pyrite. These absolute ratios of U/Th, V/Cr and Ni/Co are probably inherited from parental rocks rather than reflecting redox conditions in this study. Shale samples showing higher TOC content are either accompanied with higher U/Th, lower Sr/Ba and lower (La/Yb)(N), which demonstrates that organic matters are preserved in a deeper, fresh and reduced water environment. Plots of K2O/Na2O-SiO2, SiO2/Al2O3-K2O/Na2O, La-Th-Sc, Th-Sc-Zr/10 and Th-Co-Zr/10 indicate a tectonic setting of oceanic island arc or continental island arc.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the impact of heat stress on some physiological and endocrine traits in Saanen goats raised under Mediterranean climate conditions. The effects of thermal stress on heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) on plasma total trii-odothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), Cortisol (C), and HSP70 concentrations were evaluated on twenty two Saanen goats of different ages in the second week of April 2013, July 2013, October 2013 and January 2014. Climatic data such as temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity (%) were recorded from Spring 2013 to Winter 2014. Live body and BCS values were also recorded during this period. The physiological parameters above were measured twice on each experiment day (morning and afternoon) in all seasons. Blood samples were collected in each afternoon of the experiment day to analyze T3, T4 C, and HSP70. All data were analyzed. According to the values of rectal temperature (RT), it was estimated that the goats were under extreme heat stress only in the summer season. The heart rate (HR) values in the winter season for morning and noon periods were found statistically significant (p < 0.05). The average respiratory rate (RR) in the spring season was found significantly lower. On the other hand, the RR for the noon period in the summer was higher than in the fall and winter seasons (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between summer and fall seasons for C values. The highest value (96.62 ng/ml) was obtained in spring, whereas the lowest (60.58 ng/ml) in the fall. T3 levels in the fall and winter were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). They were the highest in the winter and spring, and the lowest in fall. T4 and T4/T3 levels in the winter were found to be statistically higher than in other seasons (p < 0.05). The lowest value for T4 was found in the fall and for T4/T3 in summer. Mean HSP70 value in spring was found to be statistically low (p < 0.05). The changes in THI values in different seasons, particularly between mornings and afternoons, indicated that thermal stress was evident, and that the animals became resistant to it eventually. The fluctuations of the C, T3, T4 and HSP70 values were indicators of the animals' reaction to thermal stress. The THI values in spring, which were between 16 and 18 THI, may be considered within the ideal comfort zone for goats. It was observed that Saanen goats were able to adapt to seasonal weather changes in the environmental conditions of the region.

AB  - Municipal wastewater (WW) effluent represents a reliable and significant source for reclaimed water, very much needed nowadays. Water reclamation and reuse has become an attractive option for conserving and extending available water sources. The decentralized approach to domestic WW treatment benefits from the advantages of source separation, which makes available simple small-scale systems and on-site reuse, which can be constructed on a short time schedule and occasionally upgraded with new technological developments.
   In this study we perform a Life Cycle Assessment to compare between the environmental impacts of four alternatives for a hypothetical city's water-wastewater service system. The baseline alternative is the most common, centralized approach for WW treatment, in which WW is conveyed to and treated in a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and is then discharged to a stream. The three alternatives represent different scales of distribution of the WW treatment phase, along with urban irrigation and domestic non-potable water reuse (toilet flushing). The first alternative includes centralized treatment at a WWTP, with part of the reclaimed WW (RWW) supplied back to the urban consumers. The second and third alternatives implement de-centralized greywater (GW) treatment with local reuse, one at cluster level (320 households) and one at building level (40 households).
   Life cycle impact assessment results show a consistent disadvantage of the prevailing centralized approach under local conditions in Israel, where seawater desalination is the marginal source of water supply. The alternative of source separation and GW reuse at cluster level seems to be the most preferable one, though its environmental performance is only slightly better than GW reuse at building level. Centralized WW treatment with urban reuse of WWTP effluents is not advantageous over decentralized treatment of GW because the supply of RWW back to consumers is very costly in materials and energy. Electricity is a major driver of the impacts in most categories, pertaining mostly to potable water production and supply. Infrastructure was found to have a notable effect on metal depletion, human toxicity and freshwater and marine ecotoxicity.
   Sensitivity to major model parameters was analyzed. A shift to a larger share of renewable energy sources in the electricity mix results in a dramatic improvement in most impact categories. Switching to a mix of water sources, rather than the marginal source, leads to a significant reduction in most impacts.
   It is concluded that under the conditions tested, a decentralized approach to urban wastewater management is environmentally preferable to the common centralized system. It is worth exploring such options under different conditions as well, in cases which new urban infrastructure is planned or replacement of old infrastructure is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work describes the reproductive physiology of the bastard grunt and gives some characteristics on the reproduction and growth in weight. Pomadasys incisus was caught with small-scale fishing fleet in the Tunis Gulf, and were sampled several times a month, from October 1991 to September 1994. The whole sample consisted in 1,325 specimens with total length ranging from 11.3 to 25.2 cm and weight from 20 to 248.5 g. The study of the reproductive characteristics is, at once, based on the evaluation of sex ratio in relation with size class and with sexual cycle. Monthly fluctuations of the gonadosomatic index combined with those of the gonad maturity stages frequencies allowed us to specify the various periods of the sexual cycle. Also, lengths at first maturity (TL50 and TL100) were estimated by fitting the relative frequency of all mature individuals to a logistic curve by non-linear regression. Moreover, monthly evolution of the condition factor, the hepatosomatic index and the nutrition index, related to sexual cycle periods and mean sea water temperatures try to give an interpretation of P incisus physiology. Growth in weight is appreciated by the means of length-weight relationships. Sex ratio is always in favour of females. Sexual maturity is attained at the same time for males and females. Sizes related to 50% and 100% of matured fish were respectively 16.13 and 21 cm. P incisus capture, by the artisanal fishery in the Tunis Gulf, occurs before sexual maturity. Therefore, biomass of spawners seems to be accessible to that fishing pattern. Sexual activity extended from June to November. Gonad maturation was carried out, between June and September, when mean sea water temperature raised from 15 to 22 degrees C; spawning peaks occurred in October when temperature falling from 22 to 17 degrees C. During winter time, when feeding activity was reduced, bastard grunt condition was the worst. P. incisus feeding is rather linked to seasonal variations of prey abundance than to physiological status. Female hepatic reserves are mobilised at the beginning of gonad maturation and are released during its terminal phase. Relative growth in weight was the same within males and females. Global length-weight relationship was Pb = 0.0107 LT3.019 and was isometric. Growths in length and weight seemed better in the Atlantic Ocean than in the Mediterranean Sea. This work underlines also the recent abundance of the bastard grunt in Tunis Gulf; moreover, that fish, whose origin is tropical, finds in Tunis bay favourable conditions for its reproduction. Because of its actual regional proliferation and its extension in the Mediterranean Sea, P. incisus may be considered as a biological indicator of the global warming of Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - 1. Our goal was to use physiological indicators [photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) response, nutrient status], population level feedbacks (self-shading) and ambient environmental conditions (dissolved nutrients, light, temperature) to improve our understanding of the seasonal and spatial population dynamics of Cladophora.
   2. Cladophora grew in three distinct phases, rapid growth early in the season (May-July), a mid-season population collapse (July-August) and autumn re-growth. Across all sites and dates, mean net maximal photosynthesis [P(M) (NET)] was 6.9 +/- 3.9 mg O(2) g DM(-1) h(-1), and alpha was 0.055 +/- 0.025 mg O(2) g DM(-1) mu m photons(-1) m(-2). Mean values for critical irradiance (I(CR)) and the half-saturation light intensity (I(K)), were 42.9 +/- 32.1 and 189.3 +/- 123.8 mu m photons(-1) m(-2) s(-1) respectively.
   3. At most sites growth was phosphorus-limited. Values of alpha were significantly higher at a site influenced by a nutrient enriched river plume, where algal growth was phosphorus-sufficient.
   4. Photoinhibition was not apparent in any of our P-I experiments. Even if photoinhibition had been apparent during in vitro P-I experiments, population level photosynthetic rates in the field would be little affected because intense self-shading restricts inhibiting irradiances to the upper few mm-cm of the algal canopy.
   5. Our physiological (P-I response) experiments contradicted previous assertions that high ambient temperatures, or nutrient deficiency, were primary causes of mid-summer sloughing. In our study, sloughing occurred simultaneously at nutrient enriched and nutrient deficient sites, at temperatures well below critical values found during in vitro experiments, and our indicator of physiological condition (P-I response) remained unchanged leading up to, or immediately after, the sloughing event.
   6. Self-shading can reduce the convexity of the P-I response within in vitro incubations, even when the amount of algal material is low. Our experiments used 0.08 g DM of algal material that formed clumps c. 1 cm thick. Under these conditions, we estimated negligible (< 1%) effects on P(M), a 12% reduction in apparent values of alpha, and 14% and 17% increases in values of the alpha-dependent terms I(CR) and I(K,) respectively.
   7. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a population-level negative feedback (self-shading) is responsible for sloughing in dense macroalgal beds. Sloughing was probably inevitable once macroalgal bed density and thickness surpassed a critical threshold. Cells towards the base of the bed received insufficient light to maintain metabolic balance, began to decay and weaken, and became increasingly susceptible to physical detachment from shear stress.

AB  - Tectonic pseudotachylytes might be used to constrain earthquake source parameters, such as dynamic shear stress resistance, average dynamic friction and slip-weakening distance. Estimation of dynamic shear stress resistance and dynamic friction from field studies is based on the assumption that the volume of melt produced during coseismic slip is proportional to the frictional work converted to heat on the fault surface. Conditions conducive to a realistic estimate of dynamic shear resistance are: (i) the presence of large outcrop exposures that allow for estimation of the volume of pseudotachylyte; (ii) the presence of structural markers offset by faults in order to relate the displacement accommodated by the fault with the volume of melt produced; (iii) data that provide an estimate of the initial melt temperature; and (iv) determination of host-rock temperature and pressure conditions that may have existed during seismic faulting. An independent indication that steady-state friction in the presence of melts might be achieved during coseismic slip arises from the dependence of the fractal dimension of the fault profile (intersection of the fault surface with the outcrop surface) with displacement. This relation could also indicate the slip-weakening distance (Hirose, T., Shimamoto, T., 2003. Fractal dimension of molten surfaces as a possible parameter to infer the slip-weakening distance of faults from natural pseudotachylytes. Journal of Structural Geology 25, 1569-1574).
   The above conditions are all satisfied in the case of the Gole Larghe Fault Zone, which consists of hundreds subparallel strike-slip faults that cut tonalites of the Adamello batholith (Italy). The thickness of pseudotachylyte-bearing faults increases with displacement. From displacement/thickness ratios and energy balance calculations, we determined the dynamic shear resistance for several pseudotachylyte-bearing faults. In the same faults, the fractal dimension of the fault profile increases from 1.0 to 1.16 with displacement. This was also observed in experiments where steady-state friction in the presence of melt was achieved (Hirose, T., Shimamoto, T., 2003. Fractal dimension of molten surfaces as a possible parameter to infer the slip-weakening distance of faults from natural pseudotachylytes. Journal of Structural Geology 25, 1569-1574). However, we will show that the estimate of the dynamic shear stress resistance, average dynamic friction and slip-weakening distance in the studied faults is limited by the uncertainties to attribute the measured displacement to a single seismic rupture. Since many pseudotachylytes in the upper seismogenic crust overprint preexisting cataclasites, it is suggested that future field and experimental work should be addressed to determine microstructural indicators (i.e. evolution of cataclastic fabric with displacement) within cataclasites, which might constrain the contribution of the cataclastic, pre-pseudotachylyte displacement to the total displacement accommodated by the fault.

AB  - Solar heating and cooling (SHC) systems are currently under rapid development and deployment due to their potential to reduce fossil fuel use and to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector a sector which is responsible for 40% of the world energy use. The available technologies on the market for thermally driven cooling systems are absorption and adsorption chillers, solid and liquid desiccant cooling systems, and ejector refrigeration cycles. Of these, absorption chillers are considered as the most desirable method for harnessing solar thermal energy due to their relative maturity, reliability, and higher efficiency. In addition, absorption chillers can take advantage of economies of scale in large buildings to obtain a relatively good levelized cost of cooling as compared to other thermally-driven air-conditioning systems. In this paper, the background theory on solar-powered absorption chillers is presented followed by a comprehensive literature review of the recent existing theoretical and experimental investigations on this technology is conducted. The review shows that the majority of solar absorption chillers installed and much of the research around the world is based on single-effect chillers and low-temperature solar thermal collectors, while less emphasis has been placed on the combination of high-temperature solar thermal collectors and multi-effect absorption chillers, especially triple effect chillers. Research studies indicate the use of gas-fired backup systems for single-effect chillers is inefficient due to its very low primary energy savings. It was also found that the storage tank and piping can be major sources of heat losses in solar absorption cooling systems. Thus, special care should be taken to ensure sufficient and appropriate insulation for all heat loss components. In regions with low direct normal incidence solar resources (e.g. most of Europe), solar multi-effect chillers are relatively inefficient, so single-effect chiller-based solar cooling systems are the best techno-economic choice in such regions. Conversely, multi-effect absorption chillers with high-temperature collectors are indeed promising in regions with high solar resources. However, the review shows that using currently available technology, SHC absorption chillers are not able to economically compete with conventional cooling without government subsidies and incentives. Therefore, improving the economic performance of these systems is essential. While there is clearly more that can be done on chiller and solar collector components themselves, we believe some R&D emphasis going forward should also be dedicated to the balance of the system, including optimization of the system configuration, minimizing parasitic losses, improved design and integration of thermal storage and auxiliary system, and numerous controls and operational aspects. To date, many of these topics have been largely overlooked in favor of chiller performance studies.

AB  - Over the past decade, a range of sensor technologies became available on the market, enabling a revolutionary shift in air pollution monitoring and assessment. With their cost of up to three orders of magnitude lower than standard/reference instruments, many avenues for applications have opened up. In particular, broader participation in air quality discussion and utilisation of information on air pollution by communities has become possible. However, many questions have been also asked about the actual benefits of these technologies. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive literature search including both the scientific and grey literature. We focused upon two questions: (1) Are these technologies fit for the various purposes envisaged? and (2) How far have these technologies and their applications progressed to provide answers and solutions? Regarding the former, we concluded that there is no clear answer to the question, due to a lack of: sensor/monitor manufacturers' quantitative specifications of performance, consensus regarding recommended end-use and associated minimal performance targets of these technologies, and the ability of the prospective users to formulate the requirements for their applications, or conditions of the intended use. Numerous studies have assessed and reported sensor/monitor performance under a range of specific conditions, and in many cases the performance was concluded to be satisfactory. The specific use cases for sensors/monitors included outdoor in a stationary mode, outdoor in a mobile mode, indoor environments and personal monitoring. Under certain conditions of application, project goals, and monitoring environments, some sensors/monitors were fit for a specific purpose. Based on analysis of 17 large projects, which reached applied outcome stage, and typically conducted by consortia of organizations, we observed that a sizable fraction of them (similar to 30%) were commercial and/or crowd-funded. This fact by itself signals a paradigm change in air quality monitoring, which previously had been primarily implemented by government organizations. An additional paradigm-shift indicator is the growing use of machine learning or other advanced data processing approaches to improve sensor/monitor agreement with reference monitors. There is still some way to go in enhancing application of the technologies for source apportionment, which is of particular necessity and urgency in developing countries. Also, there has been somewhat less progress in wide-scale monitoring of personal exposures. However, it can be argued that with a significant future expansion of monitoring networks, including indoor environments, there may be less need for wearable or portable sensors/monitors to assess personal exposure. Traditional personal monitoring would still be valuable where spatial variability of pollutants of interest is at a finer resolution than the monitoring network can resolve.

AB  - Simple Summary The surface temperature variation of heavy broilers (42-61 d age) under heat stress is an important indicator of thermal comfort, but it is not well studied and reported yet. This study examined the variation of surface temperatures of broilers through two dynamic air velocity treatments under hot summer conditions. It was discovered that the surface temperatures varied over age, daytime, and environmental factors (air temperature, relative humidity, and temperature humidity index). A simple linear regression model to predict the surface temperature of heavy broilers was developed. The findings from this study will enhance knowledge to understand the broilers' responses under heat stress, which will be helpful in providing necessary management decisions to create a comfortable thermal environment. Heavy broilers exposed to hot summer conditions experience fluctuations in surface temperatures due to heat stress, which leads to decreased performance. Maintaining a bird's homeostasis depends on several environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity). It is important to understand the responses of birds to environmental factors and the amount of heat loss to the surrounding environment to create thermal comfort for the heavy broilers for improved performances and welfare. This study investigates the variation in surface temperatures of heavy broilers under high and low air velocity treatments. Daytime, age and bird location's effect on the surface temperature variation was also examined. The experiment was carried out in the poultry engineering laboratory of North Carolina State University during summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019 as a part of a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of wind chill application to mitigate heat stress on heavy broilers. This live broiler heat stress experiment was conducted under two dynamic air velocity treatments (high and low) with three chambers per treatment and 44 birds per chamber. Surface temperatures of the birds were recorded periodically through the experimental treatment cycles (flocks, 35-61 d) with infrared thermography in the morning, noon, evening, and nighttime. The overall mean surface temperature of the broilers under two treatments was found to be 35.89 +/- 2.37 degrees C. The variation in surface temperature happened due to air temperature, thermal index, air velocity, bird's age, daytime, and position of birds inside the experimental chambers. The surface temperatures were found lower under high air velocity treatment and higher under low air velocity treatment. During the afternoon time, the broilers' surface temperatures were higher than other times of the day. It was also found that the birds' surface temperature increased with age and temperature humidity indices. Based upon the experimental data of five flocks, a simple linear regression model was developed to predict surface temperature from the birds' age, thermal indices, and air velocity. It will help assess heavy broilers' thermal comfort under heat stress, which is essential to provide a comfortable environment for them.

AB  - Deccan volcanic bole beds are important indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions during Cretaceous-Tertiary volcanism. However, little attention has been paid to iron oxide characteristics of these lava flow hosted sediments. Therefore, in order to understand the genesis and transformation of various iron oxides in different colored bole beds, we studied the mineral magnetism and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) characteristics of red, brown and green boles that are extensively exposed in the Deccan volcanic province (DVP) of Western India. Mineral magnetism and DRS characteristics indicate hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as the major iron oxide in all the bole beds with traces of goethite (alpha-FeOOH) in many. Maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) was also present in red boles as well as in few brown and green boles. The higher concentration of magnetic minerals in red boles is due to the neo-formation of fine magnetic minerals produced from heating of the weathered sediments by the overlying lava flow. The increasing concentration of superparamagnetic (SP) fraction (indicated by frequency dependent susceptibility, chi(fd)) with increased reddening of the bole beds (mean chi(fd) for green, brown and red boles = similar to 2.5, 11.1 and 19.3 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1), respectively) facilitates the use of chi(fd) as first order estimate for degree of heating in red boles. The paragenesis of ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals in green and brown boles is indicated by good correlation (R-2 = 0.78) between hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM) and chi(fd) suggests that green and brown boles have undergone some pedogenesis. The overall distribution of iron oxides in these bole beds indicate their genesis from incipient weathering of Fe-Mg minerals (e.g. olivine and pyroxenes) under humid conditions leading to the formation of ferrihydrite and goethite as precursors. Partial to complete heating resulted into oxidation of precursors and titanomagmetite to maghemite as the intermediate transformation phase and hematite as end product. The green, brown and red boles thus represent the transitional baking environments under various hydrous-anhydrous conditions and pedogenic processes. The genesis and transformation of various iron oxides in DVP bole beds may have significant implications for the characterization of such interflow sediments/paleosols from other igneous provinces (e.g. Israel, Karoo Flood Basalt, South Africa and Columbia River Basalt, USA). Further, complex genesis of the iron oxides in the DVP bole beds also envisages a great scope to study them as Martian analogues apart from their significance to paleoenvironment and demands more advanced rock magnetic and spectroscopic approaches.

AB  - Converging lines of evidence suggest that the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the endogenous biological clock controlling mammalian circadian rhythms. To study the calcium responses of the cellular components that make up the clock, computer-controlled digital video and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used with the Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 to examine dispersed SCN cells and SCN explants with repeated sampling over time. Ca2+ plays an important second messenger role in a wide variety of cellular mechanisms from gene regulation to electrical activity and neurotransmitter release, and may play a role in clock function and entrainment.
   SCN neurons and astrocytes showed an intracellular Ca2+ increase in response to glutamate and 5-HT, two major neurotransmitters in afferents to the SCN. Astrocytes showed a marked heterogeneity in their response to the serial perfusion of different transmitters; some responded to both 5-HT and glutamate, some to neither, and others to only one or the other. Under constant conditions, most neurons showed irregular temporal patterns of Ca2+ transients. Expression of regular neuronal oscillations could be blocked by the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Astrocytes, on the other hand, showed very regular rhythms of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations with periods ranging from 7 to 20 sec. This periodic oscillation could be initiated by in vitro application of glutamate, the putative neurotransmitter conveying visual input to the SCN critical for clock entrainment. Long-distance communication between glial cells, seen as waves of fluorescence moving from cell to cell, probably through gap junctions, was induced by glutamate, 5-HT, and ATP. These waves increased the period length of cellular Ca2- rises to 45-70 sec. Spontaneously oscillating cells were common in culture medium, serum, or rat cerebrospinal fluid, but rare in HEPES buffer.
   One source for cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases was an influx of extracellular Ca2+, as seen under depolarizing conditions in about 75% of the astroglia studied. All neurotransmitter-induced Ca2+ fluxes were not dependent on voltage changes, as Ca2+ oscillations could be initiated under both normal and depolarizing conditions. Since neurotransmitters could induce a Ca2+ rise in the absence of extracellular Ca2+,  the mechanisms of ultradian oscillations appear to depend on cycles of intracellular Ca2+ fluxes from Ca2+-sequestering organelles into the cytoplasm, followed by a subsequent Ca2+ reduction.
   In the adult SCN, fewer astrocytes are found than neurons, yet astrocytes frequently surround glutamate-immunoreactive axons in synaptic contact with SCN dendrites, isolating neurons from each other while maintaining contact with other astrocytes by gap junctions.
   Neurons and glia respond to neurotransmitter application with a variety of Ca2+ responses; both may play a role in the function of the SCN, and their interaction may explain several aspects of mammalian clock physiology not easily explained solely on the basis of our current understanding of axonally mediated neurotransmission.

AB  - In this study, we examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of water stress in China for the historical (1971-2010) and the future (2021-2050) periods using a multimodel simulation approach. Three water stress indices (WSIs), that is, the ratios of water withdrawals to locally generated runoff (WSIR), to natural streamflow (WSIQ), and to natural streamflow minus upstream consumptive water withdrawals (WSIC), are used for the assessment. At the basin level, WSIR estimates generally match the reported data and indicate severe water stress in most northern basins. At the grid cell level, the WSIs show distinct spatial patterns of water stress wherein WSIR (WSIQ) estimates higher (lower) water stress compared to WSIC. Based on the WSIC estimates, 368 million people (nearly one third of the total population) are affected by severe water stress annually during the historical period, while WSIR and WSIQ suggest 595 and 340 million, respectively. Future projections of WSIC indicate that more than 600 million people (43% of the total) might be affected by severe water stress, and half of China's land area would be exposed to stress. The found aggravating water stress conditions could be partly attributed to the elevated future water withdrawals. This study emphasizes the necessity of considering explicit upstream and downstream relations with respect to both water availability and water use in water stress assessment and calls for more attention to increasing levels of water stress in China in the coming decades.
   Plain Language Summary Severe water stress in China has been widely reported, but its time evolution and spatial patterns are rarely assessed. We examine the spatial and temporal change patterns of water stress in China by using multimodel simulations and three different water stress indices (WSIs). Results suggest that different WSIs imply distinct spatial patterns of water stress over China. The WSIs indicate that water stress conditions in northern China are quite distinct from that in southern China. During the past decades (1971-2010), severe water stress is found in northern areas while little is found in southern areas. In the future (2021-2050), however, water-stressed areas might expand in southern China and water stress levels might aggravate in urban areas, putting considerably more people exposed to severe water stress. This assessment provides useful information for regional water planning/management within the context of future climate change and socioeconomic development in China.
   Key Points
   Water stress estimates can be much different with the consideration of upstream water withdrawal and consumption Severe water stress conditions are found in northern China in the past Water-stressed areas significantly expand over southern China in the future

AB  - The organizing framework of adaptive landscape agriculture is protective afforestation. The study of the shelterbelt state is necessary for detection of their protective height due to the dramatically changing climatic conditions. The research purpose is to carry out the distribution of trees of English oak (Quercus robur L.) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) with height for the stand structure evaluation, as well as to propose the measures for the condition improvement of English oak. The shelterbelt, the spatial structure of which was studied, is located in the vicinity of the village of Zolotarevka (65 km from the city of Lugansk). Archival data on the creation time and age of the studied forest shelterbelt were not revealed. Shelterbelts in the Lugansk region were created in accordance with the "Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature", which was designed for 1949-1965. Sampling areas were laid out in accordance with the industrial standard OST 56-69-83. The composition of the shelterbelt, the diameter and average height of the trees were determined based on the results of enumerative valuation. The coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of stands of the studied species were calculated by the standard methods of biometrics. The distribution of Norway maple and English oak trees with height was checked with the normal distribution of trees in the plantation according to the Shapiro-Wilk test. The authors revealed that arithmetic and valuation mean heights of the stands of English oak and Norway maple on two permanent sampling areas differ slightly. It was found that the stand of Norway maple on the first and second sampling areas is characterized by positive right-side symmetry and positive kurtosis. Analyzing the stand condition, it is arguable that the coefficient of skewness of the English Oak stand on both areas is not the same in sign and numerical value: on the first sampling area - leftside negative (As = -2.026) and on the second - right-side positive (As = 0.973). The authors pay particular attention to the fact that the value of the coefficient of kurtosis of the English Oak stands is the highest on the first sampling area - 3.044. On the basis of the Shapiro-Wilk test it is shown that the curve of distribution of the Norway maple stands with height on the first and second sampling areas does not correspond to the normal distribution curve for the plantations. While the curve of distribution of the English Oak stands with height on the second sampling area is close to the indicator of the Shapiro-Wilk test for normal stands and is 0.823 (for p = 0.05, W = 0.842, n = 10).

AB  - The Southeastern United States experiences recurring hydrological droughts, which can reduce water availability and result in water deficits. Long-term monitoring data from Panola Mountain Research Watershed, a small, forested, seasonally water-limited watershed near Atlanta, GA, was used to quantify interactions of climatic variability with shallow and deep storage and evapotranspiration. Watershed storage (WS) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) were estimated monthly from 1985 through 2015 using a relationship with baseflow and a water-budget approach, respectively. A watershed shallow storage (SS) water budget, based on soil moisture profile data, indicated a transition from recharge to surplus as dormant season SS increased to field capacity, and a transition from utilization of stored water to water deficits as growing season SS declined toward its wilting point. Deeper storage appeared unavailable to AET during dry conditions. The majority of deeper storage recharge occurred during the dormant season and required SS to be near field capacity. WS was an effective drought indicator. Growing season droughts typically occurred when WS was below normal at the end of the dormant season and growing season precipitation (P) was below or near normal. A hydrologic persistence analysis showed that monthly month-standardized WS was significantly correlated (p-value<0.05) with past monthly month-standardized WS for the previous 19 months and with past monthly P for the previous 11 months, indicating the importance of past hydrologic conditions on WS. These findings allowed assessment of expected climatic changes on the water cycle, which included effects on future recharge, water deficits, and drought occurrence.
   Plain Language Summary Drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster in North America, resulting in reduced streamflows that are necessary for human use and aquatic plants and animals and shortages in shallow soil water that are necessary for plant growth and health. Monthly changes in storage of water in shallow and deep soils were estimated at a small, forested research watershed near Atlanta, Georgia to understand the relationships between shallow and deep storage and summertime drought occurrence. Summertime droughts occurred when springtime water storage in deeper soils was below normal and summertime rain was either near or below normal. Water storage in deeper soils was predominantly replenished by rain in the winter, but only after shallow soils were first wetted up. Deeper soils were rarely replenished during the summertime because most of the summertime rain that replenished water in shallow storage was evaporated or used by plants. These observations can be used to better understand conditions that result in drought in the Southeastern U.S. Expected climatic change in this region can affect the future occurrence of droughts by changing the amount of replenishment of water in deep soils in the winter and resulting in larger shortages in shallow soil water in the summer.

AB  - It is important to assess river ecosystem health in large-scale basins when considering the complex influence of anthropogenic activities on these ecosystems. This study investigated the river ecosystem health in the Haihe River Basin (HRB) by sampling 148 river sites during the pre- and post-rainy seasons in 2013. A model was established to assess the river ecosystem health based on water physicochemical, nutrient, and macroinvertebrate indices, and the health level was divided into "very poor," "poor," "fair," "good," and "excellent" according to the health score calculated from the assessment model. The assessment results demonstrated that the river ecosystem health of the HRB was "poor" overall, and no catchments were labeled "excellent." The percentages of catchments deemed to have "very poor," "poor," "fair," or "good" river ecosystem health were 12.88%, 40.91%, 40.15%, and 6.06%, respectively. From the pre-to the post-rainy season, the macroinvertebrate health levels improved from "poor" to "fair." The results of a redundancy analysis (RDA), path analysis of the structural equation model (SEM), and X-Y plots indicated that the land use types of forest land and grassland had positive relationships with river ecosystem health, whereas arable land, urban land, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and population density had negative relationships with river ecosystem health. The variance partitioning (VP) results showed that anthropogenic activities (including land use and socio-economy) together explained 30.9% of the variations in river ecosystem health in the pre-rainy season, and this value increased to 35.9% in the post-rainy season. Land use intensity was the first driver of river ecosystem health, and socio-economic activities was the second driver. Land use variables explained 20.5% and 25.7% of the variations in river ecosystem health in the pre-and post-rainy season samples, respectively, and socio-economic variables explained 12.3% and 17.2% of the variations, respectively. The SEM results revealed that urban land had the strongest impact on water quality health and that forest land had the strongest impact on macroinvertebrate health. This study has implications for the selection of appropriate indicators to assess river ecosystem health and generated data to examine the effects of anthropogenic activities on river ecosystem health in a fast-growing region.

AB  - Today, a large amount of knowledge is available concerning various sites of potential high active waste (HAW) repositories in salt media. Domal Zechstein salt formations have been examined at several sites in Germany. Extensive R&D work was initiated in the former Asse Salt Mine in order to explore the suitability of salt for waste isolation by laboratory tests, theoretical studies and in-situ tests with test results forming a technological base for future repository development.
   Resulting from the inhomogeneity of salt structures the demanded safety of a permanent repository for radioactive wastes can be demonstrated only by a specific site analysis in which the entire system, "the geological situation, the repository, and the form and amount of the wastes" and their interrelationships are taken into consideration.
   The site analysis has three essential tasks: (1) Assessment of the thermomechanical load capacity of the host rock, so that deposition strategies can be determined for the site; (2) Determination of the safe dimensions of the mine (e.g. stability of the caverns and safety of the operations); and (3) Evaluation of the barriers and the long-term safety analysis for the authorization procedure.
   The geotechnical stability analysis is a critical part of the safety assessment. Engineering-geological study of the site, laboratory and in situ-experiments, geomechanical modelling, and numerical static calculations comprise such an analysis.
   Within a scenario analysis - according to the multi-barrier principle, the geological setting is checked to be able to contribute significantly to the waste isolation over long periods. The assessment of the integrity of the geological barrier can only be performed by making calculations with geomechanical and hydrogeological models. The proper idealization of the host rock in a computational model is the basis of a realistic calculation of stress distribution and excavation damage effects. The determination of water permeability along discontinuities is necessary in order to evaluate the barrier efficiency of each host rock.
   In this paper some important processes for the performance assessment are described, namely creep and fracturing, permeability and infiltration, and halokinesis and subrosion.
   For the future, the role and contributions of geoscientific and rock mechanics work within the safety assessment issues (e.g. geomechanical safety indicators) must be identified in greater detail, e.g. considerations of geomechanical natural analogy for calibration of constitutive laws.

AB  - Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability is frequently compromised in the course of diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Sucrose is a low molecular weight, hydrophilic marker with slow permeability at the naive BBB and therefore one of the widely used indicators of barrier integrity. Our laboratory recently developed a highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method for stable isotope labeled [C-13(12)]sucrose in biological matrices. Correction of total brain concentration for contribution of intravascular space is required in such experiments in order to accurately measure BBB permeability, and it is often accomplished by vascular perfusion with buffer solutions prior to brain sampling. The purpose of the present study was to develop a UPLC-MS/MS method, which allows simultaneous analysis of two different stable isotope labeled sucrose variants, one of which can be utilized as a vascular marker. The first analyte, [C-13(12)]sucrose, serves to quantify brain uptake clearance as a measure of BBB permeability, while the second analyte, [C-13(6)]sucrose, is administered just before termination of the animal experiment and is considered as the vascular marker. [H-2(2)]sucrose is used as the internal standard for both C-13 labeled compounds. Because the majority of recent studies on CNS diseases employ mice, another objective was to validate the new technique in this species. The UPLC-MS/MS method was linear (r(2) >= 0.99) in the tested concentration ranges, from 10 to 1000 ng/mL for both analytes in plasma, from 2 to 400 ng/g [C-13(12)] sucrose in brain and from 10 to 400 ng/g [C-13(6)]sucrose in brain. It was also validated in terms of acceptable infra and inter run accuracy and precision values (n = 5). The dual analyte technique was applied in a study in mice. One group received intravenous bolus injections of 10 mg/kg [C-13(12)]sucrose at time 0, and 10 mg/kg C-13(6) sucrose at 14.5 min, and subsequent terminal blood and brain sampling was performed at 15 min. For comparison, another group received an intravenous bolus dose of 10 mg/kg [C-13(12)] sucrose and was submitted to transcardiac perfusion with buffer after 15 min. We demonstrate that the two alternative techniques to correct for intravascular content deliver equivalent values for brain concentration and brain uptake clearance.

AB  - Fissure eruptions are commonly linked to magma dikes at depth and are associated with elastic and inelastic surface deformation. Elastic deformation is well described by subsidence occurring above the dike plane and uplift and lateral widening occurring perpendicular to the dike plane. Inelastic deformation is associated with the formation of a graben, which is bordered by graben parallel faults that might express as sets of fractures at the surface. Additionally, secondary structures, such as push-ups, bends and step overs, yield information about the deforming domain. However, once these structures are formed during fissure eruptions, they are rarely preserved in nature, due to the effects of rapid erosion, sediment coverage or overprinting by other faulting events. Therefore, simple normal fault displacements are commonly assumed at dikes. At the 2014/2015 Holuhraun eruption sites (Iceland), increasing evidence suggests that developing fractures exhibited variations in their displacement modes. In an attempt to investigate these variations, a fieldwork mapping project combining Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based aerophoto analysis was undertaken. Using these data, we generated local high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and a structural map that facilitated the identification of kinematic indicators and the assessment of the observed structures. We identified 315 fracture segments from these satellite data. We measured the strike directions of single segments, including the amount of opening and opening angles, which indicate that many of the measured fractures show transtensional dislocations. Of these, similar to 81% exhibit a significant left-lateral component and only similar to 17% exhibit a right-lateral component. Here, we demonstrate that the local complexities in these fracture traces and geometries are closely related to variations in their transtensional opening directions. Moreover, we identified local changes in fracture azimuths and offsets close to eruption sites, which we speculate are associated with geometric changes in the magma feeder itself. The results highlight that the opening of fractures associated with an erupting fissure may record transtensional modes with both, left-lateral and right-lateral components. These results further highlight the value of using UAV-based high-resolution data to contribute to the integrity of the observations of the structural complexities produced by local geologic events.

AB  - Background: At present, there is no effective vaccine or other approved product for the prevention of sexually transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It has been reported that women in resource-poor communities use vaginally applied citrus juices as topical microbicides. These easily accessible food products have historically been applied to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and cytotoxicity of these substances using an established topical microbicide testing algorithm. Freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice and household vinegar were tested in their original state or in pH neutralized form for efficacy and cytotoxicity in the CCR5-tropic cell-free entry and cell-associated transmission assays, CXCR4-tropic entry and fusion assays, and in a human PBMC-based anti-HIV-1 assay. These products were also tested for their effect on viability of cervico-vaginal cell lines, human cervical explant tissues, and beneficial Lactobacillus species.
   Results: Natural lime and lemon juice and household vinegar demonstrated anti-HIV-1 activity and cytotoxicity in transformed cell lines. Neutralization of the products reduced both anti-HIV-1 activity and cytotoxicity, resulting in a low therapeutic window for both acidic and neutralized formulations. For the natural juices and vinegar, the IC50 was <= 3.5 (0.8-3.5)% and the TC50 <= 6.3 (1.0-6.3)%. All three liquid products inhibited viability of beneficial Lactobacillus species associated with vaginal health. Comparison of three different toxicity endpoints in the cervical HeLa cell line revealed that all three products affected membrane integrity, cytosolic enzyme release, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity in living cells. The juices and vinegar also exerted strong cytotoxicity in cervico-vaginal cell lines, mainly due to their acidic pH. In human cervical explant tissues, treatment with 5% lemon or lime juice or 6% vinegar induced toxicity similar to application of 100 mu g/ml nonoxynol-9, and exposure to 10% lime juice caused tissue damage comparable to treatment with 5% Triton-X-100.
   Conclusions: Lemon and lime juice and household vinegar do not fulfill the safety criteria mandated for a topical microbicide. As a result of their unphysiological formulation for the vaginal tract, they exhibit cytotoxicity to human cell lines, human vaginal tissues, and beneficial vaginal Lactobacillus species.

AB  - Lactose is a sugar uniquely found in mammals' milk and it is the major milk solid in bovines. Lactose yield (LY, kg/d) is responsible for milk volume, whereas lactose percentage (LP) is thought to be more related to epithelial integrity and thus to udder health. There is a paucity of studies that have investigated lactose at the genomic level in dairy cows. This paper aimed to improve our knowledge on LP and LY, providing new insights into the significant genomic regions affecting these traits. A genome-wide association study for LP and LY was carried out in Fleckvieh cattle by using bulls' deregressed estimated breeding values of first lactation as pseudo-phenotypes. Heritabilities of first-lactation test-day LP and LY estimated using linear animal models were 0.38 and 0.25, respectively. A total of 2,854 bulls genotyped with a 54K SNP chip were available for the genome-wide association study; a linear mixed model approach was adopted for the analysis. The significant SNP of LP were scattered across the whole genome, with signals on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20, 28, and 29; the top 4 significant SNP explained 4.90% of the LP genetic variance. The signals were mostly in regions or genes with involvement in molecular intra- or extracellular transport; for example, CDH5, RASGEF1C, ABCA6, and SLC35F9. A significant region within chromosome 20 was previously shown to affect mastitis or somatic cell score in cattle. As regards LY, the significant SNP were concentrated in fewer regions (chromosomes 6 and 14), related to mastitis/somatic cell score, immune response, and transport mechanisms. The 5 most significant SNP for LY explained 8.45% of genetic variance and more than one-quarter of this value has to be attributed to the variant within ADGRB1. Significant peaks in target regions remained even after adjustment for the 2 most significant variants previously detected on BTA6 and BTA14. The present study is a prelude for deeper investigations into the biological role of lactose for milk secretion and volume determination, stressing the connection with genes regulating intra- or extracellular trafficking and immune and inflammatory responses in dairy cows. Also, these results improve the knowledge on the relationship between lactose and udder health; they support the idea that LP and its derived traits are potential candidates as indicators of udder health in breeding programs aimed to enhance cows' resistance to mastitis.

AB  - In the present study we evaluated the toxicological effects of a scarcely documented environmental pollutant, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), on selected biochemical endpoints in the common carp, Cyprinus carpio. Juvenile organisms were exposed to PFOS through a single intraperitoneal injection (liver concentrations ranging from 16 to 864 ng/g after 5 days of exposure) and after I and 5 days effects were assessed in liver and serum of the exposed organisms. The investigation of the hepatotoxicity of PFOS included the determination of the peroxisome proliferating potential (peroxisomal palmitoyl CoA oxidase and catalase activity) and the compounds influence on the average DNA basepair length (ABPL) by agarose gel electrophoresis. Total antioxidant activity (TAA), cholesterol and triglyceride levels were monitored in the serum. After 1 day of exposure the ABPL was significantly increased in the 270 and 864 ng/g treatment groups. After 5 days of exposure significant increases relative to the control were observed for the 16, 270 and 864 ng/g treatment groups. Enzyme leakage from the liver was investigated by measurement of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities in the serum. At 561, 670 and 864 ng/g PFOS a significant increase in serum ALT activity became apparent after 5 days of exposure with values ranging from 159 to 407% relative to the control. For serum AST activity a significant increase for the 864 ng/g treatment group was observed with a value of 112% relative to the control. Determination of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration into liver tissue as assessed through myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in liver, was used as an indicator for inflammation. It appeared that inflammation was not involved in the observed membranous enzyme leakage for the 561, 670 and 864 ng/g PFOS treatment groups. The results of this study suggest that PFOS induces inflammation-independent enzyme leakage through liver cell membranes that might be related to cell necrosis. Furthermore, results show that PFOS does not significantly affects serum antioxidant levels nor does it clearly induce peroxisome proliferation in carp. This study also points out that PFOS might interfere with homeostasis of the DNA metabolism. The results of these biochemical analyses were used to perform an initial hazard assessment study indicating that PFOS levels observed in tissues of wildlife populations could induce a clear rise in serum transaminase levels indicative for disruption of hepatocyte membrane integrity.

AB  - Fluorescent bioorthogonal smart probes across the visible spectrum will enable sensitive visualization of metabolically labeled molecules in biological systems. Here we present a unified design, based on the principle of photoinduced electron transfer, to access a panel of highly fluorogenic azide probes that are activated by conversion to the corresponding triazoles via click chemistry. Termed the CalFluors, these probes possess emission maxima that range from green to far red wavelengths, and enable sensitive biomolecule detection under no-wash conditions. We used the CalFluor probes to image various alkyne-labeled biomolecules (glycans, DNA, RNA, and proteins) in cells, developing zebrafish, and mouse brain tissue slices.

TI  - Recent shifts in the state of the North Pacific
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA  - English
AB  - The winters of 1999-2002 for the North Pacific were characterized by spatial patterns in sea level pressure anomaly (SLPA) and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) with little resemblance to those of the leading pattern of North Pacific climate variability, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). In essence, the southeastern (northern) portion of the North Pacific was subject to atmospheric forcing characteristic of that before (after) the major regime shift of 1976-77. Recent major changes in the ecosystems off the west coast of the United States and continued conditions similar to those of the early 1990s in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk are consistent with these SLPA and SSTA patterns. Our result illustrates that a single indicator such as the PDO is incomplete in characterizing North Pacific climate.

AB  - It is recognized that wildlife populations exhibit spatial and temporal variability in patterns of species richness across heterogeneous landscapes. This phenomenon can prove problematic for environmental practitioners when attempting to complete comprehensive environmental assessments (EM) with limited field surveys. A better understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns in population dynamics should enhance site-level decision-making. In this study, the variability of seasonal data across the Credit River Watershed, southern Ontario, is assessed for a hierarchy of conservation measures including species richness, and two conservation wildlife response guilds based on primary habitat and area sensitivity. Bird populations were monitored at 24 forest monitoring plots across the watershed by the authors twice a season from 2003 to 2010 following the protocol of Environment Canada's Forest Bird Monitoring Program. The monitoring plots are located within four land management zones identified as 1) urban, 2) transitional, 3) escarpment and 4) rural. Data from the monitoring program are used to compare species richness among plots across the watershed and among land management zones. In addition, the variability of records from each plot over the 8 year period was determined by means of the Coefficient of Variation (CV) statistic. The mean variability of these records at each site within each land management zone was determined in order to assess whether the temporal variability of bird records might affect the integrity of short term assessments. Finally, a one-way ANOVA was applied to learn whether the result of short-term assessments may be further compounded by differences in the response of selected bird guilds to landscape heterogeneity. The results show that there is a significant difference in mean richness of forest birds among the four management zones. The ANOVAs indicate that significant difference is due to the temporal variability of a) breeding forest interior birds rather than edge birds or generalist species and b) breeding area sensitive species rather than area non-sensitive species. Recommendations are made that environmental assessments targeting forest interior bird populations need to plan sampling strategies that recognize this variability, especially for sites within the transitional and urban zones. Planning in the transition or urbanizing landscape should incorporate landscape ecology principles to sustain current levels of richness in forest species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper demonstrates that electrochemical detection (ECD) coupled to ion chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (IC-ECD-ESI/MS/MS) can be used to rapidly estimate some indications of the health status of organisms. The lactulose to mannitol ratio (L/M) is used as a non-invasive assay to investigate small intestinal absorption pathways and mucosal integrity. In the present study, an evaluation of the negative effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam perorally administrated to a group of dogs was carried out by determining the lactulose/mannitol index using the IC-ECD-ESI/MS/MS hyphenated technique. According to the results of the study, meloxicam altered gastrointestinal permeability. Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) was tested to determine if it could prevent meloxicam induced gastrointestinal damage and it was found that CoQ(10) could be an effective preventive treatment. Furthermore, plasma glucose concentration level was determined to be an indirect indicator of the oxidative state in the blood. To find out the beneficial effects of a double antioxidant combination (alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and CoQ(10)) on the total glucose level in chickens, ALA and CoQ(10) were provided as food additives in factory farm raised chicken. The results of the pilot study indicate that the glucose level in the plasma of chickens group fed with CoQ(10) and ALA was significantly decreased compared to the control group. Ion chromatography (IC) utilizing pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) was compared to ion chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as an analytical tool for monitoring the carbohydrate level in biological fluids. In electrochemical detection, the newly developed two-pulse waveform successfully withstands matrix effects in biological samples. Continuous on-line desalting of the high salt concentrations used as the eluent for carbohydrate separation from the anion-exchange column allows coupling of IC and MS techniques. A make-up solution (0.5 mM LiCl) was delivered prior to MS detection for efficient ionization of eluted carbohydrates. Method validation showed that both used techniques are practically comparable and some advantages of each are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates the nature of shadow banking and its effects on bank lending and funding conditions in the U.S. financial markets. It, first, reviews the main instruments of this credit intermediation and the procyclical patterns in it. Second, it estimates two indicators of shadow banking activities and uses these indicators in Markov-switching (MS) and vector autoregressive models. The MS models detect two regimes for bank lending, and these regimes reflect the expansion and contraction phases of bank lending cycles. Shadow banking is positively (negatively) associated with bank lending in the expansion (contraction) phases. Another model that uses impulse-response analysis shows that shadow banking has a positive effect on the risk premium and a negative effect on term spread.

AB  - In many countries, environmental policies and regulations are implemented to improve environmental quality and thus individuals' well being However, how do individuals value,the environment? In this paper, we review the life satisfaction approach (LSA), which represents a new nonmarket valuation technique The LSA builds on the recent development of subjective research in economics and takes measures of reported life satisfaction as an empirical approximation to individual welfare Microeconometric life satisfaction functions are estimated taking into, account environmental conditions along with income and other covariates The estimated coefficients for the environmental good and income can then be used to calculate the implicit willingness to pay for the environmental good

Plantlets of cv. 'Desiree derived from irradiated callus of potato were inoculated in vitro with a culture filtrate of A. solani (Sorauer). Of the 45 lines selected and subsequently evaluated under conditions of natural infection in the greenhouse six showed lesser degrees of early blight infection than the cv. Desiree control. The six lines selected in the greenhouse retained lower degrees of infection during 2 years of field trials.

T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

AB  - The relation between the entropy exchange of an open atmospheric system in non-equilibrium conditions with its environment and the organization of the system is examined in terms of the theory of dissipative structures. In this paper, the integrative form of the entropy balance equation in a form suitable for describing the entropy budget of an atmospheric system as a whole is derived starting from the Gibbs relation, and, as examples, the entropy flows of a West Pacific typhoon and a Bay of Bengal cyclone are calculated. The results show that negative entropy flows have an important effect on the organization of atmospheric dissipative structures and that the evolution of negative entropy flows is a good indicator of the life cycle of an atmospheric system.

AB  - Scanning electron microscope (SEM) orientation contrast images of mantle nodules show that garnets contain cellular domains of different crystallographic orientation. Electron backscatter diffraction shows small crystallographic mismatches (<3<degrees>) across cell boundaries. A transmission electron microscope examination of an area containing these substructures shows that the cell boundaries comprise arrays of dislocations and are subgrain boundaries. The observed garnet substructures relate to high-temperature dislocation creep and recovery. This is the first time that subgrains have been shown to occur in a significant volume of an individual garnet. Wider application of new SEM techniques may enable us to use garnet microstructures to determine deformation conditions more exactly and will aid interpretation of garnet microchemical data.

AB  - The application of Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) classified the island into four different habitat types. Each of them comprises different communities with indicator species of their own.
   Deterended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) was used to study species-environment relationships. Accordingly, the most important environmental factors affecting the distribution and structure of the present communities are: moisture content, depth of water, CaCO3 concentration, organic carbon and soil texture.
   The former vegetation of the island was studied through palynological technique. DCA (Deterended Correspondence Analysis) ordination of TWINSPAN pollen assemblage groups clarified the distribution of hydrophytes in the lowermost layer and mesophytes in the uppermost layer of profile dug (60 cm depth) in the island. Amphibious species occupied the middle level reflecting a change from hydric to mesic conditions.

AB  - The benthic crustaceans do not have random spatial distribution under natural conditions, this means that these species can have a determined pattern such as associated or uniform. In this work we studied a non-random spatial pattern in two freshwater malacostracan species, Aegla cholchol (Decapoda) from Cautin river, and Hyalella patagonica (Amphipoda) from Quillel-hue lake (38 degrees S, Araucania Region, Chile) respectively. The data revealed that both species have an associated pattern, and negative binomial distribution. These results agree with similar observations for other inland water benthic species from Southern Chilean rivers and streams.

AB  - Twenty-one coal samples of Seam 11 from the Antaibao Mine, Ningwu Coalfield, Shanxi Province, were analyzed by microscopic method. The macerals were identified and their ratios were calculated. The vitrinite contents decrease and the inertinite contents increase from bottom to top of the seam section. The data were used as indicators in the definition of different types of coal facies and hydrodynamic condition diagrams. The results indicate that the peat moor of Seam 11 might be formed in a regression environment, and it can be divided into 7 secondary regression processes. The peats evolved from low-open moor to dry-forest moor. The water depth of the moor decreased, and activity of water flowing decreased.

AB  - The highly complex lithological structure as well as topographic characteristics of the Medvednica area are responsible for its profound vegetational, micro-climatic and pedophysiographic diversity. In view of the quality of the original soil-forming material, the first place is taken by rocks and their detritus which directly govern soil physical composition. The best indicators of soil physical composition are its depth, colour, skeletal nature, particle size distribution, soil density, density of soil solid phase, total porosity, water capacity, air capacity, structure and hydraulic properties. On Medvednica, these vary greatly and play the main role in defining soil quality. The success of ecosystem management depends on the knowledge of the above factors. The goal of this research is to determine how the lithological base, or parent material, primarily affects physical (horizon thickness, profile depth, skelet proportion, soil texture, soil structure) and mineral soil properties.
   A total of 80 pedological profiles were opened in the Medvednica Nature Park area and evenly distributed so as to comprise all the representative lithological units. Samples of physically altered soils were taken from genetic horizons, as well as a fragment of rock, i.e. parent material, for the purpose of determining the litho logical rock affiliation. Soil samples has been analayzed in the humus-accumulative (A horizon) and first under mineral horizon (mostly B horizon). The differences between the topsoil humus-accumulative and B horizon were statistically analyzed per lithological units. The samples were prepared (ISO 11464 2006) and analyzed in the laboratories of the Faculty of Forestry of the University of Zagreb and at the Croatian Geological Institute in Zagreb. According to FAO (2006), the following was determined in situ: the proportion of skelet per genetic horizon, horizon thicknesses and total profile depth. Laboratory analyses of the samples taken from genetic horizons included the particle size distribution according to ISO 11277:2009, stability of structural microaggregates according to Pernar et al. (2013) and mineral soil composition (XRD) using the X-ray diffraction method on X-ray diffractrometer X'Pert PRO MPD.
   For the needs of statistical analysis, parent material was divided into six characteristic units, leaning in part on the classification of Halamic et al. (2001) used during geochemical research of stream sediments on Medvednica. The lithological unit LIT I is represented by metamorphic rocks, predominantly greenschists, muscovite chlorite and quartz-muscovite schists. The lithological unit LIT2 is represented by metamorphic rocks, predominantly phyllites. The lithological unit LIT3 consists of igneous rocks, predominantly diabases and spilites. The lithological unit LIT4 are Mesozoic clastic rocks of Lower Cretaceous age, and comprise sandstones, siltites and shales. The lithological unit LIT5 consists of Mesozoic and Tertiary clastic rocks dominantly represented by marls. LIT6 is made up of Tertiary carbonate rocks represented by lithotamnic limestones together with clay limestones (Figure 1).
   Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica 7 software. Descriptive statistics was made for all the analyzed variables, including the number of samples, arithmetic means and standard deviation. Differences between the analyzed variables by lithological units were tested with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), on condition that the assumption of homogeneity of variance was satisfied. For those variables in which the test of homogeneity of variance was not satisfied, the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used. Type I error (a) of 5 % was considered statistically significant.
   The following soil types were identified in the opened pedological profiles: dystric cambisol, eutric cambisol, calcaric cambisol, stagnosol, regosol and luvisol (the percentage ratio by representation is 62 - 19 % - 10 9/0 4 % 3 % 2 %).
   Based on the comparison of soils formed in six different lithological units, it can be concluded that physical and mineral soil properties depending on type of litological units. Silty to clay loam is the most represented textural class in Medvednica Nature Park. It was found on metamorphic rocks above greenschist and phyllite, igneous rocks, sandstones and marls, whereas on easily weathered limestones the textural class ranges from silty clay to clay. The analysis of particle size distribution (content of individual fractions) showed that the profiles developed on silicate lithological parent material have on average higher sand content compared to the profiles developed on carbonate rocks, which is conditioned by the manner of parent rock weathering. Higher clay content above easily weathered limestones eventually led to variability of the textural class in relation to other lithological units. In all the investigated lithological units in terms of structural microaggregate stability, the soils in Medvednica Nature Park manifest highly stable microaggregates. In relation to the B horizon, the humus-accumulative horizon revealed higher stability of structural microaggregates, which can be attributed to higher content of organic matter in the topsoil horizon. The soils above igneous and metamorphic rocks have significantly lower content of the mineral quartz and higher content of the minerals chlorite and feldspar in relation to the soil above sedimentary rocks. There was no difference in muscovite/illite contents in lithological substrates. Soil was the deepest above marl rocks and the shallowest above dolomitised limestones, which is primarily conditioned by the manner of parent material weathering.
   Our research highlights all the complexity and heterogeneity of the geological-lithological structure of Medvednica. In combination with other pedogenetic factors, it manifests even higher soil heterogeneity, which eventually causes problems in the processing and interpretation of the results.
   This research provides reference data on physical and mineral properties of soils in Medvednica Nature Park in the most represented lithological units. However, these data should be taken with caution and should be compared with the results of other similar studies, since the same lithological parent material may give rise to the formation of soils of different taxonomic affiliation, depending on the changes in the constellation of other pedogenetic factors (climate, vegetation, relief).

AB  - We examined the lipids preserved in active and inactive geothermal silica sinters (with ages of up to ca. 900 yr) from Champagne Pool, a hot spring in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Amongst a range of lipid biomarkers, 1,2-di-O-alkylglycerols (diethers) and 1,2-di-O-phytanylglycerol (archaeol) are Particularly abundant. Bacterial non-isoprenoidal diethers Occur in highest abundance in young sinters, Particularly when normalised relative to archaeol.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the modulator effects of task type (intellective, creative and bargaining) and communication channel on the influence of time pressure on group performance quality. For this reason, it was carried out an experiment using a sample of 124 subjects, that were randomly assigned into the six different experimental conditions (3*2 -communication channel*time pressure) in four-person groups. The results showed the relevance of type of task and communication channel in understanding the relation between time pressure and group performance quality. It is suggested that future research will must take into account environmental or individual variables as modulators to reach a better understanding of the relation between time pressure and group performance quality, whose literature results are often contradictory.

For this purpose, various exergetic, environmental and sustainability parameters of a PEMFC are investigated based on its operating and technical conditions. Consequently, these parameters may be utilised as some indicators in the development of energy and environmental policies for residential and industrial applications using PEMFC power systems. These parameters are also expected to help understand the linkage between micro-fuel-cell parameters and global aspects in terms of environmental impact and sustainable development and hence make PEMFCs more efficient, more environmentally benign and more sustainable.

AB  - The potential for competitive inhibition to limit the growth of microbial pathogens in food raises questions about the external validity of typical predictive microbiology studies and suggests the need to consider microbial community dynamics in food safety risk assessment. Ecological theory indicates, however, that community dynamics are highly complex and may be very sensitive to initial conditions and random variation. Seemingly incongruous empirical results for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef are shown to be consistent with a simple theoretical model of interspecific competition. A potential means of incorporating community-level microbial dynamics into the food safety risk assessment process is explored. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Four large office buildings were investigated to assess relationships among ventilation rate, smoking activity, and indicators of indoor air quality. Inspections of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems indicated that they were adequately designed, operated, and maintained. During the tests, all four HVAC systems provided ventilation rates essentially conforming to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989. IAQ indicators included respirable suspended particles, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Environmental tobacco smoke indicators included ultraviolet particulate matter, fluorescent particulate matter, and nicotine. Results show that with the HVAC systems adequately designed, operated in accordance with the current ASHRAE Standard, and properly maintained, all indicators were below applicable standards, regardless of smoking policy.

AB  - The cells of synurophyte flagellates (algal class Synurophyceae, formerly included in the Chrysophyceae) are enclosed within a regularly imbricate layer of ornamented siliceous scales. Scale morphology is of critical taxonomic importance within this group of algae, and the scales are valuable indicator microfossils in paleolimnological studies. The data presented here demonstrate that scale morphology and the integrity of the scale layer can exhibit extreme variability in culture as a function of the cellular quota of silica under silica-limited growth. Silica-limited, steady-state populations of the colonial flagellate Synura petersenii Korsh, were maintained over a range of specific growth rates (mu = 0.11-0.69 days(-1)) and silica cell quotas (Q(si) = 0.13-2.40 pmoles Si . cell(-1)). Scale morphology and the organization of the scale layer became increasingly aberrant as silica stress increased. Under severe stress, scale deposition was completely suppressed so that cells appeared scale-free. This depression of scale deposition was reversible; populations of silica-starved, scale-free cells rapidly regenerated new scale layers when placed in batch culture and spiked with dissolved silica. During recovery from silica stress, cell division was repressed for 24 h while mean cell silica quota increased 25-fold. The first new scales appeared within 2 h after the silica addition, and development of the new scale layer proceeded in an approximately synchronous manner, resulting in normal scale layers on virtually all cells after 48 h of recovery in Si-rich medium. silica content of silica-replete Synura cells in comparable to freshwater diatoms of similar size, but Synura has much greater potential quota variability than diatoms and no apparent threshold silica requirement. Silica-limited growth kinetics and competition between diatoms and Synura for silica are discussed.
   The results suggest that morphological variability of siliceous scales in natural populations of synurophyte flagellates may result from silica stress and that the experimental approach developed here has great potential value as a means for circumscribing ecotypic variation in scale morphology. Results also demonstrate that scale production can be uncoupled from cell division, suggesting that urophyceae may be fundamentally different from that of diatoms (algal class Bacillariophyceae). This experimental system has application in the future study of the intracellular membrane systems and the regulatory processes involved in silica biomineralization.

AB  - The status of fishery stocks in the coastal waters of China is far from ideal, mainly due to climate change and the impacts of human activities (e.g., pollution and overfishing). Thus, the restoration and protection of fishery resources have become critical and complex. The stability and balanced structure of the fish community is a basic foundation for the protection of fishery resources. Based on data collected from bottom trawls by the R/V Beidou in continental shelf of the East China Sea in November 2006 and February 2007, changes in the composition and diversity of fish species and functional groups were analyzed. The research area was divided into offshore waters and inshore waters by the two-way indicator species analysis (TWIA). The results showed that the dominant species were different between offshore waters and inshore waters and also varied with the survey time. The most abundant family was Sciaenidae and Teraponidae in November 2006, Sciaenidae, Engraulidae and Triglidae were most abundant in February 2007. The species belonged mainly to mobile piscivores (G6), benthivores/piscivores (G4), benthivores (G3) and planktivores (G1), and the dominant species in November 2006 were commercial species (e.g. Larimichthys polyactis and Trichiurus japonicus), but small-sized species were dominant in February 2007 (e.g., Harpadon nehereus, Benthosema pterotum, Champsodon capensis, and Acropoma japonicum). The species diversity showed a similar trend as the functional group diversity. Stations with higher diversity were mainly distributed in inshore waters in February 2007, whereas higher diversity was found in offshore waters in November 2006. The highest biomass and species number were found in G6 group, followed by the G4, G5 and G1 groups. The distribution of the number of individuals of each functional group showed the opposite trend as that of the biomass distribution. In addition, the size spectra were mainly concentrated around 3-29 cm, and the individual number of fish species gradually decreased with the increase in body size, but the relative biomass showed a moderate fluctuation in each size class. These changes showed that species with faster growth rate and earlier maturity age became dominant in continental shelf of the East China Sea. So the variations in biological characteristics of fish should be fully considered in maintaining sustainable utilization of fishery resource.

An exploratory analysis of socio-environmental indicators is proposed using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Results of the analysis identify four time intervals (1862-1891, 1892-1930, 1931-1976, 1977-2009) with homogeneous characteristics in both population and land-use attributes. These time intervals represent conditions of dynamic equilibrium between the environment and the local socioeconomic context, and highlight latent transitions in both population and land-use variables.

AB  - In the New Keynesian framework, the public's expectation about the future path of monetary policy is an important determinant of current economic conditions. This paper examines the impact of unobservable shifts in the central bank's output gap target Oil inflation and Output dynamics. I show that when the degree of persistence of a shock is private information of the central bank, and policy is discretionary in nature, it is optimal for the central bank not to reveal the future expected path of the output gap target. Perfect transparency unambiguously increases inflation and output volatility and thus lowers welfare. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An analysis model has been constructed for handling interactions between highly complex street-block wide solar radiation patterns and building air-conditioning load. As a demonstration case of the present system, coupled solar radiation-thermal load analysis for an eleven-story office building has been performed. By comparing the result of a building located in a city block with a reference case of a self-standing building, the proper arrangement of buildings and spaces such as solar reflectance of building surface may be proposed.

AB  - Trematode communities in populations of estuarine snails can reflect surrounding animal diversity, abundance, and trophic interactions. We know less about the potential for trematodes to serve its bioindicators in other habitats. Here, we reanalyze data from 2 published studies concerning trematodes, 1 in the Chilean rocky intertidal zone and the other fiom the East African rift take. Lake Tanganyika. Our analyses indicate that trematodes are more common in protected areas and that in both habitats they are directly and positively related 10 surrounding host abundance. This further Supports the notion that trematodes in first intermediate hosts can serve as bioindicators of the condition of free-living animal communities in diverse ecosystems..

AB  - The nudibranch species Tenellia adspersa (Nordmann, 1845) is recorded from the Finnish archipelago for the first time in more than 100 years, as previous records of this species from the Baltic proper are few and date back prior to 1900. The present record was made by means of SCUBA diving at near-shore brackish water locations. Despite only a few early records from the literature, the new data presented here suggest that this species is abundant in the northern part of the Baltic proper. A short account of ecological observations of T adspersa from the Northeast Atlantic is given, indicating that together with the present abundance, this highly adaptable species is fully capable of thriving in true brackish water conditions.

AB  - We report on morphological abnormalities observed in Acartia lilljeborgi in Espirito Santo Bay (E.S. - Brazil). Samples were collected at six stations; five inside the bay and one outside of it, in March 1991-92 (raining season) and September 1991-92 (dry season) during 3 days. Biotic and abiotic variables were also determined. About 30% of the specimens exhibited morphological abnormalities, such as intestinal prolapse and partial rupture of the chitinous carapace accompanied with a mass extrusion of cell material and protoplasm. The proportion of young forms of A. lilljeborgi with abnormalities was greater than that of adult forms (59%). A. lilljeborgi can therefore be used as a possible indicator of environmental conditions in the bay.

AB  - During the last decades the concept of job quality (JQ) and immigrant's assimilation in the labour market has been highly debated in the social science.
   This paper aims to contribute to this emerging body of research on subjective job quality indicators as a measure of immigrants' integration in the French labour market through estimation of the differential between native and migrant workers.
   Focussing on the gap between native and immigrant workers in the French labour market context, we evaluate job quality with subjective indicators related to the working environment, such as whether or not the job tasks entail health risks, physical strains or other drawbacks.

AB  - Improving plant nutrient management is important for environmental, economic, and social considerations. The adoption of the "4R" nutrient stewardship framework (right source, right rate, right time, and right place) provides a basis for examination of the underlying scientific principles behind fertilizer use. These 4R concepts are based in global principles related to chemistry, biology, physics, and economics, but the selection of specific practices is adjusted to individual field conditions, relying on local expertise and data. Various stakeholders have input in the selection of nutrient management practices, and their objectives may not always coincide. The development of performance indicators to measure the progress made by adoption of the 4R management techniques needs to be decided by stakeholders.

KW  - LIFE STAGES
AB  - The oil spill dispersants, Corexit(R) 9500 and Corexit(R) 9527 have low to moderate toxicity to most aquatic species in laboratory tests. Toxicity estimates are significantly affected by test variables such as species, lifestage, exposure duration, and temperature. Aquatic toxicity data generated from spiked, declining exposures (107 min half-life) are more reflective of actual dispersant use conditions. Decisions to use oil spill response chemicals should not be based solely on aquatic toxicity. Factors to consider include product effectiveness, toxicity of dispersed oil, species/habitats requiring priority protection, and recovery potential of sensitive habitats and populations. An environmental risk assessment approach is recommended where dispersant toxicity data generated under environmentally relevant exposures are compared to estimated environmental concentrations of dispersants.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the importance of integrated studies of marine geology and geochemistry in the environmental management of an urbanized coastal inlet, using Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia, as an example. The harbour receives 170 million litres of raw sewage per day; other sources of contamination include landfills, industrial activity, surface runoff and dredging. The level of contamination by metals in surficial sediments in Halifax Harbour is among the highest anywhere recorded in marine harbours, and is a result of sediment trapping and lack of flushing. Geological and oceanographic conditions strongly influence the present environmental quality of the harbour; assessment of environmental quality and the design of waste-water management systems in urban harbours, are fundamentally dependant on detailed knowledge of sediment transport, deposition and erosion.

AB  - PC BEEPOP is a computer model that simulates honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colony population dynamics.  The model consists of a feedback system of interdependent elements, including colony condition (e.g., initial size, reproductive potential of the queen and forager longevity), environmental variability (e.g., weather) and contaminant exposures.  It includes a mortality module (BEEKILL) and a chemical-toxicity data base and probit analysis program (BEETOX).  PC BEEPOP is a modified version of an existing colony dynamics model, BEEPOP, and can be used as a tool for environmental risk assessments.  Results of sensitivity analysis and simulations of various climatic and toxic scenarios are discussed and compared to observed changes in the size and composition of honey bee colony populations.

We find that productivity growth of a company is related to productivity growth of neighboring companies, in both the short and long term. The marginal effects of the different factors on productivity growth are stronger in the short run rather than in the long run. Land characteristics and economic territorial conditions have the largest marginal effect on productivity growth and its components. This study contributes to the existing literature by including spatial interactions in the analysis of productivity growth.

AB  - The present status of industrial HSE management in a number of EU member states is reviewed, with a focus on the integration of health, safety and environment in single management systems. The review provides insight into the standards and paradigms adopted by industry, and it identifies trends and needs for improvement. It appears that most industries consider goal-based HSE management programs to be a success and believe them to contribute to the profitability of the industry. We conclude that HSE management would benefit greatly from guidance on how to use existing management systems efficiently and also from the further development of meaningful safety performance indicators that identify the conditions prior to accidents and incidents.

AB  - Increasingly, levels of the 'stress hormones' cortisol and corticosterone are being used by ecologists as indicators of physiological stress in wild vertebrates. The amplitude of hormonal response is assumed to correlate with the overall health of an animal and, by extension, the health of the population. However, much of what is known about the physiology of stress has been elucidated by the biomedical research community. I summarize five physiological mechanisms that regulate hormone release during stress that should be useful to ecologists and conservationists. Incorporating these physiological mechanisms into the design and interpretation of ecological studies will make these increasingly popular studies of stress in ecological settings more rigorous.

Comparison with natural glass compositions suggests equilibration at lower water fugacity,f(H2O), than inferred from Al-in-hornblende geobarometry. The disparity between geobarometric techniques may be explained by a decrease in f(H2O) and consequent crystallization several weeks before eruption-a time period too short for hornblende reequilibration. Reduced f(H2O) could have resulted from processes associated with basalt magma injection, including (1) late-stage magma ascent (under H2O-saturated conditions) or (2) influx of other volatilles (CO2, SO2) into the dacite magma system.

AB  - Vegetation data of the Rift Valley have been revisited using fuzzy set theory to give quantitative measures of the links between species and vegetation states. Vegetation is considered as a global indicator of both land use and natural conditions. Human activities in the area have influenced the physiognomy of vegetation so much that an apparently uniform state has developed over most of the Rift Valley floor. Fuzzy set theory has made it possible to interpret the pattern of variation in vegetation on the basis of some reference states corresponding to protected and cultivated sites. The concept of stratocoena is applied to analyse the anthropogenic influences on the tree-shrub and herb layers in order to investigate how they respond to human interference individually.

AB  - The specific growth rate (SGR) of natural populations of bacterioplankton, from three lowland watercourses in the northeastern part of England, was measured at intervals over 15 months using a batch-culture method. SGR of the bacteria from one watercourse showed seasonal periodicity with notably low values (<0.01 h(-1)) in winter which coincided with acid conditions. SGR of bacteria from the other two watercourses, which were permanently circumneutral, showed irregular periodicity and notably low values were never recorded. Thus, SGR is an easily determined indicator which may be used to recognize the inhibition of bacterioplankton, which is brought about by adverse water quality, and which potentially leads to reduction in biopurification capacity.

AB  - In a carbon constrained economy which targets a massive reduction of the CO2 emissions, biogenic carbon is bound to be a scarce resource with high economic value. In such scenario, the carbon efficiency may become the key performance index to represent the revenues of the biomass-to-X conversion plants.
   In this work, the potential carbon efficiency (PCE) indicator is defined to quantify the achievable carbon efficiency (i.e. the amount of carbon contained in the final product with respect to the available input carbon), of a stream or of a process unit. Compared to the conventional carbon efficiency (CE), that is affected only by the separation/addition of carbon-containing species, the PCE allows quantifying the potential variation of the achievable carbon efficiency in process units where no carbon separation occurs, but where a limiting element is added (e.g. hydrogen through steam addition) or oxygen content is increased (e.g. oxygen injection in a reformer).
   The difference between the CE and the PCE along a biomass conversion process is typically due to the excess of oxygen atoms in the syngas, which is removed as CO2 in the syngas conditioning unit. Therefore, the difference between CE and PCE shows the potential gain in carbon efficiency that can be obtained by the addition of H-2 from an electrolysis process.
   In this paper, the PCE and the CE have been calculated along the process units of different biomass-to-X plants. The selected case studies allow comparing different gasification technologies (direct gasification, indirect gasification and sorption enhanced gasification) in plants for the production of methanol and synthetic natural gas, showing how CE and PCE are influenced by process units such as the gasification technology, syngas reforming, syngas conditioning and hydrogen addition.

AB  - Research Highlights: Flammability of wildland fuels is a key factor influencing risk-based decisions related to preparedness, response, and safety in Alaska. However, without effective measures of current and expected flammability, the expected likelihood of active and problematic wildfires in the future is difficult to assess and prepare for. This study evaluates the effectiveness of diverse indices to capture high-risk fires. Indicators of drought and atmospheric drivers are assessed along with the operational Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS). Background and Objectives: In this study, 13 different indicators of atmospheric conditions, fuel moisture, and flammability are compared to determine how effective each is at identifying thresholds and trends for significant wildfire activity. Materials and Methods: Flammability indices are compared with remote sensing characterizations that identify where and when fire activity has occurred. Results: Among these flammability indicators, conventional tools calibrated to wildfire thresholds (Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and Buildup Index (BUI)), as well as measures of atmospheric forcing (Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)), performed best at representing the conditions favoring initiation and size of significant wildfire events. Conventional assessments of seasonal severity and overall landscape flammability using DMC and BUI can be continued with confidence. Fire models that incorporate BUI in overall fire potential and fire behavior assessments are likely to produce effective results throughout boreal landscapes in Alaska. One novel result is the effectiveness of VPD throughout the state, making it a potential alternative to FFMC among the short-lag/1-day indices. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the societal value of research that joins new academic research results with operational needs. Developing the framework to do this more effectively will bring science to action with a shorter lag time, which is critical as we face growing challenges from a changing climate.

AB  - Deviations from optimal environmental conditions, including external conditions of keeping and feeding birds, often lead to so-called technological stresses. The effect of stress affects the cellular composition of the blood. Assessment of baseline blood parameters of chickens before stress-induced exposure in groups I and II showed that they had different gas exchange rates, which reflected on the oxygen supply of the body. Before stress (background) in the blood of two-linear chickens (group I), the number of red blood cells was 3.25 +/- 0.06 1012/L, white blood cells 23.10 +/- 1.02 109/L, hemoglobin 67.61 +/- 2.49 g/l, average erythrocyte hemoglobin content 19.56 +/- 0.52 Pg. In group II, the number of red blood cells in the peripheral blood was 3.80 +/- 0.06 1012/L, white blood cells 27.10 +/- 0.93 109/L, hemoglobin 83.91 +/- 1.86 g/L. The effect of the stress factor in the form of a vibrational effect initiated a decrease in the concentration of red blood cells in the bloodstream of chickens, regardless of a series of studies. The cell level in hybrid birds obtained at the poultry farm decreased by 12.36% (p<0.01) compared to the background, and by 15.38% imported from Germany. In the body of chickens obtained at the poultry farm, 1 hour after exposure to the stress factor erythropoiesis stimulation was observed, compensating for the loss of red blood cells and increasing the hemoglobin concentration to 101.45 +/- 2.83 g/l, as well as the value of SIT. The red blood cells and erythropoiesis organs in the body of chickens obtained at the poultry farm (group II) had a high reactivity, which allowed the body to quickly compensate for the lack of oxygen and metabolic substrates.

AB  - Decades of fertilizer and manure applications have led to a buildup of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils and sediments, commonly referred to as legacy P. Legacy P can provide a long-term source of P to surface waters where it causes eutrophication. Using a suite of numerical models, we investigated the influence of legacy P on water quality in the Yahara Watershed of southern Wisconsin, USA. The suite included Agro-IBIS, a terrestrial ecosystem model; THMB, a hydrologic and nutrient routing model; and the Yahara Water Quality Model which estimates water quality indicators in the Yahara chain of lakes. Using five alternative scenarios of antecedent P storage (legacy P) in soils and channels under historical climate conditions, we simulated outcomes of P yield from the landscape, lake P loading, and three lake water quality indicators. Legacy P had a significant effect on lake loads and water quality. Across the five scenarios for Lake Mendota, the largest and most upstream lake, average P yield (kg ha(-1)) varied by -41 to +22%, P load (kg y(-1)) by -35 to +14%, summer total P (TP) concentration (mg l(-1)) by -25 to +12%, Secchi depth (m) by -7 to +3%, and the probability of hypereutrophy by -67 to +34%, relative to baseline conditions. The minimum storage scenario showed that a 35% reduction in present-day loads to Lake Mendota corresponded with a 25% reduction in summer TP and smaller reductions in the downstream lakes. Water quality was more vulnerable to heavy rainfall events at higher amounts of P storage and less so at lower amounts. Increases in heavy precipitation are expected with climate change; therefore, water quality could be protected by decreasing P reserves.

AB  - Hematologic analysis provides reliable information on the health status of animals. It is an important variable in the assessment of adaptive and productive capacity of breeds under unfavorable environmental conditions. It is an assessment that combined with other genetic and environmental factors and management can become useful for the future sustainability of mainstream agriculture in a hot environment. Adaptive capacity is affected by some factors such as breed, pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, hematological profile is an important indicator of animal health and production. The objective of this study was to perform the comparative hematological analysis of Santa Ines and Morada Nova breeds (native ewes from Brazil) in all different reproductive stages. Twenty Santa Ines and 20 Morada Nova sheep distributed in a completely randomized design in a split-plot arrangement over time were used. To obtain blood counts, blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture every 14 days, always in the morning, before the animals were released into the pasture. The Morada Nova breed had higher hemoglobin and total leukocyte count than Santa Ines breed. Regarding the influence of pregnancy and puerperium on the eritrogram, there was an increment in red blood cell, hemoglobin and packed cell volume of both breeds in middle pregnancy. However, had a reduction in late pregnancy. There were a reestablishment of the blood cell counts during the puerperium period. It was verified an increase on neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio indicated that ewes in the late pregnancy, postpartum and puerperium were under stress conditions compared to others reproductive stages. The total plasma proteins also increased during this period to compensate for the high nutritional requirements of the fetus, and these levels remained high until the end of the puerperal phase, when the lambs were weaned. The pregnancy and puerperium influenced all erythrocyte indices and changed the total leukocyte count.

AB  - The origin of oil reservoirs in four structural belts in the Nanpu sag, Bohai Bay basin, was studied on the basis of the results of Rock-Eval pyrolysis on 140 samples and biomarker analysis on 30 source rock samples and 43 oil samples. The three possible source rock intervals have different biomarker associations and were deposited in different environments. The third member of the Shahejie Formation (Es-3) is characterized by relatively high gammacerane/alpha beta C30 hopane (>0.09), high extended tricyclic terpane ratio (ETR) ([C-28+ C-29]/[C-28+C-29+Ts]) (>0.4)), low C-27 diasterane/sterane (<1.0), and low C-27/C-29 steranes (<1.13), and was deposited in saline-water, anoxic conditions with high contribution from terrestrial organic matter (TOM). In contrast, the first member of the Shahejie Formation (Es-1) and the third member of the Dongying Formation (Ed(3)) were characterized by low gammacerane/alpha beta C-30 hopane (<0.09), low ETR (<0.4), and were deposited in freshwater-dominated, anoxic conditions, but have different C-27 diasterane/sterane (0.73-1.08 and 0.72-2.24, respectively) and C-27/C-29 steranes (0.94-1.47 and 1.12-1.82, respectively). Three oil groups have been identified in the study area of the Nanpu sag. Oils mainly originated from paleo-reservoirs during the period of Neotectonism not from the source rocks directly. Such a petroleum origin and accumulation pattern has important implication for petroleum exploration. The residual paleo-reservoirs may occur in Es-3 of Nanpu 1 and Nanpu 5 structural belts, Es-1 of the Nanpu 4 structural belt, and Es-3 and Es-1 of the Nanpu 2 structural belt in the Nanpu sag, Bohai Bay basin.

AB  - Traditional agricultural landscapes represent mosaics of land use covers that often support high species diversity. Many Eastern European countries contain large areas of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland. However, these landscapes are likely to change under current EU regulations and global market pressure, with potentially negative consequences for biodiversity. The conservation value of Romania's grasslands is widely recognized, but the potential conservation value of other parts of the landscape mosaic has not been assessed to date. For this reason, we sought to assess patterns of plant diversity across the entire landscape mosaic. We sampled vascular plants at 139 sites (comprising 8 plots of 1 m(2)/ha) in forest (n = 23), grassland (n = 57) and within the arable mosaic (n = 59). To examine potential differences in species richness and composition between these land cover types, we used analysis of variance and detrended correspondence analysis. We also modeled total species richness, richness of HNV indicator plants and richness of arable weeds in response to variables representing topography as well as structural and configurational heterogeneity. Species composition differed strongly between grassland, the arable mosaic and forests. Richness was highest in grasslands, but surprisingly, the arable mosaic and grassland contributed similarly to the cumulative number of recorded species. Models of species richness revealed a wide range of responses of plant groups to topographical conditions and to structural and configurational heterogeneity, which often differed between land use types. Plants were affected by conditions measured at both local (1 ha) and landscape (50 ha) scales. Noting the substantial, and hitherto under-recognised, contribution of the agricultural mosaic to regional-scale plant diversity, we recommend consideration of the entire landscape mosaic in future conservation schemes.

AB  - Physiological responses from sensitive (S156) and resistant (R123) genotypes of ozone bioindicator, snap bean, were investigated after exposing the plants to cumulative, phytotoxic ozone amounts. Daily course of gas-exchange parameters showed delayed stomatal response in S156 leaves to environmental changes comparing to the response of R123 leaves. Potential photosynthetic quantum conversion, Stern-Volmer nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), and maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) values changed differently in the two genotypes between the first and last measuring days. We concluded that the higher ozone sensitivity originated at least partly from inferior regenerating and/or antioxidant capacity. Experimental protocol proved to be determinant on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters: F-v/F-m and NPQ declined at midday, and only the sensitive leaves showed a slight increase in NPQ between 12 h and 16 h. We explained these results by moderately high temperatures and shade-adapted state of our experimental plants under substantial ozone stress. On the base of temperature dependence of minimal fluorescence yield (F-0), critical temperature proved to be higher than 32.7A degrees C for Phaseolus vulgaris under these conditions. We found a strong linear correlation between NPQ and nonphotochemical quenching of F-0, indicating that NPQ was determined mostly by energy-dependent quenching (q(E)). The q(E) is the light-harvesting complex located component of NPQ and depends on the amount of zeaxanthin molecules bound in PSII proteins. Thus, difference between daily courses of NPQ in the two genotypes was probably due to different ways of utilization of the zeaxanthin pool under the interactive effect of ozone and moderate heat stress.

AB  - Increased incidences of mixed assemblages of microcystin-producing and nonproducing cyanobacterial strains in freshwater bodies necessitate development of reliable proxies for cyanotoxin risk assessment. Detection of microcystin biosynthetic genes in water blooms of cyanobacteria is generally indicative of the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial strains. Although much effort has been devoted toward elucidating the microcystin biosynthesis mechanisms in many cyanobacteria genera, little is known about the impacts of co-occurring cyanobacteria on cellular growth, mcy gene expression, or mcy gene copy distribution. The present study utilized conventional microscopy, qPCR assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study how competition between microcystin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa CPCC 299 and Planktothrix agardhii NIVA-CYA 126 impacts mcyE gene expression, mcyE gene copies, and microcystin concentration under controlled laboratory conditions. Furthermore, analyses of environmental water samples from the Missisquoi Bay, Quebec, enabled us to determine how the various potential toxigenic cyanobacterial biomass proxies correlated with cellular microcystin concentrations in a freshwater lake. Results from our laboratory study indicated significant downregulation of mcyE gene expression in mixed cultures of M. aeruginosa plus P. agardhii on most sampling days in agreement with depressed growth recorded in the mixed cultures, suggesting that interaction between the two species probably resulted in suppressed growth and mcyE gene expression in the mixed cultures. Furthermore, although mcyE gene copies and McyE transcripts were detected in all laboratory and field samples with measureable microcystin levels, only mcyE gene copies showed significant positive correlations (R-2 > 0.7) with microcystin concentrations, while McyE transcript levels did not. These results suggest that mcyE gene copies are better indicators of potential risks from microcystins than McyE transcript levels or conventional biomass proxies, especially in water bodies comprising mixed assemblages of toxic and nontoxic cyanobacteria.

AB  - In this research, various assessment tools are applied to comprehensively investigate hydrogen production from steam reforming of poultry tallow (PT). These tools investigate the chemical reactions, design and simulate the entire hydrogen production process, study the energetic performance and perform an environment impact assessment using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology.
   The chemical reaction investigation identifies thermodynamically optimal operating conditions at which PT may be converted to hydrogen via the steam reforming process. The synthesis gas composition was determined by simulations to minimize the Gibbs free energy using the Aspen Plus (TM) 10.2 software. These optimal conditions are, subsequently, used in the design and simulation of the entire PT-to-hydrogen process. LCA is applied to evaluate the environmental impacts of PT-to-hydrogen system. The system boundaries include rendering and reforming along with the required transportation process. The reforming inventories data are derived from process simulation in Aspen Plus (TM), whereas the rendering data are adapted from a literature review. The life cycle inventories data of PT-to-hydrogen are computationally implemented into SimaPro 7.3. A set of seven relevant environmental impact categories are evaluated: global warming, abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, and cumulative non-renewable fossil and nuclear energy demand. The results are subject to a systematic sensitivity analysis and compared to those calculated for hydrogen production from conventional steam methane reforming.
   The LCA results indicate that the thermal energy production process is the main contributor to the selected environmental impact categories. Improvement actions to minimize the reforming thermal energy and the transport distance are strongly recommended as they would lead to relevant environmental improvements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A mechanistic combined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK/TD) and growth model for the aquatic macrophytes Lemna spp. has been developed. This model simulates the development of Lemna biomass under laboratory and environmental conditions. Growth of the Lemna population is simulated on basis of photosynthesis and respiration rates which are functions of environmental conditions, i.e., temperature, global radiation, N- and P-concentrations. The toxicodynamic sub-model describes the effects of growth-inhibiting substances by a respective reduction in the photosynthesis rate based on the Lemna spp. internal concentrations. Internal concentrations are calculated using a simple, one-compartment toxicokinetic model that considers the uptake of substances through the plant surface.
   The growth model was parameterised based on literature data while toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic parameters were determined by calibrating the model using substance specific effect data. Both the growth model and the toxicokinetic model were independently tested by comparing model predictions to observed data.
   In an exemplary case study, the model was applied to a risk assessment for the sulfonyl urea herbicide metsulfuron-methyl. This assessment was carried out for two standard scenarios used in European regulatory risk assessments for pesticides. Thereby, it was shown that the effect of transient concentration peaks of metsulfuron-methyl on Lemna populations is much lower than estimated in a low tier assessment considering the maximum surface water concentration and the EC50 obtained from the standard Lemna growth inhibition test. The model also predicts moderate effects for longer lasting exposures resulting from calculated drainage entries into the water body if the majority of the entry occurs during the cold season with no or slow growth of the plants.

AB  - In his seminal paper about using seabirds as indicators of marine food supplies, Cairns (1987, Biol Oceanogr 5:261-271) predicted that (1) parameters of seabird biology and behavior would vary in curvilinear fashion with changes in food supply, (2) the threshold of prey density over which birds responded would be different for each parameter, and (3) different seabird species would respond differently to variation in food availability depending on foraging behavior and ability to adjust time budgets. We tested these predictions using data collected at colonies of common murre Uria aalge and black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla in Cook Inlet, Alaska. (1) Of 22 seabird responses fitted with linear and non-linear functions, 16 responses exhibited significant curvilinear shapes, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) analysis indicated that curvilinear functions provided the best-fitting model for 12 of those. (2) However, there were few differences among parameters in their threshold to prey density, presumably because most responses ultimately depend upon a single threshold for prey acquisition at sea. (3) There were similarities and some differences in how species responded to variability in prey density. Both murres and kittiwakes minimized variability (CV < 15%) in their own body condition and growth of chicks in the face of high annual variability (CV = 69%) in local prey density. Whereas kittiwake breeding success (CV = 63%, r(2) = 0.89) reflected prey variability, murre breeding success did not (CV = 29%, r(2) < 6.00). It appears that murres were able to buffer breeding success by reallocating discretionary 'loafing' time to foraging effort in response (r(2) = 0.64) to declining prey density. Kittiwakes had little or no discretionary time, so fledging success was a more direct function of local prey density. Implications of these results for using 'seabirds as indicators' are discussed.

AB  - The Upper Paleocene Forties Sandstone Member is a prolific hydrocarbon reservoir in the Southern North Sea. It has for decades been regarded as a 'classic' submarine fan depositional system, containing mainly high-density turbidites formed during a period of coeval tectonic uplift of the East Shetland Platform and lowstand deposition in basinal areas to the south and east. This view is partly challenged by the sedimentological, palynostratigraphical, and 3D seismic data presented in this study. A revised model is proposed in which the Forties Sandstone Member in the South Central Graben is interpreted as a deep-marine depositional system, which due to the presence of intra-basinal topographic highs locally was transformed into a more shallow-marine setting. Within the study area, several fault trends and a number of salt diapirs can be shown to have been active during deposition, and marginal- to shallow-marine conditions may have developed in association with these tectonic elements. The sub-basins between the highs became sites of rapid sedimentation of slope to basin plain turbiditic successions. Non-marine to nearshore palynofacies and the presence of root traces and wave-formed structures are the prime indicators of nearshore conditions, with the presence of presumed shallow-water trace fossils and seismic clinoforms possibly indicative of shelf-to-slope transition being secondary arguments.
   The shallow-marine lithosomes mainly formed in shoreline and shoreface environments that formed as rims around diapirs and fault block crests. They are sand-dominated and relatively thin, and have a more sheetlike reservoir geometry than their deeper-water counterparts. Hence, thickness anomalies are no longer a pre-requisite for postulating sand in plays involving the Forties Sandstone Member. Moreover, the presence of local coastlines several tens of kilometers east of where it was located in previous models increases the probability of Upper Paleocene reservoir development in the Norwegian sector of the Southern North Sea.

AB  - We present the results of a study to examine the effects of management actions and natural disturbances in influencing the evolution of habitat patterns on forested lands. TELSA, a spatially explicit vegetation succession model with the ability to apply user-defined management actions and stochastic wildfires calibrated to local conditions, was used to evaluate changes in several indicators of habitat condition. We assessed seral stage and patch size changes over multiple 200-year simulations under a constant rate of harvest within each of these analyses. In the absence of natural disturbances, old growth habitat and large patches of forest of similar age and tree species composition decreased unless special management practices were applied. Old-growth management area reserves and periodic 'aggregated cutblock' harvesting entries helped maintain forest seral stage distribution at the target level, and patch size characteristics similar to the patterns that would have occurred under historic natural disturbances. Adding wildfire to the management scenarios substantially reduced the amount of old-growth habitat in designated old-growth management area reserves, compromising the ability to maintain old-growth at target levels. A 50% increase in the area designated as old-growth management area reserves would be required to offset the loss of old growth due to wildfire. Although the amount of old-growth habitat was diminished by wildfire, the availability of large habitat patches greater than 250 ha increased. We discuss the need to consider the role of management and natural disturbances in landscape planning, and suggest that redundancy is essential to maintain those features vulnerable to stochastic disturbances. Landscape scenario modeling can facilitate the development of risk averse plans, and encourage the development of innovative approaches to achieving timber and non-timber objectives.

AB  - This study evaluated the environmental health conditions of 21 municipalities in the state of Goias with basic public sanitation services operated directly by the Prefectures. The Environmental Health Indicator (ISA) proposed by CONESAN was adapted according to the availability of the existing data. The situations found were: 9.5% of healthy municipalities, 28.6% with average health and 61.9% with low health, and the indicators that most influenced the results were those of sanitary sewage and solid waste. The study showed the importance of researching on the health situation and allowed to verify which services deserve to receive immediate interventions and, therefore, both economic and technical investment in the municipal systems studied.

Data on the examination of dust storm effects in the territory of the southern regions of Volgograd oblast are given. Patterns of a change in the agrophysical indicators of light chestnut soil and peculiarities of the formation of spring barley productivity in the interband space in years with different levels of water availability were established. The studies demonstrated that some agrophysical soil indicators in agroforest landscapes change differentially in the interband space.

AB  - This study allows the presentation of health condition of littoral of El jadida city by the analysis of the four heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn and Cr) for the polychaete Arenicola grubii. Samplings were carried out monthly from September 2003 to August 2004. Three physicochemical parameters of the seawater were also measured: pH, temperature and salinity. The obtained results show that there is a variation in space and time of the bioaccumulation. The site of Jorf Lasfar shows the most important values. Also this variation depends on seasons: the high values are registrated during dry season.

AB  - The choice of an alternative technology for effluent treatment as well as the location for deployment must be preceded by a study of environmental sustainability. A method for assessing the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants, based on environmental, social and economic-financial characteristics was proposed. The method was applied to three wastewater treatment plants using stabilization ponds, located in the municipalities of Cajati, Jacupiranga and Pariquera-Acu, all belonging to the Lower Ribeira de Iguape River basin, in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The lack of values for some parameters considered in the formulation of indicators undermined the achievement of more realistic values. The proposed method proved to be easy to visualize the condition of sustainability of wastewater treatment stations using stabilization ponds.

AB  - Veterinarians make an important contribution to the profitability of dairies by providing nutrition consultation. The ultimate measure of the quality of a dairy ration is how it affects milk production and body condition. The planning of dairy rations is becoming even more important because farmers are coming under increasing pressure to reduce the environmental impact of manure. To serve as nutrition consultants, veterinarians must understand the various methods used for nutritional assays of feedstuffs and how the various nutrients interact in the net protein and carbohydrate system of ruminant digestion. This column discusses this system and the importance of the, rapid and slow availability of the energy and nitrogen in feedstuffs. The column considers ways to assess and maximize the feed value of grass, corn, and alfalfa. It also reviews various indicators of ruminal health.

LA  - English
AB  - The expression of a novel Cd-inducible gene encoding a 25 kDa non-metallothionein cysteine-rich protein (CRP) in the earthworm Enchytraeus buchholzi is investigated with respect to Cd-specificity and Cd-sensitivity. The amount of CRP-mRNA correlates with the environmental as well as with the intra-worm Cd-concentration. Even the subtoxic concentration of 100 mu g Cd/l induces CRP-gene expression. CRP-mRNA is expressed already 2 h after the worms were exposed to Cd. Other heavy metals or stress conditions can induce only little or even no CRP-mRNA. The CRP-gene is switched on long before Cd becomes toxic to worms and can be therefore taken as a warning signal of prospective irreversible Cd-damages at an early, still reversible stage.

AB  - 2-Thiothiazohdine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA) is the accepted urinary indicator of occupational exposure to carbon disulfide. An extractionless automated column-switching procedure for the determination of this compound in urine was developed. The biological fluid is directly injected into the chromatographic system after dilution. A clean-up procedure is performed in an anion-exchange pre-column, with aqueous formic acid as eluent, followed by a transfer to a cyan-amino or amino analytical column in order to carry out analysis of TTCA under isocratic elution conditions, with a mixture of acetonitrile, water and formic acid as eluent, combined with ultraviolet detection. The detection limit of the method in urine is estimated to be 0.1 mg/l.

AB  - A material consisting of 46 trichocercid rotifers from diverse waters in south and central Sweden was analyzed to reveal their relationships to their substrate. Most species were found in a wide variety of periphytic environments, but a few seemed to be specialized on bogs or psammon, respectively. Several trichocercids are generally regarded as plankters, but some of them obviously invade the open water only on certain occasions. A few species of Trichocerca are registered as indicators of eutrophy, but in some cases only a planktic occurrence may be regarded as indicating. On the other hand, hypertrophic environments are generally avoided. Trichocerca similis prefers polyhumic environments, T. uncinata oligotrophic and running-water conditions. The occurrence is often best explained by studying the food choice.

These optogenetic reporters are powerful tools for live-cell microscopy and quantitative analysis at the subcellular level. In this review, we present an overview of the transduction mechanisms that have been exploited for engineering these genetically encoded reporters. Finally, we discuss current and future efforts towards the combined use of various optogenetic actuators and reporters for simultaneously controlling and imaging the physiology of cells and tissues.

AB  - The selection of social and economic metrics to document baseline conditions and analyze the dynamic relationships between ecosystems and human communities are important decisions for scientists, managers, and watershed citizens. A large variety of social and economic data is available but these have limited use without theoretical frameworks. In this paper, several frameworks for reviewing social-ecosystem relations are offered, namely social sanctions, sense of place, civic structure, and cultural differences. Underlying all of these frameworks are attitudes, beliefs, values, and norms that affect which questions are asked and which indicators are chosen. Much work and significant challenges remain in developing a standard set of spatially based socio-economic metrics for watershed management.

AB  - The middle Jurassic Goradongar Formation exposed in Goradongar hill represents a mixed siliciclasticcarbonate succession with shales and limestones. They contain a large number of well preserved trace fossils. Total 44 ichnospecies of 31 ichnogenera; representing diverse ethology, were grouped in five ichnoassemblages (Planolites, Palaeophycus, Gyrochorte, Rhizocorallium and Arenicolites assemblage). These recurring ichnoassemblages represent the Cruziana ichnofacies and occasionally a mixed Skolithos-Cruziana ichnofacies. Patterns of diversity and density of the trace fossils reveal changes in bathymetry, oxygen level, trophic level and the sub-strate conditions at the time of deposition. These paleoenvironment and palaeo-oceanography changes are co-relatable to world-wide Bathonian-Callovian (middle Jurassic) deposits.

AB  - Meteorological events such as severe storms, floods or droughts are often referred to as extreme events. The impact of such events on society is immense and numerous efforts have been devoted to study them. Many proxy indicators in paleoclimate variability reconstructions are sensitive to such extremes, and a careful quantification of their link to environmental parameters is indispensable. In this paper we determine the relationship between typical states of the atmospheric circulation over and around the North Atlantic, on the one hand, and extreme events, on the other. We apply a novel statistical approach to associate extremes and weather regimes. This study enables us to infer the atmospheric conditions that prevailed in the North Atlantic region during key periods of the recent past.

AB  - The possibilities and limits of the applicability of ecological values are discussed. It is differentiated between "polulation indicator values", which are reflecting the ecological site conditions and "utilisation indicator values". For the forming of the mean value the later should be weighted with the respective covering degree respectively quote of earnings. Shall the development of indicator values be pursued for a serie of years, this is only possible, if the utilisation regime in the meantime has not essentially changed. Otherwise the indicator values have to be transformed by means of the "Mahdvertraglichkeitszahl" ("cutting compability value") into a corrected mean indicator value. As regards the nutrient value (nitrogen value), this is qualified more for characterizing of the general nutrient availability than the measured values from the standardly accomplished soil sampling.

AB  - The sea cliffs at Joggins, Nova Scotia, are the most extensive and continuous Carboniferous section in eastern North America. Although the section has been considered to have formed within a nonmarine depositional basin, paleobiological information indicates that parts of the section were deposited in brackish water. The occurrence of a trace-fossil assemblage, which includes Cochlichnus, Kouphichnium, and Treptichnus, is part of an assemblage of biogenic structures that apparently reflects paleodeposition within fluvial systems that may have experienced distal marine influences. Presence of agglutinated foraminifera characteristic of brackish-water environments supports this interpretation. This information provides new evidence of brackish-water conditions at Joggins such as those now being widely recognized in other Carboniferous coal-bearing sections.

Hair samples (837 males, 965 females) were taken from individuals of non-industrial native populations of unpolluted areas. Geographical, geochemical, racial and nutritional aspects of inter-group variations of trace element concentrations are discussed. The significance of hair analysis as a biological indicator of abnormal intake of trace elements in man is confirmed. Geographical variations of hair trace element concentrations, on the whole, depend on geochemical conditions or nutritional factors. The concentration of elements in hair is highly variable because of local factors, which makes racial or ethnic identification impossible for trace element analysis.

Both vacuolar and cytoplasmic pH were determined by several independent techniques. These techniques were NMR spectrometry, distribution of radioactive probes and spectrophotometric measurement of the absorbance changes of a naturally occurring vacuolar pH indicator. There was no difference in the cytoplasmic pH between cells grown in the presence or the absence of NaCl, but the vacuolar pH of cells grown in the presence of NaCl was higher by 0.38 to 1.05 pH units (depending on the technique that was used) than the vacuolar pH of cells grown in the absence of NaCl.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated analysis of the Atibaia river basin. An environmental diagnosis was performed in the study area. It was applied the methodology developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, in 2003, coupled to that done by Tricart and adapted by Ross (1994). We selected 33 environmental indicators which allowed physical and spatial representations of the basin and supported the development of scenarios. Three of them were developed for the Atibaia river basin, called trend, management, and conservation. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of the basin, which generated results that allowed to manage water resources and environmental conservation. The main conclusion is that, in the conservationscenario, best conditions to restore the environmental quality of the basin were observed.

AB  - Market conditions may lead firms to increase offensive marketing activities aimed at attracting new customers, and/or to enhance defensive relationship building intended to retain current customers. Characteristics of the marketing environment are examined, including firms' interest in technology adoption and perceived need to apply it to provide structure for the supply chain, product development, quality control, and social impact. Such indicators relate to the firm's perception of "competitive intensity" in the marketplace. Survey results from 196 manufacturing companies show that technology adoption propensity and competitive intensity are associated with greater investments in offensive marketing activities as well as customer and employee engagement.

AB  - Phospholipid oxidation products resemble danger signals, which accumulate under conditions of increased oxidative stress and cell death. They serve as indicators of inflammation-induced tissue damage and have been demonstrated to act as endogenous regulators of the innate immune response. Recent in vitro and in vivo evidence highlights the impact oxidized phospholipids exert on the maturation process of dendritic cells, where these molecules mediate both stimulatory and inhibitory effects, thereby influencing decisive steps of the adaptive immune response.

AB  - This research was motivated by the need to identify characteristics of environmental indicators that are meaningful to the public so that these indicators will convey conditions of environmental quality. Four focus groups were conducted to gather qualitative data about expert, stakeholder, and public knowledge and understanding of environmental indicators. The Lake Erie Quality Index (LEQI) was used as a model of environmental indicators and focus group participants offered reactions and interpretations of the LEQI. Results identify the level of the public's understanding of indicators, suggest characteristics that make indicators useful, and identify differences between how experts, stakeholders and the public interpret environmental indicators. All three groups agree on the importance of developing measurable environmental indicators that can present sound scientific information to the public.

AB  - This paper presents results of experimental investigations on a field of 8 photovoltaic panels assembled 2 in series and 4 such parallel combinations. The diurnal and environmental effects have been characterized systematically. The usage conditions are clean and dusty states of panels, the centers of each series combinations shorted and unshorted. It is observed that the curvature at the maximum power point of the I-V curve could be an indicator of the panel characteristics. The temperature effects on the voltage at the maximum power point are also discussed. It is brought out that field evaluation is essential and often maximum power point tracking can be dispensed if a known load exists and a judicious choice of battery bank capacity is made.

AB  - Within police studies, 'police culture' is often depicted according to a series of values (e.g. conservatism, solidarity, suspicion, etc.). This article argues in favour of an alternative conceptualization of police 'culture', which draws on concepts from the sociology of culture. Police culture is viewed as a resource, which actors deploy within particular institutional constraints. Drawing on 100 interviews and participant observation in a police department, the analysis examines how officers negotiate meaning in an unsettled occupational environment prompted by heightened levels of police oversight. Two culture indicators are examined: solidarity and mission. This article represents an explicit attempt to theorize police culture sociologically and invoke an adaptive framework for uncovering how actors use culture within a definable set of structuring conditions.

AB  - The distribution of benthic foraminifera and their relation to the main environmental factors in Hornsund fjord in August of 2001 and 2002 were studied. Three benthic foraminiferal assemblages were identified. The assemblage Cassidulina reniforme-Elphidium excavatum f. clavata occupies the inner parts of the fjord and is related to the cooled winter local waters. The assemblage Nonionellina labradorica-Elphidium excavatum f. clavata inhabits the outer part of the fjord affected by the transformed Atlantic water mass. The assemblage Lobatula lobatula is an indicator of the high-energy environmental conditions. Certain changes in the foraminifer distribution in the fjord in comparison to 1990-1991 were revealed. In particular, a considerable propagation of the species Nonionellina labradorica inside the inner part of the fjord is noted.

AB  - In this study, the geochemical properties, sedimentation conditions and hydrocarbon potential of the bituminous marls, having quite rich organic carbon content (average 9.27% TOC), composed of gray-green colored, dominant marl lithology with marl-claystone intercalation in the Bozcahuyuk (Seyitomer/Kutahya) Basin has been evaluated. In this context, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, Gas Chromatography (GC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Modified Fischer Assay (MFA) analyses of the samples taken from the study area were performed and their organic facies have been evaluated. The marls have an excellent source rock characteristics, and include kerogen predominantly as Type I and rarely as Type II. The precipitation of organic matter took place under reducing anoxic redox conditions where oxygen was limited. Analysed samples contain terrestrial phytoclasts and palynomorphs as well as freshwater algae indicating Type-I kerogen such as Botryococcus braunii. Organic geochemical data show that the study area is deposited in the "AB" organic facies continental-marine transition zone. Carbon preference index (CPI), C-27, C-28 and C-29 steran abundance distribution of the samples as well as presence of Gamesaran as a salty environment indicator indicates that the lake enironment has been under marine environment influence from time to time and thereforethe study area have lagoon character. The average of the T-max values of analysed samples is 432 degrees C and it was determined that the bituminous marls in the region could not produce conventional petroleum due to their immaturity. However, it has been evaluated that these marls have the potential to produce synthetic petroleum as the kerogen types are dominantly Type-I, TOC and HI contents are high, as well as the analyzed samples have an average of 12.60% (133 L / ton) MFA oil content.

AB  - Dinoflagellates are referred among potential bioinvaders and environmental proxies. Information from tropical regions on the coupling of cyst and motile stages of dinoflagellates characterized by high suspended-load, and high diversity but low abundance is limited. Here, the population dynamics of dinoflagellates (planktonic-motile-stages and benthic-cysts) from monsoon-influenced Cochin-harbour, southwest coast of India was investigated. A targeted sampling strategy is proposed over conventional methods to obtain better estimates of abundance and diversity. From the water column, the cyst-producing-dinoflagellates contribution was quantified for the first time, and it was up to 52% of total planktonic-motile-stages. Interestingly, the number of motile stages versus the number of cysts for heterotrophs revealed an inverse trend and the explanation is not straightforward. This is because Cochin-harbour experiences discharges, i.e., freshwater (peak during monsoon), anthropogenic, and dredging activities throughout the year facilitating benthic-suspension, high sedimentation rate, and distinct seasonality in the availability of prey. In such an environment, motile-stages-diversity and cysts-species-richness formed potential environmental proxies. The presence of cysts of indicator taxa (Protoperidiniwn, Polykrikos, Lingulodinium) for nutrient-enrichment in relatively good proportions and low ranges of motile-stages diversity and cysts species-richness do signal eutrophic system. Autotrophic-cysts dominance illustrates that the heterotrophs need not be dominant in the eutrophic-system as reported in earlier studies. The dominance of euryhaline dinoflagellates (Gonyauhne spinifera, Protoperidiniwn pentagonum, P. leonis, Pyrophacus steinii) cysts provided additional information on cyst-producing-dinoflagellates as potential environmental indicators. The existence of 24 morphotypes belonging to potentially harmful-algal-bloom (HAB) species emphasizes HAB risks under favorable conditions.

AB  - Freshwaters are among the most globally threatened habitats and their biodiversity is declining at an unparalleled rate. In an attempt to slow this decline, multiple approaches have been used to conserve, restore or enhance waterbodies. However, evaluating their effectiveness is time-consuming and expensive. Identifying species or assemblages across a range of ecological conditions that can provide a surrogate for wider freshwater biodiversity is therefore of significant value for conservation management and planning. For lakes and ponds in three contrasting landscapes of Britain (lowland agricultural, eastern England; upland, north-west England; urban, central Scotland) we examined the link between macrophyte species, macrophyte morpho-group diversity (an indicator of structural diversity) and the richness of three widespread aquatic macroinvertebrate groups (molluscs, beetles, and odonates) using structural equation modelling. We hypothesised that increased macrophyte richness and, hence, increased vegetation structural complexity, would increase macroinvertebrate richness after accounting for local and landscape conditions. We found that macrophyte richness, via macrophyte morpho-group diversity, was an effective surrogate for mollusc, beetle, and odonate richness in ponds after accounting for variation caused by physical variables, water chemistry, and surrounding land use. However, only mollusc richness could be predicted by macrophyte morpho-group diversity in lakes, with no significant predicted effect on beetles or odonates. Our results indicate that macrophyte morpho-group diversity can be viewed as a suitable surrogate of macroinvertebrate biodiversity across diverse landscapes, particularly in ponds and to a lesser extent in lakes. This has important implications for the restoration, conservation, and creation of standing water habitats and for assessing their effectiveness in addressing the decline of global freshwater biodiversity. Management actions prioritising the development of species-rich and structurally diverse macrophyte assemblages will be likely to benefit wider freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - The development of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques is continuing in order to increase the generated energy from photovoltaic (PV) generators. A variety of MPPT techniques have been proposed and classified based on three main categories: offline, online and hybrid techniques. This paper presents a review of the most popular techniques for offline and online tracking of the Maximum Power Point (MPP), which are the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Hill Climbing (HC) techniques, respectively. This is in addition to a review for all hybrid techniques reported in the literature demonstrating their main merits and shortcomings. Moreover, the present paper combines the ANFIS and HC as a hybrid technique for the first time. The proposed technique involves the features of the ANFIS and HC techniques and mitigates their shortcomings in order to increase the generated PV electrical energy. The proposed technique is a combination of two stages to assess the duty ratio (control signal) being applied to a boost converter for MPP tracking. The first stage includes a set point calculation loop to estimate the duty ratio. The second stage involves a fine tuning loop to determine the exact duty ratio corresponding to the MPP. This achieves maximum power transfer to the load even under nonuniform climatic conditions using a relatively simple control system. The proposed technique has been simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and compared with some other MPPT techniques (the Constant Voltage (CV), ANFIS, HC, Incremental Conductance (IncCond) techniques) for steady state and rapidly changing climatic conditions (Ropp and sine radiation tests) as well as load variations. The results reveal that the proposed hybrid MPPT technique outperforms other MPPT techniques in term of performances indicators, which include the tracking speed, tracking accuracy and energy gain factor.

AB  - We evaluated the long-term pattern of leaf area index (LAI) dynamics and radiation use efficiency (RUE) in short rotation poplar in uncoppice (single stem) and coppice (multi-stem) plantations, and compared them to annual field crops (AFCs) as an alternative for bioenergy production while being more sensitive to weather fluctuation and climate change. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of LAI and RUE as indicators for bioenergy production and indicators of response to changing environmental conditions. For this study, we selected poplar clone J-105 (Populus nigra L. x P. maximowiczii A. Henry) and AFCs such as barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), and compared their aboveground dry mass (AGDM) production in relation to their LAI development and RUE. The results of the study showed the long-term maximum LAI (LAI(max)) to be 9.5 in coppice poplar when compared to AFCs, where LAI(max) did not exceed the value 6. The RUE varied between 1.02 and 1.48 g MJ(-1) in short rotation poplar and between 0.72 and 2.06 g MJ(-1) in AFCs. We found both LAI and RUE contributed to AGDM production in short rotation poplar and RUE only contributed in AFCs. The study confirms that RUE may be considered an AGDM predictor of short rotation poplar and AFCs. This may be utilized for empirical estimates of yields and also contribute to improve the models of short rotation poplar and AFCs for the precise prediction of biomass accumulation in different environmental conditions.

AB  - Forty-two ditch cutting samples of the KR-1 offshore well from depths of 9660 ft to 10,920 ft composited at 90-ft intervals were subjected to sedimentological, micropaleontological, and geochemical analyses using standard procedures and the laser ablationinduced coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique, respectively. Sedimentological analysis revealed the presence of glauconites and the rare occurrence of framboidal pyrites, indicative of deposition in a slightly anoxic marine environment. Palynomorph percentage distribution shows that there are more terrestrially derived miospores (dominated by Zonocostites ramonae (Rhizophora spp.), Psilatricolporites crassus (Tabernaemontana crassa), Acrotichum aureum, and Laevigatosporites sp.) than marine phytoplanktons. Rare occurrence of Globoquadrina venezuelana, Globigerinoides promordius, and Globigerina sp. denotes an Early Miocene age and proximal shelf. These indicate that the main environment of deposition in the KR-1 well is coastal to marginal marine consisting of coastal deltaicinner neritic, made up of tidal channel and shoreface deposits. Geochemical results show that the average concentrations of considered rare earth elements are less than their concentrations in world average shale. Trace metal ratios (such as Th/Cr, Cr/Th, Th/Co, and Cr/ Ni) suggest that the investigated sediments were derived from felsic source rocks. Rare earth element patterns (such as La/Yb, Gd/Yb, La/Sm, and Eu/Eu) and Th data established the felsic composition of the source rocks. Ratios of U/Th, Ni/Co, Cu/Zn, and V/Sc suggest a well-oxygenated bottom water condition. Estimated europium and cerium anomalies of the studied samples suggest an oxidizing environment of deposition. Nonetheless, the ratios of V/Cr suggest a range of environmental conditions. Moreover, ratios of V/(V+ Ni) suggest the rare occurrence of suboxic to anoxic environments of deposition.

AB  - This study from the Sremski Karlovci clay pit in northern Serbia sheds new light on the physicochemical conditions, ecology and evolution of the Paludina Lake - the Pliocene successor of the late Miocene giant Lake Pannon hosted by the Pannonian Basin. The multidisciplinary study combines sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, palaeontology, palaeobotany, coal petrology, organic geochemistry and magnetic mineralogy. The sedimentary succession studied represents the lake margin at the foot of the Fruska Gora ridge. Sedimentary facies reveal minor and major lake-level changes, including a forced regression with fluvial valley incision in the succession middle part and the ultimate emergence and covering of the lake floor by Pleistocene loess. Mollusc and ostracod fauna indicates an oligohaline shallow cool-water environment, no deeper than 5-6 m, with an active inflow of spring water. The lake local depth during transgression maxima did not exceed 20 m. Palynological and geochemical analyses indicate a rich and diversified assemblage of gymnosperm plants with a contribution of angiosperms, weeds and microbial biomass in the peat-forming suboxic to oxic coastal swamp environment. Maceral analysis of organic matter shows a prevalence of huminite, accompanied richly by inertinite in lignite and by liptinite in clay. The Pleistocene shift to terrestrial semiarid environment resulted in oxidizing groundwater conditions, with the reddening of sediments around a fluctuating groundwater table and the diagenetic transformation of bacteria-derived greigite into magnetite. In regional stratigraphy, the occurrence of Viviparus neumayri Brusina in the lower half of the succession indicates the Lower Paludina Beds of Dacian Stage (early Zanclean age). Other gastropods and certain ostracodes indicate transition to the Middle Paludina Beds of lower Romanian Stage (late Zanclean-early Piacenzian). The upper half of the succession lacks age-diagnostic fossils and is considered to represent Middle Paludina Beds with a possible relic of Upper Paludina Beds at the top.

AB  - The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidentiary base supporting the hypothesis that the increased hazard for obesity in mood disorder populations (and vice versa) is a consequence of shared pathophysiological pathways. We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles with the following search terms: obesity, inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, insulin, cognition, CNS, and neurotransmitters, cross-referenced with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The frequent co-occurrence of mood disorders and obesity may be characterized by interconnected pathophysiology. Both conditions are marked by structural and functional abnormalities in multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions that subserve cognitive and/or affective processing. Abnormalities in several interacting biological networks (e.g. immuno-inflammatory, insulin signaling, and counterregulatory hormones) contribute to the co-occurence of mood disorders and obesity. Unequivocal evidence now indicates that obesity and mood disorders are chronic low-grade pro-inflammatory states that result in a gradual accumulation of allostatic load. Abnormalities in key effector proteins of the pro-inflammatory cascade include, but are not limited to, cytokines/adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Taken together, the bidirectional relationship between obesity and mood disorders may represent an exophenotypic manifestation of aberrant neural and inflammatory networks. The clinical implications of these observations are that, practitioners should screen individuals with obesity for the presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms (and vice versa). This clinical recommendation is amplified in individuals presenting with biochemical indicators of insulin resistance and other concurrent conditions associated with abnormal inflammatory signaling (e.g. cardiovascular disease).

AB  - In estuarine systems, informed water resource management decisions rely, in part, on evaluating how changes in freshwater inflow and salinity affect a selected management target (i.e., habitat or organismal changes). This study examined the distribution or Spartina alterniflora and S. cynosuriodes species along the Altamaha River estuary in Georgia in association with an extensive drought, during which time freshwater inflow decreased considerably and salty water encroached into previously brackish areas. Bankside vegetation was surveyed along the length of the estuary at the beginning and end of the drought (2000, 2002), and again in 2004 after flows had increased. In addition, a removal experiment, in which one or the other plant was removed from naturally mixed communities, was conducted the drought (2001-2002). In all surveys, S. cynosuroides densities decreased at a location that corresponded to where average high tide salinities were > 14 psu, such that the downstream border shifted from approximately 3 to 6 kill from the mouth of the river between 2000 and 2002 and then back to 3 kill ill 2004. Although the peak density of S. alterniflora also shifted upstream between 2000 and 2002, upstream densities were high in 2004 and plant distribution did not correspond with salinity. Ill the removal experiment. densities and relative % cover of S. alterniflora increased in all treatments (including controls), whereas densities of'S. cynosuroides remained relatively constant except ill treatments where it was purposely removed. We interpret these results to suggest that S. alterniflora is a strong invader that can expand into new habitat under stressful (increased salinity, low flow) conditions. and that once it is established it call co-exist with S. cynosuroides. The more rapid response of S. cynosuroides (shifts occured within 2 years) suggests that its downstream limit is a potential indicator of changes in inflow conditions in this system.

AB  - In spite of their potential use as indicators of both present and past environmental conditions, little is known about the diatom communities in the many small water bodies at high altitudes in New Zealand. We sampled benthic diatoms at 20 sites in a typical subalpine mire pool/tarn complex near Arthur's Pass in South Island, New Zealand in the austral spring 2001. The aims were to characterise the diatom communities, including identification of a possible endemic component, and to investigate relationships with environmental variables. The community at genus level was consistent with the peat-bog diatom flora reported from elsewhere except for the common occurrence of the Tasmania/New Zealand endemic genus Eunophora. At the species level, 27 of the 52 most common taxa appear to correspond to known species from the Northern Hemisphere and are therefore presumed to be cosmopolitan in their distribution. Just two taxa are known from the Southern Hemisphere only, however identification of the remaining common species proved problematic. Analysis using the BIO-ENV procedure of the PRIMER computer program confirmed an expected strong association between diatom community composition and pH, with water conductivity and gilvin also important. Weighted averaging regression and cross-validation using C-2 software enabled selection of four diatom species as potentially sensitive indicators of certain pH levels. Neither species of Eunophora showed a strong preference for pH or for any of the other environmental variables measured, indicating that other factors are determining their distributions. The strength of the species-environment relationships found in this small survey suggests good potential for monitoring current conditions and for palaeoecological applications. Extension of the dataset with information from other alpine/subalpine areas is desirable, as is the compilation of a regional diatom identification guide for these habitats.

AB  - Axi-symmetric compression experiments on short cylinders (radius> length) have great potential for the investigation of different nonplane strain geometries. In such experiments strain geometry and intensity are heterogeneously distributed throughout the specimens due to the effects of friction at the contact surface between the pistons and the specimen. We ran a series of tests on Solnhofen limestone at constant confining pressure (200 MPa), temperature (600 degrees C) and displacement rate (5.2 X 10(-6) m S-1), conditions at which this material deforms predominantly by crystal plasticity. Using shape and crystallographic preferred orientation (SPO and CPO) patterns of calcite grains, the latter measured by electron back-scattered diffraction techniques (EBSD), we can discriminate areas in the deformed specimens with distinct non-plane strain geometries. SPO and CPO patterns record differences in the orientation of the finite stretching direction with respect to the external reference frame. It is radial in the vicinities of the rigid loading pistons, but circumferential outside the periphery of the pistons. As shortening progressed, the middle part of the specimen was extruded with respect to the contacts with the rigid end pieces, imparting a non-coaxial component to the flow with a circumferential vorticity axis in both upper and lower halves of the specimen. This component was recorded in the microstructure as an asymmetric CPO. The aim of the experiments is to improve the interpretation of naturally deformed rock bodies when strain departs from plane strain conditions by using the CPO as a 3D kinematic indicator, providing not only shearing direction but also information about the shape in 3D of the strain ellipsoid.

AB  - Monitoring of rangelands has evolved from traditional focus on plant communities and their successional status, taken from a few selected subsamples, to much broader perspectives. Rangelands, being complex biosocial systems, offer a near infinite array of possibilities for choice of variables and how to collect and interpret the data. Past monitoring approaches have inadequately considered objectives, critical definitions, and appropriate sequencing of steps taken. While management objectives should ideally have primacy in choice of variables used in inventory and monitoring, there are some countervailing advantages in employing some commonalities in monitoring protocols among tracts of rangelands. Inventories should come before monitoring. Assessment should follow collection of an adequately long time series of data which is the essence of monitoring. Trends involve judging whether the monitoring data show increases, decreases, or stable trajectories. Assessment involves an always at least partially subjective judgement of condition in relation to appropriate standards and objectives. We are no longer limited to just plant community data collected annually in a few conveniently and subjectively chosen quadrats. Geomatics (remote sensing, GIS, and GPS) opens the possibility of frequent, synoptic (everywhere, instantaneously) landscape coverage via satellite imagery. Indisputable evidence of cause(s) requires concurrent data on these influences along with similar trends from similar circumstances (replications) and controls [reference areas lacking the putative cause(s)]. Three alternatives that could replace plant succession as the underlying, dominant theory of rangeland monitoring are: risk assessment, sustainability, and desertification. Risk assessment is well proven where biophysical indicators can be employed. Politically neutral incorporation of socioeconomic considerations have yet to be demonstrated, however. Sustainability is such a broad and diffuse concept that anyone can read into it whatever he or she wishes. Desertification is the preferred macroconcept to guide us into the future, because its use can more objectively encompass both biophysical and socioeconomic features, at any scale in time and space.

TI  - Standardized system for quantifying residual dirt on medical appliances cleansed in hospital washers-disinfectors Dirt detection by different methods
T2  - FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA
LA  - English
AB  - An easy-to construct, easy-to-operate standardized system was developed for determining the residual biological contamination of surgical instruments, endoscopes and other medical appliances subjected to hospital cleansing and/or disinfection. It consists of standard-sized pieces of glass, metal or endoscope plastic - dirt carriers - either bare or enclosed in truncated Eppendort caps to simulate hard-to-access conditions. The surface of the carriers is covered with model dirt simulating biological contamination and the carriers are then affixed to sturdy metal holders. Conventional model dirts were found to peel or flake off the carrier surface, lowering the precision of residual soil determination. A newly developed model dirt consisting of liver mash, lactose and sunflower oil and exhibiting low tendency to peel off surfaces was therefore used. The whole setup was subjected to chemical or enzymic cleansing programs at elevated temperature in hospital washer-disinfectors of two types, and the residual dirt after cleansing was determined by three methods. The method using toxicant-doped dirt that quenches the luminescence of an indicator bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum gave satisfactory data under laboratory conditions but with hospital-washed samples it exhibited excessive fluctuations caused by bacterium-dirt interactions and by physical influences. Both other methods gave better results but displayed some process sensitivity. The luciferin-luciferase-based ATP bioluminescence assay sometimes gave low or even negative dirt level values and showed a low effect of reduced dirt accessibility on cleansing of metal carriers. The Bradford protein assay showed about equal cleansing efficiency for both easily and poorly accessible carriers after enzymic cleansing. Our system can be used for determining low levels of residual contamination of medical appliances after cleansing/disinfection and assessing the efficiency of commercial washer-disinfectors; its efficiency can be further increased by using a cleansing process-insensitive method for soil detection and quantification.

AB  - The Damage Rating Index (DRI), a microscopic and semi-quantitative petrographic tool, is a method that has increasingly been used in North America and Europe because it can answer questions regarding the nature and the degree of damage in concrete affected by deleterious mechanisms such as alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR). This paper presents the results of the condition assessment, using the DRI, of concrete mixtures of different strengths and incorporating different reactive aggregate types (fine versus coarse aggregate) with the aim of verifying both how alkali-silica reaction (ASR) develops against its expansion levels and how the DRI could be used to better quantify damage in concrete due to ASR.

AB  - Human security, particularly in the Arctic, is being stressed by climate change and other factors. Science and technology provide one instrument for the development of strategies that will protect those living in the Arctic from threats to environmental, social and economic conditions, namely human security, incurred by climate change. This paper explores a public good approach to Canada's Science and Technology (S&T) strategy. Investigated in particular is the role of science and technology in addressing Arctic human security needs, using evolving Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) quality-of-life indicators to measure the ability of Canada's S&T strategy to meet these needs.

AB  - Rhythms in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous carbonate sequences expressed by lithological-, micropaleontological data in several Central Carpathian sections were interpreted as a record of orbitally induced climate fluctuations. The rhythmic changes of the bed thickness are associated with regular fluctuations in abundance of microplankton content. These lithological rhythms can be correlated with the excentricity Milankovich cycles (periodicities of 120 and 480 Ka); the calcareous microplankton assemblages alternate with radiolarian associations in successive rhythms of 200-300 Ka. The first Gate Valanginian) episode of Early Cretaceous greenhouse conditions is recorded by a low frequence fluctuations of delta(13)C values in the Western Carpathian sections.

AB  - Numerous studies have reported that treelines are moving to higher elevations and higher latitudes. Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration. Here we bring together this knowledge through a review of 142 treeline related publications, including 477 study locations. We summarize the information known about factors limiting tree-growth at and near treelines. Treeline migration is not only dependent on favorable growing conditions but also requires seedling establishment and survival above the current treeline. These conditions appear to have become favorable at many locations, particularly so in recent years. The review revealed that at 66% of these treeline sites forest cover had increased in elevational or latitudinal extent. The physical form of treelines influences how likely they are to migrate and can be used as an indicator when predicting future treeline movements. Our analysis also revealed that while a greater percentage of elevational treelines are moving, the latitudinal treelines are capable of moving at greater horizontal speed. This can potentially have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. To conclude the review, we present the three main hypotheses as to whether ecosystem carbon budgets will be reduced, increased or remain the same due to treeline migration. While the answer still remains under debate, we believe that all three hypotheses are likely to apply depending on the encroached ecosystem. Concerningly, evidence is emerging on how treeline migration may turn tundra landscapes from net sinks to net sources of carbon dioxide in the future.

AB  - Providing clean and safe drinking water by point of use (POU) disinfection methods has become a critical issue, especially in crises and epidemics. In this study, antimony-and nickel-doped tin oxide electrode (Ni-Sb-SnO2) was employed as an electrode for electro-catalytic disinfection of surface water. The synthetized electrodes were characterized using scanning electron microscope, linear sweep voltammetry and X-Ray diffraction techniques. The results revealed that the highest electrochemical disinfection efficiency was achieved by the Ni-Sb-SnO2 electrode under weak acidic conditions and its performance decreased with increasing pH towards alkaline environment. Based on the results, total coliform (TC) and fecal coliform (FC) were completely removed at current density of 0.67 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrochemical disinfection of microorganisms showed that the process efficiency was directly proportional to increasing time and at 0.6 C cm(-2) of charge passed, 3-log removal of the both indicators occurred after 15 min. The highest removal efficiency of TC and FC was also achieved at 8 mmol of NaCl concentration at <10 min of detention time. The results of this study depicted that the Ti/Ni-Sb-SnO2 electrode provides higher disinfection efficiency for the removal of TC and FC compared with Ti and SS/PbO2 electrodes. Moreover, the proposed system was able to completely eliminate heterotrophic, Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aerogenes indicators under optimal conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed electrochemical system can be efficiency applied as a POU disinfection system for disinfection of water contaminated with microbial indicators, especially for crises and epidemics.

AB  - Forestry faces frequent and severe natural calamities causing high amounts of salvage wood. Especially under mountainous conditions, regional available self-loading truck capacity is often the main limiting factor causing transport capacity bottlenecks. Therefore, innovative logistics strategies are needed to ensure quick transport of high amounts of salvage wood. Consequently, a multi-echelon unimodal transport concept, where timber is synchronously transshipped at a truck terminal with four transshipment lots from self-loading trucks to semitrailers, was modeled by means of a discrete event simulation. The simulation model calculates key performance indicators such as transshipped volumes and costs and support estimations of optimal truck fleet configuration. The results provide cost-optimal truck fleet configurations in terms of the number of self-loading trucks, semitrailers and prime mover trucks for varying transshipment volumes, delivery time to terminal and legal truck payload scenarios. Applying the truck terminal concept considerably decreases the number of self-loading trucks needed to transport the same volume when compared to unimodal wood transport, which is most common under mountainous conditions in Europe. In the majority of delivery time to terminal and terminal transshipment volume scenarios, the number of self-loading trucks was reduced by more than 50%. Increasing the legal gross vehicle weight for timber transport from 44 t up to 50 t reduces the number of self-loading trucks needed by 20% to 38%, depending on the scenario setting. Additionally, less self-loading trucks arriving at the terminal also cuts queuing times and system efficiency increases as transport cost/t is reduced by 6% to 11% depending on the scenario setting. Expanding the truck terminal concept by adding storage capacity as well as varying the number of transshipping lots and also including costs for terminal construction and operations in the economic analyses are promising topics for future studies.

AB  - Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) is a valuable medicinal and aromatic plant. The introduction of such an eco-friendly element as presowing seeds inoculation with phosphate mobilizing microbial biopreparation into the growing technology is especially important in the cultivation of this crop. It is connected with an extensive use of fennel in the production of medicines, including the remedies for children. Under the moisture deficiency conditions of the southern Steppe of Ukraine, the study on the effectiveness of phosphate mobilizing biopreparations depending on the impact of sowing dates is particularly relevant. Our field experiments were carried out in 2017-2019 in the Kherson region on the dark chestnut soils typical for the southern Steppe of Ukraine. Presowing seeds inoculation with biopreparations of phosphate mobilizing bacteria Albobakteryn and Polimiksobakteryn positively affected the indicators of fennel productivity and yield quality. Among the microbial preparations studied, a preference for Polimiksobakteryn was recorded. The research findings indicate a tendency to lower the quantitative and qualitative indicators of fennel seed yield from early to late sowing. The most favourable conditions for the productive processes of fennel plants and accumulation of essential oil were ensured by the interaction of seeds bacterization with the Polimiksobakteryn biopreparation and early spring sowing at the right soil tilth stage in the third ten-day period of March. In this variant, the yielding capacity was 1.41 t/ha, the weight of 1000 seeds reached 5.61 g, the essential oil content in the seeds amounted to 6.13% in dry matter, the relative yield of essential oil being 76.1 kg/ha. The introduction of microbial preparations of phosphate mobilizing bacteria into the technology of fennel cultivation is a promising environmentally friendly approach to improving the crop productivity.

AB  - Climate change threatens the provisioning of forest ecosystem services and biodiversity (ESB). The climate sensitivity of ESB may vary with forest development from young to old-growth conditions as structure and composition shift over time and space. This study addresses knowledge gaps hindering implementation of adaptive forest management strategies to sustain ESB. We focused on a number of ESB indicators to (a) analyze associations among carbon storage, timber growth rate, and species richness along a forest development gradient; (b) test the sensitivity of these associations to climatic changes; and (c) identify hotspots of climate sensitivity across the boreal-temperate forests of eastern North America. From pre-existing databases and literature, we compiled a unique dataset of 18,507 forest plots. We used a full Bayesian framework to quantify responses of nine ESB indicators. The Bayesian models were used to assess the sensitivity of these indicators and their associations to projected increases in temperature and precipitation. We found the strongest association among the investigated ESB indicators in old forests (>170 years). These forests simultaneously support high levels of carbon storage, timber growth, and species richness. Older forests also exhibit low climate sensitivity of associations among ESB indicators as compared to younger forests. While regions with a currently low combined ESB performance benefitted from climate change, regions with a high ESB performance were particularly vulnerable to climate change. In particular, climate sensitivity was highest east and southeast of the Great Lakes, signaling potential priority areas for adaptive management. Our findings suggest that strategies aimed at enhancing the representation of older forest conditions at landscape scales will help sustain ESB in a changing world.

AB  - Clam shell can be used to reconstruct recent and past environmental variations at high-resolution time scale. During processes of growth increments, carbonate structure can record subdaily (tidally) to seasonal information of environmental variations such as water temperature, salinity and tidal change. This study aims to investigate the potential of clam shells as an environmental recorder, observe the visibility of microgrowth lines in shell cross-sections of Corbula modesta from intertidal and subtidal areas and interpret the periodicity of the shell patterns during Pre-and post-monsoon in Chabahar bay. Clams were collected on a fourteen days basis and the shells were sectioned from the umbo to the ventral margin, polishing, etched and observed microgrowth lines and increments under a light microscope. The majority of the clam shells showed that the number of growth lines in shell structures was close to the number of tidal emersions (P>0.05) and the growth increments width in intertidal and subtidal areas were significantly different (P<0.05). Multiple regression analysis was used to assess independent associations between shell mean increment width and environmental parameters. Study model showed that 60.8% of the variation in shell growth could be explained by temperature, salinity, rainfall and tidal change. Individually, temperature and salinity made the greatest unique contribution to explain shell growth, respectively (P<0.05). Increment widths in monsoon season were much narrower and show sudden bunching of growth increments at the onset, with rapid recovery. This study shows monsoon in shell structure are considered markers for identifying the period of seasonal variation. These findings provide a basis for the interpretation of the temporal changes in shell microgrowth patterns in terms of environmental conditions of clam shells.

AB  - After the onset of continental collision, magmatism often persists for tens of millions of years, albeit with a different composition, in reduced volumes, and with a more episodic nature and more widespread spatial distribution, compared to normal arc magmatism. Kinematic modelling studies have suggested that slab breakoff can account for this post-collisional magmatism through the formation of a slab window and subsequent heating of the overriding plate and decompression melting of upwelling asthenosphere, particularly if breakoff occurs at depths shallower than the overriding plate. To constrain the nature of any melting and the geodynamic conditions required, we numerically model the collision of two continental plates following a period of oceanic subduction. A thermodynamic database is used to determine the (de)hydration reactions and occurrence of melt throughout this process. We investigate melting conditions within a parameter space designed to generate a wide range of breakoff depths, timings and collisional styles.
   Under most circumstances, slab breakoff occurs deeper than the depth extent of the overriding plate; too deep to generate any decompressional melting of dry upwelling asthenosphere or thermal perturbation within the overriding plate. Even if slab breakoff is very shallow, the hot mantle inflow into the slab window is not sustained long enough to sufficiently heat the hydrated overriding plate to cause significant magmatism. Instead, for relatively fast, shallow breakoff we observe melting of asthenosphere above the detached slab through the release of water from the tip of the heating detached slab. Melting of the subducted continental crust during necking and breakoff is a more common feature and may be a more reliable indicator of the occurrence of breakoff. We suggest that magmatism from slab breakoff alone is unable to explain several of the characteristics of post-collisional magmatism, and that additional geodynamical processes need to be considered when interpreting magmatic observations.

AB  - Plant growth in the Arctic is strictly dependant on thermal conditions. The purpose of our study is therefore to calculating temperature distributions on the Svalbard archipelago at a relatively high spatial resolution. The model is designed to reflect both the length of the growing season and the temperature sum for a given area (i.e. growing degree-days (GDD)). GDD on Svalbard is defined as the cumulative sum of positive mean daily temperatures in the months of June, July and August. The temperature distribution of GDD for the entire archipelago is calculated from both local and regional information. Local information is derived from data collected in a small area in northwestern Spitsbergen (Kongsfjorden) where a network of 45 thermal sensors recorded air temperatures for five years (2001-2005). A local GDD parameter is computed by a linear combination of elevation, valley depth and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Then this local GDD is applied to the whole of Svalbard (GDD1) and refined stepwise by adding environmental variables such as cloud fraction, land surface temperature, sea surface temperature, distance to the ocean and number of snow-free days. Because the official network of climatological stations on Svalbard is not dense enough and sufficiently well-distributed across the archipelago to enable spatial interpolations for four years only (2011-2014), all outputs are statistically evaluated and adjusted using the values recorded at 9 (2011), 12 (2012) and 13 (2013-2014) meteorological stations (GDD(ref)) and used as a set of evaluation data. The final model (GDD(mean)) which is the mean of the annual models estimated by regression (GDD(est)), performs well: the central parts of Spitsbergen, known for its comparatively high temperatures, contrast with the colder northern and eastern parts of the archipelago.

AB  - Given the diversification of oilseed-based products, sunflower is a competitive crop for obtaining high oil and protein concentrations; however, both are subject to genotypic and environmental variability. We analyzed individual and interaction effects of nitrogen (N), plant density (D) and genotype (G) in a 2-year field experiment. A set of "sink" (oil, protein, and hull concentrations and quantities) and "source" (leaf area duration, nitrogen uptake, nitrogen and biomass remobilizations) indicators were measured at harvest in a split-split-plot design with contrasting nitrogen (N+: 150 kg ha(-1); N-: no fertilization), plant density (01: 3 and D2: 4.5 plants m(-2)) and genotype (cv. LG5451HO in 2011, cv. Olledy in 2012 and cv. Kerbel in both years) treatments. We found that nitrogen had a significant positive effect on protein concentration and plant density had a positive effect on nitrogen uptake after flowering. Oil concentration was not related to oil weight but was related to plant dry matter at flowering and biomass remobilization. Protein concentration was related to protein weight and nitrogen nutrition index at flowering and to nitrogen uptake and leaf area duration after flowering. Significant interaction effects were identified on sink (N x D, D x G) and source (N x G) indicators in the 2012 experiment, which was only partly explained by differences in initial states at flowering. In this study, the genotype that maximized oil concentration depended on nitrogen and plant density conditions, while the genotype that maximized protein concentration was the same regardless of cropping conditions. We highlight the importance of analyzing effects of determining factors on oil accumulation during grain filling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of Water Invasion on Outburst Predictive Index of Low Rank Coals in Dalong Mine
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - ADSORPTION
KW  - METHANE
AB  - To improve the coal permeability and outburst prevention, coal seam water injection and a series of outburst prevention measures were tested in outburst coal mines. These methods have become important technologies used for coal and gas outburst prevention and control by increasing the external moisture of coal or decreasing the stress of coal seam and changing the coal pore structure and gas desorption speed. In addition, techniques have had a significant impact on the gas extraction and outburst prevention indicators of coal seams. Globally, low rank coals reservoirs account for nearly half of hidden coal reserves and the most obvious feature of low rank coal is the high natural moisture content. Moisture will restrain the gas desorption and will affect the gas extraction and accuracy of the outburst prediction of coals. To study the influence of injected water on methane desorption dynamic characteristics and the outburst predictive index of coal, coal samples were collected from the Dalong Mine. The methane adsorption/desorption test was conducted on coal samples under conditions of different injected water contents. Selective analysis assessed the variations of the gas desorption quantities and the outburst prediction index (coal cutting desorption index). Adsorption tests indicated that the Langmuir volume of the Dalong coal sample is similar to 40.26 m(3)/t, indicating a strong gas adsorption ability. With the increase of injected water content, the gas desorption amount of the coal samples decreased under the same pressure and temperature. Higher moisture content lowered the accumulation desorption quantity after 120 minutes. The gas desorption volumes and moisture content conformed to a logarithmic relationship. After moisture correction, we obtained the long-flame coal outburst prediction (cutting desorption) index critical value. This value can provide a theoretical basis for outburst prediction and prevention of low rank coal mines and similar occurrence conditions of coal seams.

AB  - Adverse environmental conditions limit crop yield and better understanding of plant response to stress will assist the development of more tolerant cultivars. Maize and common bean plantlets were evaluated under salinity, high temperature, drought and waterlogged conditions to identify biochemical markers which could be useful for rapid identification of putative stress tolerant plants. The levels of phenolics (free, cell wall-linked, total), aldehydes including malondialdehyde and chlorophylls (a, b, total) were measured on stressed plantlets. Only two indicators were statistically non-significant: chlorophyll b in maize plantlets stressed with sodium chloride and malondialdehyde content in drought stressed maize. The most remarkable effects of abiotic stresses can be summarized as follows: (i) salinity increased levels of free phenolics in maize plantlets and chlorophylls (a, b, total) in common bean; (ii) high temperature (40 degrees C) elevated levels of chlorophylls (a, b, total) in maize but decreased chlorophylls (a, b, total) and free phenolics in common bean; (iii) drought increased phenolics and decreased chlorophylls (a, b, total) in maize and increased chlorophyll pigments (a, b, total) in common bean; (iv) waterlogging increased free phenolics and decreased chlorophylls (a, b, total) in maize and increased chlorophyll (a, total) in common bean. Free phenolics and chlorophylls, especially a, were the most responsive indicators to stress and can, therefore, be considered putative biochemical markers for abiotic stress tolerance in maize and common bean. The use of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis to differentiate non-stressed and stressed plants in breeding programs is also a novel aspect of this report. Fisher's linear discriminant functions classified correctly 100% of non-stressed or stressed originally grouped plants.

AB  - We may expect butterflies as ectotherms to have particularly active life-history stages that occur in the warmest and lightest times of the year; however, there are temperate species that are active when climatic conditions seem unfavourable and photoperiod short, such as the Taylor's checkerspot (Euphydryas editha taylori). For such species, studies suggest that even subtle changes to microclimate can potentially impact populations. Thus, understanding how in situ variations in microclimate influence the Taylor's checkerspot butterfly could provide much needed insights into more effective management. We conducted a series of surveys that explored (i) adult habitat use, (ii) final instar larval distribution and (iii) adult movement up to and across site boundaries at two sites in Oregon, USA, in 2010 and 2011. We found that in situ habitat use by the Taylor's checkerspot butterfly was strongly influenced by microclimate. Both adult activities and final instar larvae distribution were clustered within the warmest areas of the sites. Moreover, adults did not use up to 59% and larva up to 90% of their sites, despite vegetation structure and composition being uniform. More specifically, butterfly habitat use increased with increasing ground temperatures, and we found that areas with the highest ground temperatures were more exposed to direct sunlight. Similarly, we found that butterflies tended to only move through sunlit site boundaries. We conclude that the Taylor's checkerspot is sensitive to changes in its thermal environment at fine spatial scales. Our results highlight the importance of microclimate as an indicator of habitat quality, and establishing the thermal criteria in which species of concern exists may provide valuable insights into the implications of climate change.

AB  - Studies using mice and rats have demonstrated that nicotine induces a conditioned place preference (CPP), with more effective results obtained by using biased procedures. Zebrafish have also been used as a model system to identify factors influencing nicotine-associated reward by using an unbiased design. Here, we report that zebrafish exhibited putative nicotine biased CPP to an initially aversive compartment (nicotine-paired group). A counterbalanced nicotine-exposed control group did not show a significant preference shift, providing evidence that the preference shift in the nicotine-paired group was not due to a reduction of aversion for this compartment. Zebrafish preference was corroborated by behavioral analysis of several indicators of drug preference, such as time spent in the drug-paired side, number of entries to the drug-paired side, and distance traveled. These results provided strong evidence that zebrafish may actually develop a preference for nicotine, although the drug was administrated in an aversive place for the fish, which was further supported by molecular studies. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR analysis depicted a significant increase in the expression of alpha 7 and alpha 6 but not alpha 4 and beta 2 subunits of the nicotinic receptor in nicotine-paired zebrafish brains. In contrast, zebrafish brains from the counterbalanced nicotine group showed no significant changes. Moreover, CREB phosphorylation, an indicator of neural activity, accompanied the acquisition of nicotine-CPP. Our studies offered an incremental value to the drug addiction field, because they further describe behavioral features of CPP to nicotine in zebrafish. The results suggested that zebrafish exposed to nicotine in an unfriendly environment can develop a preference for that initially aversive place, which is likely due to the rewarding effect of nicotine.

AB  - Atmospheric surface ozone (O-3) was measured at Toolik Lake, Alaska, from September 2010 to August 2011, along with winter and springtime (January-May) measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). Concurrent episodic springtime depletion of both O-3 and GEM was observed between April and May 2011. To investigate these depletion events, surface O-3 measurements from Toolik Lake were compared with similar measurements from Barrow, the only Alaskan site available to use as an indicator of conditions at the Arctic Ocean coastline. Barrow is located approximately 400 km to the northwest of Toolik Lake. In all cases where O-3 and GEM depletion was observed at Toolik Lake, similar O-3 depletion events (ODEs) were observed at Barrow. Conversely, in over half of the instances where ODEs were observed at Barrow, no such events were recorded at Toolik Lake. The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was utilized to interpret the transport conditions and potential influence of oceanic air masses on depletion events observed at Toolik Lake. These analyses indicate that ODEs observed at Toolik Lake are correlated with depletion events observed at Barrow when the prevailing airflow is from the north and the air mass has spent substantial time over the Arctic Ocean or coast within the previous week. These observations suggest that coastal O-3 and GEM-depleted air masses are likely transported from the Arctic Ocean up to similar to 200 km inland and to at least an altitude of 700 m above sea level. These observations underscore that O-3 and GEM depletion events impact not just the Arctic coastal zone but also extensive inland areas with possible implications for the cycling and bioavailability of mercury (Hg) to inland Arctic ecosystems.

AB  - Two Populus families growing at two sites in Europe (i.e., northern Italy versus central France) were used to investigate: (1) the relationships between various leaf structural and growth traits and biomass production, (2) the dependence of these relationships on environmental conditions and genetic background (i.e., Populus deltoides x Populus nigra family versus P deltoides x Populus trichocarpa family), and (3) the subsequent relevance of the use of these morphophysiological traits as indirect indicators of productivity. Tree growth and leaf characteristics, as well as the links between them, were intensively studied for 3 weeks. The R deltoides x R trichocarpa family was more productive than the P deltoides x R nigra family at both sites. The two families inherited complementary leaf characteristics from their respective male parents, i.e., large leaves from P trichocarpa and fast leaf production from P nigra. The traits were clearly dependent on site conditions, trees being much bigger in Italy than in France. Moreover, the G x E interaction caused a significant change in the genotypic ranking between sites in terms of productivity for the R deltoides x P trichocarpa family, which might represent a limit for the selection of productive hybrids showing a large environmental spectrum. Three categories of leaf traits could be considered: (i) traits linked to whole tree growth irrespective of site and family (e.g. leaf area, petiole dimensions), (ii) traits for which the relationships with tree growth were dependent on site and/or family (e.g., specific leaf area, nitrogen content, leaf number increment), and (iii) traits showing no link with tree growth irrespective of site and family (e.g., chlorophyll and carbon contents).

AB  - In order to understand fluctuations in terrestrial and marine environments influenced by the East Asian Monsoon during the last 42 kyr, we investigated a sedimentary core MD982195 collected from the northern East China Sea (ECS), one of the largest marginal seas in the world. The total abundance of pollen and spores varies from 4.8 to 22.3 x 10(3) grains g(-1). The pollen and spores can be grouped to represent six local zones of pollen assemblage based on their abundance and assemblages. Pollen assemblage found in the modem condition (zone MD2195-6) is consistent with the present vegetation found in Kyushu, Japan. Cooler condition with high rainfall can be estimated in zone MD2195-1 (42-40.5 ka). Larger area of continental shelf in the ECS and Yellow Sea was exposed to the land during the large drop in the sea level in zones MD2195-2 (40.5-17 ka) and -3 (17-14 ka). High abundance of nonarboreal pollen in Zones MD2195-2 and -3 is attributed to reduced distance, exposed continental shelf and ocean current system. Rainfall could have been diminished in zone MD2195-2. Climate could begin to warm up in zone MD21953. Sharp decrease in abundance of nonarboreal pollen due to rapid transgression characterizes zone MD2195-4 (14-8 ka). Warm temperate-subtropical evergreen broad-leaved pollens developed in zone MD2195-5. The occurrence of Phyllocladus, originating from high land of New Guinea, Indonesia Maritime Continent and Philippines, between upper zone MD2195-2c and zone MD2195-4 suggests that Kuroshio Current flowed through the ECS during the last glacial times.

AB  - Sediment samples recovered from three proximate reef environments in north Jamaica, characterised by different light penetration regimes, reveal marked variations in the bathymetric range of sediment microboring communities. In contrast to clear water environments, assemblages developed in turbid water conditions undergo both bathymetric restriction and compression in their range. In clear water sites, the upper photic-lower photic zone transition occurs between depths of 20-30 m. This is marked by a shift from a predominance of cyanobacterial (e.g., Eurygonum nodosum, Scolecia filosa, Fasciculus frutex and Fasciculus dactylus) and chlorophyte (e.g., Rhopalia catenata, Fasciculus grandis, Reticulina elegans and Scolecia botulifera) traces, to assemblages dominated by the traces E nodosum and S. filosa (cyanobacteria), F grandis (chlorophyte), Palaeoconchocelis starmarchii (rhodophyte) and Orthogonum fusiferum and Saccomorpha sphaerula (fungi). At sites characterised by intermediate levels of turbidity this same assemblage transition occurs at around 15-20 m depth and at the most turbid site at depths of only 5-10 m. Integration of assemblage data and light readings indicates that this transition occurs where percentages of surface light illumination are reduced to around 10-15%. Compression of the lower photic zone is so extreme at the most turbid site, that microboring assemblages at only 30 m depth show evidence of a transition to an assemblage associated with dysphotic ( <1% of surface illumination) conditions. This is dominated by fungal boring traces. Given that microendolithic assemblages have been widely considered to represent useful palaeobathymetric indicators, this study illustrates that it is more accurate to regard assemblages as indicative only of photic zones. The bathymetric range and extent of zones clearly varies significantly as light penetration levels change. Caution is thus needed in the extrapolation of assemblage or ichnocoenosis data to specific bathymetric ranges. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Single-cell analysis in microfluidic cultivation devices bears a great potential for the development and optimization of industrial bioprocesses. High parallelization allows running a large number of cultivation experiments simultaneously even under quick alteration of environmental conditions. For example, the impact of changes in media composition on cell growth during classical batch cultivation can be easily resolved. A missing link for the scalability of microfluidic experiments is, however, their complete characterization via conventional performance indicators such as product titer and productivity. While existing mass spectrometry technology is not yet sufficiently coupled with microfluidics, optical methods like enzymatic assays or fluorescence sensors are promising alternatives but require further improvement to generate quantitative measurements of extracellular metabolites.

AB  - Since diversity suggests that changes in nematode populations or communities may be useful indicators of environmental changes including anthropogenic disturbances, in this study the following measurements were done : pH, predominant plant taxa, nematode density and diversity at different wetland points along La Tapera creek. A random sampling was carried out and data were subject to analysis Nest. In this work, neither the diversity nor the pH changed, however the latter was high and. nematode density and taxa were small but without significative oscillations between stations. However, other population indices showed consistent differences between sites, which are pointing out environmental alteration throughout the creek. These Preliminary results from the wetland present a description of nematode communities existing under a particular set of conditions that have not been reported previously.

AB  - A Strain isolated from Argentinean regional fermented sausages was found to produce and secrete a compound that inhibited growth of Lactobacillus strains used as indicators. It was characterized as Paenibacillus polymyxa (P13). The antimicrobial activity, named polyxin, was obtained from culture supernatant fluid of late stationary phase and was inhibitory to actively growing cells. It was effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species tested including foodborne pathogens. Bacteriocin-like properties such as proteinaceous nature (sensitive to proteases), insensitivity to organic solvents and chelators, stability to heat (up to 10 min at 90 degrees C), and acidic pH but instability in alkaline conditions, were determined. A molecular mass of 10 kDa was estimated by molecular gel filtration.

AB  - The economic well-being of most of the nations on earth depends greatly on arable soils and how well their productivity is maintained. Soil quality can improve or deteriorate depending on influencing factors. There is a need of tools to interpret the different soil quality data as well as a strategy for an evaluation that gives a quality picture for a specific soil. A strategy for an integrated evaluation of soil quality is suggested. The different indicators used are such that they reflect biological, chemical, and physical components of the soil. Information about climatic conditions as well as data concerning cultivation measures, previous and present, should be included. Principal component analysis (PCA) is needed to evaluate the complex data sets compiled from all these variables.

All zoo-exhibited and 72% of the translocated rhinoceroses had generalized hemosiderosis. None of the recently caught or free-ranging rhinoceroses studied had this lesion. Several processes can result in hemosiderosis, and its presence in the captive and translocated animals may not necessarily indicate a hemolytic process; however, the absence of hemosiderosis in free-ranging and recently caught animals suggests that a hemolytic syndrome previously reported in captive black rhinoceroses does not occur under natural conditions.

AB  - Magnesium ion (Mg+2) plays an important role in various biological processes. All the commercial indicators available share a common drawback, i.e., they have a higher affinity towards calcium ions (Ca+2) than Mg+2. In this study, we reported a new robust green fluorescent indicator, Mag-520, for detection of Mg+2 in live cells. Our results showed that Mag-520 has 10 fold higher affinity towards Mg+2 than Ca+2 , while mag-fluo-4 has less than 0.5 fold affinity to Mg+2 than Ca+2 under the same conditions using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The results demonstrated that Mag-520 provides a better tool to measure Mg+2 with less interference from Ca+2.

AB  - Tracing the history of the phrase "epidemic of hearing loss," Zdrodowska identifies two aspects of the moral panic related to deafness: blaming the epidemic on the noisy urban environment and pointing to particularly vulnerable groups, i.e. children, individuals with health conditions and intellectuals. Urban noise is considered to be an ambivalent phenomenon - it is the scourge of big cities of the nineteenth and twentieth century and at the same time it is an indicator for a modern Western lifestyle. The use of the term "epidemic" activates a medical discourse around the urban threats to hearing - the city is examined and diagnosed; it is perceived not only as an acoustically dangerous environment, but also as a patient consumed by a major disease.

AB  - This paper presents a simple biosensor for observing the dissolved oxygen (DO) production in water. The measuring process is implemented using the biochips G connected with a biosensor module and electronic circuit to detect the changes of dissolved oxygen in real time measurement. Initial test was completed to observe the biochip response to the different oxygenated water solution. A light and dark experiment with ON/OFF phase of 20 minutes illumination period was realized to stimulate the green algae Chlorella vulgaris photosynthesis process to DO rate. The results show Biochip G using algae Chlorella vulgaris response to environmental changing conditions in the form of relationship between output voltage and DO rate the solution.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that Mexican pinyons (Pinus cembroides) and Johannis pines (P. johannis) grow under different environmental conditions, the flora associated with both species was sampled along two 20-m perpendicular transects at 40 sites. Patterns were analyzed with the two-way-indicator-species program, which yielded six groups with Mexican pinyons dominating xeric sites and Johannis pines dominating mesic sites. Other groups of species corresponded to transition from mesic to xeric sites. We used canonical-correspondence analysis to explore the effect of slope and aspect on species and indirectly related them to an underlying moisture gradient. The first ordination axis indicated that aspect explained 59% of the variation, and the second axis, representing slope, explained 41%.

AB  - The paper presents a comprehensive analysis to explore the environmental vulnerability pattern of the Mid-Atlantic region. It is a combination of several methods - stressor-resource overlay, state-space analysis, and clustering analysis - at different steps of the analysis. In addition, a generalized distance measure was utilized in the state-space analysis to handle the interdependency among variables without reducing their dimensionality. Results from the analysis provided valuable insights on the environmental conditions, in general, and the relative vulnerability pattern, in particular, of the Mid-Atlantic region. The suggested method offers a simple but effective way to understand the complex spatial pattern of environmental vulnerability at regional scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - HABITAT FRAGMENTATION
AB  - Next to the problem of fragmented nature, also the fragmentation of the rural matrix in rapidly changing cultural landscapes deserves attention. Because of the multifunctionality of these landscapes, a reflection is needed about the references for fragmentation analysis and interpretation. Flanders (Belgium) is taken as pilot area because of its high degree of urbanisation, road development and intensity of land use. Fragmentation analysis is based on deliberate selections of relevant land use systems in the first place, next on the explicit definition of some past. planned or idealistic reference condition. Differencing or rationing actual and reference landscape structure indicators yields fragmentation maps with enhanced interpretation possibilities for landscape and spatial planning.

AB  - The sex pheromone of female Heterodera schachtii, the sugar beet cyst nematode, was partially isolated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Female-conditioned medium (FCM), produced by incubating 20 H. schachtii females in 1 ml of ultrapure water, attracted males in a concentration dependent manner. The attractive material was not contained within the female gelatinous matrix and did not attract second stage juveniles (J2). Characterisation of FCM revealed that the attractive material was water soluble and heat stable. Male H. schachtii exhibited stylet thrusting behaviour upon exposure to FCM, and this behaviour was used as a novel indicator of biological activity.

AB  - In many countries, forest management and its assessment are based, to a varying extent, on national criteria and indicators (C&I) for sustainable forest management (SFM). Data on forests and forest management collected in Poland largely correspond to the scope of pan-European indicators developed under the Forest Europe process, however, no standardized national set of C&I has been developed and implemented so far. In this paper we discuss the processes and systems used in Poland to: 1) monitor forests and forest management, and 2) collect and publish information about forests, in terms of their use for development and implementation of national criteria and indicators of SFM. The framework of forest condition monitoring in Poland consists of several elements, of which the most important are: Forest Monitoring (FM), National Forest Inventory (NFI), stand-wise inventories and the continuous monitoring of damages in forests managed by the State Forests National Forest Holding. More and more information on the Polish forests is shared publicly, mainly via the national portal of Forest Data Bank. There are several reports published yearly: statistical yearbooks published by the Statistics Poland, NFI results, annual reports on updated forest area and forest resources, results of FM in Poland and annual reports on forest protection and damages. In the recent decades much progress has been made in digitalization of forest management and planning which has resulted in steady improvements in the coverage of information on forests and its accuracy provided to stakeholders and general public. Data sources analysed in this paper can be a good source of information for the national set of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management although further enlargement of available information on forests is advisable.

AB  - The fish community of temporary wetlands is highly dynamic due to the marked seasonal changes in hydrological and limnological conditions. In this study, we evaluated spatiotemporal variation in the fish community and the influence of environmental factors on this variation in temporary wetlands in southern Brazil. Two different life cycles-annual and non-annual fishes-were recorded among species. Variation in the fish community appeared to be associated with differences in the life history strategy of species. While species of annual fish were present throughout the hydroperiod, gradually decreasing in density over time, non-annual fish species had an opposite pattern, with higher densities in the final phase of the hydrological cycle. Variations in the composition and abundance of fish community in temporary wetlands were related to habitat and landscape attributes (area, number of microhabitats and isolation between temporary wetlands) and climate indicators of water availability (air temperature, average rainfall, and water level of the Sao Goncalo channel), but not to water conditions (dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity and water temperature). We concluded that the ichthyofauna of temporary wetlands are composed both of rare species, highly specialised for life within these ephemeral environments, and widespread generalist species that reach the wetlands opportunistically for short periods. Habitat and landscape attributes and changes in climate and hydrological variables over the hydroperiod are the factors that had the greatest influence on spatiotemporal variation of the fish community. Maintaining physical characteristics and the hydrological cycle of temporary wetlands is critical for the conservation of fish species inhabiting these vulnerable environments in southern Brazil. Habitat and landscape attributes and climate and hydrology fluctuations affect the annual and non-annual fishes inhabiting temporary wetlands differently.

AB  - Human health outcomes are known to be affected not only by individual physical and socio-economic status, but also by external environmental conditions, as well as by place-based economic and geographical circumstances. In recent decades, a large number of studies have addressed the background of differences in health outcomes between rural and urban areas. Are rural ways of living healthier than urban ways of living? This has led to a wealth of studies on human health and the geographical differences of living and working. The effects of regional or urban characteristics on health outcomes are often inconsistent among different studies/countries. An important factor that seems to be important is the ambiguous definition of both health and urbanism, as well as the presence of intra-regional heterogeneity (e.g. inner-city areas). In the present study, we conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on space and health indicators, based on a broad, but concise overview of the underlying mechanisms involved. Next, we provide a quantitative research synthesis with the help of a meta-analysis of published studies on self-rated/self-reported physical health conditions in rural and urban areas. The results from our meta-analytical regression analysis indicate that there is not a clearly convincing difference between rural and urban areas; however, people in rural areas appear to rate themselves slightly healthier than their urban counterparts. In addition, we observe that self-rated/reported fair/poor health is also highly dependent on a number of personal and socio-economic factors; from a personal perspective, education, addiction, physical activity, and duration of residence appear to play a significant role, while, from a socio-economic perspective, in particular, community predictor measures (e.g. gross domestic product, population, unemployment rate) appear to exert a substantial influence.

AB  - We investigated effects of early and later life housing on attention bias, as an indicator of affective state, in pigs differing in coping style [reactive (LR) vs. proactive (HR)]. Pigs (n=128) in barren or enriched housing from birth (B1 vs. E1) that experienced either a switch in housing at 7 weeks of age or not (creating B1B2, B1E2, E1E2, and E1B2 treatments), were studied in a 180-s attention bias test at 11 weeks. Pigs exposed to a 10-s-auditory-and-sudden-motion threat in the test arena paid more attention to the location of the threat, were more vigilant, showed less eating, more walking and were more likely to utter high-pitched vocalisations than non-threat pigs. During threat presence, HR pigs from post-switch enriched housing (E2-HR, i.e., B1E2+E1E2) showed more vigilance but less exploration than others. After threat removal, no effects were found on time spent paying attention to the threat, vigilance, and eating, but E2-HR pigs paid attention to the threat more frequently, were more likely to utter high-pitched vocalisations and walked more compared to (part of) other groups, suggesting the most negative affective state in these animals. E2 pigs grunted more than B2 pigs. Thus, current housing, but not early life housing, affected behaviour in a personality-dependent manner in this attention bias test. Housing effects were opposite to expectation, possibly due to the short-term effect of the relative contrast between the home pens of the pigs and the test room. This potentially overruled putative long-term effects of environmental conditions on attention bias.

AB  - Two cores of bat guano were recovered from Topolnica and Gura Ponicovei Caves in the south-west region of Romania and analyzed for delta N-15, delta C-13 and pollen. Deposition of guano began in CE 1537 at Gura Ponicovei and CE 1694 at Topolnita, allowing for the development and interpretation of climate and vegetation records since the Little Ice Age. delta N-15 values were found to record phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation through the effect of winter precipitation on the local nitrogen cycle. Alternatively, delta C-13 values are interpreted to correspond with variation in summer precipitation. Both records suggest progressively drier conditions during the termination of the LIA in the region at CE 1870. The transition to landscape openness, with patchy forests of Tilia, Carpinus betulus, and Quercus during this time could be related to the lower water availability at both sites. Wetter conditions inferred from a 3 parts per thousand increase in delta N-15 values between CE 1879 and CE 1970 occurred contemporaneously with a similar trend in European winter precipitation and increased frequency of positive NAO phases during this interval. The delta C-13 values between CE 1885 and CE 1968 suggest a trend towards a wetter summer climate as well. Although there is at times evidence of forest dynamics being controlled by climate, vegetation appears to be more closely associated with human impact, particularly around Topolnica Cave. The contribution of ruderal pollen indicators from CE 1985 - present is likely related to agricultural practices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In dairy production, high fertility contributes to herd profitability by achieving greater production and maintaining short calving intervals. Improved management practices and genetic selection have contributed to reversing negative trends in dairy cow fertility, but further progress is still required. Phenotypes included in current genetic evaluations are largely interval and binary traits calculated from insemination and calving date records. Several indicator traits such as calving, health, variation in body condition score, and longevity traits also apply to genetic improvement of fertility. Several fertility traits are included in the selection indices of many countries, but for improved selection, the development of novel phenotypes that more closely describe the physiology of reproduction and limit management bias could be more effective. Progesteronebased phenotypes can be determined from milk samples to describe the heritable interval from calving to corpus luteum activity, as well as additional measures of cow cyclicity. A fundamental component of artificial insemination practices is the observation of estrus. Novel phenotypes collected on estrous activity could be used to select for cows clearly displaying heat, as those cows are more likely to be inseminated at the right time and therefore have greater fertility performance. On-farm technologies, including in-line milk testing and activity monitors, may allow for phenotyping novel traits on large numbers of animals. Additionally, selection for improved fertility using traditional traits could benefit from refined and accurate recording and implementation of parameters such as pregnancy confirmation and reproductive management strategy, to differentiate embryonic or fetal loss, and to ensure selection for reproductive capability without producer intervention. Opportunities exist to achieve genetic improvement of reproductive efficiency in cattle using novel phenotypes, which is required for long-term sustainability of the dairy cattle population and industry.

AB  - We provide a comprehensive analysis of the Holocene climate and vegetation changes over South America through numerical simulations. Holocene climate for several periods (8 ka, 6 ka, 4 ka, 2 ka, and present) were simulated by an atmospheric general circulation model, forced with orbital parameters, CO2 concentrations, and sea surface temperature (SST), while the analysis of the biome distributions was made with a potential vegetation model (PVM). Compared with the present climate, our four simulated periods of the Holocene were characterized by reduced South Atlantic Convergence Zone intensity and weaker South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The model simulated conditions drier than present over most of South America and gradual strengthening of SAMS toward the present. The Northeast Brazil was wetter because of southward migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Moreover, SST conditions were the main forcing for the climate changes during the mid Holocene inducing larger austral summer southward ITCZ migration. PVM paleovegetation projections are shown to be consistent with paleodata proxies which suggest fluctuations between biomes, despite the fact that ages of dry/wet indicators are not synchronous over large areas of the Amazonian ecosystem. Holocene PVM simulations show distinct retreat in Amazonian forest biome in all four simulated periods. In 6 ka, present caatinga vegetation in Northeastern Brazil was replaced with savanna or dense shrubland. The simulations also suggest the existence of rainforest in western Amazonia and the expansion of savanna and seasonal forest in the eastern Amazon, with shifts in plant community compositions and fragmentation located mostly in ecotone regions. Moreover, our PVM results show that during the Holocene, the Amazonian tropical forest was smaller in area than today, although western Amazonia persisted as a tropical forest throughout the Holocene.

AB  - This study investigates the processes that control dug well and borewell water chemistry in crystalline basement aquifers in semi-arid environment Changes in SO42- and NO3- were observed in both dug well and borewell samples. Six dug wells and seven borewells had high NO3- concentrations relative to SO42- suggesting prevailing oxidizing redoA conditions in these samples. The highest NO3- and SO42- concentrations were found in few borewells. These high concentrations could be attributed to low recharge rates and chemical weathering of sulfide minerals. The acidic conditions may have promoted As-T adsorption in the majority of dug wells. The saturation indices and correlation coefficients showed that most dug wells and some borewells were supersaturated with respect to Fe-bearing minerals, implying that trace elements such as As-T, Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn were likely to coprecipitate with residual Fe minerals. The low mobility of As-T in dug wells could be also explained by the limited carbonate mineral abundance in the weathered layer. By contrast, the elevated MT concentrations observed in the majority of borewells reflected an extended water-rock interaction that had led to deportonation of surface charges of the aquifer minerals, thereby inhibiting As-T adsorption. The average concentration of Fe-T and total coliform content of dug well samples exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) limits for drinking waters. Likewise; the average concentrations of Fe-T, As-T (similar to 55% of samples) and Pb in borewells were higher than the WHO permissible limits. The study showed that the local groundwater resources are exposed to both anthropogenic and geogenic sources of pollution. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Quantification of phosphorus (P) loss risk of animal manures is essential to scientifically sound P risk assessment and environmental friendly nutrient management, but has faced significant challenges due to the shortage of appropriate techniques. This study was conducted to determine P source coefficients (PSC) for quantifying differential P loss risk of various manures relative to soluble chemical fertilizer. After 2-d, 2-week, 8-week, and 26-week soil incubations with various manures, P-amended soils were analyzed for Olsen P (Ol), Mehlich-3 P (M3), water extractable P (WEP), and Fe-oxide coated filter paper strip P (FeO), each of which was then used to calculate manure PSC. Manure PSCM3 had the strongest linear relationships (r(2) = 0.95-0.97) among different incubation durations, compared with PSCWEB (r(2) = 0.79-0.91), PSCOl (r(2) = 0.85-0.94), and PSCFeO (r(2) = 0.88-0.91). The 2 week incubation yielded PSCM3 which had the strongest linear relationships (r2 = 0.87-0.97 with a mean of 0.95) among the tested soils, compared with those from 2-d, 8-week, and 26-week incubations. In addition, laboratory PSCM3 had the strongest linear relationships with those PSCM3 measured under field conditions, relative to PSCOl, PSCFeO, and PSCWEP. Hence, the 2-week incubation along with Mehlich-3 P yielded the most consistent PSCs for various manures across soil types, incubation durations, and soil conditions, and can be recommended as a common protocol for determining manure PSC. The recommended default PSC values are 110, 65, 46, and 43% for liquid swine, liquid dairy, solid poultry, and solid beef manures, respectively, for the new P index of Ontario.

AB  - The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta psi(mt) or mtMP) is directly influenced by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The exact nature of the interactions between respiration (flux) and mtMP (force) under various physiological and pathological conditions remains unclear, partially due to methodological limitations. Here, we describe a combination of high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry based on the OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k and the widely applied mtMP indicator safranin. The analysis of OXPHOS in mouse brain homogenates revealed that, at commonly applied concentrations, safranin inhibits Complex I-driven OXPHOS capacity, primarily targeting the phosphorylation system, but has no effects on LEAK respiration. Conversely, Complex II-driven OXPHOS capacity was inhibited by <20% by safranin concentrations normally used for mtMP monitoring. The mtMP was higher in the LEAK state without adenylates than at identical LEAK respiration after ADP stimulation and Complex V inhibition with oligomycin. The maximal electron transfer system (ETS) capacity was reached in uncoupler titrations before the mtMP fully collapsed, whereas respiration was inhibited at increasing uncoupler concentrations, resulting in the progressive reduction of mtMP. In a pharmacologically induced state of Complex II dysfunction, mtMP was rather insensitive to the inhibition of OXPHOS to 50% of its normal capacity, but robustly responded to inhibitors when respiration was limited by substrate depletion. The optimal concentration of uncoupler supporting maximal ETS capacity varied as a function of pharmacological intervention. Taken together, the combined measurement of respiration and mtMP greatly enhances the informative potential of OXPHOS studies. The respirometric validation of inhibitory and uncoupling effects is mandatory for any fluorophore employed to assess mtMP in any respiratory state, tissue type, and pathophysiological condition. The methodological issues analyzed herein are relevant for the study of mitochondrial respiration in a wide variety of setting, including cancer cell metabolism.

Mortality and welfare impairment were evaluated daily. Mortality was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for the 0 L: 24 D photoperiod among O. niloticus and significantly higher (P < 0.05) for the 24 L: 0 D photoperiod among C. gariepinus. In general, mortality was significantly higher (P < 0.05) among O. niloticus than in C. gariepinus, with mortality being very high in the first 5 weeks of culture in the 2 species in all 3 photoperiods. Mortality was probably due to stress in the tanks arising from poor acclimatization to the environmental conditions, feeding inhibition, cannibalism, and maladjustment to the light/dark rhythmic cycle. The 0 L: 24 D photoperiod had a profound effect on the welfare of the juveniles of O. niloticus, and 24 L: 0 D compromised the welfare of the juveniles of C. gariepinus, as shown by the nonintrusive welfare indicators. The 2 unfavorable photoperiods manifested in stress conditions that caused injuries and affected swimming activity, behavior, coloration, and growth. If welfare challenges arising from photoperiodism are taken into account during culture of the species with photoperiodic manipulation, the species' mortality will be decreased and the farmer's profits will increase.

AB  - We radiotracked Northern Waterthrushes (Parkesia noveboracensis) in four habitats in Puerto Rico during two winters (i.e., January-April) in 2003 and 2004 to determine the ecological determinants of diurnal space use and overwinter site-persistence in this species. The majority of birds (69%) were sedentary and used a contiguous area within a single habitat over the winter period. A smaller percentage (31%) initially used a contiguous area within a single habitat but then permanently moved from that area to another disjunct location (mean = 418 m). Most of these movements were out of the two habitats (dry forest and Black Mangrove) that became the driest from January to mid-March and into wetter mangrove areas. The primary determinants of movement probability were moisture and food availability on each bird's home range. Foraging areas of birds that eventually moved were drier and had lower food availability than areas used by site-persistent individuals. The sites that these itinerant birds moved to were wetter and had higher food availability, which suggests that individuals moved in response to changing resources. Our results (1) indicate that habitats used by this species differ in suitability and (2) support previous findings that turnover rates within a habitat could serve as an indicator of habitat quality. The ability to predict behavioral responses of individuals to habitat conditions that vary across space and time is essential for understanding individual and population responses to habitat loss and the effects of a changing climate in the New World tropics.

AB  - The growing concern for health-related problems deriving from pollutants leaching is driving national and international administrations to support the development of tools for evaluating the effects of alternate management scenarios and identifying vulnerable areas. Cropping systems models are powerful tools for evaluating leachates under different environmental, social, and management conditions. As percolating water is the transport vehicle for pollutants transport in soil, a reliable evaluation of water balance models is a fundamental prerequisite for investigating pesticides and nitrate fate. As specific approaches for the evaluation of multi-layer evolution of state variables are missing, we propose a fuzzy-based, integrated indicator (I(SWC): 0, best; 1, worst) for a comprehensive evaluation of soil water content (SWC) simulations. We aggregated error metrics with others quantifying the homogeneity of errors across different soil layers, the capability of models to reproduce complex dynamics function of both time and soil depth, and model complexity. We tested I(SWC) on a sample dataset where the models CropSyst and CERES-Wheat were used to simulate SWC for winter wheat systems. I(SWC) revealed that, in the explored conditions, the global assessment of the two models' performances allowed identification of CropSyst as the best (average I(SWC) = 0.441, with a value of 0.537 obtained by CERES-Wheat), although each model prevailed for some of the metrics. CropSyst presented the highest accuracy (average agreement module = 0.400), whereas CERES-Wheat's accuracy was slightly worse, although achieved with a simplified modelling approach (average Akaike Information Criterion = -230.44), thereby favouring large-area applicability. The non-univocal scores achieved by the models for the different metrics support the use of multi-metric evaluation approaches for quantifying the different aspects of water balance model performances.

AB  - Dermal spicules (or 'ossicles') of cultured sea cucumbers can be fluorescently marked with tetracycline and calcein for sea ranching and restocking but optimal immersion conditions are unknown Lethal and non-lethal effects. and the efficacy of marking spicules in juvenile sandfish (Holothuria scabra), were examined under different immersion conditions. Fluorescence brightness and the proportion of marked spicules generally increased with concentration and duration of immersion. Frequency of burial (an indicator of stress) in sandfish increased with both fluorochromes at concentrations above 50 mg L-1 Growth in the two weeks post-marking was unaffected at immersion concentrations of 50 and 100 mg L-1 compared to controls, but appeared inhibited by immersion in solutions of 200 and 400 mg L-1 of tetracycline or calcein. Sequential marking by tetracycline (yellow) and calcein (green), in either order, showed that calcein was deposited in a higher proportion of spicules. Three other fluorochromes with disparate colors, alizarin complexone, calcein blue and xylenol orange, also marked sandfish spicules and expanded the variety of dichromic combinations. Both tetracycline and calcein fluoresced more brightly when juveniles were marked at 26 or 30 degrees C than at 21 degrees C, and this low temperature appears also to reduce the proportion of spicules marked by tetracycline. Our findings show that seawater temperature should be regulated for ex situ immersion marking The behavioral and biological sensitivities of sandfish demand care in administering the fluorochromes. Fluorochrome immersion at 100 mg L-1 for 24 h at >= 26 degrees C provides a practical compromise between minimizing the fitness of released juveniles and ensuring the efficacy of the markers for studies on the growth and survival of sea cucumbers stocked in the wild.

AB  - While soil water composition has long been recognised as being related to soil type (characteristics of the horizons), the influence of structures resulting from agricultural activities (hedges. ditches, wheel ruts, etc) is still under discussion. This work was undertaken to show that a snapshot of spatial variability of the geochemical characteristics of soil water at the scale of a plot can improve our understanding of soil geochemistry in a farmland setting. We selected a 3 hectare hedged plot located on a hillside, limited by a stream and used as pasture where soils have developed in weathered gneiss. The water depth, electrical conductivity, major ions, temperature, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents dissolved oxygen content, fluorescence, alkalinity, Fe(2+), Mn(2+). NO(2)(-). Fe(III) and F(-) contents were measured in 62 auger holes randomly drilled on the site. Four sectors were identified in order to describe the distribution of the main geochemical parameters. Electrical conductivity and some major ions. especially sulphate, had larger concentrations near hedges where oxic conditions prevailed. These features were attributed to the impact of the linear anthropogenic network on the circulation of subsurface soil waters and evapo-transpiration and represent sector I. Dissolved Mn was an indicator of well channelled runoff subsurfaces facilitating the circulation of more highly reducing water (sector III), while DOC probably marked areas drained less well, with a prolonged contact time between soil solutions and organic topsoil horizons (sector II). The presence of dissolved Mn and Fe(II) indicates bottomland anoxic conditions (sector IV). It is concluded that a survey of the chemical composition of soil water may be a direct approach to show the influence of permanent structures on current soil properties and dynamics.

AB  - River floodplains are disturbance-dominated landscapes where floods are major regulators of both aquatic and nearby terrestrial communities. Amphibians are common inhabitants of floodplains and their life cycle depends on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. We focused on how different syntopic species of amphibians reacted to the environmental conditions of a large river floodplain. We examined life-history traits such as population age structure and growth in small- and large-bodied species of anurans and urodeles in the lower Danube River floodplain in Romania. Two newt species, Triturus vulgaris (small-bodied) and Triturus dobrogicus (large-bodied), and two anuran taxa, Bombina bombina (small-bodied) and the Rana esculenta complex (large-bodied), were included in the study. The ages of individuals estimated by skeletochronology varied from 3 to 5-6 years for T. vulgaris and from 2-3 to 4-5 years for T. dobrogicus. In the anurans, ages varied from 2 to 5 years in B. bombina and from 4 to 10 years in the R. esculenta complex. The numbers of breeding opportunities (i.e., the number of years the adults reproduce) are similar in both newt species (3), while growth rates and age at maturity differ between the large- and small-bodied species. In anurans, the number of breeding opportunities for the smallest species, B. bombina (4), is associated with a high growth rate and earlier maturation. In the larger R. esculenta complex, the higher number of breeding opportunities (7) is associated with a low growth rate and delayed maturation. The study of age distribution and associated parameters provides useful information on population life history. We discuss how age structure and growth of amphibian populations in large river floodplains can be used as indicators of environmental conditions.

AB  - We examined the effects of food concentration and temperature on nucleic acids and protein content of Calanus finmarchicus in order to evaluate the use of RNA as a growth rate index for this species. We measured RNA, DNA, and protein content of copepods reared from egg to adult stage in 5 combinations of food and temperature conditions (25 to 500 mug C l(-1), 4 to 12 degreesC). At 8 degreesC, DNA, RNA and protein content and RNA:DNA differed among food treatments during Stages N6 through to adult female. Protein:DNA ratios and RNA:protein ratios were significantly different among food levels for only 3 of the 8 stages examined. At excess food, DNA, RNA, and protein content and RNA:DNA ratios were inversely related to temperature for most stages from C1 onward, but the effect of temperature was relatively small over the range of temperatures investigated. The RNA:DNA and protein:DNA ratios increased with developmental stage whereas the RNA:protein ratio and growth rates (measured in terms of protein, nitrogen, DNA, and carbon content) declined with increasing stage. Although the relationship of RNA:DNA to growth rates was stage-specific, the two were related when standardized for temperature and developmental stage. RNA:protein ratios were directly related to growth rates regardless of stage, and the slope of the relationship increased with increasing temperature in a nonlinear fashion, Our results emphasize the importance of temperature and developmental stage for the relationship of growth rates to RNA concentration and RNA:DNA ratios. We propose 2 ways to estimate in situ growth rates of C, finmarchicus from RNA:DNA or RNA:protein ratios and environmental temperature.

AB  - In July 2012, we sampled ant species in remnant and restored prairie tracts in the Platte River Prairies, managed by The Nature Conservancy of Nebraska. The sampling period coincided with TNC's July 2012 "Week of Insects", an event which involved both general public and invited expert participation, and was an opportunity for both education and citizen science. In four days of sampling, even under severe drought conditions, we encountered 22 species of ants. Fifteen species were found in never-plowed, remnant prairies, and four species were found only in them. Thirteen species were found on restored (planted) prairies, with three of these found only in the planted prairies. Four species were exclusively associated with mature cottonwood trees near the site headquarters.

AB  - In the present study, synoptic data on the structure of macroinfauna and total organic content of sediment collected from different sources were analyzed to look for patterns of association consistent with conceptual model predictions and to identify total organic carbon (TOC) critical points corresponding to major shifts in the benthic fauna. The density and biomass peaked at moderate TOC (<20 mg/g) and reduced at TOC >30 mg/g. It is clear that sediment organic matter, depending on its quality and quantity, could act as a food source or as a stress source for the benthic community. Present study further demonstrated the general trend of modeled hypothesis with some variation in tropical condition.

AB  - The anthropogenic emission of boron to the environment has posed a serious risk to human and animal health due to its non-biodegradability and the resulting accumulation in the body. Bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) has been proven to be an economical and effective process to remove and recover boron from wastewater. In this work, we verified multiple process parameters to evaluate the efficiency of boron removal and recovery using intermittent and continuous BMED modes. Higher initial boron concentrations appeared to reduce the boron processing rate, but this reduction may be ameliorated by increasing current density. Similarly, higher initial pH was observed to retard the removal rate of boron with increasing mass transfer rate. When solution pH was controlled from 9.5 to 10.5 and the current density was 6.36 A/m(2) under maximum allowable voltage of 12 V, boron removal and recovery efficiencies were 98.6% and 86.5%, respectively. During the pH-control process, current variation pattern indicated that current density was associated with initial boron concentrations in salt apartment. When the current variation pattern was applied to a five-cycle sequential feed-batch BMED process, it accurately reflected the timing of complete boron removal and recovery on a batch fill-and-draw process. The overall boron removal and recovery efficiencies were 98.53% and 81.2%, respectively, with an energy consumption of 31.5 Wh/g. Under these conditions, the final boron concentrations in effluent were less than 10 mg/L, as required by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA). Overall, BMED is a cost-effective treatment process for boron-containing wastewater. The proposed process indicator reflecting sequential BMED process progression based on process information will further elucidate the automatic process control in industrial applications.

AB  - Phasing of combustion metrics close to the optimum values across operation range is necessary to avail benefits of reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engines. Parameters like start of combustion occurrence crank angle (CA) (theta(soc)), occurrence of burn rate fraction reaching 50% (theta(50)), mean effective pressure from indicator diagram (IMEP), etc. are described as combustion metrics. These metrics act as markers for the macroscopic state of combustion. Control of these metrics in RCCI engine is relatively complex due to the nature of ignition. As direct combustion control is challenging, alternative methods like combustion physics-derived models are a subject of research interest. In this work, a composite predictive model was proposed by integrating trained random forest (RF) machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to combustion physics-derived modified Livengood-Wu integral, parametrized double-Wiebe function, autoignition front propagation speed-based correlations, and residual gas fraction model. The RF machine learning established a correlative relationship between physics-based model coefficients and engine operating condition. The ANN developed a similar correlation between residual gas fraction parameters and engine operating condition. The composite model was deployed for the predictions of theta(soc), theta(50), and IMEP as RCCI engine combustion metrics. Experimental validation showed an error standard deviation (sigma(68.3,err)) of 0.67 degrees CA, 1.19 degrees CA, 0.223 bar and symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 6.92%, 7.87%, and 4.01% for the predictions of theta(soc), theta(50), and IMEP, respectively, on cycle to cycle basis. Wide range applicability, lesser experiments for model calibration, low computational costs, and utility for control applications were the benefits of the proposed predictive model.

AB  - The use of bioindicator species is a widely applied approach to evaluate ecological conditions, and several indices have been designed for this purpose. To assess the impact of pollution, especially in sediments, a pollution-sensitive index based on nematodes, one of the most abundant and species-rich groups of metazoa, was developed. The NemaSPEAR[%] index in its original form relies on the morphological inspection of nematode species. The application of a morphologically based NemaSPEAR [%] at the genus-level was previously validated. The present study evaluated a NemaSPEAR[%] index based on metabarcoding of nematode communities and tested the potential of fragments from the 28S rDNA, 18S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes. In general, molecular-based results tended to show a poorer condition than morphology-based results for the investigated sites. At the genus level, NemaSPEAR[%] values based on morphological data strongly correlated with those based on molecular data for both the 28S rDNA and the 18S rDNA gene fragments (R-2 = 0.86 and R-2 = 0.74, respectively). Within the dominant genera ( > 3%) identified by morphology, 68% were detected by at least one of the two ribosomal markers. At the species level, however, concordance was less pronounced, as there were several deviations of the molecular from the morphological data. These differences could mostly be attributed to shortcomings in the reference database used in the molecular-based assignments. Our pilot study shows that a molecularly based, genus-level NemaSPEAR[%] can be successfully applied to evaluate polluted sediment. Future studies need to validate this approach further, e.g. with bulk extractions of whole meiofaunal communities in order to circumvent time-consuming nematode isolation. Further database curation with abundant NemaSPEAR[%] species will also increase the applicability of this approach.

AB  - Coastal and shelf seas display strong variability in the horizontal and vertical distributions of chlorophyll a (CHL). Detailed data are required to identify the processes that drive the observed spatio-temporal dynamics. A high-resolution, vertically resolved transect data set for biogeochemical and physical properties was collected in the inner German Bight (GB) from 2009 to 2011 on a seasonal basis. We used fluorescence as an indicator for phytoplankton biomass via the CHL concentrations. We classified profiles into different types by evaluating the heterogeneity of CHL vertical distribution and identifying vertical location (upper mixed layer, subsurface layer, bottom mixed layer of water column) of high CHL concentration in each profile. We analyzed the spatio-temporal occurrences of the different CHL vertical distribution types in the context of the hydrodynamic environment. More than half (68.7%) of all profiles showed vertically homogeneous CHL distributions. A smaller subset (3.2%) of all profiles showed subsurface CHL maximum layers (SCMLs) in the vicinity of the pycnocline, co-varying with strongly stratified conditions in deeper water. Profiles with highest concentration of CHL in the upper part of the water column (HCU) were observed in 11.5% of all profiles. Profiles with highest concentrations of CHL in the lower part of the water column (HCL) comprised 16.6% of all profiles. HCL profiles were extensively observed during the decay phase of the spring bloom and were associated with resuspension and erosion from pre-existing SCMLs, which could be driven by tide; photosynthetic activity below the pycnocline could also contribute. Under moderate weather conditions, tidal currents were the main driver of re suspension. This study highlighted the occurrence of SCMLs and HCL patterns in vertical CHL profiles in shallow shelf seas, such as the GB.

AB  - The current study was performed with an aim to investigate the performance of ecological revetments implemented on the bank of the Cuatien River in Vinh city, Vietnam. Based on the ecological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the Cuatien River, the gabion and riprap models were introduced to investigate the effect of ecological revetment on the slope stability and ecological restoration characteristics. The effect of prevailing climatic indicators, such as temperature, precipitation, sunlight hours, and humidity were investigated to ascertain the characteristics of weather conditions on the subtropical area. On the surface soil layer of the gabion and riprap, the nutrient indicators of soil organic matter (SOM) and available nitrogen (AN) increased in the spring, summer, and winter, but decreased in autumn, and available phosphorus (AP) did not show an obvious change in the four seasons. The biomass growth rate of Vetiver grass on the gabion and riprap revetments was found to be the highest during the summer, at 15.11 and 17.32 g/month, respectively. The root system of Vetiver and other native plants could increase the cohesion of soil. After 6 and 12 months, the shear strength of the soil behind the gabion revetment increased by 59.6% and 162.9%, while the shear strength of the soil under the riprap also increased by 115.6% and 239.1%, respectively. The results also indicated that the gabion and riprap revetments could improve the river water purification effect and increase the ecological diversity in the region. In the current study, 26 floral and 9 faunal species were detected in the riprap revetment, whereas 14 floral and 5 faunal species were detected in the gabion revetment, respectively. Through high sequencing technology, the number of bacterial species in the present study was found to be 198, 332, and 351 in the water, gabion, and riprap samples, respectively.

AB  - Bearing-supported shafts are widely used in various machines. Due to harsh working environments, bearing performance degrades over time. To prevent unexpected bearing failures and accidents, bearing performance degradation assessment becomes an emerging topic in recent years. Bearing performance degradation assessment aims to evaluate the current health condition of a bearing through a bearing health indicator. In the past years, many signal processing and data mining based methods were proposed to construct bearing health indicators. However, the upper and lower bounds of these bearing health indicators were not theoretically calculated and they strongly depended on historical bearing data including normal and failure data. Besides, most health indicators are dimensional, which connotes that these health indicators are prone to be affected by varying operating conditions, such as varying speeds and loads. In this paper, based on the principle of squared envelope analysis, we focus on theoretical investigation of bearing performance degradation assessment in the case of additive Gaussian noises, including distribution establishment of squared envelope, construction of a generalized dimensionless bearing health indicator, and mathematical calculation of the upper and lower bounds of the generalized dimensionless bearing health indicator. Then, analyses of simulated and real bearing run to failure data are used as two case studies to illustrate how the generalized dimensionless health indicator works and demonstrate its effectiveness in bearing performance degradation assessment. Results show that squared envelope follows a noncentral chi-square distribution and the upper and lower bounds of the generalized dimensionless health indicator can be mathematically established. Moreover, the generalized dimensionless health indicator is sensitive to an incipient bearing defect in the process of bearing performance degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The global mean sea level is rising as a result of climate change and is likely to affect millions of people. It is essential to understand and quantify regional relative sea-level variability to be able to predict future changes. Proxy evidence is necessary for extending our understanding of past sea-level changes beyond the industrial era, and salt-marsh foraminifera have become an important tool for reconstructing late Holocene sea-level changes. In South Africa, little is known regarding the distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera and their use as sea-level indicators, thereby limiting their application in sea-level research. This study therefore describes the distribution of living and dead surface foraminifera from two study sites along the SE South African coastline. The full surface dataset has been compiled from 139 samples that are used to describe the contemporary distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera. Cluster analysis is used to define four biozones; high marsh, middle marsh, low marsh, and mudflats. In the high marsh, where environmental conditions reach the survival threshold, a greater abundance of agglutinated foraminifera occurs. In the low-marsh zone, where subaerial exposure is restricted and environmental conditions are usually stable, a greater diversity of calcareous species occurs. The tidal mudflats have the highest diversity of calcareous assemblages with some agglutinated taxa present. Distributions of living foraminiferal populations are similar to the population distributions of dead foraminifera at both sites in the low-marsh and mudflat zones. In the high-marsh zones, however, the living-to-dead ratio and distributions are different, which could be a result of different influences of environmental variables along with seasonal variations. This study provides insights into foraminiferal distributions along the SE coastline of South Africa, which will be useful for interpreting late Holocene sea-level changes.

AB  - Anthelmintic resistance of gastrointestinal nematodes in small ruminants, but also in cattle and horses, is now found worldwide. The reason for increasing anthelmintic resistance is, in particular, the extensive use of all the anthelmintic agents available on the market. A non targeted use leads to the selection of naturally occurring resistance genes within parasite populations. The most practical method for evaluating the efficacy of an anthelmintic is the fecal egg-count reduction test. To reduce the rate of anthelmintic resistance development, the available active substances must be applied less and in a targeted manner. When applying targeted (selective) treatment, part of the herd is left untreated. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the animals that require treatment for health or economic reasons. To decide on anthelmintic treatment, findings can be collected from single animals or from a group of animals in a herd. To determine which groups of animals are to be treated within a herd (targeted treatment), pooled fecal samples (cattle and small ruminants), serum pepsinogen concentration (cattle), or Ostertagia ostertagi antibodies in the bulk milk (cattle) can be analyzed. For individual animal (targeted selective) treatment, criteria including fecal egg count (cattle and small ruminants), conjuctival color as an indicator for infection with Haemonchus contortus (FAMACHA, small ruminants), body condition in adult animals (small ruminants), weight gain in juvenile animals (cattle and small ruminants), and the consistency of the feces (small ruminants) are used. These decision criteria can also be combined to enhance the informative value. Furthermore, an efficacy test of the anthelmintics used should be performed regularly at the beginning of the pasture season. During the pasture season, a low infection pressure should be maintained by pasture management strategies. The goal of sustainable parasite management is the reduction of anthelmintic treatment while maintaining the productivity and health of the animals and thus a longer effectiveness of the available drugs.

AB  - Alkaline soils, characterized by high pH, are representative of degraded regions throughout the world. Studying germination in relation to alkalinity can contribute to understanding how species cope with such conditions. Although the effects of pH have been widely studied, it is unknown whether germination response to pH gradients created with buffer solutions is representative of the conditions experienced in alkaline soils. Our aims were to (1) determine if high pH gives an accurate assessment of the effects of alkaline soils on germination, and (2) identify the inhibitory factors for germination in alkaline soils.
   Using Leymus chinensis seeds, germination was tested over a gradient of pH solutions prepared using Tris (50 mM and 100 mM) and H2O buffers and eight germination media prepared from non-alkaline and alkaline soils with different pH and electrical conductivities (EC). Additionally, solutions of 10-100 mM NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 were used to determine the main ions inhibiting seed germination.
   H2O-buffered pH had no effect on seed germination, and seed germination was much lower at all pH levels in 50 mM Tris-HCl solutions (pH 7.0-10.35) than in the H2O control (pH 7.05). No seeds germinated in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffers irrespective of the pH. In alkaline germination media (pH 10.04-10.61), high germination was obtained only at low EC. The rank order of the inhibitory effect of salts was Na2CO3 > NaHCO3 > NaCl > Na2SO4.
   Buffer solutions used to simulate alkaline environments did not provide a reliable indicator of the effects of alkaline soils on seed germination. High pH of alkaline soil had no negative effects, and results suggest that salt composition and concentration, especially CO3 (2-) and HCO3 (-), are key inhibitors.

AB  - The paper documents 41 European case histories that describe the seismogenic response of crystalline and sedimentary rocks to fluid injection. It is part of an on-going study to identify factors that have a bearing on the seismic hazard associated with fluid injection. The data generally support the view that injection in sedimentary rocks tends to be less seismogenic than in crystalline rocks. In both cases, the presence of faults near the wells that allow pressures to penetrate significant distances vertically and laterally can be expected to increase the risk of producing felt events. All cases of injection into crystalline rocks produce seismic events, albeit usually of non-damaging magnitudes, and all crystalline rock masses were found to be critically stressed, regardless of the strength of their seismogenic responses to injection. Thus, these data suggest that criticality of stress, whilst a necessary condition for producing earthquakes that would disturb (or be felt by) the local population, is not a sufficient condition. The data considered here are not fully consistent with the concept that injection into deeper crystalline formations tends to produce larger magnitude events. The data are too few to evaluate the combined effect of depth and injected fluid volume on the size of the largest events. Injection at sites with low natural seismicity, defined by the expectation that the local peak ground acceleration has less than a 10% chance of exceeding 0.07 g in 50 years, has not produced felt events. Although the database is limited, this suggests that low natural seismicity, corresponding to hazard levels at or below 0.07 g, may be a useful indicator of a low propensity for fluid injection to produce felt or damaging events. However, higher values do not necessarily imply a high propensity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies combining sedimentological and biological evidence to reconstruct Holocene climate beyond the major changes, and especially seasonality, are rare in Europe, and are nearly completely absent in Germany. The present study tries to reconstruct changes of seasonality from evidence of annual algal successions within the framework of well-established pollen zonation and C-14-AMS dates from terrestrial plants. Laminated Holocene sediments in Lake Jues (10 degrees 20.7' E, 51 degrees 39.3' N, 241 m a.s.l.), located at the SW margin of the Harz Mountains, central Germany, were studied for sediment characteristics, pollen, diatoms and coccal green algae. An age model is based on 21 calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plants. The sedimentary record covers the entire Holocene period. Trophic status and circulation/stagnation patterns of the lake were inferred from algal assemblages, the subannual structure of varves and the physico-chemical properties of the sediment. During the Holocene, mixing conditions alternated between di-, oligo- and meromictic depending on length and variability of spring and fall periods, and the stability of winter and summer weather. The trophic state was controlled by nutrient input, circulation patterns and the temperature-dependent rates of organic production and mineralization. Climate shifts, mainly in phase with those recorded from other European regions, are inferred from changing limnological conditions and terrestrial vegetation. Significant changes occurred at 11,600 cal. yr. BP (Preboreal warming), between 10,600 and 10,100 cal. yr. BP (Boreal cooling), and between 8,400 and 4,550 cal. yr. BP (warm and dry interval of the Atlantic). Since 4,550 cal. yr. BP the climate became gradually cooler, wetter and more oceanic. This trend was interrupted by warmer and dryer phases between 3,440 and 2,850 cal. yr. BP and, likely, between 2,500 and 2,250 cal. yr. BP.

AB  - Demonstration of natural attenuation of xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) in landfill leachate plumes is a difficult task and still an emerging discipline within groundwater remediation. One of the early studies was made at the Vejen Landfill in Denmark in the late 1980s, which suggested that natural attenuation of XOCs took place under strongly anaerobic conditions within the first 150 m of the leachate plume. This paper reports on a revisit to the same plume 10 years later. Within the strongly anaerobic part of the plume, 49 groundwater samples were characterized with respect to redox-sensitive species and XOCs. The analytical procedures have been developed further and more compounds and lower detection limits were observed this time. In addition, the samples were screened for degradation intermediates and for toxicity. The plume showed fairly stationary features over the 10-year period except that the XOC level as well as the level of chloride and nonvolatile organic carbon (NVOC) in the plume had decreased somewhat. Most of the compounds studied were subject to degradation in addition to dilution. Exceptions were benzene, the herbicide Mecoprop (MCPP), and NVOC. In the early study, NVOC seemed to degrade in the first part of the plume, but this was no longer the case. Benzyl succinic acid (BSA) was for the first time identified in a leachate plume as a direct indicator, and as the only intermediate of toluene degradation. Toxicity measurements on solid phase-extracted (SPE) samples revealed that toxic compounds not analytically identified were still present in the plume, suggesting that toxicity measurements could be helpful in assessing natural attenuation in leachate plumes.

AB  - Metasedimentary rocks generally contain carbonaceous material ( CM) deriving from the evolution of organic matter originally present in the host sedimentary rock. During metamorphic processes, this organic matter is progressively transformed into graphite s.s. and the degree of organisation of CM is known as a reliable indicator of metamorphic grade. In this study, the degree of organisation of CM was systematically characterised by Raman microspectroscopy across several Mesozoic and Cenozoic reference metamorphic belts. This degree of organisation, including within-sample heterogeneity, was quantified by the relative area of the defect band (R2 ratio). The results from the Schistes Lustres (Western Alps) and Sanbagawa (Japan) cross-sections show that (1) even through simple visual inspection, changes in the CM Raman spectrum appear sensitive to variations of metamorphic grade, (2) there is an excellent agreement between the R2 values calculated for the two sections when considering samples with an equivalent metamorphic grade, and (3) the evolution of the R2 ratio with metamorphic grade is controlled by temperature (T). Along the Tinos cross-section (Greece), which is characterised by a strong gradient of greenschist facies overprint on eclogite facies rocks, the R2 ratio is nearly constant. Consequently, the degree of organisation of CM is not affected by the retrogression and records peak metamorphic conditions. More generally, analysis of 54 samples representative of high-temperature, low-pressure to high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic gradients shows that there is a linear correlation between the R2 ratio and the peak temperature [T(degreesC) = -445 R2 + 641], whatever the metamorphic gradient and, probably, the organic precursor. The Raman spectrum of CM can therefore be used as a geothermometer of the maximum temperature conditions reached during regional metamorphism. Temperature can be estimated to +/-50degreesC in the range 330-650degreesC. A few technical indications are given for optimal application.

AB  - Nine yearling crossbred beef heifers, Bos taurus L., were used to examine physiological responses to horn fly, Haematobia irritans (L.), infestation. Heifers were stanchioned indoors in individual environmentally controlled rooms. On day 0, each animal received 0, 500, or 1,000 horn flies. Fly numbers were adjusted daily to maintain an appropriate infestation for each heifer. Feed intake, respiration rate, and rectal temperature was recorded daily. In addition, blood samples were collected from each animal on days 0, 12, and 33 for serum constituent analysis. To monitor metabolic hormone status, intensive blood samples were also collected hourly for 6 h on days 0, 12, and 33. Throughout the period of treatment, feed intake values were similar among treatments resulting in comparable body weight at the end of the trial. Respiration rates on each day were similar among groups. Rectal temperature was also unaffected by horn fly infestations. Serum electrolyte analysis revealed that neither Na, K, Cl, Ca, P, nor Fe differed among treatments. Likewise, HCO3/CO2, ratio, anion gap, and serum osmolality did not differ among treatment groups. Major indicators of nutrient status (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, urea N, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, globulin) and insulin, growth hormone, and prolactin were also unaffected. Serum bilirubin and enzyme (alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, lactic dehydrogenase, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase) concentrations were similar in control heifers and those infested with horn flies. Results of this trial indicate that horn fly infestations up to 1,000 flies per animal had little adverse physiological influence on the physiology of beef heifers housed under laboratory conditions in which they were well fed and not exposed to external environmental conditions. Data suggest that adverse effects on production traits of cattle due to horn flies are not likely to result in alteration of constituents measured in chemistry or hormone profiles.

AB  - Predictive, bioassay, and field methods were compared with regard to assessing conditions and risks to terrestrial biota at a Superfund site contaminated with pesticides.  Research indicated that predictive methods could result in large uncertainties, especially when attempting to estimate food chain transfer from soil to higher trophic levels (birds and mammals).  Of the examined predictive methods, the soil-to-earthworm model yielded results that agreed best with field observations and literature values.  Laboratory and in-field bioassays on soils provided good information on the potential toxicity of soils and the potential for bioaccumulation.  In-field bioassay tests with earthworms were useful for defining the spatial distribution of toxic soils at the site as well as for indicating potential bioaccumulation in invertebrates.  An attractive feature of in-field bioassays is that samples do not have to be removed from the field and assessments can begin to be made in the field.  The importance of performing reality checks by conducting field studies was clearly demonstrated in our study with regard to the soil invertebrate community as well as birds and mammals.  The main advantage of the field studies is that they provide direct information on conditions and thus aid in the interpretation or application of laboratory data.  Difficulties were encountered in the conduct of population studies of the birds and mammals.  Therefore, although site surveys of birds and mammals provide gross indications as to the presence and diversity of animals, it is probably more useful to rely on measures of residues and biomarkers to assess potential exposures and the possibility of subtle effects.  Overall, it appears that ecological risk assessments at Superfund sites are best conducted by using a mix of predictive, laboratory, and field methods.

AB  - The analysis of the instrumentally observed variations in the error of determining coordinates by the GPS navigation satellite system, performed at the Mikhnevo Geophysical Observatory of Sadovsky Institute of Geosphere Dynamics of Russian Academy of Sciences, during periods of magnetic storms, is carried out. Using a sample of 50 events that occurred in the period 2016-2019, it is shown that magnetic storms (geomagnetic activity index Kp >= 5) cause a noticeable increase in the GPS positioning error. The data obtained suggests that positioning error can be used as an indicator of the disturbed state of the ionosphere and atmosphere during magnetic storms, as well as a parameter that characterizes the degree of disturbance of the environment and the conditions for the propagation of GPS signals.

TI  - EFFECTS OF LOW-OXYGEN ENVIRONMENTS IN THE LIGHT FADING OF SIX DYES PRESENT IN THE AUTOCHROME COLOR SCREEN
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Because the dyes present in the autochrome color screen are extremely sensitive to light, autochromes are commonly not displayed. The authors investigated the effectiveness of low-oxygen environments in delaying the fading of dyes used in the autochrome process-Tartrazine, Erythrosine B, Rose Bengal, Patent Blue, Crystal Violet, and Flexo Blue. Samples of these colorants were subjected to accelerated light fading in both atmospheric and near-anoxic conditions. The low-oxygen environment was achieved by purging a glass tube with argon gas prior to sealing, maintained with oxygen scavengers, and monitored with indicators capable of detecting oxygen levels above 0.1%. Significant increases in color stability of the dyes were observed in this environment, but a complete halt to the fading process was not achieved.

AB  - Formaldehyde's, as the irritant and active gas in atmosphere, pollution assessment by perception of people is significative. Although related study is seldom reported, it is necessary to improve the general contamination evaluation based on Weber-Fischna law and combine with human's real feeling. Therefore, based on the law, Weber exponents were counted by a convenient optimal calculation, and the results could accurately embody the different standard range of formaldehyde concentration. In addition, by the human smell perception experiment, it was firstly found that the score assessment could also express the pollution condition more practically. According to the scores, expanding exponents could cause the assessment more clearly and closer to human real smell perception.

AB  - Drawing on data from recent media discourse about corporate governance in Germany, this article primarily seeks to explore the changing nature of narratives in the mass media about both organizations and their managers. Based on Greimas' narrative approach and his adaptation of Propp's morphology of the folktale, the article reconstructs two different narratives of corporate governance and the transformation process between them. To improve our understanding of narrative change, we extend the Greimasian approach in two respects. First, we highlight the two-way relationship between narrative change and the wider economic context. Second, we point to structural conditions of the narrative(s) in relation to narrative change and identify typical semantic figures as indicators of change.

AB  - Exposure and effect assessment including risk characterisation of enzymes used in household detergents were conducted. Predicted environmental concentrations were calculated by use of traditional methods and detailed transport and fate modelling. Predicted no effect concentrations were derived from the results of ecotoxicological studies conducted with subtilisin and other available information on the acute and chronic aquatic toxicity. Risk characterisation ratios were defined as the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration and the predicted no effect concentration. Risk characterisation ratios were calculated for fresh and marine water and were found to be between 0.0002 and 0.06, i.e. all well below 1. This shows that under the given conditions, the use of enzymes in household detergents does not present a risk to the aquatic environment.

AB  - Refrigerants of the conventional cooling systems contribute to global warming and ozone depletion significantly, therefore it is necessary to develop new cooling systems that use renewable energy resources and waste heat to perform the cooling function with eco-friendly working fluids. To address this, the present study introduces and analyzes a novel regenerative thermo-mechanical refrigeration system that can be powered by renewable heat sources (solar, geothermal, or waste heat). The system consists of a novel expander-compressor unit (ECU) integrated with a vapor-compression refrigeration system. The integrated system operates at the higher-performance supercritical conditions of the working fluids as opposed to the lower-performance subcritical conditions. The performance of the system is evaluated based on several indicators including the power loop efficiency, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the cooling loop, and the expander-compressor diameters. Several working fluids were selected and compared for their suitability based on their performance and environmental effects. It was found that for heat source temperature below 100 degrees C, adding the regenerator to the system has no benefit. However, the regenerator increases the power efficiency by about 1% for a heat source temperature above 130 degrees C. This was achieved with a very small size regenerator (D-r = 6.5 mm, L-r = 142 mm). Results show that there is a tradeoff between high-performance fluids and their environmental effects. Using R32 as a working fluid at heat source temperature T-h = 150 degrees C and cold temperature T-c1 = 40 degrees C, the system produces a cooling capacity of 1 kW with power efficiency of 10.23%, expander diameter of 53.12 mm, and compressor diameter of 75.4 mm.

AB  - Background Understanding the impacts of past and contemporary climate change on biodiversity is critical for effective conservation. Amphibians have weak dispersal abilities, putting them at risk of habitat fragmentation and loss. Both climate change and anthropogenic disturbances exacerbate these risks, increasing the likelihood of additional amphibian extinctions in the near future. The giant spiny frog (Quasipaa spinosa), an endemic species to East Asia, has faced a dramatic population decline over the last few decades. Using the giant spiny frog as an indicator to explore how past and future climate changes affect landscape connectivity, we characterized the shifts in the suitable habitat and habitat connectivity of the frog. Results We found a clear northward shift and a reduction in the extent of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum for giant spiny frogs; since that time, there has been an expansion of the available habitat. Our modelling showed that "overwarm" climatic conditions would most likely cause a decrease in the available habitat and an increase in the magnitude of population fragmentation in the future. We found that the habitat connectivity of the studied frogs will decrease by 50-75% under future climate change. Our results strengthen the notion that the mountains in southern China and the Sino-Vietnamese transboundary regions can act as critical refugia and priority areas of conservation planning going forward. Conclusions Given that amphibians are highly sensitive to environmental changes, our findings highlight that the responses of habitat suitability and connectivity to climate change can be critical considerations in future conservation measures for species with weak dispersal abilities and should not be neglected, as they all too often are.

AB  - The impact of freeze-thaw cycling on freshly exposed loess is a major concern in design and construction of embankments or earth dams in the Loess Plateau in China. Due to complex nature of loess as compared with the conventional soils such as sand or clay, characterizing the strength of loess to account for this impact is challenging, in particular in the field conditions. In previous research a systematic approach in this regard is still lacking. This paper presents an investigation into the problem through well-controlled experiments using a pair of bender/extender elements. The shear wave (S-wave) velocities and the compression wave (P-wave) velocities were both measured on loess specimens subjected to freeze-thaw cycling. Under otherwise similar conditions, the unconfined compression tests were carried out to evaluate the soil strength of original loess and those with different fractions of add-in quartz sands. Several influence factors including the numbers of freeze and thaw cycles, the sand content and the water content were analyzed in a collective manner to characterize the changes of the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of loess and the associated wave velocities. It was found that as the number of freeze-thaw cycles increases, the wave velocities of loess decrease. A clear difference in the magnitude of wave velocity was observed in the original loess samples due to the freeze-thaw cycling, whereas the discrepancies were less evident for the loess with higher sand contents. Based on the test results, exponential relationships were established respectively for the S wave and P wave velocities against the UCS values of the tested materials. Discussions were highlighted on whether the wave velocity can be used as an indicator to evaluate the UCS value of loess.

AB  - Meteorological extreme events have a major impact on water resources, economic development, and ecosystem health. In this study, maximum precipitation and maximum temperature indices were derived for Isfahan province, in central Iran, over the historical (1992-2017) and future (2020-2100) periods. Precipitation and maximum temperature data from the REMO model under RCP4.5 scenario were used to investigate changes in extreme values over the future period. The results showed that extreme precipitation in the historical and future periods has respectively a decreasing and increasing trend. Based on the extreme indices, temperature in the study area has a significant increasing trend in the baseline and future period. Various combinations of extreme precipitation indicators were created for joint modeling by copula theory. Copula modeling for the three weather stations for which REMO had satisfactory performance in simulating extremes over the historic period showed that the average return period of extreme precipitation combinations will be reduced in the future period compared to the historical period at Daran and Shahreza, while the average return period of combinations will have both increasing and decreasing trends at Naeen.
   Recommendations for Resource Managers
   Knowing information about the probability of occurrence of extreme precipitation with a certain value that exceeds a certain threshold will help planning for water resource systems under drought conditions and future increasing temperature.
   The joint return period of extreme precipitation can help to know the return period of extreme events such as floods and droughts.
   The findings of this study are important to assess the prediction of climate extreme. Also, these results can be useful to provide the appropriate strategies for water resources managers in drought conditions under future increasing temperature.

AB  - Objective: The performance, health, and behaviour of cattle can be strongly affected by climate. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of heat stress on blood parameters, blood proteins (haptoglobin [Hp]; heat shock protein 70 [HSP70]), rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR) and rumination time in Korean native beef calves.
   Methods: Thirty-two Korean native beef calves were randomly assigned to 8 groups with 4 animals per group. They were kept in environmental condition with temperature-humidity index (THI) ranging from 70.01 to 87.72 in temperature-humidity controlled chamber for 7 days.
   Results: Their HR, RT, and serum cortisol and HSP70 levels were increased (p<0.05) in high THI compared to those at low THI. But, serum Hp level was decreased (p<0.05) in high THI compared to these at low THI. In addition, HR, RT, serum cortisol and HSP70 were positively correlated with THI (R-2 = 0.8368, p<0.01; R-2 = 0.6162, p<0.01; R-2 = 0.581, p<0.01; R-2 = 0.2241, p = 0.0062, respectively). There was also positive association between HR and cortisol (R-2 = 0.4697, p<0.01). Similarly, RT and cortisol were positively associated (R-2 = 0.4581, p<0.01). But, THI and HR were negatively correlated with Hp (R-2 = 0.2157, p = 0.02; R-2 = 0.3362, p = 0.003). Hematology and metabolites results were different among treatment groups. Standing position was higher (p<0.05) in the high THI group compared to that in the low THI group.
   Conclusion: Based on these results, it can be concluded that HR, RT, blood parameters (Cortisol, HSP70, Hp) and standing position are closely associated with heat stress. These parameters can be consolidated to develop THI chart for Korean native beef calves.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chla) is an important indicator of water quality and eutrophication status. Monitoring Chla concentration (C-Chla ) and understanding the interactions between C-Chla and related environmental factors (hydrological and meteorological conditions, nutrients enrichment, etc.) are necessary for assessing and managing water quality and eutrophication. An acceptable Landsat 8 OLI-based empirical algorithm for C-Chla has been developed and validated, with a mean absolute percentage error of 14.05% and a root mean square error of 1.10 mu g L-1. A time series of remotely estimated C-Chla was developed from 2013 to 2015 and examined the relationship of C (Chla) to inflow rate, rainfall, temperature, and sunshine duration. Spatially, C (Chla) values in the riverine zone were higher than in the transition and lacustrine zones. Temporally, mean C-Chla value were ranked as spring > summer > autumn > winter. A significant positive correlation [Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = 0.88, p < 0.001] was observed between the inflow rate and mean C-Chla in the northwest segment of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir. However, no significant relation was observed between mean C-Chla and meteorological conditions. Mean (+/- standard deviation) value for the ratio of total nitrogen concentration to total phosphorus concentration in our in situ dataset is 75.75 +/- 55.72. This result supports that phosphorus is the restrictive factor to algal growth in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. In addition, the response of nutrients to Chla has spatial variabilities. Current results show the potential of Landsat 8 OLI data for estimating Chla in slight turbid reservoir and indicate that external pollution loading is an important driving force for the Chla spatiotemporal variability.

AB  - Through time-series sampling during the whole of 2009, phytoplankton patterns and prediction models were built up with a self-organizing map (SOM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) within the downstream region of a large subtropical river, the Pearl River (China). The excessive nutrient conditions resulted in a diatom dominant phytoplankton community. While green algae contributed more only in species diversity, as they were mainly dependent on inoculations from external resources, and their abundance remained low under fast and turbid flow conditions. The time periods of phytoplankton samples were classified into four clusters using a self-organizing map (SOM) based on species similarities. These clusters were clearly different with respect to species richness, biomass and indicators. The LDA predicting model indicated that these clusters of species assemblages could easily be differentiated by physical factors such as water temperature, discharge and precipitation. As for nutrients, only phosphate could have an occasional impact on phytoplankton assemblages. By using the environmental variables, the global score for predicting the assemblages was 64.2 %, with the predicting performance rates for clusters I, Ha, IIb1 and IIb2 at 50, 48, 62 and 74%, respectively. Cluster I benefited from a combination of higher temperatures and low discharge, and had the highest species richness and biomass. Cluster IIb1 benefited from high discharge and diverse species inoculations, but interruptions in increases of biomass. Cluster IIb2 showed that low temperatures resulted in both low species richness and biomass. Cluster Ha, characterized by phosphate, indicated that phytoplankton assemblages were occasionally P-limited in the studied section. In conclusion, the annual patterns of the downstream phytoplankton assemblages in the Pearl River were mainly regulated by physical factors but occasionally limited by nutrients.

AB  - Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.), an important turfgrass as well as a grazing species, was used as a case study for the threshold model in this paper. The growth of this grass in terms of root and shoot lengths and general quality (i.e., color) were evaluated under various levels (full, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 N) of nutrients in the culture medium. The concept of a simplified threshold model was described and applied and the conclusions were drawn on the bases of the results of this study. Bermudagrass shoot length and the grass general quality (i.e., color) significantly decreased at lower (1/8 and 1/16 N) nutrient levels. However, root length was stimulated at lower (1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 N) nutrient levels. The values of 1/8 and 1/16 N are significant, because the shoot length at the 1/8 N is reversible and this can be considered the conservation zone in the threshold model. However, the 1/16 N is irreversible or as an indicator of unrecoverable period of life span for bermudagrass which is equal to the critical threshold value. This can be a management guide for bermudagrass production for grazing purposes. Root length was stimulated at lower (1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 N) nutrient levels. Since the bermudagrass roots were not adversely affected by the stress and were somehow stimulated, this grass can be used for reclamation purposes. The grass general quality followed the same pattern as the shoot length, decreased only at the lower levels of nutrients (1/8, and 1/16 N). These three features of bermudagrass are important indicators for the life cycle of this species. These indicators would help the manager for an early warning phase between "healthy" and "unhealthy" states of this grass for production or grazing purposes.

AB  - Riparian monitoring is a key aspect of sustainable resource management and is mandated by US federal law for federal land management agencies. However, it is an endeavor hampered by rising manpower costs and time-consuming travel and methods. These limitations tend to reduce sampling intensity per reach of stream and limit monitoring to the larger waterways of management units-limitations that reduce the accuracy of inferences derived from resulting data with consequential reductions in the effectiveness of landscape-level resource management. We tested the utility of low-altitude, high-resolution, intermittent aerial digital imagery for relatively inexpensive, high-intensity sampling in a watershed inhabited by the Lahonton Cutthroat trout, a species listed as threatened under provisions of the US Endangered Species Act. Measurements gleaned from the aerial imagery included late-summer open water width, number and location of late-summer dry channels, widths of riparian areas and willow coverage. All measurements were georeferenced to allow spatial data display. Riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) was assessed from the imagery by a USDI, Bureau of Land Management team. These assessments were compared to similar on-the-ground assessments made during the preceding year. PFC assessments from aerial photography were made using an average 4 staff hours per stream compared to an estimated 36 staff hours per stream for ground PFC assessments. The two assessment methods yielded roughly comparable results. We conclude that riparian-condition assessments from 2-cm GSD digital aerial imagery allowed increased sample intensity (and thus increased inference accuracy) and that it did so in our study at a cost less than half that of conventional ground-based methods. We recommend the acquisition and analysis of 2-cm GSD digital aerial imagery be further trialed for its utility and cost efficiency in ecological monitoring of riparian systems.

AB  - Methods available to assess animal welfare at farm level are based on a range of welfare parameters, which can be divided into two categories, environment-based and animal-based parameters. The first category describes features of the environment and management, which can be considered prerequisites for welfare. The second category records animals' responses to that particular environment and management more directly. Objective of this study was to validate a mainly environment-based method, the animal needs index (ANI), with animal-based methods: behavioural observations and feather condition scores (FCS). The study was conducted on 20 commercial laying hen farms, 10 farms with battery cages and 10 farms with deep litter systems. During a 1-day visit on each farm, ANI was assessed, FCS was scored, and behavioural observations were performed. Instantaneous scan sampling and continuous focal sampling were used to assess the time spent on different behaviours and the occurrence of event behaviours. Data from behavioural observations and FCS were reduced with principal factor analysis. This resulted in two factors for each method. Significant positive correlations were found between ANI, on the one hand, and 'movement' and 'comfort', two factors from behavioural observations, on the other hand. A significant negative correlation was found between ANI and 'wing damage' (from FCS). The results of this study show that ANI is valid and sensitive enough to show differences in animal welfare between housing systems, whereas differences in welfare within housing systems cannot be shown. In conclusion, ANI is an appropriate method for assessment of laying hen welfare on a large number of farms with different housing systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental and sea level indicators were investigated using dredge samples from late Quaternary carbonate deposits along the shelf break between Goa and Cape Comorin, India. Geomorphic features in the area were identified from sonar profiles and included isolated patch reefs with a relief of up to 10 m, and linear reefs with reliefs between 2 and 15 m. The main clast types recovered from these features include fragmented corals and carbonate nodules dominated by either encrusted foraminifera or coralline algae. Some of these clast types are clearly of shallow-water origin. Fragments of reef-forming Poritid corals, for example, were collected off Mangalore at depths of 110-105 m and dated between 11,520 and 12,6 10 C-14 years BP (13.42-14.77 ka). Nodules of similar age dominated by Lithothamnium and capped by foraminiferal veneers were also collected at -90 m off Cape Comorin. Their altered algal tissues are consistent with formation in shallow water, high-energy conditions. In contrast, nodules recovered off Kochi and Mangalore-Goa are of deeper water origin, younger in age (10,9907350 C-14 years BP), and are dominated by Gypsina encrustations with volumetrically less algal encrustation. They show cyclic succession of foraminiferal-algal, or foraminiferal-algal-coral laminations in which the algal species are typical of deeper waters. The age and elevation of corals and shallow-water nodules are both consistent with published glacio-eustatic sea-level curves. In addition, the alternate micro-encrustations of foraminifera, algae and encrusting corals could indicate changing conditions from nutrient-rich and turbid to nutrient-poor and clear water that may be attributable to seasonal variations in sediment flux caused by monsoons.

AB  - The amounts of calcium and strontium were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in saccular and utricular inner ear otoliths (sagittae and lapilli, respectively) of developing cichlid fish. These fish had been maintained for 22 days at 3-g hypergravity conditions within a centrifuge. During this time-span. the animals completed their ontogenetic development from hatch to the free-swimming stage. Neither the morphogenetic development nor the timely onset and gain of performance of the swimming behaviour was impaired by the experimental conditions. Experimental and control animals also did not differ concerning their size (total length). ICP-MS revealed that the otoliths contained significantly less calcium (in mug/otolith) after hyper-g exposure compared to parallelly raised l-g control specimens (lapilli: 0.74 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.411 sagittae: 2.09 +/- 0.49 vs. 2.76 +/- 0.47). The content of strontium (in mug/otolith: lapilli: 0.0044 +/- 0.0023 vs. 0.0022 +/- 0.0013; sagittae: 0.0094 +/- 0.0026 vs. 0.0081 +/- 0.0016) and, consequently, the Sr/Ca ratio (Sr/Ca x 100) was increased (lapilli: 0.607 +/- 0.267 vs. 0.201 +/- 0.12; sagittae: 0.439 +/- 0.093 vs. 0.301 +/- 0.086). Since the calcium content can he taken as a proxy for otolith weight, and because parallelly undertaken morphometric investigations revealed smaller otoliths (maximum radius and surface area) due to hyper-g exposure, the results suggest that the growth of otoliths at hyper-g is slowed down. Since the concentration of trace elements incorporated into otoliths is likely based on the composition of the respective protein matrix, our findings suggest that the protein metabolism is affected by hypergravity.

AB  - Observing natural vegetation dynamics over the entire Holocene is difficult in Central Europe, due to pervasive and increasing human disturbance since the Neolithic. One strategy to minimize this limitation is to select a study site in an area that is marginal for agricultural activity. Here, we present a new sediment record from Lake Svityaz in northwestern Ukraine. We have reconstructed regional and local vegetation and fire dynamics since the Late Glacial using pollen, spores, macrofossils and charcoal. Boreal forest composed of Pinus sylvestris and Betula with continental Larix decidua and Pinus cembra established in the region around 13,450 cal bp, replacing an open, steppic landscape. The first temperate tree to expand was Ulmus at 11,800 cal bp, followed by Quercus, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia and Corylus ca. 1,000 years later. Fire activity was highest during the Early Holocene, when summer solar insolation reached its maximum. Carpinus betulus and Fagus sylvatica established at ca. 6,000 cal bp, coinciding with the first indicators of agricultural activity in the region and a transient climatic shift to cooler and moister conditions. Human impact on the vegetation remained initially very low, only increasing during the Bronze Age, at ca. 3,400 cal bp. Large-scale forest openings and the establishment of the present-day cultural landscape occurred only during the past 500 years. The persistence of highly diverse mixed forest under absent or low anthropogenic disturbance until the Early Middle Ages corroborates the role of human impact in the impoverishment of temperate forests elsewhere in Central Europe. The preservation or reestablishment of such diverse forests may mitigate future climate change impacts, specifically by lowering fire risk under warmer and drier conditions.

AB  - The goal of this study was to provide quantitative agronomic data and environmental performance through a life cycle assessment of camelina in a crop rotation. For this purpose, camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] was included in a crop rotation (camelina-barley [Hordeum vulgare (L.)]-camelina) fertilized with two organic fertilizers (dewatered sludge and composted sludge) during three growing seasons (2015-2018). Three treatments were considered in this experimental study of 0.018 ha: (1) Fertilization with composted sludge (15 t ha(-1)), (2) fertilization with dewatered sludge (35 t ha(-1)), and (3) control treatment without fertilization. Results showed that camelina's yield was affected by climatic conditions, ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 t ha(-1) in the first season (2015/2016) and the third season (2017/2018 and did not present significant differences between treatments. The yield components with a positive response to organic fertilization were number of silicles, number of seeds per plant, and thousand-seed weight, with an average increase compared to the control of 23.7%, 16.5%, and 18.5%, respectively. A negative correlation was observed between organic fertilization and total fat content, contrary to the increase in protein content observed with organic fertilization. The environmental assessment of this crop rotation revealed that fertilization and transport were the main hotspots. Despite the undesirable weather limitations, this study showed a positive response of camelina's yield components and seed quality to organic fertilization. By applying these organic fertilizers, it may be possible to obtain favorable camelina yields and promote waste valorization. To minimize the environmental impacts of this crop rotation with camelina, the main recommendations could be to reduce the distances between the dewatering and composting sites and the field and optimize fertilization rates. Further research is needed to determine the application of these organic fertilizers in the long term.

AB  - This paper analyzes the evaluation of investment proposals for non-revenue infrastructure projects, so as to narrow the gap in this research field, and demonstrates that projects of this category meet the terms and conditions for joining European co-financing programs. It is being implemented on a real-world infrastructure project 1 + 1 lane highway plus an emergency lane connecting the most important urban center of Northern Greece (Thessaloniki) with its major tourist area (Halkidiki). This application endeavours to quantify all the factors which, according to the European Commission Guide to CBA, should be integrated into the CBA and positively or negatively affect the financial result of the investment, including the environmental impacts that should be a fundamental concern of all involved parties in the light of current sustainable development needs. The use of the CBA method is proposed as the most appropriate tool for this process, which provides an instantaneous perception of the acceptance or rejection of investment plans by both the Public and Private Entities. However, since the transport projects refer to a future long-term period, it is evident that there is a great deal of uncertainty in critical factors such as annual average daily traffic (AADT), economic indicators, general social conditions, etc. It is, therefore, necessary to process the data derived from the CBA with a probabilistic model. In this study, the @Risk software was used to infer the NPV behavior and the most influential parameters affected it through cumulative probability and tornado diagrams respectively. The whole procedure, supported by the quantification of all parameters, allows the selection of the most optimal solution among alternatives and therefore offers enhanced cost efficiency projects with the required value for money to be achieved.

AB  - Changes in migration timing, resulting from the alteration in river continuity or the effect of climate change, can have major consequences on the population dynamics of diadromous fish. Forecasting the phenology of fish migration is thus critically important to implement management actions aimed at protecting fish during their migration. In this study, an 11-year monitoring survey of Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar) from the Ourthe River, Belgium, was analysed within a European Special Area of Conservation to improve the understanding of environment-induced spring migration. A logistic model was fitted to forecast smolt migration and to calculate phenological indicators for management, i.e. the onset, end, and duration of migration, while accounting for the influence of photoperiod, water temperature, and hydrological conditions. The results indicated that the photo-thermal units accumulated by smolts above a 7 degrees C temperature threshold was a relevant proxy to reflect the synergistic effect between temperature and photoperiod on smolt migration. After integrating the effect of river flow pulses, the model accurately explained the inter-annual changes in migration timing (R-2= 0.95). The model predictions provide decisive management information to identify sensitive periods during which mitigation measures (e.g. hydropower turbine shutdown, river discharge management) should be conducted to promote smolt survival. The model was used to predict phenological characteristics under future scenarios of climate change. The results suggest a joint effect of hydrological alterations and water warming. Temperature increases of 1-4 degrees C were associated with earlier initiation of migration, 6-51 days earlier, and spring flood events greatly influenced the duration of the migration period. Accordingly, the combined effects of human-induced modifications of the hydrological regimes and increasing temperatures could result in a mismatch between the smolt and favourable survival conditions in the marine environment.

AB  - A surface drainage system (SDS) controls catchment hydrology and acts as an indicator of geomorphologic processes. In this study, a field-based and GIS-integrated approach enabling reconstruction of a surface drainage system, which operates during heavy rainfall in small flysch catchments, has been proposed. The reconstruction is based on the ALS-LIDAR data. The reconstruction of the SDS gave the opportunity for analysis of the changes between the river system and the SDS operating during heavy rainfalls. Results have revealed that the SDS operating during heavy rainfalls is several times better developed than the river system. The density has increased from c.a. 1.5 to 13.7 kmkm(-2). Moreover, the structure of the SDS has changed, what was confirmed by the parameters of the Hortonian type of the analyses. The most significant changes were related to the first- and second-order streams. These streams were, the most frequently, the man-origin incisions and natural-origin incisions/concavities on the hillslopes conditioned by micro-relief. The man-origin sub-system reached up to 35% of the SDS functioning during heavy rainfalls, whereas the sub-system composed of incisions/concavities conditioned by micro-relief reached up to 24% of this SDS. Smaller lateral valleys included to the SDS during heavy rainfalls constitute up to 37% of the SDS. The permanent streams constitute the remaining part of the SDS. Changes in the SDS have the influence on the drainage pattern, hydrological response of a catchment, and intensity of geomorphological processes; therefore, the changes in the SDS and their consequences have been discussed.

AB  - Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores are a commonly used biological indicator to evaluate the disinfection of an enclosed space. In the present study, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas was applied to inactivate B. subtilis subsp. niger spores in an enclosed space. The effects of the ClO2 gas concentration (1-3 mg/l), relative humidity (RH, 30-70%) and exposure time (30-90 min) were investigated using a response surface methodology (RSM). A three-factor Box-Behnken experimental design was used. The obtained data were adequately fitted to a second-order polynomial model with an R-2adj of 0.992. The ClO2 gas concentration, RH and exposure time all significantly (P<0.05) and positively correlated with the inactivation of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores. The interaction between the ClO2 gas concentration and RH as well as that between the exposure time and RH indicated significant and synergistic effects (P<0.05). The predictive model was validated by additional eight experiments and proven to be with good accuracy. Overall, this model established by the RSM could show the trend of the inactivation of spores, indicate the interactions between important factors, and provide a reference to determine effective conditions for the disinfection in different enclosed spaces by ClO2 gas.Implications: The inactivation of indoor biological contaminants plays an important role in preventing the transmission of pathogens and ensuring human safety. The predictive model using response surface methodology indicates the influence and interaction of the main factors on the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores by ClO2 gas, and can predict a ClO2 gas treatment condition to achieve an effective sterilization of enclosed spaces. The results in this paper will provide a reference for the application of ClO2 gas treatments for indoor disinfection.

AB  - Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) activity is involved in cell survival and function, since PNP is a key enzyme in the purine metabolic pathway where it catalyzes the phosphorolysis of the nucleosides to the corresponding nucleobases. Its dysfunction has been found in relevant pathological conditions (such as inflammation and cancer), so the detection of PNP activity in plasma could represent an attractive marker for early diagnosis or assessment of disease progression. Thus the aim of this study was to develop a simple, fast and sensitive HPLC method for the determination of PNP activity in plasma. The separation was achieved on a Phenomenex Kinetex PFP column using 0.1% formic acid in water and methanol as mobile phases in gradient elution mode at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and purine compounds were detected using UV absorption and fluorescence. The analysis was fast since the run was achieved within 13 min. This method improved the separation of the different purines, allowing the UV-based quantification of the natural PNP substrates (inosine and guanosine) or products (hypoxanthine and guanine) and its subsequent metabolic products (xanthine and uric acid) with a good precision and accuracy. The most interesting innovation is the simultaneous use of a fluorescence detector (excitation/emission wavelength of 260/375 nm) that allowed the quantification of guanosine and guanine without derivatization. Compared with DV, the fluorescence detection improved the sensitivity for guanine detection by about 10-fold and abolished almost completely the baseline noise due to the presence of plasma in the enzymatic reaction mixture. Thus, the validated method allowed an excellent evaluation of PNP activity in plasma which could be useful as an indicator of several pathological conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The tetrazolium salts WT and CTC are frequently used as indicators of bacterial respiration. Mechanisms of tetrazolium reduction to formazan in eukaryotic cells have been proposed, however those in prokaryotes remain largely unresolved. We undertook studies to determine the sites, and degree of coupling for INT and CTC reduction in the aerobic Escherichia coli K-12 respiratory chain using both intact cells and inverted membrane vesicles. In addition, reduction in whole cells was assayed under anaerobic conditions which elicit different electron transport pathways. Results of experiments with inhibitors of specific electron transport components indicated that both CTC and INT were reduced prior to ubiquinone in the E. coli respiratory chain by the primary aerobic [succinate and NAD(P)H] dehydrogenases. INT was also reduced at ubiquinone and possibly cytochromes b(555,556). Quantitative CTC reduction was more closely correlated with respiration in whole cells than INT, but the reverse was true in inverted membrane vesicles. Both tetrazolium salts were reduced to significant degrees under anaerobic conditions, particularly glucose fermentation. Mid-point reduction potential of CTC was determined to be -200 mV by redox titration. However, it appears that CTC forms a weakly fluorescent, poorly-localized intracellular formazan at redox potentials higher than ca. -200 mV. Inhibition of the aerobic terminal oxidases with KCN or azide strongly increased INT-, but significantly decreased CTC reduction in whole cells, indicating that these agents may not be useful for optimizing CTC-formazan or CTC (+) cell numbers in some bacteria. However, several other chemical agents stimulated CTC and INT reduction. These results suggest strategies for optimizing methods using these tetrazolium salts for assessment of bacterial respiratory activity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Featured Application A potential application of this work is to provide a theoretical basis and experimental data for the principles of improving a pilot's task performance and adaptive display design under the conditions of critical situations, such as air route alternation. Air route alternation caused by unexpected events in abnormal or emergency situations often produces adverse consequences on an operator's cognition and behavior in flight tasks. Under such a circumstance, it is especially necessary to examine the utility of the interaction displays usually designed based on the routine environment. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of air route alternation and display design on operators' situation awareness (SA), task performance and mental workload during simulated flight tasks. Twenty-four participants attended an experiment where they were instructed to perform simulated flight tasks with three types of display designs in both air-route-as-planned and air-route-altered conditions. Subjective measures, behavioral measures and eye movement measures were adopted to assess the participants' SA, task performance and mental workload. The results show that unexpected air route alternation increases mental workload as well as deteriorates the SA and task performance due to the gap between attention resource demand and supply. Reducing the demand of the operator's attention resource should be the focus when coping with unexpected events in abnormal situations. In addition, reasonable information layout, such as a center-layout design of the critical decision-making information, is more important than information salience for improving the SA and task performance in abnormal situations. Nevertheless, indicators with a high-salience design, such as a more open window design and immersive design, are still worth recommending.

AB  - While resilience has grown to become a well-established goal of policy and practice, assessing resilience remains an outstanding problem. To date, measurement has largely relied on the identification of proxy indicators, inevitably shaping what is measured in ways that reflect underlying assumptions, generalisations and approximations, and raising the question of whose values are being embedded into resilience. These concerns reflect recent interest in the role of recognition justice in resilience, and in particular how marginalisation from meaning-making processes creates the conditions for the inequitable distribution of outcomes in practice. Here, we propose a two stage, subjective approach to resilience assessment, starting with rapid household interviews that invite participants to assess the likely impact of multiple shock and stressor storylines. In a second step, participatory qualitative methods are employed to support inductive investigation of resilience focused on the factors that differentiate those reporting relatively high and low resilience. We illustrate this using fieldwork data from 569 households in Bangladesh. This subjective approach enables households to engage in the production of knowledge about their resilience, revealing two core features of situated heterogeneity: the forms of difference, and the underlying causes. Underlying causes arise from interactions and feedbacks between social, political, economic and institutional conditions that are highly context specific, while significant forms of difference include intra-community and scalar heterogeneity; vulnerability to specific or generalised shocks; and the role of undesirable practices in securing resilience. The results underline the need for resilience to be assessed in relation to local understandings of precarity, and through the expression of senses of justice that inform local conceptions of wellbeing. This means moving beyond positivist approaches and placing epistemic diversity at the centre of resilience assessment, enabling the production of a situated understanding of how and why resilience is differentiated, and offering an analytical starting point from which policy and practice can drive towards equitable resilience.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) excess due to mineral fertilization in conventional crop farming has a significant negative impact on the environment. Variable rate N application (VRNA) is a promising tool to increase N recovery rates in spatially heterogeneous fields. Real-time sensor systems for VRNA usually consider only the crop?s N status and their fertilization algorithms are abundantly deterministic. Due to their education and professional experience, farmers have a considerable knowledge base that should be used to describe the dynamic and non-deterministic interactions of multiple parameters for a locally adapted N fertilization. Fuzzy systems present an effective way to integrate expert knowledge into an automated multi-parametric control. This paper describes, how fuzzy logic can be used to fuse the plant-related information from a real-time sensor system with further parameters to create a multi-parametric system for VRNA. Using sets of input?output data acquired with a Yara N-Sensor ALS2 system, an adaptive, fuzzy logic-based model of its agronomic algorithms was identified, optimized and validated. The results indicated high accordance with the N-Sensor algorithms and good automated adaptability to different calibrations with values of the Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.99 and a maximum percentage root mean square error of 0.14%. In a case study, the model was combined with the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) as an indicator for spatially varying soil productivity, as well as a case distinction for different weather conditions. Simulations with historic ECa data and N-Sensor recordings have shown the high flexibility of the multi-parametric fuzzy expert system. With the presented method, specific deficiencies of one-parametric approaches can be moderated and the application can be adapted to the prevailing conditions in a straightforward manner. Also, the target orientation could be influenced based on the specific preferences of the expert.

AB  - Cropland forms the material basis for human survival and is an important determinant of national food security. Cropland net primary productivity, which is the basis of food production and an important indicator of cropland productivity, reflects the production capacity of crops under natural conditions. However, currently, only limited knowledge was available on the relationship among cropland area, cropland management measures, and cropland productivity in China. Hence, in the current study, we used the panel data model to quantify the effects of cropland area and various cropland management measures (e.g., fertilizer use, irrigation area, agricultural machinery power, pesticide use, and agricultural film use) on cropland total net primary productivity (TNPP). Results revealed that for the entire cropland in China, an increase in cropland area, fertilizer use, agricultural machinery power, pesticide use, and agricultural film use increased cropland TNPP, whereas an increase in irrigation area decreased cropland TNPP. Further, in grain-producing areas, an increase in cropland area, fertilizer use, irrigation area, agricultural machinery power, pesticide use, and agricultural film use resulted in an increase in cropland TNPP. Moreover, in grain-balanced areas, an increase in cropland area, fertilizer use, pesticide use, and agricultural film use led to an increase in cropland TNPP, while an increase in irrigation area and agricultural machinery power reduced cropland TNPP. Finally, in grain-consuming areas, increases in cropland area, irrigation area, pesticide use, and agricultural film use caused an increase in cropland TNPP, whereas increases in fertilizer use and agricultural machinery power reduced cropland TNPP. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the encroachment of fertile cropland and, simultaneously, implement scientific management measures based on local conditions in croplands.

AB  - Aerated lagoons, typically used by small communities, often provide limited removal of wastewater nutrients. Given increasingly stringent wastewater standards, it is imperative that effective, but economical and easy-to-operate, treatment technologies be developed. The Submerged Attached Growth Reactor (SAGR (R)) is a treatment process developed to perform nitrification near freezing temperatures. Previous tests on full-scale installations have shown that SAGR could consistently remove ammonia to below current Canadian standards and provide additional total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand removal. In this study, we evaluated removal of polar chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides, at SAGR installations in two Manitoba First Nations communities (MCN and LPFN) under cold winter conditions. Both showed some removal of diclofenac, naproxen, clarithromycin, metoprolol, and trimethoprim, likely by biotransformation. Average naproxen removal was 21% (2.53 x 10(3) ng L-1) in MCN and 64% (1.58 x 10(3) ng L-1) in LPFN. Atenolol was well-removed by SAGR, by 80% on average (range of 64%-94%). Clarithromycin, metoprolol, and trimethoprim removal was similar within and between systems, ranging from 54% to 76% (30.8-3.07 x 10(2) ng L-1 removed). Carbamazepine was detected in nearly all samples, but was not well-removed, consistent with other treatment studies. Overall, results showed that SAGR technology could moderately remove CECs, while providing the designed treatment performance for other parameters. This work will help to improve our understanding of wastewater treatment in small and/or remote communities with limited infrastructure and challenging cold-weather conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pupillary reflex has been used as a method to examine psychological problems in human clinics and mental disease research. Intensive animal farming has been shown to lead to chronic stress resulting in depression; however, comparing with humans we lack an effective clinical method to clinically inspect these psychological problems in animals. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of age and housing conditions (confined crates vs. group pens) on pupillary light reflex (PLR) of sows to explore whether PLR can be used as an effective way to measure the psychological state of farm animals. In total, 270 pregnant sows were selected for PLR testing and divided into 6 treatments (45 sows per treatment) of 2 different environments (group-housed pen and confined gestation crates) and 3 parities (first, third, and fifth parities). Six selected pupil parameters: 1) latency of the pupil constriction onset (LAT); 2) the percent of the constriction (CON); 3) average constriction velocity (ACV); 4) maximum constriction velocity (MCV); 5) average dilation velocity (ADV); and 6) time of 75% recovery after constriction (T75) were examined. The results showed that there was no difference found in these PLR parameters between the breeds (P > 0.05) but the significant effects were found on LAT, CON, ACV, and MCV by age (P < 0.01). The group-housed sows had significantly higher CON, ACV, and MCV than those in the confined crates (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the pupillary light reflex of the sows was not affected by breed but by age. The results also indicate that some of PLR parameters were sensitive to housing conditions and suggest that ACV and MCV have potential to be sensitive indicators in relation to the psychological problem of sows.

AB  - Biodiversity monitoring is a key element of impact assessment follow-up activities, as it has the potential to generate relevant information about the actual impacts of approved projects on the environment. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring programs depends on issues such as technical quality. The extent to which this issue actually affects biodiversity monitoring is unclear. This knowledge gap was addressed in this study, whose main objective was to analyze the technical quality of fauna monitoring, using empirical data from large-scale mining enterprises in the state of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil. More specifically, this study aimed at analyzing: 1) whether license conditions related to faunamonitoring programs were being met by mining companies; 2) the extent to which fauna monitoring programs met a set of technical quality criteria; 3) whether there were significant differences among taxonomic groups; and, finally, 4) how fauna monitoring programs can be made more meaningful to decision-makers. A total of 236 fauna monitoring reports were analyzed. Findings indicated that, while companies complied with all license conditions, their fauna programs met, on average, 32% of the desirable technical requirements, and there were no significant differences among taxonomic groups. The main technical quality gaps were found to be lack of driving questions, hypothesis-testing and conceptual models, as well as lack of comparisons between control and impacted areas. Overall, findings indicated that the data generated in such programs have very limited value to decision-makers as they do not shed sufficient light on the actual impacts of mining activities on biodiversity. The study discusses a number of barriers to more meaningful fauna monitoring programs, and highlights the urgent need for revising current Terms of Reference. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During continuous operation of energy systems, the performance of components will mostly, gradually deviate away from the reference conditions due to performance degradation, which may eventually lead to malfunctions or operation failure. The complex interconnection among components and the propagation nature of additional irreversibility caused by malfunctions increase the difficulty of malfunction diagnosis. Particularly, in common real-world cases, multiple malfunctions usually happen simultaneously in several different components, imposing additional difficulty for effective malfunction identification and quantification. In this paper, we generalize an effective diagnosis method recently proposed by the authors to accurately locate the malfunction component and quantify the effect caused by anomalies of multiple malfunctions. The generalized method is based on advanced exergy analysis, where exergy destruction within each component is split into endogenous and exogenous parts. The endogenous exergy destruction is due to the irreversibility of the component itself, while the exogenous is caused by the inefficiencies of the remaining components. The exogenous exergy destruction is, in fact, the major obstacle to accurately pinpoint the origins of performance degradation. In the generalized approach, an internal exergy indicator is recommended to be applied first to identify the malfunction components in a fast and effective manner. Then the endogenous exergy destruction of the identified malfunction components under the reference and degradation conditions is calculated and compared for accurate quantification. The generalized diagnosis approach is applied to a complex real-world case studies, in which several malfunctions are introduced simultaneously into different components. The results show that the proposed indicator could fast identify the source of anomalies while the endogenous exergy destruction successfully and effectively quantifies all introduced malfunctions.

AB  - A high resolution submesoscale resolving ocean model was implemented in a limited area north of Island of Elba where a maritime exercise, named Serious Game 1 (SG1), took place on May 2014 in the framework of the project MEDESS-4MS (Mediterranean Decision Support System for Marine Safety). During the exercise, CTD data have been collected responding to the necessity of a Rapid Environmental Assessment, i.e. to a rapid evaluation of the marine conditions able to provide sensible information for initialisation of modelling tools, in the scenario of possible maritime accidents. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of such mesoscale-resolving CTD observations on short-term forecasts of the surface currents, within the framework of possible oil-spill related emergencies. For this reason, modelling outputs were compared with Lagrangian observations at sea: the high resolution modelled currents, together with the ones of the coarser sub-regional model WMED, are used to force the MEDSLIK-II oil spill model to simulate drifter trajectories. Both ocean models have been assessed by comparing the prognostic scalar and vector fields as an independent LID data set and with real drifter trajectories acquired during SG1. The diagnosed and prognosed circulation reveals that the area was characterised by water masses of Atlantic origin influenced by small mesoscale cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies, which govern the spatial and temporal evolution of the drifter trajectories and of the water masses distribution. The assimilation of LAD data into the initial conditions of the high resolution model highly improves the accuracy of the short-term forecast in terms of location and structure of the thermocline and positively influence the ability of the model in reproducing the observed paths of the surface drifters.

AB  - Genetically modified (GM) rice expressing Bt toxins is at the edge of commercial release in China. However, little information is available concerning the impact of Bt rice on aquatic organisms which are abundant in paddy field. A two-year study was conducted to assess the effects of two GM rice lines expressing a fusion protein Cry1Ab/1Ac (Bt rice) on three groups of zooplankton, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods in field conditions. Multi-factor ANOVA revealed that the population densities of rotifers, cladocerans and copepods in paddy field varied significantly between years and rice developmental stages, but did not differ significantly between Bt and non-Bt rice treatments. In all the field investigations, only one significant difference was found on copepods in the tillering stage of 2009, but the difference was not related to the presence of the Cry toxin. Under open-air conditions, we simulated the farming practice of straw mulch, using Bt rice straw as a food source for the water flea Daphnia hyalina. After one and two months of culture, the density of D. hyalina did not differ between Bt rice treatments and non-Bt rice treatments. A laboratory experiment found that purified Bt toxins Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac had no toxic effect on D. hyalina even in the treatment in which the Bt toxin concentration was as high as 2500 ng/ml. Those above results indicate that the two Bt rice lines have no negative effect on the three groups of zooplankton. However, further studies are needed to compare the effects of Bt rice and non-Bt rice on the paddy zooplankton community in the context of integrated pest management which includes the use of pesticides.

AB  - Environmental conditions influence plant responses to ozone (O-3), but few studies have evaluated individual factors directly. In this study, the effect of O-3 at high and low atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was evaluated in two genotypes of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (R123 and S156) used as O-3 bioindicator plants. Plants were grown in outdoor controlled-environment chambers in charcoal-filtered air containing 0 or 60 nl l(-1) O-3 (12 h average) at two VPDs (1.26 and 1.96 kPa) and sampled for biomass, leaf area, daily water loss, and seed yield. VPD clearly influenced O-3 effects. At low VPD, O-3 reduced biomass, leaf area, and seed yield substantially in both genotypes, while at high VPD, O-3 had no significant effect on these components. In clean air, high VPD reduced biomass and yield by similar fractions in both genotypes compared with low VPD. Data suggest that a stomatal response to VPD per se may be lacking in both genotypes and it is hypothesized that the high VPD resulted in unsustainable transpiration and water deficits that resulted in reduced growth and yield. High VPD- and water-stress-induced stomatal responses may have reduced the O-3 flux into the leaves, which contributed to a higher yield compared to the low VPD treatment in both genotypes. At low VPD, transpiration increased in the O-3 treatment relative to the clean air treatment, suggesting that whole-plant conductance was increased by O-3 exposure. Ozone-related biomass reductions at low VPD were proportionally higher in S156 than in R123, indicating that differential O-3 sensitivity of these bioindicator plants remained evident when environmental conditions were conducive for O-3 effects. Assessments of potential O-3 impacts on vegetation should incorporate interacting factors such as VPD.

AB  - The ideal host-associated genetic fecal marker would be capable of predicting the presence of specific pathogens of concern. Flowthrough freshwater microcosms containing mixed feces and inocula of the pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and adenovirus were placed at ambient temperature in the presence and absence of diurnal sunlight. The total Entero coccus DNA increased during the early periods (23 h) under sunlight exposure, even though cultivable Enterococcus and DNA in intact cells, as measured by propidium monoazide (PMA), decreased with first-order kinetics during the entire period. We found a significant difference in the decay of host-associated Bacteroidales cells between sunlight exposure and dark conditions (P value < 0.05), whereas the persistence of host-associated Bacteroidales DNA was comparable. The 2-log reduction times of adenovirus were 72 h for sunlight exposure and 99 h for dark conditions with similar decay rate constants (P value = 0.13). The persistences of fecal Bacteroidales cells and Campylobacter cells exposed to sunlight were similar, and host-associated Bacteroidales DNA and waterborne pathogen DNA were degraded at comparable rates (P values > 0.05). Overall, the ratio of quantitative PCR (qPCR) cycle threshold (C-T) values with and without PMA treatment was indicative of the time elapsed since inoculation of the microcosm with (i) fecal material from different animal sources based on host-associated Bacteroidales and (ii) pure cultures of bacterial pathogens. The use of both PMA-qPCR and qPCR may yield more realistic information about recent sources of fecal contamination and result in improved prediction of waterborne pathogens and assessment of health risk.

AB  - This paper provides a description of the physical and chemical properties (temperature, salinity, macro-nutrient, and oxygen concentrations) and bulk biomass indicators (chlorophyll and beam attenuation) prevailing in the subantarctic zone and polar front zones south of Tasmania (Australia) during the 'Sensitivity of the subantarctic zone to environmental change' (SAZ-Sense) expedition carried out in the austral summer of 2007. Phytoplankton biomass showed a characteristic north-south gradient of decreasing chlorophyll from the subantarctic zone to Polar Frontal Zone, as well as a zonal gradient in the northern subantarctic zone, with an increase in chlorophyll from southwest to southeast of Tasmania. The representativeness of the observations was assessed by comparison to previous studies including satellite observation of chlorophyll biomass over a 10-year period. We consider the possible role of spatial differences in: (i) ocean water masses and frontal systems, (ii) upper mixed layer stratification at three process stations, and (iii) nutrient availability, in controlling the observed variations in phytoplankton biomass in the region. Zonal gradients of the basic oceanographic physical and chemical conditions in the subantarctic zone were relatively small and therefore unlikely to control the three-fold west-to-east differences observed in the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass. The zonal variation in subantarctic zone chlorophyll biomass appears to be driven at least partly by greater micro-nutrient (iron) supply to the waters east of Tasmania, as reported also by others (Bowie et al., 2009; Mongin et al., 2011a). Despite this condition, the region of higher phytoplankton biomass to the southeast of Tasmania was only marginally more productive than the region of lower biomass west of Tasmania and south of the polar front, and exported less particulate carbon than the lower biomass waters (Jacquet et al., 2011).

AB  - Injurious feather pecking in non-cage systems is a serious economic and welfare concern for the egg-producing industry. Here, we describe the first results from an ongoing collaborative project to improve range environment and welfare of laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) within the McDonald's Restaurants Ltd, UK supply base. The objective of this study was to investigate, in a commercial situation, the correlation between: i) proportion of range cover and ii) proportion of canopy cover, with plumage damage of end-of-lay hens. The assessment of plumage damage due to injurious feather pecking is a key animal-based welfare indicator for laying hens in non-cage systems. In 2007 and 2008, all laying-hen producers within the McDonald's Restaurants Ltd egg-supply base, were required to plant (if not present already), 5% of the total range area with blocks of trees either side, and between 20-25 m from the laying hen house. Plumage damage at end of lay was positively correlated with mortality and flocks depleted in summer had less plumage damage at end of lay than flocks depleted in autumn or winter, possibly because of weather conditions at the time of placement There was no correlation between the proportion (5-90%) of range cover and plumage damage at the end of lay, however, plumage damage was negatively correlated with percent of canopy cover within tree-planted areas. Providing a minimum of 5% tree cover, planted close to the house but with good canopy coverage, may be a feasible and practical method enabling producers to reduce plumage damage due to injurious feather pecking in their laying-hen flocks. Tree cover provision may also provide environmental benefits, such as soil stabilisation, reduced nutrient leaching and carbon sequestration.

AB  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are thought to be actively involved in the cycling of sulfur in acidic mine tailings. However, most studies have used circumstantial evidence to assess microbial sulfate activity in such environments. In order to fully ascertain the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in sulfur cycling in acidic mine tailings, we measured sulfate reduction rates, sulfur isotopic composition of reduced sulfide fractions, porewaters and solid-phase geochemistry and SRB populations in four different Cu-Zn tailings located in Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The tailings were sampled in the summer and in the spring, shortly after snowmelt. The results first indicate that all four sites showed very high sulfate reduction rates in the summer (greater than or similar to100-1000 nmol cm- 3d-1), which corresponded to the presence of sulfide in the porewaters and to high SRB populations. In some of the sites, zones of microbial sulfate reduction also corresponded to a decline of organic carbon and to an apparent pyrite (with slightly negative delta(34)S values) enrichment around the same depth. Microbial sulfate reduction was also important in permanently acidic (pH 2-3) mine tailings sites, suggesting that SRB can be active under very acidic conditions. Secondly, the results showed that microbial sulfate reduction was greatly reduced in the spring, suggesting that temperature might be a key factor in the activity of SRB. However, a closer look at the results indicated that temperature was not the sole factor and that acidic conditions and limited substrate availability in the spring appeared to be important as well in limiting microbial sulfate par reduction in sulfidic mine tailings. Finally, the results indicate that sulfur undergoes rapid cycling throughout the year and that microbial sulfate reduction and metal sulfide precipitation do not appear to be a permanent sink for metals.

AB  - The reduction of viruses in wastewater and other contaminated waters in the subsurface or soil environment is an important public health consideration for land disposal of wastes and the use of ground sources as water supplies. Because of the lack of information on the comparative reductions of different viruses in soils receiving wastes, we determined the reductions of hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus 1, echovirus 1 and the indicator virus MS2 in 10-cm deep, miniature soil columns dosed twice weekly with 2.5 cm of water or wastewater and incubated at 5 or 25 degrees C for 16 weeks. The soils studied were coarse sand loamy sand, clay loam and organic muck. By examination of column effluents, few or no viruses were detected in clay loam column effluents, with >99.98% virus reductions under all conditions tested. In organic muck columns virus reductions ranged from 30-98%, with greater reductions at 25 degrees C than at 5 degrees C and greater reductions of enteroviruses than either HAV or MS2. In the sandy soil columns viruses were retained generally better in loamy sand than in coarse sand. Overall, poliovirus was reduced the most and echovirus the least. In coarse sand mean virus reductions ranged from a low of about 50% for echovirus at 5 degrees to a high of about 99.4% for poliovirus at 25 degrees. In loamy sand, mean virus reductions ranged from a low of about 60% for echovirus at 5 degrees to a high of 99.997% for poliovirus at 25 degrees. Virus reductions were greater in sandy soil columns dosed with groundwater than with wastewater. The appreciable breakthroughs of viruses in column effluents of organic muck and coarse sand soils indicate that these soil types may be unsuitable for land application of wastewater under some hydrogeological conditions.

AB  - Due to the richness of its coastal environments, particularly lagoons and mangrove, the low-lying areas of the Omani coastline attracted settlements very early. However, the low-lying coasts are highly mobile landscapes, whose evolution is controlled by multiple factors acting at different timescales, from episodic (extreme events) to millennial timescales (gradual shoreline changes). From a geoarchaeological analysis (geomorphological mapping, archaeological survey, core drilling, and sedimentological, faunic and microfaunic analyses), this study proposes for the first time to reconstruct the landscape evolution of the Quriyat coastal plain landscape during the Mid-Late Holocene. Results indicate a coastal landscape dominated by large lagoons and mangroves during the mid-Holocene (5th millennium). Between 6712 -6501 cal. BP and 6183 - 5992 cal. BP, an extreme wave event identified as a tsunami, is registered in the southern part of the coast. Between 4223 - 3984 cal. BP and 4150 - 3981 cal. BP, lagoons were quickly clogging over more than 3.5 km in favour of the development of sebkhas or dune fields. We suggest this rapid evolution is related to erosional crises linked to the setting up of arid conditions in this part of the Omani coast. The production of several sea-level index points shows a great stability of the relative sea-level over the last 6.000 yearscal. BP and point out the predominant role of sedimentary infilling in the coastline evolution of Quriyat. The high sedimentation rates, added to the exposure of coastal hazards, partially explains the relatively low density of archaeological sites found in the Quriyat coastal plain, despite the presence of major shell-midden (Khor Milk I and II), which attest the old attractiveness of this sector. From geoarchaeological and taphonomic points of view, the Quriyat area is considered as having non-favourable conditions for the preservation of archaeological remains.

AB  - In commercial conditions turkey tom and hen flocks are reared under similar housing and management conditions. However, the 2 sexes differ with regard to behavioral and physiological characteristics, and are slaughtered at different ages, resulting in different growth patterns. The rearing environment and management likely have similar effects on the welfare of both sexes reared in 1 barn, as usual in commercial flocks, but this has not previously been studied. The main aim of current study was to identify on-farm health and welfare issues of commercially reared hen and tom turkeys at 11 wk of age using the transect walk method. The study was conducted between November 2017 and March 2018 in 20 commercial turkey flocks on 16 different farms in the eastern part of Norway. On each farm, 1 barn, divided into tom and hen area, was evaluated using transect walk method. An observer walked the transects in random order and recorded the total number of birds per transect that were immobile; lame, with visible head, tail, or wing wounds; small; featherless; dirty; sick; terminal or dead. To analyze the data, we applied ANOVA and Spearman correlations in SAS software (v 9.3). The most commonly observed welfare indicators across sexes were dirty and featherless birds, and birds with tail and wing wounds. Across sexes, poor litter quality resulted in more head wounds (P < 0.05). Toms had significantly more tail wounds (P < 0.001), there were more sick birds (P < 0.01) and more terminal birds (P < 0.01) compared to hens at the same age. Several of the welfare indicators were positively correlated between the sexes, including lame, head, wing-and tail-wounded, dirty, and dead birds, suggesting similar underlying environmental causes affecting animal welfare.

AB  - Chemical mutagens, such as sodium azide, have attracted the interest of plant breeders. Azide creates DNA point mutations and affects plant growth and development, disturbs metabolic activity and inhibits protein and DNA replication, whereas mannitol is used to simulate drought stresses in tissue culture. To identify biochemical markers for stress tolerance, maize seeds were germinated under mannitol and sodium azide induced stress in controlled conditions for 7 days. Then levels of chlorophyll, carotenoids, phenolics and aldehydes produced were subsequently determined. Germination percentage was not affected by either mannitol or sodium azide and was always above 85%. However, total fresh weight decreased by 50% with the application of 153.4 mM mannitol and 0.26 mM azide in combination. This treatment significantly reduced plantlet growth from 0.94 g in the control to 0.53 g in the treated materials. Root weight reduced by 68.1%, cotyledons by 14.3%, stems by 65.0% and leaves by 70.0% in treated samples. The level of carotenoids in roots was the clearest biochemical indicator of stress produced by the mannitol and sodium azide treatment. Carotenoids increased from 0.01 mu g g(-1) fresh weight in the control to 9.03 mu g g(-1) fresh weight in the treated materials. A large-scale seed treatment with mannitol and sodium azide was carried out. 2296 seeds were placed in magenta containers with 153.4 mM mannitol and 0.26 mM NaN3. At 7 days of germination, the heaviest seedlings (450) (450/2296=20%) were transferred to soil environment. Forty-two plants (42/450=9.3%) were off-type phenotypes at 45 days. Genetic variants may have been obtained following the novel procedure described here which combines chronic treatment with sodium azide and selection pressure with mannitol to simulate drought conditions.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the chemical composition of a green fodder used in laying hens feeding raised in ecological system; organic fodder being an important condition to obtain organic eggs for consumption. In order to evaluate the chemical composition variations of the green fodder throughout the year, there were taken plants samples in three different vegetation stages (May, September and October). To each period, were done 5 determinations for the following indicators: dry matter - DM (%), ash - Ash (%), crude protein - CP (%), ether extract - EE (%), crude fiber - CF(%), nitrogen free extract - (NFE%) calcium Ca(%), phosphorus - P(%), magnesium - Mg (%), natrium - Na(%). And also, were analyzed the relevant indexes for the organic production: lead - Pb (mg/kg DM), cadmium - Cd (mg/kg DM), cooper - Cu (mg/kg DM), zinc - Zn (mg/kg DM) nitrites (ppm), nitrates (ppm), pesticides. After analysis, it was noticed that dry matter, minerals, organic matter and protein content varied very significantly between the first period and the third (p <= 0.001), while the fat content, crude fiber and nitrogen free extract did not register significant differences (p >= 0.05). Regarding the minerals elements analyzed, P and Mg differed significantly distinctly between the first and the last analyzed period. The content of green fodder in Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn was below the limits allowed by current legislation. The analyses for pesticides have highlighted the lack of them in the fodder. The quality parameters of the analyzed green fodder, expressed through levels of pollutants such as heavy metals, nitrites, nitrates, pesticides, allow us to notify that the green fodders achieve the conditions necessary for organic production.

AB  - Deforestation is a common practice worldwide in order to gain agricultural land. In Filyria, Kilkis, Greece, three major deforestations took place in 1933, 1971 and 1980. Cultivation effects, referring to soil microbial properties are studied, in deforested fields, using the adjacent remaining oak forest as reference. The soils are cultivated with cotton (conventional tillage and irrigation, alternation with wheat every two years) or wheat (reduced tillage and no irrigation). The estimation and interpretation of the microbial properties were based on the analyses of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), the MBC/SOC ratio, potential soil respiration (SR), and the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)). The forest ecosystem appears to provide better conditions for microbial growth and activity, having significantly greater SOC (31.8 g C kg(-1) soil in forest versus 9.6 g C kg(-1) soil in crop plots), MBC (1080 mg C kg(-1) soil in forest versus 492 mg C kg(-1) soil in crop plots) and SR (4.78 mg C CO2 kg(-1) soil d(-1) in forest versus 2.99 mg C CO2 kg(-1) soil d(-1) in crop plots), and significantly lower qCO(2) rates than the crop plots although its organic matter quality results to a lower MBC/SOC ratio. The number of years since deforestation played a major role for most of the parameters analyzed, although after many years the equilibrium reached by the ecosystem appeared to moderate the differences. Disturbance through cultivation decreases soil quality. Reduced tillage without irrigation of the wheat crops leads to more suitable conditions for the microbial populations (as expressed by the microbiological properties) than conventional tillage with irrigation of the cotton crops.

AB  - Calanus sinicus, a dominant calanoid copepod in the Yellow Sea, is an important link in the food web between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels. Its populations typically start to develop in later winter with a maximum of individuals in early summer. To study the correlation between changes in the abundance of this species and changes in food resources and the physical environment, RNA and DNA concentrations and egg production rates (EPR) were measured, and RNA:DNA ratios were calculated as indices of growth and nutritional conditions of copepods collected in the Yellow Sea from February to July. We observed pronounced seasonal and spatial variations of RNA concentrations and resulting RNA: DNA ratios. There was a positive correlation between the EPR and RNA:DNA ratios. The copepods collected in March and April, when phytoplankton were more abundant, had high RNA:DNA ratios, and contained more RNA than copepods collected during the other months. There was no significant correlation between the growth indices (RNA:DNA ratios and EPR) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl a) or temperature at large temporal and spatial scales. We tracked the development of two phytoplankton blooms in April, which were dominated in turn by diatoms and dinoflagellates. We observed high concentrations of RNA and a high RNA:DNA ratio at both bloom sites during the respective blooms. During the diatom bloom, the RNA:DNA ratios in copepods increased at the onset of the bloom and decreased thereafter. In addition, we observed a positive correlation (P <0.001) between RNA-based indices and Chl a. Our results suggest that food availability plays a more important role than temperature in controlling the growth of C. sinicus in the field. Thus, the spring phytoplankton blooms in the Yellow Sea are important regulators of copepod abundance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyclostationary models for the diagnostic signals measured on faulty rotating machineries have proved to be successful in many laboratory tests and industrial applications. The squared envelope spectrum has been pointed out as the most efficient indicator for the assessment of second order cyclostationary symptoms of damages, which are typical, for instance, of rolling element bearing faults. In an attempt to foster the spread of rotating machinery diagnostics, the current trend in the field is to reach higher levels of automation of the condition monitoring systems. For this purpose, statistical tests for the presence of cyclostationarity have been proposed during the last years. The statistical thresholds proposed in the past for the identification of cyclostationary components have been obtained under the hypothesis of having a white noise signal when the component is healthy. This need, coupled with the non-white nature of the real signals implies the necessity of pre-whitening or filtering the signal in optimal narrow-bands, increasing the complexity of the algorithm and the risk of losing diagnostic information or introducing biases on the result. In this paper, the authors introduce an original analytical derivation of the statistical tests for cyclostationarity in the squared envelope spectrum, dropping the hypothesis of white noise from the beginning. The effect of first order and second order cyclostationary components on the distribution of the squared envelope spectrum will be quantified and the effectiveness of the newly proposed threshold verified, providing a sound theoretical basis and a practical starting point for efficient automated diagnostics of machine Components such as rolling element bearings. The analytical results will be verified by means of numerical simulations and by using experimental vibration data of rolling element bearings. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To determine the extent and timescale of predation impacts occurring in a historically fishless headwater lake near Sudbury, Canada, we surveyed the larval remains of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus and the pelagic cladoceran Bosmina, within a Pb-210 dated lake sediment core. Size measures of fossil Bosmina mucros, carapaces, and antennules provided inferences of predation intensity. We observed two notable shifts of predation over the span of our similar to 500 year record. First, in the late-1800s, a considerable reduction in Bosmina mucro length (an indication of reduced invertebrate predation) occurred following centuries of stable, but high invertebrate predation intensity. Nearly concurrent with reduced invertebrate predation was a substantial decline in sedimentary-inferred Chlorophyll a (a measure of primary production). We hypothesise that turn-of-the century climate warming resulted in a shift in the dominant lake stratification regime at our study site, thus impacting both invertebrate predation intensity and overall primary production. Second, following an observed minnow introduction in the 1980s, the Chaoborus assemblage experienced a minor shift from larger-to smaller-bodied species, and total chaoborid concentrations were generally the lowest and most stable of the record. C. americanus was not extirpated from the lake, despite large growth in the minnow population. Although C. americanus is a reliable indicator of fishless conditions when obligate planktivorous fish are considered, our data suggest that absolute fishless conditions may be difficult to establish with confidence using the presence of C. americanus mandibles alone, as this taxon can co-exist with minnow species that are not solely planktivorous. Our palaeolimnological investigation provides temporal insight on predator-prey interactions occurring in small, shallow headwater lakes that have experienced historic shifts in predation due to long-term environmental change as well as a contemporary fish introduction.

AB  - Influences of one sewage sludge on degradation of hexazinone and formation of its major metabolites were investigated in four forest soils (A, B, C and D), collected in Zhejiang Province, China. In non-amended forest soils, the degradation half-life of hexazinone was 21.4, 30.4, 19.4 and 32.8 days in forest soil A. B, C and D, respectively. Degradation could start in soil A and C without lag period because the two soils had been contaminated by this herbicide for a long time, possibly leading to completion of acclimation period of hexazinone-degrading bacteria. In forest soils amended with sewage sludge, the degradation rate constant increased by 17.3% in soil A, 48.2% in soil B, 8.1% in soil C and 51.6% in soil D, respectively. The higher degradation rates (soil A and C) in non-amended soils accord with the lower rate increase in sewage sludge-amended soils. Under non-sterile conditions, biological mechanism accounted for 51.8-62.4% of hexazinone degradation in four soils. Under sterile conditions, the four soils had the similar chemical degradation capacity for hexazinone. In non-amended soil B, only one metabolite (B) was detected, while two metabolites (B and C) were found in sewage sludge-amended soil B. Similarly situated in agricultural soils, N-demethylation at 6-position of triazine ring, hydroxylation at the 4-positon of cyclohexyl group, and removal of the dimethylamino group with formation of a carbonyl group at 6-position of triazine ring appear to be the principal mechanism involved in hexazinone degradation in sewage sludge-amended forest soils. These data will improve understanding of the actual pollution risk as a result of forest soil fertilization with sewage sludge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In coastal areas, treated or pre-treated domestic wastewaters are commonly discharged into marine environment through outfall systems as a final disposal application. The main parameters used to design a marine outfall system are; treatment level, length of outfall manifold and discharge depth. One major aim is to preserve seawater quality especially in sensitive areas where aquaculture and recreational activities take place. It is vital to comply with the bathing water quality standards in such areas to protect public health against water borne diseases originated from pathogens. In this manner, it is very important to define the case specific bacterial inactivation rates and/or the time needed to inactive 90% of bacteria (T-90) in design of marine outfall systems. In this study, T-90 values have been determined for four different temperatures to represent different seasonal conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. The experiments were conducted in dark at 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C with wastewater inoculated seawater samples with different salinity levels between 20 ppt and 40 ppt. The selected temperatures represent the mean seasonal seawater temperatures in the bay of Antalya, located on the Turkish Mediterranean coast. The dark conditions represent a common case of submerged wastewater field below Secchi depth that is commonly observed in many deep sea outfall systems located along the coastal area. The seawater samples were taken from an offshore location in Antalya Bay and the inoculated wastewater was from a domestic wastewater treatment plant. T-90 values have been determined for faecal coliform (FC) bacteria which are commonly used as bacteriological indicators in seawater. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to develop a model to predict T-90 values for different salinity and temperature levels.

Nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen sources, and inorganic salts enhanced the production level of the antibacterial activity by B. subtilis B38. A first screening step showed that lactose, ammonium succinate, and manganese most influenced both cell growth and antibacterial activity production. These three factors varied at two levels in eight experiments using full factorial design. Results indicated that maximum cell growth (OD = 10.2) and maximum production of antibacterial activity (360 AU/mL) were obtained in a modified medium containing 1.5% (w/v) lactose, 0.15% (w/v) ammonium succinate, and 0.3 mg/L manganese. Depending on the indicator strain used, the antibacterial activity was 2- to 4-fold higher in the modified culture medium than in TSB medium under the same conditions. Thin layer chromatography-bioautography assay showed the presence of three active spots with R-f values of 0.47, 0.7, and 0.82 in TSB medium. However, the inhibition zone of two spots (Rf values of 0.7 and 0.82) was slightly larger in the modified medium. Moreover, a large zone of inhibition with an Rf value of 0.3, was observed in this modified medium, instead of the spot having an Rf value of 0.47. These results suggest that the nutrients act as environmental factors, quantitatively and qualitatively affecting the production of antibacterial compounds by B. subtilis B38.

AB  - Growth responses to twentieth century climate variability of the three main European tree species Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, and Pinus sylvestris within two temperate low mountain forest sites were analyzed, with particular emphasis on their dependence upon ecological factors and temporal stability in the obtained relationships. While site conditions in Central (similar to 51A degrees N, 9A degrees E, KEL) and West (50.5A degrees N, 6.5A degrees E, EIF) Germany are similar, annual precipitation totals of a parts per thousand...700 mm and a parts per thousand...1,000 mm describe a maritime-continental gradient. Ring-width samples from 228 trees were collected and PCA used to identify common growth patterns. Chronologies were developed and redundancy analysis and simple correlation coefficients calculated to detect twentieth century temperature, precipitation, and drought fingerprints in the tree-ring data. Summer drought is the dominant driver of forest productivity, but regional and species-specific differences indicate more complex influences upon tree growth. F. sylvatica reveals the highest climate sensitivity, whereas Q. petraea is most drought tolerant. Drier growth conditions in KEL result in climate sensitivity of all species, and Q. petraea shifted from non-significant to significant drought sensitivity during recent decades at EIF. Drought sensitivity dynamics of all species vary over time. An increase of drought sensitivity in tree growth was found in the wetter forest area EIF, whereas a decrease occurred in the middle of the last century for all species in the drier KEL region. Species-specific and regional differences in long-term climate sensitivities, as evidenced by temporal variability in drought sensitivity, are potential indicators for a changing climate that effects Central-West German forest growth, but meanwhile hampers a general assessment of these effects.

AB  - Ostracods (Crustacea) are benthic inhabitants well known for their consistent qualities as paleoenvironment markers. In particular, they are reliable indicators of water oxygenation level: filter feeders are more common in poor oxygen conditions, contrasting with deposit feeders, which are abundant in well-oxygenated settings. In the Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary transition in the Great Bank of Guizhou, ostracod species are dominated by deposit feeders, showing well-oxygenated conditions from the latest Permian, through the extinction level into the earliest Triassic. These results are consistent with ostracod faunas from northwest Guangxi Province. However, these two examples are in contrast with coeval ostracods from Sichuan, which show lower-than-normal oxygen levels in the earliest Triassic. The Great Bank of Guizhou forms an isolated platform in the large Nanpanjiang Basin on the south side of the South China Block; northwest Guangxi is nearby, in a marginal setting: both faced the Panthalassa Ocean through the P/Tr boundary times according to several published paleogeographic reconstructions. In contrast, P/Tr boundary transition rocks in Sichuan Province, located 600km north of the Great Bank of Guizhou, lie on the Tethyan side of the South China Block. Both the Great Bank of Guizhou and the Sichuan sites have earliest Triassic microbialites, but these are profoundly different in structure and composition. The difference between the two areas may reflect contrasts in the nature of circulating ocean waters, with reduced levels of oxygenation in the Tethys (Sichuan), associated with modelled slow circulation, in contrast to better circulated Panthalassa ocean waters (Great Bank of Guizhou and northwest Guangxi). This also may be an argument to show that low oxygenated, or even anoxic, waters were not the only reason for the P/Tr boundary crisis.

AB  - Devonian magmatism in the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas (Cordoba, Argentina) is represented by elliptical, porphyritic, batholithic, late- to post-orogenic monzogranites emplaced in a metamorphic-plutonic basement. Two groups of Devonian granitoids are distinguished: (1) metaaluminous to weakly peraluminous, hornblende-biotite bearing granitoids, and (2) peraluminous, biotite-(muscovite) bearing granitoids. Groups 1 and 2 are characterized by accessory phases of sphene-magnetite with high susceptibility, and ilmenite-(monazite-uraninite) with low susceptibility, respectively. The magnetic assemblage of the Group 2 Achala Batholith, predominantly paramagnetic, is the subject of this paper.
   Forty-three sites were sampled in the Achala monzogranite. Overall, it is weakly magnetic, with a mean magnetic susceptibility of 1.5 x 10(-4) SI. Twenty-one sites showed titanohaematite as the magnetic carrier of a stable remanence. The titanohaematite is an accessory mineral and contains exsolved disc-shaped intergrowths of ilmenite.
   The weak magnetism of Achala monzogranite facies contrasts with the magnetic character of other Devonian porphyritic, batholithic monzogranites in the region. The virtual absence of magnetite, together with the presence of exsolved titanohaematite and Mn-ilmenite indicate crystallization and cooling under more oxidizing conditions. Oxidizing conditions continued into the subsolidus, causing late-stage reactions of ilmenite host grains to ilmenite + rutile+ haematite, and titanohaematite to ilmenite-poorer haematite + rutile. These reactions resulted in low susceptibility values and a strong reduction of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities.
   Thermal demagnetization, up to 620-640 degrees C, isolated steeply dipping, dual-polarity remanence directions. The coincidence of the Achala paleomagnetic pole with the 380-360 Myr segment of the Gondwana Apparent Polar Wander Path and the U-Pb zircon age implies that the remanence was acquired soon after emplacement.

AB  - Sustainable management of resources is crucial for balancing competing livelihood, economic, and environmental goals. Since forests and other systems do not exist in isolation, comprehensive jurisdictional approaches to forest, and land-use governance can help promote sustainability. The ability of jurisdictions to provide evidence of progress toward sustainability is essential for attracting public and private sector investments and maintaining local stakeholder involvement. The Sustainable Landscapes Rating Tool (SLRT) provides a way to assess enabling conditions for jurisdictional sustainability through an evidence-based rating system. We applied this rating tool in 19 states and provinces across six countries (Brazil, Ecuador, Indonesia, Cote d'Ivoire, Mexico, Peru) that are members of the Governors' Climate and Forests Task Force (GCF TF). Each SLRT assessment was completed using publicly available information, interviews with stakeholders in the jurisdiction, and a multi-stakeholder workshop to validate the indicator ratings. This paper explores the effects of stakeholder involvement in the validation process, along with stakeholder perceptions of the tool's usefulness. Our analysis shows that the validation workshops often led to modifications of the indicator ratings, even for indicators originally assessed using publicly available data, highlighting the gap between existence of a policy and its implementation. Also, a more diverse composition of stakeholders at the workshops led to more changes in indicator ratings, which indicates the importance of including different perspectives in compiling and validating the assessments. Overall, most participants agreed that the tool is useful for self-assessment of the jurisdiction and to address coordination gaps. Further, the validation workshops provided a space for discussions across government agencies, civil society organizations (CSOs), producer organizations, indigenous peoples and local community representatives, and researchers about improving policy and governance conditions. Our findings from the analysis of a participatory approach to collecting and validating data can be used to inform future research on environmental governance and sustainability.

AB  - Air pollution constitutes potential threats to wildlife and human health; therefore, it must be monitored accurately. However, little attention has been given to understanding the toxicological effects induced by air pollution and the suitability of bird species as bioindicators. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), a human commensal species, was used as a study model to examine toxic metal accumulation, retention of particulate matter (PM), immunological and antioxidant capacities, and hematological parameters in birds inhabiting those areas with relatively higher (Shijiazhuang city) or lower (Chengde city) levels of PM2.5 and PM10 in China. Our results showed that Shijiazhuang birds had significantly more particle retention in the lungs and toxic metal (including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, iron, manganese, and lead) accumulation in the feathers relative to Chengde birds. They also had lower superoxide dismutase, albumin, immunoglobulin M concentrations in the lung lavage fluid, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the lungs and hearts. Furthermore, although they had higher proportions of microcytes, hypochromia, and polychromatic erythrocytes in the peripheral blood (a symptom of anemia), both populations exhibited comparable body conditions, white cell counts, heterophil and lymphocyte ratios, and plasma T-AOC and corticosterone levels. Therefore, our results not only confirmed that Shijiazhuang birds experienced a greater burden from environmental PM and toxic metals but also identified a suite of adverse effects of environmental pollution on immunological, antioxidative, and hematological parameters in multiple tissues. These findings contribute to our understanding of the physiological health consequences induced by PM exposure in wild animals. They suggest that free-living birds inhabiting urban areas could be used as bioindicators for evaluating the adverse effects induced by environmental pollution.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that has caused global concern due to its persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. Wet deposition is a crucial Hg input for both terrestrial and aquatic environments and is a significant indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of anthropogenic Hg control. Rainwater samples were collected from May 2014 to October 2018 in Chongming Island to understand the multi-year Hg wet deposition characteristics. The annual Hg wet deposition flux ranged from 2.6 to 9.8 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) (mean: 4.9 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)). Hg wet deposition flux in Chongming was comparable to the observations at temperate and subtropical background sites (2.0-10.2 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) in the northern hemisphere. Hg wet deposition flux decreased from 8.6 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-2015 to 3.8 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in 2016 and was attributed to a decrease in the volume-weighted mean (VWM) Hg concentration (-4.1 ng L-1 yr(-1)). The reduced VWM Hg was explained by the decreasing atmospheric Hg and anthropogenic emissions reductions. The annual Hg wet deposition flux further decreased from 3.8 mu g m(-2) in 2016 to 2.6 mu g m(-2) in 2018. The reduction of warm season (April-September) rainfall amounts (356-845 mm) mainly contributed to the Hg wet deposition flux reduction during 2016-2018. The multi-year monitoring results suggest that long-term measurements are necessary when using wet deposition as an indicator to reflect the impact of anthropogenic efforts on mercury pollution control and meteorological condition variations.

AB  - South Texas is located in a subtropical semiarid climate, and due to high temperature and irregular precipitation, farmers opt to leave their fields fallow during the summer months jeopardizing overall soil health. We evaluated whether sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivation coupled with drip irrigation could restore soil biological activities compared with bare fallow. Additionally, because sweet potatoes have high demand of soil nutrients, especially potassium (K), we evaluated the nutrient supply of locally sourced soil amendments. Sweet potato was cultivated during summer 2018 in McAllen, Texas, under control (no fertilizer), NPK (synthetic fertilizer), RC (yard-waste compost), and AC (compost produced under an enhanced composting process), and biochar (gasified walnut shell at 900 degrees C), each with three replicates. Soil amendments were applied at different amounts to result in a rate of 80 kg K ha(-1). Soil biological indicators were microbial biomass phosphorous, phosphatase activity, and the rate of fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA). Available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium were also quantified. Aboveground biomass and storage root yield estimated sweet potato's agronomic performance. Cultivation and irrigation stimulated soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass-phosphorous. Sweet potato yields were the highest in NPK treatment but still 2.8 times lower than variety's potential yield. Storage root yield was inversely related to aboveground biomass, suggesting that growing conditions benefited the production of shoot versus roots. Both biochar and AC treatments stimulated FDA rates and K availability. Soil pH and sodium concentration increased in all treatments over the growing season, possibly due to river-sourced irrigation water. Together, these findings show that crop cultivation promoted soil biological activities and the maintenance of nutrient cycling, compared to bare-fallow conditions. For a better agronomic performance of sweet potato, it would be necessary to identify management practices that minimize increase in soil pH and salinity.

AB  - Diadromous fishes have drastically declined over the last century, especially in Europe. Several authors have highlighted the role of large dams in this decline, but in fact, its causes are potentially multiple and cumulative, including degradation of local environmental conditions and widespread fragmentation of hydrographic networks associated with the pervasive establishment of smaller barriers. Consequently, there is a need to improve the identification and prioritization of the drivers of diadromous species loss in order to identify and apply the most appropriate conservation and restoration measures. In this study, we used both historical sources (from mid-18(th)to early 20(th)century) and current data to quantify the long-term loss of diadromous taxa over 555 sites throughout the French river network. Then, we modeled the effects of several anthropogenic pressures (e.g. barriers, water quality, hydrological and river morphological alterations) on diadromous taxon loss. Lastly, we assessed the potential consequences of four different scenarios of anthropogenic pressure reduction. Due to uncertainties in historical sources, some species were grouped into taxa leading to a potential underestimation of actual species extinctions. Despite this limitation, our results showed that the decline in diadromous assemblages is widespread but with contrasting magnitudes depending on site locations. The maximum height and density of barriers appeared as the major factors of taxon loss. Over the scenarios tested, we observed that exclusively improving local conditions have much more limited effects than restoring river continuity. Focusing actions on large dam removal did not show the strongest responses compared to removing medium and small-sized barriers. For effective and sustainable restoration of diadromous fish assemblage, (1) historical occurrences of diadromous fishes should be used as an indicator for assessing recovery, and (2) undertaken measures must be adapted to each basin to target and limit the number of barriers to remove while allowing diadromous fish recovery.

AB  - Changing climate and altered environment can significantly impact the adaptation traits among different animal species. We describe here the rationale and economics of adaptation of Aberdeen Angus and Hereford beef-producing animals brought from Canada and the Netherlands to Northern Kazakhstan. In order to investigate common zootechnic methods, daughters of imported Aberdeen Angus and Hereford cows were grouped at the age of 18-19 months with a live weight of no less than 350 kg. Groups were constituted using the analogue-pairs method and consisted of 30 cattle/group. Observations during the present study showed that the average live weight of Hereford heifers of the second generation at the age 18-22 months was 378.5 and 375.2 kg which was 8.7 and 20.6 kg (2.2-5.4%) higher than that of Aberdeen-Angus herd-mates. Chemical analysis of feedstuff was carried out in Altyndan LLP and AKA whereas physiological and clinical indicators of second-generation heifer calves were within the normal range in various seasons. The highest thermal resistance index was in animals of group I and II groups (76.4 and 78.0, respectively). Under the conditions of Akmola and North-Kazakhstan regions, the thermoneutrality or comfort temperature zone for Hereford and Aberdeen Angus breeds was within the range of +19-2 +27-31 degrees C. Analysis of ethology of animals showed that all groups had 0.19 functional activity index; as for the other indices, animals of group I and II groups (Hereford heifers) had a comparative advantage, they were more active and spent more time in moving and feed eating. Taken together, different breeds can be acclimatised and adapted to the varying climatic conditions through generations and thus presents practical strategy to secure food for growing population in the country.

AB  - The surface mining activities in grassland and rangeland zones directly affect the livestock production, forage quality, and regional grassland resources. Mine rehabilitation is necessary for accelerating the recovery of the grassland ecosystem. In this work, we investigate the integration of data obtained via a synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1 SAR) with data obtained by optical remote sensing (Worldview-3, WV-3) in order to monitor the conditions of a vegetation area rehabilitated after coal mining in North China. The above-ground biomass (AGB) is used as an indicator of the rehabilitated vegetation conditions and the success of mine rehabilitation. The wavelet principal component analysis is used for the fusion of the WV-3 and Sentinel-1 SAR images. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression model is applied based on the relationship between the remote sensing features and the AGB field measurements. Our results show that WV-3 enhanced vegetation indices (EVI), mean texture from band8 (near infrared band2, NIR2), the SAR vertical and horizon (VH) polarization, and band 8 (NIR2) from the fused image have higher correlation coefficient value with the field-measured AGB. The proposed AGB estimation model combining WV-3 and Sentinel 1A SAR imagery yields higher model accuracy (R-2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 22.82 g/m(2)) compared to that obtained with any of the two datasets only. Besides improving AGB estimation, the proposed model can also reduce the uncertainty range by 7 g m(-2) on average. These results demonstrate the potential of new multispectral high-resolution datasets, such as Sentinel-1 SAR and Worldview-3, in providing timely and accurate AGB estimation for mine rehabilitation planning and management.

AB  - The climate conditions are complex and diverse in Southwest China (SWC), especially the karst area, and the interaction between climate change and terrestrial ecosystems has become complex. Vegetation productivity is an important indicator in terrestrial ecosystems, and can visually reveal the impacts of extreme climate. Drought affects not only the process of photosynthesis directly, but also the changes in vegetation productivity from other forms of interference with photosynthesis. Against this background, we analyzed the time series and spatial distribution characteristics of drought, the temporal and spatial distribution and anomalies of vegetation productivity. For the observation period 2001-2012, we used different drought monitor patterns (including Pa, SPI, SPEI and PDSI) to assess the impact of drought on vegetation productivity (annual NPP and monthly GPP). We mainly want to explore the response of different monitor patterns to vegetation productivity at different stages. NPP exhibited considerable variation during 2001-2012; the droughts in 2009 and 2010 led to NPP reduction by 14.7% and 8.4%, respectively. The NPP is directly proportional to the severity of drought, severe drought had a greater impact on monthly GPP than mild drought, especially for evergreen forests, shrublands, and deciduous forests, while little variation was found for croplands. We compared drought indices-vegetation productivity during the drought season between 2009 and 2010; SPEI has a better correlation with SPI and PDSI. The results demonstrate that SPEI and PDSI are most capable of monitoring the vegetation drought conditions. There will be large differences of the influence on vegetation productivity on different drought levels. Our findings suggested that multi-indices in drought monitoring are needed in order to acquire robust conclusions.

AB  - European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is an important target species for recreational and commercial fisheries. In recent years, the spawning stock biomass has declined markedly in some areas, and strict management measures have been introduced. However, the development of appropriate stock assessment and fisheries management has been hampered by a lack of information on post-release mortality. This study investigated post-release mortality of sea bass captured with common recreational fishing gear under experimental conditions in an aquaculture facility over 10 d. Three experiments investigated (i) the effects of different bait types; (ii) the impact of prolonged air exposure; and (iii) the impact of deep hooking on post-release mortality. By combining the experimental results with country-specific information on sea bass angling practices, estimates of post-release mortality are provided for the northern sea bass stock. No mortality was observed for sea bass captured on artificial baits. The use of natural baits resulted in a mortality of 13.9% (95% CI = 4.7-29.5%), which was associated with deep hooking, hooking injuries, and prolonged air exposure. The use of artificial baits and short air exposure (<= 30 s) increased survival probability, whereas deep hooking resulted in 76.5% (95% CI = 50.0-93.2%) mortality. Depending on country-specific angling practices, post-release mortality estimates ranged from 2.8% to 9.1% (mean = 5.0%, 95% CI = 1.7-14.4%) for northern sea bass. Despite these relatively low mortality estimates, post-release mortality should be considered in stock assessments as its cumulative impact may be high. Moreover, post-release mortality can be reduced by implementing species-specific best practice guidelines.

AB  - Most alpine floodplains are heavily modified and have lost their natural habitat dynamics and biodiversity. However, little is known about the consequences for floodplain forests. To study this topic, the Bavarian River Ammer was selected. An analysis of the effects of river regulation was possible within the 'Schnalzaue' where 55 years ago a weir and a dam had been built separating an active and inactive section of the floodplain. A comparison between both sections helps assessing the effect of the dam on the alluvial grey-alder forests (Alnetum incanae), as basis for future restoration. We expected lower disturbance, lower moisture and higher nutrient supply in the inactive floodplain and thus, a transition to a maple-ash forest (Adoxo-Aceretum). Therefore, we analysed species composition, functional plant traits of the leaf-height-seed scheme (leaf dry matter content, plant height, seed mass) and Ellenberg indicators (indicator values for moisture and nutrients, indicator species for flooding and for periodical wet conditions). The ordination results indicated different species compositions in both floodplain sections, while this was poorly reflected by the results of a syntaxonomic analysis. The latter suggested presence of a rarely flooded Asarum-subassociation of grey-alder forest in both floodplain sections. In the sections, similar site conditions prevailed regarding moisture and nutrient supply, while plant height indicated slightly more disturbance in the active floodplain. Overall, the results reveal low disturbance in both sections, even though the active one is connected with the river. A reason for this finding could be increased erosion of River Ammer downstream the weir with respective lower water levels. Accordingly, restoration should improve river dynamics in the entire floodplain to allow more frequent disturbance as a measure to maintain the grey-alder forest in the long term.

AB  - The occurrence of evaporite minerals in the Mamfe Basin (Albian-Cenomanian) is considered to be an indicator of aridity and palaeo-saline waters. A detailed lithostratigraphic analysis of the Mamfe sedimentary basin-fill indicates the occurrence of carbonate and sulphide minerals in close association with halite and gypsum within the Manyu, Mamfe and Bagba Members of the Nfaitok Formation. The composition and textures of these carbonate and sulphide minerals were studied using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), attached to Energy Dispersive Atomic X-ray analyser (EDAX) that generates Backscattered and Secondary Electron Imaging (BSEI). Two paragenetic suites were encountered in this study; calcite/dolomite/ankerite/siderite and pyrite/sphalerite/galena respectively. The compositional and textural variability of different suite members appear to be conditioned by the competition for CO32- and SO42- anions by metal cations with respect to redox conditions and diagenetic stages. Early formed authigenic minerals exhibit euhedral textures, while late diagenetic minerals exhibit pseudomorphic textures, as cations with higher ionic radii integrate into earlier structures. Calcite is a precursor for dolomite, ankerite and siderite at late diagenetic stages. Pyrite, sphalerite and galena indicate deposition in anoxic and sulphate reducing environments. Micron-sized euhedral pyrite framboids are syn-depositional, while Pb-Zn mineralization in voids and cavities are formed at late diagenetic stages below the sulphate reduction zone (SRZ), where siderite forms encrustations around skeletal pyrite.

AB  - The approval of the current Bathing Water Directive (Directive 2006/7/EC) involves a set of changes regarding to its predecessor. One of the most important ones is the necessity to define bathing water profiles. These profiles should identify putative pollution sources ("source apportionment"). In urban beaches, bacteriological pollution problems depend, in most instances, on the operation of the sanitation system. Due to the novelty of the bathing water profile concept, the methodologies proposed in the literature to solve this issue are still scarce. This paper presents a methodology to assess the percentage in which a bacteriological concentration is exceeded, according to the Directive 2006/7/EC standards, which could be a suitable indicator of bacteriological pollution in bathing waters, due to it is related with the probability to impair the Directive 2006/7/EC regulatory standards. This indicator would be useful for the "source apportionment" in bathing waters and, consequently, for the definition of the bathing water profile, and can be used in combination with other sources of information, especially those provided by the analysis of extreme events, maybe more interesting for the managers. The methodology involves the characterisation of effluents under different hydrometeorological conditions, the characterisation of advection, diffusion and reaction processes of bacteriological organisms in the aquatic environment by using mathematical models, in which calibration and sensitivity analysis were carried out. The outcome of the application of this methodology in an urban beach located in Santander (Northern Spain) is also shown. To define the bathing water profile we have considered the sanitation system operating under normal conditions, which include storm water overflows (CSOs), and the uncontrolled discharges.

AB  - It is widely admitted that low self-efficacy has a detrimental impact on the functioning and performance of a person mainly concerned with performance goals but has no impact when a person is mainly concerned with learning goals (Dweck, 1986). However, results from both correlational and experimental studies are divergent. Since these studies examined very few indicators of participants' cognitive functioning, they may have failed to detect those aspects that could be more vulnerable to a negative impact of the combination of performance goals and low self-efficacy. Another concern is the lack of most studies to clearly distinguish the type of performance goal examined, particularly the performance-avoidance versus the performance-approach goal. In the current study, we decided to focus on performance-approach and learning goals in order to examine how self-efficacy intervenes in their effects on participants' self-regulation and performance on a cognitive task. One hundred and forty participants (85 females and 55 mates) were examined. They were randomly assigned either to the learning or the performance-approach goals condition, In each condition, half of the participants received feedback aimed at inducing either high or low self-efficacy beliefs with regard to the task prior to executing it aloud. Examination of participants' verbal reports, direct observation of some of their behaviours while solving the task, and responses to a retrospective questionnaire allowed the assessment of several indicators of their self-regulation and performance. As already reported by many studies, self-efficacy influenced various aspects of participants' self-regulation and performance. However, contrary to Dweck's hypothesis (1986), when interaction effects between self-efficacy and goals were observed, they always involved learning instead of performance-approach goals. Findings of this study suggest that the nature of the goal might not matter as much as its personal significance or value.

AB  - Background and aims This study was the first to test the efficiency of monitoring root electrical capacitance (C-R*) non-destructively in the field to evaluate crop development under different environmental conditions. Methods A free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment was performed with two winter wheat cultivars, two levels (low and high) of nitrogen supply and two (ambient and elevated) of [CO2] in three replicate plots over two years. The validity of C-R* as a proxy for root uptake activity was confirmed by tracking the ceptometer-based leaf area index (LAI). Results Repeated C-R* measurements clearly demonstrated the seasonal dynamics in root development, with a peak at flowering, and the delayed growth in the second year caused by the unfavourable meteorological conditions. From the vegetative to flowering stages, C-R* was strongly correlated with LAI (R-2: 0.897-0.962). The positive effect of higher N supply and elevated [CO2] on crop growth was clearly indicated by the higher C-R* values, associated with increased LAI, shoot dry mass (SDM) at flowering and grain yield (GY). The maximum C-R* was closely related to GY (R-2: 0.805 and 0.867) when the data were pooled across the N and CO2 treatments and the years. Unlike C-R* and GY, SDM and LAI were significantly lower in the second year, presumably due to the enhanced root/shoot ratio induced by a severe spring drought. Conclusions The present results convincingly demonstrated the potential of the in situ root capacitance method to assess root responses dynamically, and to predict crop GY.

AB  - In Islamic countries, many sacred places reflect the history, culture, and tradition of the nations. One of the main issues that can improve the architecture of these places is the proper lighting system. In this research, two alternative lighting designs for the main courtyard of the JAMKARAN mosque are discussed. These schemes are presented based on related international experiences and standards of lighting systems and to minimize energy consumption and eliminate disadvantages in the current lighting system. At first, based on on-site visits and data collection, the general structure of JAMKARAN mosque including dimensions, height, architectural structure, and current lighting system of the mosque including the number, location, and power consumption of projectors and other lighting equipment was modeled and simulated in DIALux Evo software. Afterward, using the results obtained from software simulation and comparison of software output data with lighting standards and international experiences, technical and operational shortcomings of the current design were identified. In the end, two alternative lighting designs based on international standards and user experiences related to lighting systems for sacred places are presented. The simulation results show that the proposed designs not only meet the lighting standards and technical indicators but minimized the number of lights, amount of energy consumption, and costs. In terms of economic, the cost of our proposed lighting designs is equal to 60 percent of the cost of the current JAMKARAN mosque's lighting system. And in terms of technical indicators, such as minimum light intensity, glare, and uniform light distribution, the proposed designs are superior. This research opens windows for researchers to develop a lighting system design in sacred places with an approach to improving technical and economic conditions. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

KW  - Indexes of dynamism
AB  - The effective corporate reputation management in today's business environment requires new research approaches that are based on a combination of social, psycho-emotional, behavioral and economic theories, and practices. The company's corporate reputation is formed in retrospect and is being accumulated on the basis of thoughts and impressions due to the relationships with various contact groups. According to the theory of behavioral economics, decisions made by stakeholder are often based on cognitive biases and, as a result, are inconsistent with rational behavior. Under such conditions reputational risks may arise, as the company's key stakeholders may not take into account the advantages of corporate reputation and its components. In this context, the methodical approach to the corporate reputation management has been proposed on the basis of the structural analysis of the dynamicity of its components. The peculiarity of the approach lies in the construction of a matrix that reflects the list of key stakeholders and main attributes of corporate reputation, the combination of which makes it possible to identify the structural components of the company's corporate reputation. To study structural changes in the company's corporate reputation it has been proposed to calculate such indicators: the coefficient of the structural formation of corporate reputation, the coefficient of the coordinated volatility of the corporate reputation components, the coefficient of the direction of change of the corporate reputation components. The calculation of these ratios allowed us to obtain information about the structural content of corporate reputation in the dynamics, namely, taking into account the structural components of the financial and social effects. We believe that the definition of indicators of the dynamics of the structural components of corporate reputation in the aggregate expand the method of evaluating the object of study in the dynamics and complement the information field of the reputation management in terms of behavioral theories.

AB  - Recent research has challenged the idea that cervid antlers are such costly traits, supporting the assertion early-life antler investment is an honest signal of adult phenotypic quality. However, inferences were made based on antler measurements while growing (velvet) and thus, studies on fully-formed clean antlers are needed to avoid possible bias caused by the inter-individual variation in antler growth phenology. We studied a semi-captive population of European roe deer inhabiting a sub-Mediterranean area (Valsemana research station) and living under optimal conditions (ad libitum food supply and veterinary care). Based on repeated measurements taken from 146 individuals, we assessed whether allocation to secondary sexual traits during early life affected body mass or antler development during adulthood. Furthermore, we evaluated which body measurements better predicted future male quality. Additionally, using 488 individuals, we described age-class-specific variation in male body measurements and assessed the decline in antler size between adult and senescent stages (i.e. magnitude of senescence). Results agree with the assertion that there is no negative effect of a high investment in antler during early life on adult antler size or body mass, but we suggest the use of clean antlers as a more robust and reliable measure. The variables that better predicted body mass during adulthood were yearling body mass and body size at 6 months. Antler score between 10 and 18 months resulted in the best indicator of adult antler size. Finally, we support the idea that the magnitude of senescence in antler size is smaller in environments with higher resource availability during winter.

AB  - The Japan Sea is ideal for investigating deep water formation due to its unique topography and hydrography. However, because of the scarcity of reliable indicator and high-resolution ventilation records, the driving mechanisms behind ventilation changes in the entire Japan Sea since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In this study, we analyze the radiolarian assemblage in three sediment cores from the southwestern, central, and northwestern Japan Sea to reveal ventilation variations over the last 25 ka. Our results suggest that weak ventilation was a widespread phenomenon in the Japan Sea during the LGM. This is inferred by the low relative abundances of species belonging into the Japan Sea Proper Water (JSPW) Assemblage, which are indicative of deep water ventilation in the Japan Sea. The JSPW Assemblage have gradually become the predominant species in studied cores from the last deglaciation to the early Holocene, suggesting an abrupt transition from oxygen poorer to oxygen richer conditions. All investigated regions show re-ventilation during the deglaciation, albeit at different times. The JSPW ventilation in the central Japan Sea started during the 19 ka Melt-water Pulse (MWP) and remained in an interglacial mode after MWP-1A (similar to 14.7 ka), presumably due to the opening of the Tsushima Strait and intrusion of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC). An abrupt increase in productive shallow water export during the B?lling-Aller'd (B/A) was likely the key factor causing poorly oxygenated deep-water conditions in the southwestern Japan Sea. In contrast, the weakening ventilation in the northwestern Japan Sea during the B/A and Younger Dryas was probably caused by the blocking effect of the sea ice.

AB  - The depositional environment of the Antalo Limestone was previously interpreted from regional field-based studies and microfacies. However, stable oxygen and carbon isotopes are also invaluable proxies of paleo-environmental conditions, depositional, and diagenetic environments. Hence, the analyses of stable oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of this unit were examined from bulk limestone samples and integrated with a detailed petrographic study to interpret depositional environments and diagenetic evolution. The samples were collected from three outcrop sections, which together represent the full thickness of the unit. The microfacies identified from these samples indicate shallow-deep marine depositional as well as meteoric phreatic, marine phreatic, and deep burial diagenetic environments. The limits of variations of the oxygen isotopic ratios range from - 10.46 to - 3.56 parts per thousand, with - 6.07 parts per thousand mean value. The limits of variations of the carbon isotopic ratios range from - 0.02 to 2.56 parts per thousand, with 1.4 parts per thousand mean value. The calculated z values range from 123.08 to129.7 and the paleo-temperatures are estimated to be 32.4-73.52 degrees C, with an average temperature of 46.5 degrees C. The carbon isotope ratios indicate marine-water sources. This was confirmed from z values (> 120), indicating that the samples are marine carbonates. The depleted oxygen isotope ratios and high-temperature values, on the other hand, represent deep-burial diagenesis, which indicates the isotopic composition and the temperature conditions of the cement precipitating diagenetic fluids. The compositional fields of the delta O-18-delta C-13 cross plots, also indicate marine carbonates subjected to mixing zone-deep-burial diagenesis. Therefore, both the petrographic and stable oxygen and carbon isotopic evidences are mutually in agreement, indicating related depositional and diagenetic environments.

AB  - In this article, the lower Cambrian marine shale of the southern part of the Ordos basin is taken as an example to investigate the formation environment and development models of source rocks with high organic abundance in the ancient strata of the southern North China plate. The lower Cambrian shale source rocks had a thickness of 10-80 m, with high total organic carbon contents (an average of 2.68% and maximum of 9.39%) and favorable organic matter types-mainly sapropelinite macerals- and yet low S1, S2, and hydrogen index, which indicate that the source rocks have relatively high thermal maturity. Therefore, it is demonstrated that marine shale of the lower Cambrian proves to be excellent gas source rocks at the southern part of the Ordos basin and are presently distributed mainly in the south part of the North China plate. During the early Cambrian period, paleoproductivity was relatively high, as indicated by the rich C-27 sterane contents, high sterane/hopane ratios, and high tricyclic terpane/hopane ratios in biomarkers and high P and Ba values in trace elements. The tectonic setting promoted the formation of highly abundant source rocks with favorable preservation conditions, as suggested by the relatively high V/Cr ratios and low Zr/Rb and Pr/Ph ratios. Thus, the paleoproductivity and preservation conditions were the main factors controlling the occurrence of highly abundant source rocks. The formation of highly abundant source rocks was under the joint effects of the tectonic setting and the undercompensation environments of the passive continental marginal slope of the Paleo-Qjnling Ocean and deepwater bays. The paleo-geomorphologic troughs and/or fault depressions (because of tectonic movement) and deepwater bay environments together influenced the development scale of highly abundant source rocks, whereas the deepwater shelf environment of the continental marginal slope ensured the high quality of the source rocks.

AB  - Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the availability and use of low-cost particulate matter sensors in a wide range of air quality applications. They carry the promise of revolutionising air quality monitoring, yet considerable reservations exist regarding their performance and capabilities, thus hindering the broader-scale utilization of these devices. In order to address these concerns and assess their feasibility and accuracy for various applications, we evaluated six low-cost PM2.5 sensors (the Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F, Shinyei PPD42NS, Plantower PMS1003, Innociple PSM305, Nova SDS011 and Nova SDL607) in laboratory and field conditions using two combustion aerosols, concrete dust and ambient particles. In assessing the performance of these sensors, we focussed on indicators such as the linearity, accuracy and precision, critically differentiating between these qualities, and employed inter-comparison (the coefficient of determination, R-2). In the laboratory, all sensors responded well, with an R-2 > 0.91 when the PM2.5 concentration was > 50 mu g m(-3), as measured by the DustTrak. In particular, the PMS1003 demonstrated good accuracy and precision in both laboratory and ambient conditions. However, some limitations were noted for the tested sensors at lower concentrations. For example, the Sharp and Shinyei sensors showed poor correlations (R-2 < 0.1) with the DustTrak when the ambient PM2.5 concentration was < 20 mu g m(-3). These results suggest that the sensors should be calibrated individually for each source in the environment of their intended use. We demonstrate that when tested appropriately and used with a full understanding of their capabilities and limitations, low-cost sensors can serve as an unprecedented aid in a broad spectrum of air quality applications, including the emerging field of citizen science.

AB  - Based on biomarker analysis of crude oils from Western Qaidam Basin, the geochemical characteristics and significances of C-19-C-26 short-chain steranes were investigated. The oils are characterized by unimodal n-alkane distributions with even (C-18-C-24) predominance, low Pr/Ph (mostly < 0.5), high concentration of gammacerane, and the C-35-hopane over the C-34-hopane, suggesting high salinity and anoxic conditions typical of a saline lacustrine sedimentary environment. The short-chain steranes, comprising C-19 sterane, C-21 pregnane and C-22 homopregnane as well as C-23-C-26 steranes were detected in these crude oils. The relative abundance of these individual compounds showed positive correlations; especially C-21 pregnane and C-22 homopregnane were found to be closely correlated with other short-chain steranes. On the other hand, the C-25 sterane displayed general correlation with other short-chain steranes, whereas the C-26 sterane exhibit relatively poor correlation. The study of short-chain sterane distributions and of other aliphatic and aromatic compounds indicated that the relative concentration of short-chain steranes within the study area is controlled by multiple factors such as redox conditions of the depositional environment, water salinity, and thermal maturity of organic matter. Apparently, a weak-reducing environment with brackish water seems to contribute to the formation and enrichment of short-chain steranes. The abundances of these compounds relative to regular steranes increase with the increasing maturity of the oils, which may be possibly attributed to thermal stability reasons. Source-related biomarkers uncover the primary origin of short-chain steranes may be related to algae.

AB  - Background: Trimethylamine (TMA) is a nitrogenous base aliphatic organic compound accounting for the odor of rotten fish and it is used as an indicator for analyzing the quality of fish products.
   Introduction: Extraction procedures and analytical methods including colorimetric and Gas-Chromatography (GC) can quantify the TMA contents of fish products after pre-treatment with basic solutions. However, the extraction procedure and analytical methods for acid-treated samples are not known, despite the majority of fish products being preserved using acid preservatives.
   Methods: The methodologies used included solid-phase micro-extraction of TMA followed by its quantification by a GC-based analytical method. An analysis of response surface methodology was also conducted to verify the optimum conditions for TMA detection in acid-treated liquid samples affected by factors including trapping time, temperature, and stirring speed.
   Results: The results obtained from this study showed that the optimum conditions for the best yield of TMA extraction are 20 min of trapping, emission at 55 degrees C, and stirring at 400 rpm. The validation of the developed method was carried out using rotten fish after acid treatment. Acid treatment decreased TMA by up to 73.01%, however, when adding NaOH solution of the same volume to the samples, TMA increased similar to the control group.
   Conclusion: Here, we report a simple, sensitive, and rapid extraction procedure. A GC-based analytical method was developed for the analysis of TMA from the acid-treated sample. The developed extraction procedure and analytical methods were optimized and validated, which could be helpful for the extraction of TMA without damaging the sample.

AB  - Synthetic musk compounds are extensively used in personal care and cosmetic products around the world. Because they are not completely removed in sewage treatment plants, they eventually end up in aquatic environments. The aim of this reviewwas to summarize published information on effects of polycyclicmusks on aquatic organisms and to discuss whether the experimental design of toxicological studies involving these substances could influence the results obtained. With the exception of one study run in a flow-through system, all published toxicological studies on synthetic polycyclic musks have been conducted in semi-static or even static systems. Based upon data in the literature and our own results, we conclude that in toxicological tests with semi-static set-ups, concentrations of polycyclic musks decrease with time between bath exchanges, and, as a result, tested organisms are not being exposed to stable concentrations but rather to concentration pulses. The duration and character of these pulses are influenced mainly by aeration of experimental baths, as polycyclicmusks have a tendency to volatilize from water baths. Under semi-static conditions, tested organisms may be subjected to lower concentration of the tested substance for relatively long periods. Those levels may even fall below the limits of quantification. During these periods, some level of detoxification and/or elimination (depuration) of the toxicant may reduce toxic effect of the previous exposures. Consequently, toxicity of polycyclic musk substances for aquatic organisms obtained under these conditions may be underestimated. Based upon existing data in the literature, therefore, it is very difficult to correctly estimate risk of polycyclic musks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A fundamental question underlying skeletal mineral secretion in marine invertebrates is the extent to which the physico-chemical parameters of seawater (e.g., salinity, temperature) and animal physiology influence their skeletal mineralogy and chemistry. Groups with more complex mineralogies, such as bryozoans, have the ability to actively control their own skeletal composition in response to environmental conditions and could be considered indicators of global environmental change. Thus, this study aims to reveal how the unique environmental conditions of low salinity (circa 24-26), prominent seasonality and semi-isolation of the White Sea (WS) subarctic region caused by the last glaciation (12,000 ya) affect the carbonate skeletal geochemical composition of bryozoans. X-ray diffraction analysis of 27 bryozoan taxa (92 specimens) revealed a completely monomineral calcite composition of skeletons with a mean value of 6.9 +/- 1.8 mol% MgCO3 and moderate variability at the species and family levels. Most specimens (43.5%) precipitated skeletal magnesium within the range of 7-8 mol% MgCO3. Regional analysis of the mineralogical profile of the White Sea bryozoans shows that they differ statistically from bryozoan species living in the neighbouring Arctic and temperate Scotland regions in terms of magnesium content in calcite (approximately 7 mol% MgCO3 in the White Sea versus 5 mol% MgCO3 in other regions). We suggest that the effect of low salinity on magnesium content was compensated by relatively high summer temperature causing rapid growth and calcification and possibly resulted in the increased Mg contents in the White Sea (WS) bryozoans. However, on a local scale (between sampling locations), the influence of temperature and salinity could be excluded as a source of observed intraspecific variability. The concentration of MgCO3 in skeletons of the studied bryozoans is controlled by other environmental variables or is species specific and depends on the physiological processes of the organisms.

AB  - Soil water shortage is a critical limiting factor that threaten the growth of vegetation and their sustainability in semi-arid areas. Grasses directly respond to the soil water availability (SWA), and the soil water shortage degree can be studied through plant physiological response thresholds under soil drought stress. In this study, the lower-and-optimal limitation of SWA was evaluated with pots along the soil water gradient by quantifying plant gas exchange parameters. These parameters showed a strong cubic relationship with the relative soil water content (RWC) in four forage species. The lower limitation of RWC was obtained for Onobrychis viciifolia (4.0%-20.2%), followed by Astragalus adsurgens (15.5%-25.5%), Elymus nutans (16.1%-27.2%), and Lolium multiflorum (24.6%-35.8%). The average RWC was of 74.83%, and the water saturation point of water use efficiency (WSPWUE) showed a similar critical scope in the four species: Onobrychis viciifolia (71.2%-82.8%), Astragalus adsurgens (72.1%-84.2%), Elymus nutans (79.3%-85.1%), and Lolium multiflorum (76.7%-85.6%). The highest productivity with the highest availability of water (HPHAW) for Onobrychis viciifolia, Astragalus adsurgens, Elymus nutans and Lolium multiflorum was of 71.2%-82.8%, 72.1%-84.2%, 79.3%-85.1% and 76.7%-85.6%, respectively. The lower limitation of RWC, the maximum water use efficiency (WUEmax) and HPHAW in legumes were lower than those values obtained in gramineae, suggesting that legumes were more susceptible to soil drought stress. We concluded that plant gas exchange parameters acted as indicators for SWA under drought conditions, and represented a valuable tool for identifying SWA threshold response in environmental changes.

AB  - Foodborne outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of blueberries contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. The microbial quality of blueberries could be influenced by the conditions of hygiene prevailing during post harvest handling. This study evaluated the hygienic conditions of 6 selected fresh blueberry packing lines. Five of the packing lines were sampled twice and the remaining one was sampled once during the summer of 2015 and the summer of 2017. A delimited area (100 cm(2)) on each of the ten selected sites of the packing lines was swabbed with sterile sponges before the packing started (AM samples), during lunchtime break (NOON samples), and at the end of a packing day (PM samples). The sponges were thoroughly rinsed with Dey-Engley neutralization broth which was subsequently sampled for total aerobes, yeasts and molds, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci. Results showed that sample site and sampling time had a significant influence (P <= 0.05) on total aerobic, yeast and mold, and total coliform counts. The PM samples had significantly higher (P <= 0.05) total aerobic and yeast and mold counts than the NOON samples which had significantly higher (P <= 0.05) counts than the AM samples. Fourty-six out of the 310 (14.8%) collected samples tested positive for enterococci while 27 (8.7%) samples tested positive for fecal coliforms. Berry lugs, rubber belts on color sorters, and premature berry disposing areas had significantly higher (P <= 0.05) microbial counts than the other sites. The study suggests that some sites along fresh blueberry packing lines could become contaminated by micro-organisms during packing. Whether these contaminated sites will become a food safety concern depends on the incidence of pathogen presence in the microbial community and efficacy of routine sanitizing treatments.

AB  - Detailed chemostratigraphy across the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary in northern Tunisia points to several prevailing paleoceanographic conditions during the deposition of organic-rich beds of Bahloul Formation. The sedimentological study shows that there is no correlation between color and CaCO3 content because both dark and light-colored intervals of Bahloul Formation are carbonate-rich. Stable isotope analysis displays a positive carbon isotope excursion characterized by four significant peaks (I to IV) which are ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 parts per thousand. These peaks represent episodes of elevated rates of organic carbon burial during the C/T oceanic anoxic event (C/T boundary OAE2). The Cenomanian-Turonian boundary could be situated between the third isotopic peak and the filament event. The total organic carbon (TOC) measurements show values ranging from 0.28 to 6.19% with average value of 3.5%. This indicates that the Bahloul Formation shale is a very good oil source rock. The Hydrogen Index (HI) values range from 359 to 698 mg HC/g TOC. The T-max values range from 390 to 438 degrees C. Binary diagrams HI vs. T-max indicate a type II with values falling within the immature organic-matter range. The concentrations major elements reveal low values of Ti and K. The correlation between Al and Ti and K shows a significant correlation pointing to homogeneous provenance. Primary productivity indicators (Cu, Ba, and Ni) record its association with organic matter. Redox-sensitive elements such as U, V, and Mo and the high values of V/(V + Ni) ratio indicate a strongly reducing environment which led to the better preservation of the organic matter.

AB  - Recent years have seen increased interest in the application of on-line condition monitoring of medium voltage networks as the need to maintain and operate ageing cable networks increases. Detection and analysis of partial discharge (PD) activity is generally used as an indicator of pre-breakdown processes that may be indicative of insulation degradation over time. A significant challenge for on-line monitoring is discrimination between multiple partial discharge sources that will often naturally exist in the data. To discriminate between PD sources each PD signal is represented as a feature vector and a clustering algorithm is used to identify clusters in the resulting feature vector space, often after dimensional reduction. Each cluster identified in the data corresponds to a distinct PD source. In this work a comparison of clustering algorithms and dimensional reduction techniques is performed to identify clusters for a variety of PD data sets, in all cases the feature vector is created using wavelet decomposition energies. The three clustering algorithms used were Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Ordering Points to Identify Clustering Structure (OPTICS) and Simple Statistics-based Near Neighbour clustering technique (SSNN). The two dimensional reduction techniques considered were Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE). At present the most commonly used combination of dimensional reduction technique and clustering algorithm for PD data are PCA and DBSCAN respectively. From the comparison performed in this work it was found that t-SNE combined with OPTICS or SSNN were the most successful at clustering PD data. For use in practical situations SSNN is preferred over OPTICS as it requires only a single input parameter, which generally be hardcoded, leading to a completely autonomous technique. It is therefore suggested that a combination of t-SNE and SSNN is particularly appropriate for discriminating PD sources.

AB  - We evaluated effects of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen on the composition of forest understorey vegetation both in space and time, using repeated data from the European wide monitoring program ICP-Forests, which focuses on normally managed forest. Our aim was to assess whether both spatial and temporal effects of deposition can be detected by a multiple regression approach using data from managed forests over a relatively short time interval, in which changes in the tree layer are limited. To characterize the vegetation, we used indicators derived from cover percentages per species using multivariate statistics and indicators derived from the presence/absence, that is, species numbers and Ellenberg's indicator values. As explanatory variables, we used climate, altitude, tree species, stand age, and soil chemistry, besides deposition of nitrate, ammonia and sulfate. We analyzed the effects of abiotic conditions at a single point in time by canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regression. The relation between the change in vegetation and abiotic conditions was analyzed using redundancy analysis and multiple regression, for a subset of the plots that had both abiotic data and enough species to compute a mean Ellenberg N value per plot using a minimum of three species. Results showed that the spatial variation in the vegetation is mainly due to "traditional" factors such as soil type and climate, but a statistically significant part of the variation could be ascribed to atmospheric deposition of nitrate. The change in the vegetation over the past c. 10 years was also significantly correlated to nitrate deposition. Although the effect of deposition on the individual species could not be clearly defined, the effect on the vegetation as a whole was a shift toward nitrophytic species as witnessed by an increase in mean Ellenberg's indicator value.

AB  - Species distributions are influenced by variation in environmental conditions across many scales. Knowledge of fine-scale habitat requirements is important for predicting species occurrence and identifying suitable habitat for target species. Here we investigate the perplexing distribution of a riparian habitat specialist, the western subspecies of the purple-crowned fairy-wren (Malurus coronatus coronatus), in relation to fine-scale habitat associations and patterns of riparian degradation. Surveys of vegetation attributes, river structure and disturbance indicators that are likely to be causal determinants of the species occurrence were undertaken at 635 sites across 14 catchments. Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling demonstrated that the probability of purple-crowned fairy-wren occurrence increased with Pandanus aquaticus crown cover, shrub density and height of emergent trees, while riparian structure and signs of cattle were indirect predictors of occurrence. As our study area predominantly contained Pandanus type habitat, we failed to identify river grass as an important component of habitat. Predictions from a cross-validated model of purple-crowned fairy-wren occurrence suggested distribution is constrained by three factors: (i) low quality of local habitat within catchments where the species occurs; (ii) broad-scale reduction in habitat quality that has resulted in extinction of the species from parts of its range; and (iii) unmeasured variables that limit the exploitation of suitable habitat. The reliance of the species on dense shrubby understorey suggests conservation efforts should aim to maintain the complexity of understorey structure by managing fire and grazing intensity. Efforts to halt the continuing decline of riparian condition and maintain connectivity between areas of quality habitat will help to ensure persistence of riparian habitat specialists in northern Australia.

AB  - A benefit of wetland preservation and restoration is the ecosystem service of improving water quality, typically assessed based on bacterial loading. The Ballona Wetlands, a degraded salt marsh of approximately 100 ac located on the southern border of Marina Del Rey (Los Angeles County, California, USA) are currently the focus of publicly funded restoration planning. The wetlands receive tidal water, usually contaminated with fecal indicator bacteria (FIB: total and fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci) from the adjacent Ballona Creek and Estuary. During the summer of 2007, two 24-h studies were conducted to determine FIB tidal dynamics within the wetland. Measurements of water flow and mean FIB concentrations (n = 3) were measured every 1.5 h to determine total FIB load estimates. FIB loading rates (MPN/s) were greatest during flood tides as water entered the wetlands, and then again during spring tide conditions when sediments were resuspended during swifter spring ebb flows. During daylight hours, the wetland acted as a sink for these bacteria as loads diminished, presumably by sunlight and other processes. Conversely, during late afternoon and night, the wetlands shifted to being a source as excess FIB departed on ebb flows. Therefore, the wetlands act as both a source and sink for FIB depending on tidal conditions and exposure to sunlight. Future restoration actions would result in a tradeoff - increased tidal channels offer a greater surface area for FIB inactivation, but also would result in a greater volume of FIB-contaminated resuspended sediments carried out of the wetlands on stronger ebb flows. As levels of FIB in Ballona Creek and Estuary diminish through recently established regulatory actions, the wetlands could shift into a greater sink for FIB. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Question: Is demographic performance of Primula vulgaris correlated with habitat characteristics of the small landscape elements in which it occurs? Can we use this species as an indicator for species-rich semi-natural habitats?
   Location: Flanders. Belgium.
   Methods: To capture differences in demographic traits and habitat characteristics, both within and between populations, a two-level survey was carried out. Population size and structure of 89 P. vulgaris populations in different types of small landscape elements was recorded in 1999. At plot level, densities of different life stages were determined and these were related to edaphic conditions and vegetation structure and composition.
   Results: Three different population types were distinguished: (1) dynamic populations. characterized by seedling and juvenile proportions. (2) normal populations with relatively more adults. but with considerable numbers of seedlings and juveniles and (3) senescent populations, mainly consisting of adults. Senescent populations were significantly smaller than populations with a dynamic demo graphic structure. At plot level. comparison of demographic characteristics between different management regimes revealed that recruitment rates and total plant density of P. vulgaris were highest in plots that received a regime that included mowing and clearing of ditch banks whereas densities were lower along forest edges. For these plots. it was shown that nutrient levels were higher. Densities of adults as well as juvenile and seedling densities were negatively correlated with vegetation height.
   Conclusions: Local disturbance and heterogeneity may mask the relationship between unfavourable conditions and demographic characteristics at population level. but it is clear that in small populations recruitment needs to be lifted to guarantee its persistence. Performance of P. vulgaris in small landscape elements can be a first indication of plant species diversity in small landscape elements.

TI  - The Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL): A new indicator of the impact of mortality shocks on the individual lifespan, with application to mortality reversals induced by COVID-19
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - EXPECTANCY
AB  - Declines in period life expectancy at birth (PLEB) provide seemingly intuitive indicators of the impact of a cause of death on the individual lifespan. Derived under the assumption that future mortality conditions will remain indefinitely those observed during a reference period, however, their intuitive interpretation becomes problematic when period conditions reflect a temporary mortality "shock", resulting from a natural disaster or the diffusion of a new epidemic in the population for instance. Rather than to make assumptions about future mortality, I propose measuring the difference between a period average age at death and the average expected age at death of the same individuals (death cohort): the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL). For fine-grained tracking of the mortality impact of an epidemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. For illustration, quarterly MUL values in 2020 are derived from estimates of COVID-19 deaths that might substantially underestimate overall mortality change in affected populations. These results nonetheless illustrate how MUL tracks the mortality impact of the pandemic in several national and sub-national populations. Using a seven-day rolling window, the empirical shortcut suggests MUL peaked at 6.43 years in Lombardy, 8.91 years in New Jersey, and 6.24 years in Mexico City for instance. Sensitivity analyses are presented, but in the case of COVID-19, the main uncertainty remains the potential gap between reported COVID-19 deaths and actual increases in the number of deaths induced by the pandemic in some of the most affected countries. Using actual number of deaths rather than reported COVID-19 deaths may increase seven-day MUL from 6.24 to 8.96 years in Mexico City and from 2.67 to 5.49 years in Lima for instance. In Guayas (Ecuador), MUL is estimated to have reached 12.7 years for the entire month of April 2020.

AB  - Energy is one of the most important social and economic infrastructures and human life is strongly depends on it. In recent years, the occurrence of natural disasters such as drought as a high-impact low-probability event is undeniable. So, energy planning in the disruption situation is necessary in order to anticipate and maintain the performance of the energy system in optimal condition. This paper focuses on developing a hybrid long-term framework for evaluating the energy system resilience based on sustainability concept against drought. The model bridges the gap between long-term energy system planning in macro level and short-term switching operations or micro level modeling approach in response to drought resulted by climate change. The new resilience indexes are used to maximize the social welfare, to minimize the energy needed but not supplied (ENNS), to recover the system performance rapidly and minimum the total cost of the energy system after occurring drought. When disaster happens, the modeling of energy systems will do through two stages because the behavior of the system should be considered, compare and analyzed before and after disruption events. On the other hand, the system uncertainties, possible futures and different strategies can change the optimal path of the energy needed supply, which is examined by scenario analysis in the proposed model. So, the developed model is a two-stage optimization model with linear programming approach and scenario analyzing model with a combination of back-casting and forward future approaches Numerical model is performed on UTOPIA energy system and its results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Processing quality of winter-wheat is affected by genotype, environmental conditions, and crop husbandry practices. In the present study, a data set of 17 quality-related traits for 211 main winter-wheat varieties in China during 2006 to 2018 was extracted from China Wheat Quality Report. Analysis was carried out to evaluate the quality status and variations, to reveal correlation between quality-related traits, as well as to identify key influencing factors. Results indicated that the quality indicators of medium-gluten or medium-strong-gluten wheat varieties were acceptable, whereas those of weak- and strong-gluten wheat varieties were far below national standard, especially hardness index (HI), crude protein content (CPC), wet gluten content (WG), and water absorption for weak-gluten wheat and sedimentation value (SV), stability time (ST), and stretch area (SA) for strong-gluten wheat, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that WA, WG, development time, HI, CPC, falling number, ST, and tractility directly affected the overall quality of winter-wheat. CPC, SV, and WG in medium-gluten wheat had no significant correlation with the processing quality of noodles score, whereas gluten index significantly correlated with noodle score (P < 0.001). This implied that protein quality might play a more important role than protein quantity in determining medium-gluten wheat quality. Furthermore, analysis of variance showed that genetic characteristics (cultivars) had significant influences on the restriction indexes (SV, ST, and SA) of strong-gluten wheat, whereas genetic characteristics, environment conditions, and crop growing practices (cultivars, locations, and years) significantly affected the restriction indexes (HI, CPC, WG, and WA) of weak-gluten wheat. The results suggest that improvement of Chinese strong-gluten wheat should mainly focus on cultivating new varieties. As to weak-gluten wheat, cultivation and husbandry practices should be paid more attention to limit undesired high grain protein content.

AB  - This research aims at assessing the environmental impacts exerted by a smart motorway compared to those of a traditional motorway. The study has global policy implications: it takes into account the impacts due to the construction and maintenance of the infrastructure and the environmental effects produced by the traffic emissions, taking into account smart technologies and truck platooning regulation. Through a classical LCA approach, 1 km-long smart motorway with 2m-high embankmentwas assumed as the functional unit for the analysis. A realistic traffic condition has been considered. A comparison between environmental effects produced by the use of virgin material and by Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement wasmade by assuming twomaintenance plans. Thanks to C-ITS systemsthe greater safety featured by smartmotorways has a significant effect on the environmental impact, compared to conventional motorways. The impact produced by safety barriers during the life cycle was also estimated. For smart motorways the impact categories GWP, POCP, AP and EP are observed to be considerably reduced in the maintenance phase of zinc-coated steel safety barriers and in those associated to traffic emissions. It must be noted that in smart motorways vehicle emissions are markedly influenced by the percentage of heavy vehicles travelling in Truck Platooning mode. The results showthat concomitant use of lime stabilization and RAP leads to a significant reduction in energy consumption (up to 35%) and pollutant emissions (up to 34% of CO2) than in case of exclusiveuse of virginmaterial. The accidents reduction produce a 30% decrease of GWP, POCP, AP and EP related to safety barriers maintenance phase than the corresponding values of traditional motorway. Truck platooning mode generates GWP reduction close to 4%. The environmental advantages of a smart motorway increase progressively with the increase of AADT, platooning truck percentage and heavy vehicles percentage. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The clear relationship between the microbiome and the general well-being of metazoans has motivated the characterization of bacterial communities in cultured species for future microbiome monitoring and modulation to improve productivity. To study the bacterial diversity associated with farmed adult P. monodon at harvest, guts, gastric mills (GM), pond water and sediments were investigated using next-generation sequencing technology in two control ponds (CP1 and CP2) where animals showed a healthy appearance, and two low productive ponds (LP1 and LP2) where animals showed signs of disease. Animals from CP2 were on average at least 4 g heavier than animals from other ponds, and the final yield of both CP was more than double that of LP. LP2 showed the lowest diversity indices, which can potentially be attributed to high abundance of Vibrio spp. and warm water conditions (31.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C on average). The structure of the bacterial community in the gut, GM and water samples was different between CP and LP. Vibrio spp. and anaerobic bacteria (e.g. Fusibacter) were enriched in the gastrointestinal tract of animals from LP (LDA >= 4). While Vibrio can potentially act against the host and other members of the bacterial community, Fusibacter might be an indicator of sulfur compounds accumulation in the animal as the hepatopancreas becomes affected by a PirA toxin. Enrichment of Cyanobacteria in the water (LDA = 4.38) and members of Desulfobacteraceae in sediments of LP (5% on average) could be environmental stress indicators in summer conditions. Characterizing bacterial microbiomes in aquaculture is important to detect indicators of health and productivity that can be used as monitoring tools in the animal s gastrointestinal tract and the environment, ultimately enabling a targeted modulation of the bacterial community for improved production.

AB  - A record of the conditions and duration of Archean serpentinization is preserved as chemical, isotopic, and textural properties of the magnesium-chromium hydroxycarbonate mineral stichtite. This provides a window into the conditions associated with a potentially habitable environment on early Earth and Mars. Stichtite is associated with Archean chromite-rich serpentinite rocks of South Africa, Western Australia and Southern India. Stichtite compositions range within the Cr-Fe-Al hydrotalcite group, with trends unique to each discrete serpentinite host body. Elemental and textural analysis of stichtite-associated chromite indicates that stichtite forms in fore-arc/layered intrusive/boninite setting rocks through interaction of chromite and methane-rich serpentinizing fluids. The degree to which chromite is replaced by stichtite is inferred to correlate with the length of time that the host rocks spent within the "stichtite window." Carbon stable-isotope values of Archean stichtite suggest carbon sourcing from marine kerogen with minor marine dissolved inorganic carbonate in most samples, as opposed to the strongly kerogen-dominated Phanerozoic stichtite. The carbon and hydrogen stable isotope profile of Archean stichtite ranges from the methane fields of active serpentinizing zones, to geothermal, with trends suggestive of methane oxidation rather than the substrate depletion noted in Phanerozoic stichtite. Thus, isotope values of stichtite appear to record oceanic oxygenation levels. The association of the stichtite 2H polytype (nee barbertonite) with aragonite +/- antigorite suggests this is a higher pressure/temperature polytype of stichtite. Reaction textures, isotopic values, and qualitative mineral thermobarometric indicators indicate that stichtite forms during serpentinization in a methane/H-2-rich environment within fluid conduits, ranging from near the surface, to depths where pressure is up to 2.8 GPa and temperature is up to similar to 300 degrees C.

AB  - The inventory of long-term braiding activity is a useful tool for detecting alterations in a rivers' hydromorphological state and for a river's management in the context of the Water Framework Directive on integrated river basin management for Europe. Our study focuses on braided sectors of rivers in South-Eastern Subcarpathians (Romania). The inventory evaluates types of alterations based on the spatial analysis of fluvial morphology indicators (i.e., length of the river sector forming a braided pattern; width of the braided active channel), and vegetation cover (i.e., length of banks covered by forest and shrubs; area of in-stream patches of shrubs) accumulated over the last century. Furthermore, we performed a regional scale hierarchical cluster analysis to estimate the degree of alteration when compared to an historical baseline. In South-Eastern Subcarpathians, the studied rivers experienced a decrease of braiding activity revealed by the shortening and narrowing of their braided sectors, expansion of riparian forests, and the diminishment of vegetated islands' areas. We separated three types of river clusters, corresponding to low (cluster 1), moderate (cluster 2), and high (cluster 3) degree of alteration. Moreover, the clusters demonstrate the evolutionary path of the braided pattern alterations until the functioning of another channel pattern. The inventory is relevant for differing types and levels of alterations. Additionally, this tool may serve as a first step toward the restoration of altered sectors by identifying rivers in cluster 1 as potential candidates of present-day reference sites for altered rivers with similar natural conditions as in cluster 3.

AB  - Ability to understand the factors driving horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance from unknown, harmless bacteria to pathogens is crucial in order to tackle the growing resistance problem. However, current methods to measure effects of stressors on horizontal gene transfer have limitations and often fall short, as the estimated endpoints can be a mix of both the number of transfer events and clonal growth of transconjugants. Our aim was therefore to achieve a proper strategy for assessing the minimal concentration of a stressor (exemplified by tetracycline) that drives horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance from a complex community to a model pathogen. Conditions were optimized to improve a culture-based approach using the bacterial community of treated sewage effluent as donor, and fluorescent, traceable Escherichia coli as recipient. Reduced level of background resistance, differentiation of isolates as well as decreased risk for measuring effects of selection were achieved through the use of chromogenic medium, optimization of conjugation time as well as applying a different antibiotic for isolation of transconjugants than the one tested for its ability to drive transfer. Using this assay, we showed that a very low concentration of tetracycline, 10 mu g/L i.e. 150 times below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the recipient, promoted horizontal transfer of multiple antibiotic-resistance determinants. Higher concentrations favoured selection of a tetracycline-resistance phenotype along with a decline in the number of detectable transfer events. The described method can be used to evaluate different environmental conditions and factors that trigger horizontal dissemination of mobile resistance elements, eventually resulting in the formation of drug-resistant pathogens.

AB  - The use of ripened fine-grained organic dredged materials as construction materials, e.g. as top soil on slopes such as landfills or dikes, is an important contribution to environmental engineering science. The materials are legally considered a waste and need to be beneficially re-used. Therefore, not only standard geotechnical parameters have to be determined but also their erosion resistance which is a particularly critical environmental parameter. There is a variety of different tests to determine the flow dependent erosion resistance of soils, such as the erosion function apparatus (Briaud et al. 2001). In this study, however, the focus lays on the aggregate stability as an indicator for the erosion resistance under static loading, which can be determined using wet sieving and disintegration tests. The disintegration tests after Wei ss mann (2003) and Endell (RPW 2006) have a similar setup; however, the specific boundary conditions for the tests as well as the evaluation procedures are different. Wei ss mann proposed his test to determine the erosion stability of dike cover materials while the Endell test should be used for mineral sealing liners in navigation channels. In this study both tests have been used to evaluate the aggregate stability of fine-grained organic dredged materials that have been installed in large-scale research dike facilities and in the recultivation layers of different landfills. The materials showed good visual performance with respect to rainfall induced erosion so far; however, problems in determining erosion and aggregate stability indices limit the value of the studies: both disintegration tests investigated have major limitations with respect to the organic soils tested. Particularly the evaluation methods are not suitable for the soils but also some boundary conditions are critical and are discussed in this paper. The gained knowledge is a valuable basis for the development of standard characterisation methods for dredged materials in environmental and geotechnical applications.

AB  - We present a multiproxy characterization of a complex, polycyclic soil sequence from Les Alcusses, Moixent (Valencia, SE Spain). The area has abundant settlements dating from early Neolithic to Roman times. The sequence comprises six main units, dating back to 8.7-8.5 ka cal BR We integrated mineralogy, inorganic (pH, grain size, elemental composition) and organic chemistry (pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, pyrolysis GC/MS), micro-charcoal, pollen and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) data. All data is contextualized within a framework of archaeological information and radiocarbon dating, with the aim of deciphering the Holocene environmental changes.
   We infer a shift from wetter and warmer, in the early-mid Holocene, to drier and cooler climatic conditions with increased fire occurrence, in the mid-late Holocene (particularly after 5.3 ka cal BP). Although the pollen record indicates a rapid forest retreat and expansion of grasslands for the Neolithic period, local proxies (molecular soil OM indicators and NPP) point to the presence of pine forest in the studied location well after the regional decline started. The same proxies suggest a sharp forest decline after about 7.0 ka cal BR Strong soil erosion, likely linked both to climatic instability and the intensification of human exploitation, resulted in a hiatus from the late Neolithic to the Roman period. A certain climate amelioration, wetter conditions and land abandonment or, at least, lower human pressure, are suggested for the late Roman period/Early Middle Ages. Direct evidence of changes in soil properties due to agriculture was not detected in the sequence except for the upper soil unit studied, which reflects intense agricultural management (with the possible use of agrochemicals).

AB  - Characterization of bulk organic matter (OM) from lacustrine sediments of Frickenhauser See (northern Bavaria, Germany) reveals considerable variation during the last two millennia. Atomic C/N ratios and total organic carbon (TOC) content are positively correlated with arboreal pollen percentages which are used as an indicator of land-use intensity. Despite possible alterations of OM during early diagenesis, differences between three major lithological units are large enough to be interpreted as human impact on the sedimentation of CM in the lake. Sediments deposited prior to deforestation in the catchment area (unit C) are characterized by mean C/N ratios of 14.5, indicating a mixed composition of organic matter derived from lacustrine and terrestrial sources (forest litter). During a period of intensive soil erosion (ca. 1000 AD until 1870 AD; unit B), low C/N ratios of around 7.7 suggest that the relative proportion of forest litter decreased in favour of the lacustrine component and soil OM. Terrestrial plant detritus is only transported into the lake through numerous turbidite events. Deforestation and agriculture also coincide with a decreasing TOC content from an average value of 10.7% to 1.5%. This decrease is explained through a dilution effect due to the high input of minerogenic matter. Stable carbon isotopes indicate eutrophication of the lake due to the mobilization of nutrients through soil erosion. Starting around 1870 AD, organic-rich sapropelic sediments are deposited (unit A). A decline of turbidite events and increased wind shelter from trees due to reduced land-use intensity led to meromictic conditions. Consequently, negative excursions in the delta C-13 isotope record at the onset of unit A probably reflect methanogenesis under permanently anoxic conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organic and inorganic geochemical indicators were examined in a 3-m core collected from the mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay (CB) to determine how sources of organic matter (OM) have changed during the preceding three centuries of increasing anthropogenic influence in this region. This study also establishes the history of eutrophication and anoxia/hypoxia and relates these processes to changes in OM deposition and preservation and to historical events within the Bay's watershed. The sediment record shows that a marked increase in organic carbon (35%-50%), biogenic silica (18%) and total sulfur (42%) occurs between 1934 and 1948. This transition is likely due to increasing anoxic/hypoxic bottom water conditions as indicated by an abrupt change in sulfur speciation. Lipid biomarker distributions indicate that a substantial change in the sources of OM deposited since 1934 has also occurred. Biomarker compounds derived from phytoplankton and microbial sources show a 2- to CfoId increase in their abundance relative to total organic carbon (TOC) between 1948 and 1975. Using both diagenetic models and information on lipid reactivity, an effort is made to distinguish compositional changes due to changes in OM delivery (both quantity and quality) from changes that may be due to OM degradation. It appears that enhanced OM production in the mesohaline region of CB has contributed to the observed changes in quantity and character of OM preserved in sediments from this site. Increased inorganic fertilizer application and human population growth in the watershed are coincident with the onset of eutrophic and hypoxic conditions in CB, suggesting that anthropogenic activities within estuarine watersheds may exert a substantial influence on carbon cycling processes in estuaries and potentially the coastal ocean, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) are significant indicators for evaluating the environmental consequences of climate changes in arid regions. Understanding of the relationship between these changes and land surface properties of the arid regions is important in land planning. The Gavkhoni playa is a closed basin in the arid zone of Iran that has recently undergone significant environmental changes due to decreasing precipitations. The objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal changes of its LST and NDVI before and after the drought event of 2014-2018. Through the application of an integrated method based on cellular fractal model and continuous wavelet transform (CWT), we investigated the relationship between variation of surface fractal dimension and distribution of LST and NDVI changes before and after the drought. The results indicated substantial changes in LST and NDVI values associated with the onset of drought conditions. Changes in the spatial distribution of LST and NDVI were particularly high in the central playa area, the western and southern sides of the playa, including the salt lake, the wetlands, and the clay flat. These areas correspond to the zone 4 of the fractal dimension map where extreme topographic anomaly and complexity. Wavelet analysis confirmed the relationship between the surface fractal dimension pattern and anomalies in LST and NDVI variations. The investigation highlighted the ability of the integrated application of the cellular fractal model and wavelet analysis to quantify the relationship between land surface properties and the spatial variation of LST and NDVI in changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been identified as one of the cleanest producers of green energy. AD typically uses organic materials as feedstock and, through a series of biological processes, produces methane. Farmyard manure and slurry (FYM&S) are important AD feedstock and are typically mixed with agricultural waste, grass and/or food wastes. The feedstock may contain many different pathogens which can survive the AD process and hence also possibly be present in the final digestate. In this study, a semi-quantitative screening tool was developed to rank pathogens of potential health concern emerging from AD digestate. A scoring system was used to categorise likely inactivation during AD, hazard pathways and finally, severity as determined from reported human mortality rates, number of global human-deaths and infections per 100,000 populations. Five different conditions including mesophilic and thermophilic AD and three different pasteurisation conditions were assessed in terms of specific pathogen inactivation. In addition, a number of scenarios were assessed to consider foodborne incidence data from Ireland and Europe and to investigate the impact of raw FYM&S application (without AD and pasteurisation). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the score for the mortality rate (53) was the most sensitive parameter (rank coefficient 0.49) to influence the final score 5; followed by thermal inactivation score (SI. 0.25) and potential contamination pathways (52, 0.16). Across all the scenarios considered, the screening tool prioritised Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella spp., norovirus, Streptococcus pyogenes, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella Iyphi ( followed by S. paratyphi), Clostridium spp., Lisleria monocytogenes and Campylobacter coli as the highest-ranking pathogens of human health concern resulting from AD digestate in Ireland. This tool prioritises potentially harmful pathogens which can emerge from AD digestate and highlights where regulation and intervention may be required. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Records of fluvial suspended sediment fluxes are sensitive indicators of hydrometeorological and permafrost change. Here we document the watershed-scale suspended sediment flux response to a period of hydrometeorological change and landscape disturbance in two High Arctic rivers. Net in-channel and extra-channel sediment storage and changing hydrometeorological conditions dampen the downstream transport of increased sediment delivery from localized permafrost slope disturbances. Our results show that the impact of permafrost disturbance is likely a smaller effect than a shift toward a pluvially (rainfall) dominated hydrological regime in these environments. Suspended sediment transport is energy limited under contemporary hydrometeorological conditions, and the transition from a nival to pluvial dominated flow and sediment transfer regime will likely accelerate landscape change in the High Arctic.
   Plain Language Summary The long-term impact and response of High Arctic river systems to climate and landscape change remain poorly constrained. We investigate the effects of climate and permafrost change on sediment transport in two High Arctic rivers in Canada (75 degrees N) during a period of rapid climate change and landscape disturbance using a 15-year record of suspended sediment export-the longest record of its kind in the High Arctic. We find that increased sediment erosion from permafrost landscape disturbances has not increased the downstream-suspended sediment export beyond an immediate, short-lived response due to (1) the rivers ability to store additional sediment and (2) offsetting hydroclimatic controls. Our findings further suggest that these river systems are potentially in a transition period, shifting from a snowmelt to a rainfall dominated flow regime, but current rainfall magnitudes are below a critical threshold to mobilize additional sediment in these systems. We conclude that increased rainfall magnitude is likely to be the tipping point to significant long-term geomorphic change and downstream effects in the Canadian High Arctic.

AB  - In open ocean waters thallium (Tl) belongs to the group of conservative elements, even though deviations from this trend have been observed in NW German coastal waters. Here, we report on tidal, seasonal and spatial dynamics of Tl along with Mo and Mn in the water column of a backbarrier tidal flat close to the island of Spiekeroog, the Jade system (Inner Jade and Jade Bay) and the adjacent offshore region. Dissolved thallium (Tl-diss) displays strong tidal and seasonal variations (similar to 25-60 pM) unrelated to salinity. In all study areas, Tl-diss clearly deviates from conservative behavior. In general, Tl-diss is low during low tide (with a loss of up to 50%) and inversely related to Mn-diss, except in summer. The tidal Tl variations as well as the loss of Tl in the water column may be due to Tl removal from pore waters in reducing sediments and drainage of Tl-free but Mn-rich pore waters into the water column during low tide. The negative Tl anomaly can be traced offshore for more than 40 km to the island of Helgoland.
   The redox chemistry of Tl is not well studied, and Tl removal from pore waters was previously suggested to only occur under anoxic/sulfidic conditions. By contrast, our preliminary pore water results suggest that Tl could be removed already under slightly reducing (suboxic) conditions, likely along with microbially induced Mn reduction in the sediments. Therefore, this study supports the biological involvement in the aqueous cycling of Tl. We propose the use of Tl-diss next to Mn-diss as valuable indicator of suboxic or anoxic pore water discharge to the coastal realm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Burrowing and mud mound-building life-habits of quasiterrestrial fiddler crab Uca lactea from Bengal coast under specific substrate (soft aqueous mud deceptively occurring below rigid sand), hydrodynamic (low-energy and shallow inundation) and geomorphic (coastal mudflats around estuary mouth) conditions are addressed to evaluate geological and geotechnical importance. They construct mud-mounds at burrow (simple, I-shaped and un-branched) heads during tidal recession through oozing out of burrow-base mud-slur. Depth of tidal inundation and substrate undulations control mound population, height and types (dominance of short simple-mounds in high-grounds vs. tall compound-mounds in low-grounds allowing subaerial respiration). Loss of dwelling habitat through mound collapse during high tide is promptly compensated by new constructions. Microbial stabilization of mounds through seasonal algal bloom enhances their preservation under freshly deposited sand layers. They also produce mud-chimneys and feeding-pellets in association with Turritella spp. trails and worm burrows.
   Despite considerable preservation potentiality of Uca mud-mounds their exact ancient analogues are not yet known. The study provides firsthand criteria to recognize fossil burrows and mud-mounds of Uca and comparative analysis between U. marionis mud-volcanoes and U. lactea mud-mounds. Morphologically they are identical enough to constitute a unique ichnotaxon. The studied ichnocoenose corresponds in fossil records to Skolithos-Taphrhelminthopsis-Ophiomorpha-Planolites-Thalassinoides association within shallow marine Psilonichnus ichnofacies to which Uca mud-mounds are new entrants diagnostic of palaeoshoreline, especially shallow coastal-mudflats at high-tide level. Uca mud-mounds, by virtue of requirement of unique substrate conditions, are considered as ichnological indicators of erosion-prone coastal segments. Their global zoogeographic distribution allows wide application of this ichnological tool.

AB  - Sexual signals indicate species identity and mate quality, and their importance for mate attraction is largely recognized. Recently, research in animal communication has started to integrate multiple signal modalities and evaluate their interactions. However, mate choice experiments across animal taxa have been limited to laboratory conditions, and assessments of multiple sexual signals under field conditions are still lacking. We take advantage of the divergence in visual and acoustic signals among populations of the Neotropical poison frog Oophaga pumilio to evaluate the importance of male advertisement calls and color patterns in female mate selection. Previous mate choice experiments in this species suggested color-assortative female mate preferences across many populations. Nevertheless, acoustic signals are crucial for sexual selection in frogs, and males of O. pumilio use advertisement calls to attract females. We hypothesize that both advertisement calls and coloration affect female mate selection in O.pumilio. To test this hypothesis we tested 452 receptive females from six populations in Costa Rica and Panama in their natural home ranges for preferences regarding local vs. non-local advertisement calls and color patterns. Overall, the calls overrode the effect of coloration, whereby most females preferred local over non-local calls. We found a tendency to prefer brighter (but not necessarily local) males in two populations. Furthermore, the strength of preferences varied geographically, and thus might be involved in prezygotic isolation among populations. The stronger effect of calls on mate attraction is associated with acoustic divergence between genetic groups in the species, while color pattern diversity is mostly located within one genetic group, i.e., not linked to large-scale population structure. Finally our data highlights the importance to consider an array of signal modalities in multiple wild populations in studies of behavioral isolation.

AB  - Methodologies are presented to (1) evaluate the effect of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) motion on velocity measurements, (2) assess the stationarity of velocity time series, and (3) ensure that a sample record is of sufficient length for measurements taken with an ADCP at a fixed location in a natural river. ADCP motion occurring on the timescale of an ensemble is investigated by comparing single-ping and multiping measurements obtained at the same location under the same flow conditions. Large-scale motion occurring over the course of the entire measurement is studied by first examining a set of indicators to determine if motion may have resulted in the ADCP measuring in regions of different flow characteristics and then dividing the record into segments representing the potentially different regions for comparison. If boat motion is significant, the ADCP record is edited accordingly. Stationarity is assessed using statistical trend tests with guidance provided for selecting parameters based on instrument physics and flow conditions. Mean streamwise and spanwise velocity profiles can be calculated after confirming the reliability of a measurement. A set of criteria are presented to evaluate the appropriateness of an assumption of the law of the wall for streamwise velocity profiles. The methodology is demonstrated using 67 fixed-vessel measurements obtained at two sites on the lower Roanoke River for two discharges. The results indicate that an appropriate procedure was used for securing the ADCP in the channel and that the sample records were sufficient to provide both accurate measurements of mean quantities and assess the stationarity of velocity.

AB  - The effects of phosphate (P) limitation, varying salinity (5-65 psu), and solid media growth conditions on the polysaccharides produced by the model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin were determined. Sequential extraction was used to separate polymers into colloidal (CL), colloidal extracellular polymeric substances (cEPS), hot water soluble (HW), hot bicarbonate soluble (HB), and hot alkali (HA) soluble fractions. Media-soluble polymers (CL and cEPS) were enriched in 4-linked mannosyl, glucosyl, and galactosyl residues as well as terminal and 3-linked xylosyl residues, whereas HW polymers consisted mainly of 3-linked glucosyl as well as terminal and 2,4-linked glucuronosyl residues. The HB fraction was enriched in terminal and 2-linked rhamnosyl residues derived from the mucilage coating solubilized by this treatment. Hot alkali treatment resulted in the complete dissolution of the frustule releasing 2,3- and 3-linked mannosyl residues. The fusiform morphotype predominated in standard and P-limited cultures and cultures subjected to salinity variations, but growth on solid media resulted in an enrichment of the oval morphotype. The proportion and linkages of 15 residues, including neutral, uronic acid, and O-methylated sugars, varied with environmental conditions. P limitation and salinity changes resulted in 1.5- to 2.5-fold increase in carbohydrate production, with enrichment of highly branched/substituted and terminal rhamnose, xylose, and fucose as well as O-methylated sugars, uronic acids, and sulfate. The increased deoxy- and O-methylated sugar content under unfavorable environments enhances the hydrophobicity of the polymers, whereas the anionic components may play important roles in ionic cross-linking, suggesting that these changes could ameliorate the effects of salinity or P-stress and that these altered polysaccharide characteristics may be useful as bioindicators for environmental stress.

AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a resident bacterium of the intestinal tract of humans and animals. This bacterium can be responsible for serious diseases and is one of the largest causes of hospital-based infections. This hardy organism resists many kinds of stresses and is used as a major indicator of the hygienic quality of food, milk, and drinking water. On the other side, enterococci seem to have beneficial role in the development of cheese aroma and are added in certain starter cultures. Since ten years, our laboratory has used the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique to study the response of E, faecalis to physical or chemical stresses as well as to glucose and total starvation. Twenty-seven protein spots on 2-D gels have been identified by N-terminal sequencing or Western blotting which make up the first proteome database of this species. The proteins were classified in four different groups according to their function and their regulation. The first group comprises well-characterized proteins with known protective functions towards stresses. The second group contains enzymes of catabolic pathways. Their implication in stress resistance seems not obvious. A third group are proteins induced in glucose-starved cells belonging to the CcpA regulon. Induction of these enzymes under starvation may serve to increase the scavenging capacity of the cells for nutrients or may be important to mobilize endogenous energetic reserves. Lastly, nine N-terminal amino acid sequences or open reading frames (ORF) showed no homologies with sequences in databases. A comprehensive description of stress proteins of E faecalis and analysis of their patterns of expression under different environmental conditions would greatly increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the extraordinary capacity of this bacterium to survive under hostile conditions.

TI  - INVESTIGATION ON FREE LOCOMOTION AND OCCUPATION OF SOWS IN THE POSTWEANING PERIOD
T2  - ZUCHTUNGSKUNDE
LA  - German
KW  - ANIMAL-WELFARE
AB  - In pig production two outstanding animal welfare problems are obvious. Breeding sows have very restricted opportunities for free locomotion and little environmental stimulation. In the present paper three common management systems are compared to evaluate the reaction of sows to various housing systems. The following results for behavioural observations on dry sows were obtained:
   1. Experimental design and analysis
   Before the animals are alloted to different treatment groups their behaviour and endogenous influences on it have to be registered. All behavioural indicators can be treated as quantitative traits in the analysis of variance if they are distributed normally and mean values per animal per day are applied. Due to the animal welfare law each individual animal has to be protected. Therefore the data relevant to animal welfare have to be analysed on the basis of individual animals.
   2. Behaviour
   The periods of activity were registered within 12 hours during 5:00 to 17:00 quite accurately. The repeatability between the 14th and 28th day is very high for almost all traits when sows are kept in groups. Endogenous factors as physical condition and age influence the traits of activity and rest, as well as well-being and stress situations. The length of time that sows are kept in groups has a minimal effect, variance between animals is large.
   3. Management systems
   Differences were found between the management systems for almost all traits.In the systems the ethological requirements are fulfilled to different extents. No successful therapy can be expected when sows are kept in groups for only four weeks. The sows were occupied with straw much longer than 1 hour in the management systems involved in this experiment. A significant improvement in the psychological and physiological status of the sows by free locomotion depends on duration and condition of this opportunity.

AB  - Bypass grafts promote blood flow impaired by a partial obstruction (stenosis) of arteries by fat accumulation. This type of system's computational modeling is used to understand the flow characteristics and look for reasons and solutions for postoperative failures. The present work deals with the effects of changes in geometry in the performance of a system consisting of an idealized partially obstructed artery and a bypass graft. The constructal design method has been employed in previous works in the analysis of such system assuming steady-state flow. In the present work, blood flow is modeled as transient and pulsatile. The constructal design method is used to determine the performance indicator (dimensionless pressure drop), constraints (system volume and stenosis degrees-50% and 75%) and degrees of freedom: junction angle (30 degrees <= alpha <= 70 degrees) and diameter ratio (0.5 <= D-1/D <= 1). The response surface methodology was used to evaluate the conditions of minimum pressure drop in transient conditions. As the junction angle decreased to 30o, and the diameter ratio increased to 1, the pressure drop decreased, and there was a considerable dependence of pressure drop on the stenosis degree. The effects of the diameter ratio were more pronounced than those of the junction angle. A resistance model based on an analogy with an electronic circuit was introduced, resulting in a correlation for the pressure drop due to the bypass. This correlation confirmed that the point (alpha,D-1/D)=(30 degrees,1) is a point of minimization of flow resistance. The application of the constructal design method in hemodynamics might be an excellent alternative to configuring enhanced performance and providing valuable results to the understanding of biological flows.

AB  - The purpose of this research is deploying a proximal sensing solution using non-invasive and cost-effective sensors onboard an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) as a feasible way for building high-resolution maps of water potential in vineyards. The final objective is offering growers a practical system to make decisions about water management, especially for arid climatic conditions. The monitoring AGV was entirely developed within this research context, and as a result, it is a machine specifically designed to endure off-road conditions and harsh environments. The autonomous vehicle served as a massive, non-invasive, and on-the-go data collector robotic platform. The sensors used for measuring the relevant field variables were two spectral reflectance sensors (SRS), an infrared radiometer, and an on-board weather sensor. The collected data were displayed on comprehensible grid maps using the Local Tangent Plane (LTP) coordinate system. The proposed model has a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.69, and results from combining six parameters: the canopy and air temperatures (as the temperature difference), the relative humidity, the altitude difference, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). The strongest relationships found in this study were between the temperature difference and PRI, with an R-2 of 0.75, and the temperature difference with the leaf water potential with an R-2 of 0.61. The practical use of these high-resolution maps includes irrigation scheduling and harvest zoning for sorting grape quality, with a further use as inputs to complex artificial intelligence algorithms considering larger areas or complementing airborne data. Future improvements to make the models more robust and versatile will entail considering additional variables, locations, or grapevine cultivars, and even other crops grown in vertical trellis systems.

AB  - Biomonitoring is a significant method for evaluating aquatic life forms and their environments. The longer the process continues, the results of it become more precise. Benthic macroinvertebrates' exposure to changes in environmental conditions makes them an important part of any biomonitoring program. This paper reviews a long-term water quality of the Buyuk Menderes River Basin which is the biggest river basin spread across the western Anatolia (Turkey). The study area was divided into three regions (Usak, Aydin, Denizli), primarily considering the provincial borders in the basin. A total of 40 sampling sites from the main river and its tributaries were selected. The prominent agricultural and industrial pollutants (textile, tannery and sugar factories) from each region have been taken into account. The most common and current biotic indices (BMWP Spanish version, ASPT, RBPIII, MMIF, EPT%, Diversity and Evenness) based on the pollution tolerance of benthic macroinvertebrates have been used to track water quality changes. The relationships between environmental variables (sO(2), dO(2), water temp., salinity, flow, TDS, Cond, pH, NO3-N, NO2-N, PO4-P, Fe+3, NH4-N) and bioindicators have been revealed by using multivariate analyses (NMDS, CCA). The region-based variations in water quality were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test. The one-way variance analysis test (ANOVA) was used for the contrast between the biotic indices. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found among the regions in terms of Shannon-Wiener, Evenness, BMWP and MMIF indices. Regions were separated according to pollution sources, and the impact of provinces on water quality may vary according to their industry types. It has been observed that pollutants can spread across a basin for very long distances and reinstatement of the environmental conditions may require long periods.

AB  - Evaluating soil structure dynamics is a major challenge when analysing or modelling pedogenesis. Constructed Technosols are considered, by definition, to be good candidates for pedogenetic studies, insofar as their initial characteristics and implementation conditions are controlled. Thus, we developed an approach based on image analysis of soil microstructures in order to specify the structure dynamics of a constructed Technosol. We described and quantified porosity and aggregation descriptors on a microscale (1) from pictures of mesocosms performed during 14 months, using an innovative automatic high-resolution image-acquisition device (Soilinsight (R)), and (2) from thin sections sampled in situ in a 1 ha field experiment at t0 and t2 (17 months). Plant root system architecture of Lupinus albus and the behavior of introduced earthworms (Lumbricus castaneus) were described using the Soilinsight (R) device. After 14 months, the pore surface was 10 times greater in the presence of plants and macrofauna than in the control samples. Although the biological activity promoted the genesis of aggregates, their dynamics were irregular. In fact, the proportion of aggregates varied depending on both root age and worm action. In situ, the soil was progressively compacted due to a significant decrease in the number of > 2000 mu m pores. In the same way, three aggregate descriptorsnumber, area and shape-were selected as the most significant indicators of soil aggregation evolution during the early stages of pedogenesis. In conclusion, this approach, based on the quantification of microstructure parameters, did indeed allow the description and monitoring of 2D soil structure dynamics in both field and mesocosms conditions. Completed with 3D soil structure data, this micromorphological analysis could advantageously contribute to the impact of climatic and biological agents modelling on a structural evolution of Technosols during initial pedogenesis.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess serum natural antibody (NAb) bindings keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) titer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, two of the most important elements of the natural defense system in the uterus. The study was conducted on 77 Brown Swiss cows (3-7 years of age) with body condition scores (BCS) of 2.6 +/- 0.1. The diagnosis of endometritis in cows on day 30-32 postpartum was made by rectal examination, vaginoscopy, ultrasonography and cytobrush technique. Blood samples were collected immediately after the examinations to measure serum NAb titer and CRP concentrations. NAb binding KLH titers were determined using the indirect ELISA method and the CRP level by using the bovine CRP ELISA kit. Mean NAb titers were 5.36 +/- 0.16, 7.43 +/- 0.15, 8.55 +/- 0.19 and 9.64 +/- 0.27 respectively in healthy cows (Control, n = 29), cows with mild endometritis (ME, n = 21), cows with moderate endometritis (E, n = 17) and cows with severe endometritis (SE, n = 10). Mean serum CRP concentrations were 48.88 +/- 3.92 mu g/mL, 82.86 +/- 4.28 mu g/mL, 98.86 +/- 8.2 mu g/mL and 122.34 +/- 12.72 mu g/mL respectively in groups control, ME, E and SE. NAb binding KLH titer and CRP levels increased significantly in cows with endometritis (P<0.001). BCS did not change serum NAb titer and CRP level (P>0.05). Parity did not cause a significant difference in serum NAb titer and CRP levels (P>0.05), but serum NAb level were higher in multiparous cows with ME (P<0.05). In conclusion, it is thought that serum NAb titer and CRP level can be used effectively as an indicator to determine uterus infections.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) was the main environmental problem facing the mining industry. For AMD had high heavy metals content and low pH, the compacted sewage sludge might be a barrier for tailings whose oxidation and weathering produced AMD, with its own carbon source, microorganism reduction ability and impermeability. To study the heavy metals environmental risk, under the simulate AMD, the deionized water (DW), and the pH 2.1 sulfuric acid water (SA) seepage conditions, respectively, the changes of the chemical speciation of heavy metals Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn and total organic carbon (TOC) content in the compacted sewage sludge were assessed in the different periods. The results indicated according to the distribution of heavy metals, the potential mobility was for Cd: 6.08 under AMD, 7.48 under SA, infinity under DW; for Cu: 0.08 under AMD, 0.17 under SA, 0.59 under DW; for Fe: 0.15 under AMD, 0.22 under SA, 0.22 under DW; for Ni: 2.60 under AMD, 1.69 under SA, 1.67 under DW; and for Zn: 0.15 under AMD, 0.23 under SA and 0.21 under DW at the second checking time. TOC content firstly decreased from 67.62 +/- 0% to 66.29 +/- 0.35%, then increased to 67.74 +/- 0.65% under the AMD seepage while TOC decreased to 63.30 +/- 0.53%, then to 61.33 +/- 0.37% under the DW seepage, decreased to 63.86 +/- 0.41%, then to 63.28 +/- 0.49% under SA seepage. That indicated under the AMD seepage, the suitable microorganisms communities in the compacted sewage sludge were activated. And the heavy metals environmental risk of compacted sewage sludge was lower with AMD condition than with other two. So the compacted sewage sludge as a barrier for tailings was feasible as the aspect of environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Antibiotics are a therapeutic class widely found in environmental matrices and extensively studied due to its persistence and implications for multi-resistant bacteria development. This work presents an integrated approach of analytical multi-techniques on assessing biodegradation of fluorinated antibiotics at a laboratory-scale microcosmos to follow removal and formation of intermediate compounds. Degradation of four fluoroquinolone antibiotics, namely Ofloxacin (OFL), Norfloxacin (NOR), Ciprofloxacin (CPF) and Moxifloxacin (MOX), at 10 mg L-1 using a mixed bacterial culture, was assessed for 60 days. The assays were followed by a developed and validated analytical method of LC with fluorescence detection (LC-FD) using a Luna Pentafluorophenyl (2) 3 pm column. The validated method demonstrated good selectivity, linearity (r(2) > 0.999), intra-day and inter-day precisions (RSD < 2.74%) and accuracy. The quantification limits were 5 mu g L-1 for OFL, NOR and CPF and 20 mu g L-1 for MOX. The optimized conditions allowed picturing metabolites/transformation products formation and accumulation during the process, stating an incomplete mineralization, also shown by fluoride release. OFL and MOX presented the highest (98.3%) and the lowest (80.5%) extent of degradation after 19 days of assay, respectively. A representative number of samples was selected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS with triple quadrupole and the molecular formulas were confirmed by a quadruple time of flight analyzer (QqTOF). Most of the intermediates were already described as biodegradation and/or photodegradation products in different conditions; however unknown metabolites were also identified. The microbial consortium, even when exposed to high levels of FQ presented high percentages of degradation, never reported before for these compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Photosynthetic light-use efficiency (LUE) is an important indicator of plant photosynthesis, but assessment by remote sensing needs to be further explored. In this study, two protective mechanisms for photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) and heat dissipation in the deep oxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle, were explored to estimate photosynthetic LUE from canopy radiance spectra. Four independent experiments were carried out on summer maize (C4 plant) on 5 July 2008, and winter wheat (C3 plant) on 18 April 2008, 16 April 2010, and 13 May 2010, by synchronously measuring daily canopy radiance spectra and photosynthetic LUE. The competitive relationship between ChlF and photochemical yield made it possible to estimate photosynthetic LUE. LUEChlF models were developed for ChlF at 688 nm (R 2=0.72) and 760 nm (R 2=0.59) based on the experimental data from 13 May 2010 at the Guantao flux site. The LUEChlF models were validated by three independent experiments, and the results showed that the LUEChlF relationship was weakened, possibly by variation in species, canopy density, and environmental conditions. As an easy, rapid, non-intrusive method, a photochemical reflectance index (PRI) provides an instantaneous assessment of dynamic photosynthetic LUE. The significant negative relationship between non-photochemical quenching and PRI was confirmed. Although there was a significantly positive relationship between LUE and PRI in all four independent experiments, this was evidently weakened by the canopy and environmental conditions. Difference in PRI (PRI) from the minimum reference PRI around noontime can largely eliminate interference factors. The LUEPRI model was developed based on experimental data from 13 May 2010 at the Guantao flux site (with an R 2 value of 0.85), and validated by the three other independent experiments. The validation result indicated that different species can markedly affect the precision of the PRI difference method.

AB  - Machine learning support for medical decision making is truly helpful only when it meets two conditions: high prediction accuracy and a good explanation of how the diagnosis was reached. Support vector machines (SVMs) successfully achieve the first target due to a kernel-based engine; evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can greatly accomplish the second owing to their adaptable nature. In this context, the current paper puts forward a two-step hybridized methodology, where learning is accurately performed by the SVMs and a comprehensible emulation of the resulting decision model is generated by EAs in the form of propositional rules, while referring only those indicators that highly influence the class separation. An individual highlighting of the medical attributes that trigger a specific diagnosis for a current patient record is additionally obtained; this feature thus increases the confidence of the physician in the resulting automated diagnosis. Without loss of generality, we aim to model three breast cancer instances, for reasons of both high incidence of the disease and the large application of state of the art artificial intelligence methods for this medical task. As such, the prediction of a benign/malignant condition as well as the recurrence/nonrecurrence of a cancer event are studied on the Wisconsin corresponding data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed hybridization reached its goals. Rule prototypes evolve against a SVM consistent training data, while diversity among the different classes is implicitly preserved. Feature selection eventually leads to a resulting rule set where only the significant medical indicators together with the discriminating threshold values are referred, while individual relevance of attributes can be additionally obtained for each patient. The gain is thus dual: the EA benefits from a noise-free SVM preprocessed data and the resulting SVM model is able to output rules in a comprehensible, concise format for the physician.

AB  - Ninety-one farms were visited over a 2-year period to assess the welfare of growing pigs in five different production systems found either in France or in Spain using the Welfare Quality (R) protocol. This study focused on animal-based measures as indicators of 'good feeding' and 'good housing'. Multiple Generalized Linear Mixed Models were performed for each measure to evaluate the differences between production systems and to detect possible causal factors. Pigs in the conventional system presented the lowest prevalence of poor body condition, whereas extensive Mallorcan Black pigs and extensive Iberian pigs were associated with a decreased prevalence of bursitis and pig dirtiness. The straw-bedded system presented a lower prevalence of bursitis, but poorer hygiene and more susceptibility of poor body condition than the conventional system. The age of the animals had a significant effect on the appearance of bursitis in the three intensive systems studied. The type of floor was a significant causal factor of bursitis and pig dirtiness in the conventional system and among intensive Iberian pigs. The feeding system was another causal factor of pig dirtiness on more than 50% of the body in the conventional system, whereas pig dirtiness on less than 50% of the body was influenced by the age of the animals. The prevalence of huddling animals in the conventional system was associated with the highest stocking densities and the lowest environmental temperatures. The results indicate that there were important differences between production systems based on animal-based indicators of the good feeding and housing principles. The recording of the age of the animals, type of floor, feeding system, stocking density and environmental temperature can be useful to predict the appearance of a given welfare measure of 'good housing' on a farm.

AB  - Pollen longevity in seven Potamogeton species representing different pollination systems (anemophily, epihydrophily and hydroautogamy) was assessed both under aerial condition and in contact with water to investigate how water impacts the sexual reproduction in these aquatic taxa. Stainability of pollen with MTT was considered as an indicator of pollen viability. The half-life of pollen longevity was calculated using exponential decay regression. Overall, pollen viability decreased relatively rapidly with time. Pollen grains of obligate anemophilic species had lower initial viability and shorter half-lives than those of facultative anemophilic species. Pollen in these latter species may take more time to reach the stigma. The pollen of Potamogeton may be categorized as partially hydrated pollen owing to its generally spherical shape and lack of furrows, rapid loss of viability, and fast pollen tube initiation. The half-life is positively correlated with pollen size. Smaller-sized grains are at greater risk of desiccation than larger grains. In contrast with the situation observed in most terrestrial angiosperms, contact with water increases pollen longevity in Potamogeton species. In our present study the half-lives of pollen longevity of Potamogeton species in which the pollen had come into contact with water (mean of 10.65 h) were markedly higher than those under aerial conditions (mean of 5.79 h, t = 2.622, P = 0.039). The results of our study contradict a widely held belief that water is detrimental to pollen viability in angiosperms and furthermore indicate that close proximity to water results in selection for wettability. The transition to a hydrated status together with its morphology, make Potamogeton pollen more adapted to the aquatic environment and thus serves to ensure reproductive process. Results of our present study may have direct implications for understanding the evolution of the sexual reproductive system in aquatic angiosperms.

AB  - The spatial variability of soil aggregate stability and its relationship to runoff and soil erosion were examined in a catena of soils and vegetation in a semiarid environment at the Rambla Honda field site (Tabernas, Almeria, SE Spain) to evaluate the validity of structural stability as a soil erosion indicator in sandy loam range soils. The influence of soil properties and topography on the variability of aggregate stability was also examined. Methods include: 1) aggregate stability assessment at 12 sites (3 repetitions per site) on the hillslope by two methods: a) aggregate size distribution by dry sieving b) water drop test; 2) soil organic carbon content; 3) particle size distribution determination: 4) terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model (1-m resolution); 5) monitoring runoff and erosion for nearly 3 years in eight (10 x 2 m) plots distributed over the hillslope. Results: 41% of the average soil mass is formed by >2-mm aggregates. However, wet aggregate stability is poor, with a mean (of a total of 1440 aggregates) of only 26 drop impacts necessary to break up a wet aggregate (pF = 1). Significant relationships were found in the number of water drops required for aggregate breakdown and runoff and erosion rates. However, no significant relationships between the mean weight diameter of aggregates under dry conditions and runoff or erosion rates were observed. The relationships of aggregates with other soil properties, hillslope position and proximity to plants are also analysed. The most significant correlation found was between the number of drop impacts and soil organic matter content. The stability of topsoil aggregates seems to be a valuable indicator of field-assessed runoff and inter-rill erosion of sandy loam range soils under semiarid conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crop diversity is crucial for producing more food and nutrition in the crowded planet and achieving agricultural sustainable development, and thus it is a hot topic in shaping policies aimed at ensuring food security. Many studies have revealed that enhanced crop diversity can benefit crop productivity. However, research on how to maintain a relatively high crop diversity at regional and national scales remains limited. This study attempts to examine the underlying mechanisms of crop diversity changes in China and eventually answer why China can maintain a high crop diversity from the spatial-temporal perspective. To achieve this end, the county level crop area dataset for the period of 1980-2014 was compiled and used to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop diversity in China. The result reveals that the China's crop diversity trended upward over past 35 years, evidenced by more than 7 major crops at national level and 4 major crops at county level having undergone massive planting process to maintain a high crop diversity. Spatially, the crop diversity increased in more than two-thirds of the counties, and its hotspots moved gradually to the south-west mountainous area. The natural factor of slope and the social factor of population density contributed to shape the crop diversity pattern in global effects. In contrast, the irrigation degree, elevation of cropland, mean annual temperature and precipitation affected the spatially non-stationary distribution of crop diversity at the local level. On the whole, the maintenance of a higher crop diversity in China not only was limited by natural conditions, but also subject to adopt the multi-cropping systems strategic choice for the country to agricultural conditions. We argued that crop diversity can be an indicator to draw agricultural zoning, and increasing crop diversity should be recognized as a policy tool to implement agricultural sustainable development strategy.

AB  - The long-term effects of conservation agriculture on soil physical and chemical properties and their relationship with crop yields are still relatively poorly understood. In addition, the effects of those practices ranged widely depending on climatic and edaphic conditions and so they cannot be generalized for all agro-ecological regions and crop types. This study evaluates the effects of three conservation agriculture practices reduced tillage (RT), reduced tillage plus incorporation of green manure (RTG), and no-tillage (NT) on the soil quality on almond orchards under semiarid conditions and the soil factors explaining crop yield under these management practices. The soil physical indicators used were bulk density, resistance to penetration, total porosity, air capacity, relative field capacity, available water content, infiltration rate and field plant-available water content. The chemical parameters evaluated were soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and available phosphorus. Changes in the soil physical properties with the incorporation of green manure and with no-tillage, relative to RT were, mainly detected in the 5-15 cm soil layer, where improvements in soil water availability were observed. In addition, there was a positive effect of both green manure and no-tillage on the infiltration rate relative to RT. The shift from RT to RTG led to an improvement in total soil organic carbon and nitrogen, resulting in a positive effect on crop yield after six years of implementation. No-tillage led to a decline of about 70 % in crop yield with respect to the tillage treatments, despite the improvement in the soil available water content from the first year of its adoption. However, a strong decrease in the concentrations of available nitrogen was the factor mainly responsible for the crop yield reductions under NT.

AB  - In Ukraine, cucumber (Cucumis sativus Linneus) annually occupies about 20 % of the total area of all vegetable crops sown in the open ground or 52.6 thousand hectares. The main reason that significantly reduces the quantitative and qualitative indicators of this vegetable crop's main valuable economic traits is the high incidence of commercial crops with diseases, especially downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk & M.A. Curtis) Rostovtsev). Since 1985 in Ukraine, this cucumber disease in the open ground on nonresistant varieties has continuously had intense development, in some years the development - by the type of epiphytotic. Simultaneously, the shortage of commercial yield of this vegetable crop due to the defeat of this disease under the field conditions can reach the level of 50-80 % or more, seed loss - 25-70 %. One of the main reasons for significant losses of commercial yield and seeds of gherkin cucumber under the conditions of its cultivation in the open ground is recognized as the high susceptibility of samples to some diseases, particularly downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Rostovtsev). Unfortunately, this problem has remained relevant for Ukraine over the past few decades. So, obtaining the initial material of a gherkin cucumber with a harmonious combination in the genotypes of a complex of various valuable economic characteristics (yield, quality, resistance to diseases, chemical substances content, suitability for various types of processing) and creating a modern competitive, innovative product (variety, hybrid) on its basis remains a relevant and priority task for domestic agricultural science at present. At the same time, scientists have proved that introducing complex (integrated) systems into production, which expect the biologization of protection with its transfer to an ecological and economic basis, is recognized as the most promising today. We suggested using resistant varieties (hybrids) in such integrated systems that provide the highest economic effect.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) involves actual water consumption directly from the land surface; however, regional ET maps are usually neglected during water management and allocation. In this study, an integrated satellite-based ET monitoring approach with two spatial resolutions is proposed over an extremely arid basin in China that has experienced crop area expansion and has been the focus of a water-saving project since 2012. The proposed ETWatch approach combined with an empirical downscaling strategy based on vegetation condition was employed to produce monthly ET maps. This method achieves satisfactory accuracy and is validated by its reasonable spatial and temporal pattern results. Yearly results exhibit an increasing ET trend before 2012, which subsequently gradually decrease. This trend fits well with the dynamics of the basin-wide vegetation condition, indicating that there is a stronger correlation between water consumption and vegetation than between other environmental indicators. The average ET over three main crop types in the region (grape, cotton, and melon) decreased by approximately 5% due to optimizations of the irrigation timeline during the project, while 13% of the water savings can be attributed to the fallowing of crop areas. Based on the irrigation distribution in 2012, a comparison between drip and border irrigation that achieves water savings of 3.6% from grape and 5.8% from cotton is conducted. However, an afforestation project that involved planting young trees led to an approximate 25% increase in water consumption. Overall, since 2012, the water-saving project has achieved satisfactory performance regarding excessive groundwater withdrawal, showing a reduction trend of 3 million m(3)/year and an increase in Lake Aiding water levels since 2011. The results reveal the potential of the ET monitoring strategy as a basis for basin-scale water management.

AB  - Profitability measures are a lens through which business can be viewed and they form a common basis for investment decisions. Especially in areas close to national borders, these decisions could be linked to the question on which side of the border a venture should be located in order to realise country-specific comparative advantages that make the investment more profitable. Differences in profitability between countries are driven by manifold aspects, including specific cost or revenue structures, financing patterns and conditions, as well as taxation. The aim of this study is to identify the driving factors behind differences in profitability of Czech and German firms on the basis of a comparative analysis. In this article, a two-step variance analysis is conducted. The first step focuses on the operational differences in RoA between Czech and German ventures, which is based on deeper analyses of the asset turnover and the profit margin. In the second step, the differences in RoE are analysed, considering influences from national taxation, conditions and patterns of financing and operations of the ventures. A model-based cumulative variance analysis quantifies the impacts of these underlying drivers of profitability with a comparative focus. For this reason, the average measures of these drivers from 2002 to 2014 - the longest time series available for both countries - are extracted from the BACH database, which provides harmonised accounting information. This paper confirms the hypothesis that specific drivers of profitability differ significantly between the two countries in certain business sectors and would cause substantial differences in profitability. Due to the overlapping nature of these individual effects, they compensate each other to a great extent. The results provide useful benchmarks that a company's management can use to increase its profitability tackling specific comparative (dis-)advantages between the Czech Republic and Germany.

AB  - The natural N-15 abundance (delta N-15 value) of organic rice tends to be higher than that of conventional rice. However, as delta N-15 values vary in both organic and conventional rice, it might be difficult to use a particular delta N-15 value as an indicator of organic growth conditions. This review describes an approach that was developed at the Tohoku Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization. The relationship between the delta N-15 values of rice and those of soil under organic or conventional farming conditions has been investigated. Regardless of the farming method, the delta N-15 values of rice reflect those of the soil. The delta N-15 values of organically grown rice tend to be higher than the regression line obtained from the delta N-15 values of rice and soil without the application of an N fertilizer. The delta N-15 values of conventionally grown rice tend to be lower than the regression line. Thus, the relationship between the delta N-15 values of rice and soil without an applied N source could be used to differentiate between organic and conventional rice. However, the existence of regional variation in the relationship between the delta N-15 values of rice and those of unamended soil can confound the use of this discriminant method. Such variation may occur due to the differences in delta N-15 of natural N inputs, and also through ammonia nitrification and subsequent denitrification. Temporal variation can also occur, though the reason for such variation is unknown. When the relationship between the delta N-15 values of rice and those of unamended soil is employed to distinguish between organic and conventional rice, regional and temporal variations in that relationship should be taken into account.

AB  - The urban population growth, together with the contemporary deindustrialization of metropolitan areas, has resulted in a large amount of available land with new possible uses. It is well known that urban green areas provide several benefits in the surrounding environment, such as the improvement of thermal comfort conditions for the population during summer heat waves. The purpose of this study is to provide useful information on thermal regimes of urban soils to urban planners to be used during an urban transformation to mitigate surface temperatures and improve human thermal comfort. Field measurements of solar radiation, surface temperature (T-s), air temperature (T-air), relative humidity, and wind speed were collected on four types of urban soils and pavements in the city of Florence during summer 2014. Analysis of days under calm, clear-sky condition is reported. During daytime, sun-to-shadow differences for T-air, apparent temperature index (ATI), and T-s were significantly positive for all surfaces. Conversely, during nighttime, T-air differences among all surfaces were significantly negative, whereas ATI showed significantly positive differences. Moreover, T-s was significantly negative for grass and gravel. Relative to the shaded surfaces, T-s was higher on white gravel and grass than gray sandstone and asphalt during nighttime, whereas gray sandstone was always the warmest surface during daytime. Conversely, no differences were found during nighttime for ATI and T-air measured over surfaces that were exposed to sun during the day, whereas T-s showed higher values on gravel than grass and asphalt during nighttime. An exposed surface warms less if its albedo is high, leading to a significant reduction of T-s during daytime. These results underline the importance of considering the effects of surface characteristics on surface temperature and thermal comfort. This would be fundamental for addressing urban environment issues toward the heat island mitigation considering also the impact of urban renovation on microclimate.

AB  - Theoretical plant growth models postulate that the relative rates of shoot and root growth are largely modulated by signals related to carbon and nitrogen status of the plant. To test this experimentally, 6-week-old vegetative cuttings of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv Merlot) were grown aeroponically in different controlled conditions of irradiance (13.8, 8.4 and 5.3 mol PAR m(-2) day(-1)) and/or nitrogen nutrition (0.15 1.20 and 7.11 mM N). Total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) and amino acids (FAA) in leaves and roots were analysed 0, 6 and 28 days after treatment initiation. Both whole-plant biomass accumulation as well as C and N contents were highly responsive to light and N availability. At day 28, plant dry weight was significantly reduced in shaded vines (-35% of that of the control plants) and stimulated under the high it-radiance environment (+30%). Deprivation of N enhanced root growth (+51%) at the expense of above-ground growth, whereas leaf dry weight was significantly greater in the high-N treatment than in the control. Vines grown under low-N and high irradiance conditions had the highest root-to-shoot ratios and those grown under low light and high N the lowest. Finally, redistribution of biomass among vegetative vine parts was significantly related to different indicators of the vine C:N status measured either at the whole-plant (N concentration) or at the organ level (TNC:FAA ratio), suggesting that root-to-shoot biomass partitioning was controlled by some aspect of plant C:N balance. Such relationships will be useful to improve allocation rules in a process-based growth model of grapevine. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The acute toxicity of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, and zinc pyrithione (Zpt), a biocide used in anti-dandruff shampoos and protective antifouling paints, to three species of ostracods and two waterfleas, including Daphnia magna, was determined and compared under light and dark conditions. Under normal laboratory conditions, UV light had no significant influence on the outcome of toxicity bioassays, although in the case of imidacloprid both EC50 and LC50 calculated values were twice as high under the light as in the dark. No influence of UV light was observed on bioassays conducted with Zpt, in spite of the fast aqueous photolysis exhibited by this compound. Imidacloprid 48-h LC50 for cladocerans (65-133 mg/L) were two orders of magnitude higher than for ostracods (301-715 mu g/L); values of EC50 for cladocerans and ostracods were 2-6 mg/L and 3-16 mu g/L, respectively. Toxicity of Zpt to both ostracod and cladoceran species appears to be similar, with 48-h LC50 in the range 137-524 and 75-197 mu g/L for ostracods and cladocerans, respectively, and similar values for EC(50)s. The mortality endpoint (LC50), however, is not a reliable predictor of the effects of imidacloprid under field situations (e.g. rice paddies), because the paralysis effect induced by this insecticide takes place at much lower concentrations than those required to cause the death of the animals: regardless of the taxa, differences as large as 100- or 600-fold were observed between the EC50 and LC50 for the same exposures. As a consequence, immobilization tests and EC50 values are recommended for this class of compounds, while caution should be exercised in environmental risk assessments of this and possibly other related neonicotinoid insecticides with similar activity.

AB  - The phosphorus load originating from crop production and animal husbandry is a major contributor to the eutrophication of lakes, rivers and coastal waters. The P losses to surface waters may, however, differ drastically due to the diversity of agricultural production systems practised under contrasting environmental conditions. To assess the most problematic types of agriculture, we need information on the P load from different alternative farming practices. Such information cannot, however, be obtained solely from field runoff experiments, as the number of treatment combinations required to account for all relevant farming systems and environmental conditions far exceeds our research capabilities. To facilitate the comparison of P loads, we therefore need reasonably simple models. A key factor controlling the P load from agriculture is the past and present use of nutrients in fertilizers and manure in relation to a crop's uptake, i.e. the soil-surface balance of P. Here, we present a simple empirical model that relates the P surplus (or deficit) in a farm to the edge-of-field losses of algal-available R Based on long-term fertilizer trials, the model first estimates the change in soil-test P of top soil with the aid of the soil-surface balance of P. Soil-test P is then used to approximate the concentration of dissolved reactive P in surface runoff and drainage flow, as adjusted for different P application types. The loss of particulate P is obtained from typical erosion rates. The model can be applied in life-cycle analyses and in assessing future developments. We illustrate use of the model by calculating the loss of algal-available P from conventional and organic crop and dairy farms located on clay and fine sand soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brown knapweed (Centaurea jacea L.) has been suggested as a potential bioindicator for tropospheric ozone (O-3), but little is known about the intra-specific variation in O-3 Sensitivity in this wild species. The aim of this study was to quantify the differences in O-3 sensitivity among and within five populations, and to relate the differences to morphological, phenological, and genetic characteristics. These parameters were periodically recorded in two consecutive experiments on a total of 357 plants from five different European countries (Norway, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia). They were grown from seed in natural soil under ambient conditions at a site with seasonally elevated O-3 concentrations (Cadenazzo, southern Switzerland). The populations differed significantly both in frequency and extent Of O-3 injury, as well as in phenological development. The observed degree Of O-3 injury was highest in the Slovenian and the Swiss populations, while only few Hungarian and Norwegian plants showed slight symptoms of injury. Plants were generally most sensitive to O-3 when reaching the reproductive stage, and insensitive at the rosette stage. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (AFLP) demonstrated genetic distinctiveness of the five C. jacea populations. All individuals of four of the five populations were correctly assigned to the respective populations based on principal component analysis. Cluster analysis quite accurately reflected the geographic origin of each population. Overall, the analysis revealed a high degree of intra-specific variability in O-3 sensitivity in C. jacea, and underlined the important influence of the climate-dependent population-specific plant development on O-3 Sensitivity. These observations may constrain the development of a standardized biomonitoring system. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic stress occurs when animals are unable to deal with a persistent stressor with species-typical responses, or when several stressors are present concurrently. Chronic stress is most frequently considered in intensive systems, but it may also be a welfare concern for extensively managed species, such as the sheep. Here we review behavioural and physiological responses of sheep to experimentally induced chronic stressors to determine relevant indicators of chronic stress. Neuroendocrine responses to chronic stress are difficult to interpret because initial responses are followed by an apparent normalisation. Thus, cortisol or catecholamines may be at or below pre-stress levels during chronic stress, but this varies with different stressors. Chronic stress can also affect reproductive function, impair body and wool growth and meat quality, reduce immune function, and is associated with greater parasite burdens in sheep. Chronic stress induces alterations in behaviour patterns, particularly activity and feeding, and circadion rhythms of behaviour. Stereotypic behaviours, however, are infrequent in sheep and may occur only in experimental conditions of social isolation. Behavioural and physiological data suggest that rough handling and sheepdogs may be sources of chronic stress for sheep. Social subordination and weaning also act as chronic stressors, leading to higher parasitism in these animals and a greater response to additional stressors. Lameness and parasitism are associated with physiological and behavioural responses indicating that these are severe forms of chronic stress in sheep. It is unclear whether environmental stressors, such as weather and food availability, induce chronic stress in sheep. Under-nutrition may, however, be a welfare concern through its impact on lamb survival. The existence of many sources of chronic stress in the management of sheep suggests that the welfare of this species requires more attention than it has currently received.

AB  - Research Highlights: This study highlighted the possibility of estimating the productivity of mountain sites (mixed beech-coniferous stands) based on tree and stand dendrometric characteristics. Background and Objectives: The mountainous region of Romania offers suitable conditions for the formation and development of mixed beech-coniferous stands with complex, multi-aged structures. Based on the dendrometric characteristics of the trees, established indicators were used to estimate the productivity of the sites, with other quantitative indicators being proposed to better capture the particularities of mixed multi-aged stands. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the productive potential of the sites, a combined in situ mapping method was applied. Laboratory analyses of soils, and information provided indirectly by indicator plant and tree overstories, led to the characterization of soil types and the identification of forest sites for study. The productivity of the sites was estimated using quantitative indicators established based on the dendrometric characteristics of the trees and stands. Results: Indicators based on stand production and growth are relevant for multi-aged stands of mixed beech-coniferous formation. The ratio between tree volume and the basal area is the result of basal area and height increments, both of which are variable and depend on the quality of the site. Thus, a form height stand can be used as an indicator to characterize the productivity of the site in mixed multi-aged stands. Conclusions: Knowing the ecological specificity of sites in the formation of mixed beech-coniferous forests is a first condition necessary to achieving stable stands that are able to continuously fulfill multiple functions. The favorability of forest sites for a certain assortment of species is a fundamental character of the sites, which is essential for the management of these forest formations.

AB  - Pliocene coal, clayey coal, and coaly claystone sediments from the Yatagan Formation (Denizli Basin, southwestern Turkey) have been investigated with respect to maceral association, mineralogical composition, n-alkane, isoprenoid and saturated-aromatic biomarker characteristics, and stable isotopes (H-2, C-13, N-15, O-18, and S-34). The main purpose of the present study was to determine the hydrocarbon potential and paleodepositional conditions of coals in the Denizli Basin. The abundances of huminite, liptinite, and inertinite macerals were 46.14%, 8.06%, and 1.57%, respectively. The huminite/vitrinite reflectances (%Ro) of the coal, clayey coal, and coaly claystone samples ranged between 0.26 and 0.37 %Ro, implying sub-bituminous B and C coal ranks. The total organic C (TOC, wt.%) content and the T-max values of the investigated samples ranged between 0.74 and 43.80 wt% and 390-440 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the coaly horizons were characterized by very low H index (HI), O index (OI), production index (PI), and Tmax values. Moreover, a high waxiness degree, C preference index (CPI), odd-to-even predominance (OEP), terrigenous/aquatic ratio (TAR), and high C-19 tricyclic terpane/C-23 tricyclic terpane (C-19/C-23 TT) and C-24 tetracyclic terpane/C-26 tricyclic terpane (C-24*/C-26 TT) biomarker ratios indicated a terrestrial plant input. These results were supported by stable isotope (H-2, C-13, and N-15) investigations. Although the Pliocene coals have source rock potential according to the TOC content and pyrolysis analyses, they have been determined to be at the diagenesis and immature stages as a result of organic petrographic, and saturated-aromatic biomarker investigations.

AB  - Outdoor skating is a valued and culturally important winter activity in Canada that is vulnerable to warming winter temperatures resulting from anthropogenic climate change. Changes to the outdoor skating season (OSS) due to climate change have been estimated from historical weather records using the occurrence of daily temperatures below a particular temperature threshold as a proxy for rink availability. However, research on the actual weather conditions needed for outdoor rinks to be maintained in reasonable condition is limited. In this study, we used historical weather data and daily reports on outdoor rinks in Montreal to identify which daily or multi-day temperature variable can best act as an indicator of outdoor ice rink availability. We evaluated a series of temperature variables using a logistic regression to predict the likelihood of open rinks during each day of the season. Using AIC scores to select the best model, we found that the mean of the preceding six-day maximum temperature was the best predictor of skating availability. Using this temperature predictor, we then projected changes in the duration of the future OSS in Montreal based on global climate model data, downscaled to the island of Montreal using the MarkSim Weather Generator. Our results showed that the mean OSS duration in Montreal would range from a 15% to a > 75% decline by 2090 depending on which future emissions scenario we follow. In a scenario that limits global temperature rise to below 2.0 degrees C (RCP 2.6), we projected a 41 day mean OSS duration at the end of this century. By contrast, under a business-as-usual emissions pathway (RCP 8.5), the average length of the OSS in Montreal could decline to only 11 days per year. Our results suggest that very ambitious climate change mitigation will be required to preserve outdoor skating in Montreal in the face of ongoing global climate change.

AB  - During the Late Ordovician, abundant siliceous rocks interlayered with K-bentonites were widely distributed in the Wufeng Formation in the north-western part of the Sichuan Basin, South China. In order to analyse the material provenance, redox condition, sedimentary environment, and their formation, here we present mineralogical and geochemical investigations on siliceous rocks samples collected from three sections. The presence of massive radiolarian tests, high Si/Si + Al + Fe + Ca ratios (0.87-0.99) and Al-Fe-Mn diagram plotting at nonhydrothermal area, reflects that the deposition of the siliceous rocks was simultaneous, effected by biogenic and terrigenous origin. The TiO2-Zr, La/Th-Hf, and La/Yb- n-ary sumation REE bivariate diagrams indicate that the provenance of Late Ordovician siliceous rocks was primarily from felsic igneous rocks. According to the palaeoredox indicators (V/(V + Ni), V/Cr, V/Sc, U/Th, and Ni/Co) and the size of framboidal pyrite, it is considered that the water column conditions of the Late Ordovician siliceous rocks were likely to be anoxic in all three sections. The application of parameters for relatively immobile elements allowed us to establish a continental margin for most samples from the three sections. Finally, we propose that the deposition of siliceous rocks was related to the accretion of the Cathaysia Block to the Yangtze Block. During the Late Ordovician, huge amounts of volcanic ash were released by intensified volcanic eruptions and fell into the ocean, triggering the proliferation of radiolarians. The abundant radiolarians and the persistent continental detritus constituted the major components of siliceous rocks in the Upper Yangtze Block.

AB  - Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) are an economical alternative to conventional wastewater treatment technologies. They are commonly favored by small and rural communities. Due to long hydraulic retention time required by the treatment in these systems, algal activity is often expected during summer season. This study investigated the effects of algal growth on the removal and inactivation of pathogenic indicator organisms in WSP systems. Two predominant algae species (Mougeotia sp. and Hydrodicty sp.) that were found in Amherstview WSP were able to increase both pH and DO. The highest inactivation rates of both E. coli. and total coliforms (TC) were observed at pH 10.5 compared to other pH (4, 8, 8.5, 9.5) investigated in the bench-scale experiments. Both high (20 mg/L) and low DO (1 mg/L) levels can facilitate the removal and inactivation of both E. coli. and TC. Enterococci were significantly reduced at both intermediate (8.6 mg/L) and high (20 mg/L) DO concentrations. Therefore, the presence of algae can potentially promote the removal of E. coli, TC and Enterococci. Much higher inactivation of E. coli, TC and Enterococci at a higher temperature (20 degrees C) than at a lower temperature (4 degrees C) indicates temperature is one the most important removal factor. Two potential/additional indicator organisms (Enterococci and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens)) exhibited different inactivation trends than the traditional indicators (E. coli and TC) under the same pH and DO conditions. C. perfringens were tolerant to all the tested pH, DO and temperature conditions. Their resistance to environmental stresses may pose potential health risk. Hence, both Enterococci and C. perfringens could be potentially used as indictor organisms to predict the overall level of pathogens in treated wastewater.

AB  - Road infrastructure is important to the well-being and economic health of all nations. The performance of road pavement infrastructure is sophisticated and affected by numerous factors and varies greatly across different roads. Large scale spatial analysis for assessing road infrastructure performance is increasingly required for road management, therefore multi-source factors, including satellite remotely sensed climate and environmental data, and ground-monitored vehicles observations, are collected as explanatory variables. Different from the traditional point or area based geospatial attributes, the performance of pavement infrastructure is the line segment based spatial data. Thus, a segment-based spatial stratified heterogeneity method is utilized to explore the comprehensive impacts of vehicles, climate, properties of road and socioeconomic conditions on pavement infrastructure performance. Segment-based optimal discretization is applied on discretizing segment-based pavement data, and a segment-based geographical detector is utilized to assess the spatial impacts of variables and their interactions. Results show that the segment-based methods can more reasonably and accurately describe the characteristics of line segment based spatial data and assess the spatial associations. The two major categories of factors associated with pavement damage are the variables of traffic vehicles and heavy vehicles in particular, and climate and environmental conditions. Meanwhile, the interactions between the explanatory variables in these two categories have much more influence than the single explanatory variables, and the interactions can explain more than half of the pavement damage. This study highlights the great potential of remote sensing based large scale spatial analysis of road infrastructures. The approach in this study provides new ideas for spatial analysis for segmented geographical data. The findings indicate that the quantified comprehensive impacts of variables are practical for wise decision-making for road design, construction and maintenance.

AB  - Following a request from EFSA, the Panelon Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) developed an opinion on the state of the art of Toxicokinetic/Toxicodynamic (TKTD) models and their use in prospective environmental risk assessment (ERA) for pesticides and aquatic organisms. TKTD models are species- and compound-specific and can be used to predict (sub)lethal effects of pesticides under untested (time-variable) exposure conditions. Three different types of TKTD models are described, viz., (i) the General Unified Threshold models of Survival' (GUTS), (ii) those based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEBtox models), and (iii) models for primary producers. All these TKTD models follow the principle that the processes influencing internal exposure of an organism, (TK), are separated from the processes that lead to damage and effects/mortality (TD). GUTS models can be used to predict survival rate under untested exposure conditions. DEBtox models explore the effects on growth and reproduction of toxicants over time, even over the entire life cycle. TKTD model for primary producers and pesticides have been developed for algae, Lemna and Myriophyllum. For all TKTD model calibration, both toxicity data on standard test species and/or additional species can be used. For validation, substance and species-specific data sets from independent refined-exposure experiments are required. Based on the current state of the art (e.g. lack of documented and evaluated examples), the DEBtox modelling approach is currently limited to research applications. However, its great potential for future use in prospective ERA for pesticides is recognised. The GUTS model and the Lemna model are considered ready to be used in risk assessment.
