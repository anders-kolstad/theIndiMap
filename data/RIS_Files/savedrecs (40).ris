AB  - The article considers the categories of social, economic, and spiritual efficiency. The emphasis is made on the crisis of modern economic processes. The subject of the article is the contradictions arising in the process of increasing economic efficiency. Existing methodological approaches to the study of these categories are critically reviewed. The main goal of the article is to create the author's concept of overcoming the contradictions between the growth of economic and social efficiency in the conditions of modern economic organizations. The concept is based on the conflict paradigm. The methodological basis of the study consists of the concepts of foreign and domestic researchers dealing with the effectiveness of social reproduction. The main theoretical concept is neo-Marxism. The purpose of the article is to determine the methodology for reconciling contradictions arising in the process of managing the economic efficiency of an economic system.The thesis of P. Drucker on the inevitability of aggravating the economic crisis is considered as the cause of the conflict. In combination with the totality of such general scientific and special methods of cognition as dialectic, systemic, descriptive, theoretical modelling, the article reveals the main contradictions in the assessment of the growth of the economic and social efficiency of the economic system. The main conclusion of the article is the need to abandon the use of single-factor methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the functioning of economic systems. The main problem is the fact that the growth of economic efficiency most often has a non-linear effect on the change in social and spiritual efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to use at the same time changes in all three specified directions of efficiency, so one can determine the general vector of changes in the economic system. As a final conclusion, it was proposed to apply the efficiency rule proposed by Pareto to this assessment, according to which the system state is optimal when the value of each particular criterion describing the system state cannot be changed without deteriorating other system indicators. The article presents a table, in which the contradictory changes that are the result of a number of managerial influences are demonstrated for economic and social efficiency. A logical formula for determining the effectiveness of changes in the efficiency of the economic system, based on the indices of changes in individual quantitative indicators, is proposed. Criteria are defined that make it possible to quantify each of the blocks determining efficiency: economic, social, and spiritual. An assessment of possible indicators at the macroeconomic and microeconomic level is given. The article formulates a model for establishing the balance (optimum) of individual indicators of the total efficiency of the economic system. This model is based on the balance of economic interests of employers (owners) and social interests of workers, coordinated through culture, which is defined as one of the priorities of spirituality. A formula is proposed that enables the analytical establishment of the optimal (balance) state of the efficiency of the economic system. On the basis of the conducted research, it becomes possible to talk about a fair (reasonable) distribution of value added.
   In fact, at the theoretical level, an economic model for managing the socio-economic efficiency of the economic system is proposed, which creates the prerequisites for the effective management of the socioeconomic development of an organization in a permanent crisis environment.

AB  - Chronic degenerative diseases are the leading causes of death in developed countries. Their control is exceedingly difficult due to their multiplicity and diversity, the interconnection with a network of multiple risk factors and protective factors, the long latency and multistep pathogenesis, and the multifocal localization. Adducts to nuclear DNA are biomarkers evaluating the biologically effective dose, reflecting an enhanced risk of developing a mutation-related disease more realistically than the external exposure dose. The localization and accumulation of these promutagenic lesions in different organs are the composite result of several factors, including (a) toxicokinetics (first-pass effect); (b) local and distant metabolism; (c) efficiency and fidelity of DNA repair; and (d) cell proliferation rate. The last factor will affect not only the dilution of DNA adducts but also the possible evolution towards either destructive processes, such as emphysema or cardiomyopathies, or proliferative processes, such as benign or malignant tumors at various sites. They also include heart tumors affecting fetal myocytes after transplacental exposure to DNA-binding agents, blood vessel tumors, and atherosclerotic plaques, In this article, particular emphasis is given to molecular alterations in the heart, which is the preferential target for the formation of DNA adducts in smokers, and in human aorta, where an extensive molecular epidemiology project is documenting the systematic presence of adducts to the nuclear DNA of smooth muscle cells from atherosclerotic lesions, and their significant correlation with known atherogenic risk factors. Exocyclic DNA adducts resulting from lipid peroxidation, and age-related indigenous adducts (I-compounds) may also originate from endogenous sources, chronic infections and infestations, and inflammatory processes. Type II I-compounds are bulky DNA lesions resulting from oxidative stress, whereas type I I-compounds are presumably normal DNA modifications, which display positive correlations with median life span and are decreased in cancer and other pathological conditions. Profiles of type I I-compounds strongly depend on diet and are related to the antidegenerative effects of caloric/dietary restriction. Even broader is the possible meaning of adducts to mitochondrial DNA, which have been detected in rodents exposed to genotoxic agents and complex mixtures, as well as in untreated rodents, in larger amounts when compared to the nuclear DNA of the same cells. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA increase the number of oxidative phosphorylation-defective cells, especially in energy-requiring postmitotic tissues such as brain, heart and skeletal muscle, thereby playing an important role in aging and a variety of chronic degenerative diseases. A decreased formation of DNA adducts is an indicator of reduced risk of developing the associated disease. Therefore, these molecular dosimeters can be used as biomarkers in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases, pursued either by avoiding exposure to adduct-forming agents or by using chemopreventive agents. Interventions addressed to the human organism by means of dietary measures or pharmacological agents have encountered a broad consensus in the area of cardiovascular diseases, and are deserving a growing interest also in cancer prevention. The efficacy of chemopreventive agents can be assessed by evaluating inhibition of nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA adduct formation in vitro, in animal models, and in phase II clinical trials in high-risk individuals.

AB  - Simple Summary It is a basic high priority need of every horse to take in roughage continuously. In order to ensure the horses' behavioural, physical and mental welfare, any pause of feed intake should not last for more than 4 hours. However, this basic need is often neglected in practice. The aim of the presented study was to assess the welfare of horses that are fed restrictively (non ad libitum) and kept in individual housing systems. We analyzed whether the feed intake behaviour of horses on edible bedding differs from the one of horses on non-edible bedding. As a common practice, the individually stabled horses were fed roughage twice or thrice a day. Our results showed that with this restrictive feeding practice, the horses were not able to eat any roughage for approx. 9 h during the night. Horses on non-edible bedding altered their feed intake behaviour - i.e., they paused less often during their meals and at a later point in time than the horses on edible bedding. We conclude that special feeding patterns have to be implemented (e.g., automated forage feeding systems) to avoid any impairment of the horses' welfare if kept on non-edible bedding.
   Abstract During the evolution of the horse, an extended period of feed intake, spread over the entire 24-h period, determined the horses' behaviour and physiology. Horses will not interrupt their feed intake for more than 4 h, if they have a choice. The aim of the present study was to investigate in what way restrictive feeding practices (non ad libitum) affect the horses' natural feed intake behaviour. We observed the feed intake behaviour of 104 horses on edible (n = 30) and non-edible bedding (n = 74) on ten different farms. We assessed the duration of the forced nocturnal feed intake interruption of horses housed on shavings when no additional roughage was available. Furthermore, we comparatively examined the feed intake behaviour of horses housed on edible versus non-edible bedding. The daily restrictive feeding of roughage (2 times a day: n = 8; 3 times a day: n = 2), as it is common in individual housing systems, resulted in a nocturnal feed intake interruption of more than 4 hours for the majority (74.32%, 55/74) of the horses on shavings (8:50 +/- 1:25 h, median: 8:45 h, minimum: 6:45 h, maximum: 13:23 h). In comparison to horses on straw, horses on shavings paused their feed intake less frequently and at a later latency. Furthermore, they spent less time on consuming the evening meal than horses on straw. Our results of the comparison of the feed-intake behaviour of horses on edible and non-edible bedding show that the horses' ethological feeding needs are not satisfied on non-edible bedding. If the horses accelerate their feed intake (also defined as "rebound effect"), this might indicate that the horses' welfare is compromised. We conclude that in addition to the body condition score, the longest duration of feed intake interruption (usually in the night) is an important welfare indicator of horses that have limited access to roughage.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Gait speed is a well-known indicator of risk of functional decline and mortality in older adults, but little is known about the factors associated with gait speed earlier in life.
   OBJECTIVES To test the hypothesis that slow gait speed reflects accelerated biological aging at midlife, as well as poor neurocognitive functioning in childhood and cognitive decline from childhood to midlife.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study uses data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-based study of a representative 1972 to 1973 birth cohort in New Zealand that observed participants to age 45 years (until April 2019). Data analysis was performed from April to June 2019.
   EXPOSURES Childhood neurocognitive functions and accelerated aging, brain structure, and concurrent physical and cognitive functions in adulthood.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Gait speed at age 45 years, measured under 3 walking conditions: usual, dual task, and maximum gait speeds.
   RESULTS Of the 1037 original participants (91% of eligible births; 535 [51.6%] male), 997 were alive at age 45 years, of whom 904 (90.7%) had gait speed measured (455 [50.3%] male; 93% white). The mean (SD) gait speeds were 1.30 (0.17) m/s for usual gait, 1.16 (0.23) m/s for dual task gait, and 1.99 (0.29) m/s for maximum gait. Adults with more physical limitations (standardized regression coefficient [beta], -0.27; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.21; P <.001), poorer physical functions (ie, weak grip strength [beta, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.46], poor balance [beta, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.34], poor visual-motor coordination [beta, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.30], and poor performance on the chair-stand [beta, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.40] or 2-minute step tests [beta, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.39]; all P < .001), accelerated biological aging across multiple organ systems (beta, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.40 to -0.27; P < .001), older facial appearance (beta, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.18; P < .001), smaller brain volume (beta, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.23; P < .001), more cortical thinning (beta, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.16; P=.01), smaller cortical surface area (beta, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.21; P=.003), and more white matter hyperintensities (beta, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.02; P=.01) had slower gait speed. Participants with lower IQ in midlife (beta, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.44; P < .001) and participants who exhibited cognitive decline from childhood to adulthood (beta, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.17; P < .001) had slower gait at age 45 years. Those with poor neurocognitive functioning as early as age 3 years had slower gait in midlife (beta, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.32; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adults' gait speed is associated with more than geriatric functional status; it is also associated with midlife aging and lifelong brain health.

AB  - Stand thinning and fertilization have the potential to create a diversity of forest habitat conditions to meet the goals of biodiversity conservation while sustaining wood and biomass production. Three factors are crucial to a better scientific understanding of how wildlife habitats develop in managed forests: real-world scale of treatments using adaptive management, several decades of time to monitor responses, and the testing of extreme treatments. Communities of arboreal and forest-floor small mammals occupy young coniferous stands and may serve as indicators of change in forest structure and function, and hence biodiversity. We tested the hypotheses (H) that, when compared with unmanaged (unthinned and old-growth) stands, large-scale pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and PCT with repeated fertilization, up to 16-21 years after the onset of treatments, would enhance (H-1) stand structure, (H-2) abundance of southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals, and (H-3) abundance of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands in the south-central interior of British Columbia, Canada.
   Mean diameters and heights of crop trees in thinned stands were less than those in old-growth stands, but the low-density stands did have greater mean diameters than those in unthinned stands. Mean crown volume of pine crop trees was significantly greater in the low- and medium-density stands than in the high-density, unthinned, or old-growth stands. Mean density of overstory (range of 1010-1590 stems/ha) and understory conifers were similar in the thinned and old-growth stands. Mean species and structural diversity of total conifers were significantly higher in the heavily thinned (41000 stems/ha) than other stands. For vascular plants, mean abundance of understory herbs and total structural diversity were higher in heavily thinned and fertilized stands. Thus, some aspects of stand structure supported H-1 while others did not.
   Mean abundance of M. gapperi was higher in old-growth forest than the younger managed and unthinned stands, except in years of low numbers, and hence did not support H-2 that these treatments over a longer time-frame would enhance abundance of this species. Fluctuations in numbers, drier forest ecosystems, and slow development of forest-floor habitat with decaying woody debris and fungi may contribute to flexible habitat occupancy for M. gapperi. The second part of H-2, that mean species diversity of forest-floor small mammals would be enhanced in heavily thinned and fertilized stands tended to be supported, particularly in the period prior to canopy closure. H-3, that abundance of G. sabrinus would be maintained at levels recorded in old-growth forests by PCT of young stands, was supported for medium- and high-density stands.
   A sustained flow of wood products and structural features with their habitats for wildlife and biodiversity should be achievable with a wide range of stand densities from PCT and variable regimes of nutrient additions in intensively managed forests. Essential key elements include large-scale (operational-size) treatment units and long-term monitoring of installations over decades, preferably at 5- to 10-year intervals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Berries of grape (Vitis vinifera) contain three major tissue types (skin, pulp and seed) all of which contribute to the aroma, color, and flavor characters of wine. The pericarp, which is composed of the exocarp (skin) and mesocarp (pulp), not only functions to protect and feed the developing seed, but also to assist in the dispersal of the mature seed by avian and mammalian vectors. The skin provides volatile and nonvolatile aroma and color compounds, the pulp contributes organic acids and sugars, and the seeds provide condensed tannins, all of which are important to the formation of organoleptic characteristics of wine. In order to understand the transcriptional network responsible for controlling tissue- specific mRNA expression patterns, mRNA expression profiling was conducted on each tissue of mature berries of V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon using the Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Vitis oligonucleotide microarray ver. 1.0. In order to monitor the influence of water- deficit stress on tissue- specific expression patterns, mRNA expression profiles were also compared from mature berries harvested from vines subjected to well-watered or water- deficit conditions.
   Results: Overall, berry tissues were found to express approximately 76% of genes represented on the Vitis microarray. Approximately 60% of these genes exhibited significant differential expression in one or more of the three major tissue types with more than 28% of genes showing pronounced (2-fold or greater) differences in mRNA expression. The largest difference in tissue- specific expression was observed between the seed and pulp/skin. Exocarp tissue, which is involved in pathogen defense and pigment production, showed higher mRNA abundance relative to other berry tissues for genes involved with flavonoid biosynthesis, pathogen resistance, and cell wall modification. Mesocarp tissue, which is considered a nutritive tissue, exhibited a higher mRNA abundance of genes involved in cell wall function and transport processes. Seeds, which supply essential resources for embryo development, showed higher mRNA abundance of genes encoding phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes, seed storage proteins, and late embryogenesis abundant proteins. Water-deficit stress affected the mRNA abundance of 13% of the genes with differential expression patterns occurring mainly in the pulp and skin. In pulp and seed tissues transcript abundance in most functional categories declined in water- deficit stressed vines relative to well-watered vines with transcripts for storage proteins and novel (no-hit) functional assignments being over represented. In the skin of berries from water-deficit stressed vines, however, transcripts from several functional categories including general phenypropanoid and ethylene metabolism, pathogenesis-related responses, energy, and interaction with the environment were significantly over-represented.
   Conclusion: These results revealed novel insights into the tissue- specific expression mRNA expression patterns of an extensive repertoire of genes expressed in berry tissues. This work also establishes an extensive catalogue of gene expression patterns for future investigations aimed at the dissection of the transcriptional regulatory hierarchies that govern tissue-specific expression patterns associated with tissue differentiation within berries. These results also confirmed that water-deficit stress has a profound effect on mRNA expression patterns particularly associated with the biosynthesis of aroma and color metabolites within skin and pulp tissues that ultimately impact wine quality.

AB  - The impact of climate and ocean circulation changes on marine carbon and nitrogen cycling was investigated for a period covering the Late Ordovician Hirnantian glaciation. Three sections were studied: two from Nevada, one proximal and one distal; and one from the Yukon. The opportunity to compare delta C-13(carb), delta C-13(org). and delta C-13(grap) profiles between ocean and epeiric platform settings enabled a more thorough assessment of environmental and diagenetic factors influencing the preservation of seawater delta C-13 values at each stratigraphic section. Using the best preserved sedimentary components from the two Nevada sections, a lowstand sedimentary gradient of similar to 4 parts per thousand was found between platform and ocean settings during the Hirnantian glaciation. Gradients of similar magnitude have been reported from Hirnantian platforms in the Canadian Arctic and Baltic basins. Taking the outboard sections as the most representative of the ocean carbon pool, a mean, positive delta C-13 shift of just 2.7 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand is calculated, which is significantly smaller than the 5-7 parts per thousand positive shifts recorded in epeiric platform settings. The discrepancy is attributed to the effects of local carbon cycling in tropical and subtropical epeiric seas. It is hypothesized that increased carbonate weathering caused delta C-13 values of local carbon weathering fluxes to increase, which in turn caused seawater delta C-13 values to increase in basin proximal settings. In addition, nutrient dust fluxes may have contributed to increased levels of photosynthetic activity in proximal settings, driving sedimentary delta C-13 values even higher-much higher than sediment deposited in outboard settings where carbon exchanges with the surface ocean were less restrictive.
   A delta N-15 profile reconstructed from deposits of the distal Vinini Creek section records a 1.5 parts per thousand positive shift through the Hirnantian glacial interval. Interpreted as a major Late Ordovician upwelling zone, high organic carbon (>1 wt.%) and high hydrogen indices (400-600) make the Vinini Creek section a suitable candidate for the preservation of original sedimentary delta N-15 records. To explain the results, a conceptual model of ocean nitrogen cycling under greenhouse climate conditions is presented that highlights the role of cyanobacteria as both primary producers and nitrogen fixers. It is hypothesized that in greenhouse climates, the fixed nitrogen inventory of the abyssal ocean was low due to efficient denitrification in the ocean's expansive oxygen minimum zones. This caused algal productivity to become strongly dependenton continuous supplies of fixed nitrogen from cyanobacteria in the photic zone, yielding sedimentary delta N-15 values between 0 and -2 parts per thousand By contrast, the cooler icehouse climate of the Hirnantian led to increased ocean ventilation, greater partitioning of atmospheric oxygen into downwelling surface waters, and oxygen minimum zone shrinkage. As a result, fixed nitrogen levels climbed in the ocean's abyssal depths due to the lower denitrification rates. This in turn allowed nitrogen with high delta N-15 values to recycle back into the photic zone, driving sedimentary delta N-15 values higher during the Hirnantian glaciation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The results of a study of littoral chironomid communities from 89 lakes in the Alps are presented. The lakes are located on the northern and southern sides of the Alps from the western Bernese to the eastern Julian Alps. Due to the different origins of the data set here considered, different sampling years and sampling methodologies were adopted. All of the lakes were sampled during the ice-free season, but 79/89 lakes were sampled mainly in autumn 2000, while for a few of them the sample dated back to 1996 or the early 90s. Samples were taken by kicking the different substrata or a stretch of lakeshore (10-30 m) for at least 2-5 min with a standard net and were then preserved in alcohol. Larvae and pupal exuviae were sampled by skimming the lake surface with the same net, to extend identification to species level. Notwithstanding the large altitudinal gradient, almost all of the lakes are situated above the timberline, and show a wide range of morphological (depth, watershed and lake area) and chemical characteristics. Chironomids were the most abundant insects represented in these lakes, with highest abundances at pH between 6.0 and 7.5. In particular, Orthocladiinae and Chironominae were the two subfamilies with the widest distribution. Altitude and temperature played an important role in determining their distribution, the higher altitudes were dominated by the former, whereas the latter were more numerous in lower lakes. The prevalence of Orthocladiinae and Tanytarsini at high altitudes was regarded as a general pattern of taxonomic composition in harsh climatic areas. A reverse condition occurred only in the Julian Alps, where Tanytarsini dominate, followed by Tanypodinae and rare Orthocladiinae. Although our results demonstrated that the composition of chironomid assemblages was also determined by pH, the pattern was unbalanced. Due to the fact that no cases of strong water acidification were present, taxa restricted to very low pH were poorly represented (only three taxa-Limnophyes, Endochironomus and Orthocladius (O.) spp.) compared with circumneutral (8) and alkaline (14) taxa, which occurred in slightly acid and non-acidified soft water lakes. As regard conductivity and altitude, we found that almost all the taxa present at higher pH were contemporary present at conductivity higher than 100 mu eq l(-1) and altitude lower than 2100 m a.s.l. At species level, Pseudodiamesa branickii, Corynoneura arctica, Heterotrissocladius marcidus and Paratanytarsus austriacus resulted to be the most ubiquitous and abundant species in the Alps. When the west to east distribution of taxa was taken into account, Chironomini (particularly the genera Chironomus and Dicrotendipes) and Tanypodinae (Larsia and Paramerina) were more typical of the eastern lakes (JA). They may be better indicators of more alkaline waters. Assembling all the existing data and presenting a comprehensive panorama of lake-littoral chironomid taxa of the Alps was one of the aims of this paper. Further monitoring, but also harmonization of the sampling methodologies and taxonomical identification including inter-calibration exercises among laboratories are recommended, to provide reliable basis and more knowledge for future studies of comparative biogeography, and to preserve these environments where global climatic changes may cause abrupt shifts in the faunal assemblages with a loss of taxa typical of these mountainous areas.

AB  - The middle Miocene marks the last important transgression of the Atlantic Ocean in Aquitaine. The extent of this event is recorded by the occurrence of marine deposits, thus forming the so-called "Lectoure Gulf". In the easternmost part, the deposits consist of yellow or orange sands and calcareous sandstones, sometimes with abundant macrofauna, known as "Formation des Sables Fauves". They represent very coastal environments, in which microfauna is seldom, which in turn makes difficult getting precise datings. Recent works show that the Sables Fauves are heterochronous. A main objective is to differentiate deposits from Langhian and from Serravallian, and to study the recognition and the definition of their placing. The studied area, in the middle of the Aquitaine basin, covers the Gers, Landes, and Lot-et-Garonne districts; it corresponds to the easternmost record of Sables Fauves. Our study reveals two sedimentary units, with close lithofacies: the Peyrecrechen Member (Langhian), and the Matilon Member (Serravallian). The former, biostratigraphically dated with Praeorbulina glomerosa, represents a trangressive and a highstand system tracts from a third order depositional sequence recognized as Bur 5/Lan 1 cycle. The latter, biostratigraphically dated with Orbulina group, mainly representst the trangressive and highstand system tracts from the following sequence, known as Lan 2/Ser 1 cycle. In the northern part of the studied area, the land mammal fossil record indicates that the upper part of Setravallian deposits are younger and could correspond to cycles between Ser2 and Ser4/Tor1. Climatic conditions appear relatively steady during the middle Miocene and seem to be subtropical, though cooler than the early Miocene climatic climax.
   Contemporary orogenic activity implies distensive movements in structures related to the "Flexure Celtaquitaine". This flexuration involves both a relative failing of the southern part of the basin of up to 30 m and the superposition of Peyrecrechen and Matilon Members. This may be linked to a new halocinetic activity in south Aquitaine. The propagation of the deformation due to rifting in the Lion Gulf during the middle Miocene involves a reactivation of main anticline structures and the subsequent formation of small sedimentary domes. During the Langhian, the sea invades widely to the east, forming the "Lectoure Gulf". Later, the Serravallian transgression takes place only on the western part, leading to a southern little gulf (the "Nogaro Gulf") while embanked deposits in valley fillings are the only indicators of this transgression in the Northern part of the area. Marine deposits are in normal stratigraphic succession in the South (Nogaro) whereas Serravallian deposits appear to be embanked in the North (Gabarret). From North to South, the Setravallian unit is progressively embanked in the Langhian unit and even in the early Miocene continental substratum. Geometry is mainly controlled by eustacy and tectonics. Eustatic changes involve two identified cycles. The relative sea level falls (ca. 35 m) at the latest Langhian-earliest Serravallian, while a new rising (ca. 20 m) induces the embankment of the Matilon Member in the Northern zone. Using the Sables Fauves as markers of the middle Miocene allow i) to distinguish different tectonic events and ii) to identify the concerned structures.

AB  - Background
   In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators.
   Methods and findings
   We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised trials using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West Yorkshire, England. We used 'opt-out' recruitment, and we randomly assigned practices that did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either diabetes control or risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control or anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each arm acted as the implementation control comparison for the other targeted indicator. For example, practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the comparison for practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The implementation package embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and feedback, educational outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored to each indicator. Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months comprised the following: achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of recommended BP; and anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 2015, we recruited 144 general practices collectively serving over 1 million patients. We stratified computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and pre-intervention outcome achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices to Trial 1 (40 per arm) and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial personnel were not blind to allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but provided some outcome data. We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjusted for potential confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice level (list size, locality, pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total quality scores, and levels of patient co-morbidity), and analysed cost-effectiveness. The implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.99, p = 0.017) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 1,359 pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but there was insufficient evidence of effect on other primary end-points (diabetes control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89-1.18, p = 0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI 0.96-1.16, p = 0.215; anticoagulation prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75-1.09, p = 0.214). No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without gastro-protection in patients aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI 0.39-0.99; p = 0.021). Main study limitations concern our inability to make any inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components, given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, and that the composite endpoint for diabetes control may have been too challenging to achieve.
   Conclusions
   In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also required patient engagement.

AB  - Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a carcinogen, and exposure to iAs via food and water is a global public health problem. iAs-contaminated drinking water alone affects >100 million people worldwide, including 50 million in Bangladesh. Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10(-13)), increased MMA% (P = 2x10(-16)) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10(-23)). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10(-5)). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain 10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.
   Author summary Chronic exposure to arsenic through food and drinking water is a serious global health issue, as arsenic can increase risk for cancer, cardiorespiratory diseases, and other chronic conditions. Ingested arsenic absorbed into the blood stream is metabolized (through reduction and methylation reactions) in order to facilitate excretion in urine and removal from the body. Individuals differ with respect to the efficiency of this metabolism, in part due to inherited genetic variation. The only region of the genome known to contain variation that impacts arsenic metabolism efficiency is 10q24.32, and these variants likely alter the function of the nearby gene AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase). In order to identify new genetic variants that affect arsenic metabolism, we measured variation in protein-coding regions across the entire genome for >4,800 individuals with varying levels of exposure to arsenic through naturally-contaminated drinking water in Bangladesh. Using this data, we identified a variant in the FTCD gene (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) that is associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency and risk for arsenic-induced skin lesions. This genetic variant alters the FTCD amino acid sequence, potentially disrupting a cryptic protein translation start site in exon 3. FTCD codes for an enzyme involved in histidine catabolism and one-carbon/folate metabolism; thus, our result provides new evidence supporting the well-established hypothesis that the folate/one-carbon cycle plays an important role in arsenic-related disease.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. To all Member States, the European Union has imposed a minimum percentage of 2% of biofuels in the fuels consumed for road transport since 2005. This percentage is expected to reach 5.75% in 2010, and probably 10% in 2020. In this context, investments are made everywhere in Europe in local productions of biofuels. In Belgium, ethanol from sugar beet and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) ate generally supposed to be two of the more valuable possibilities. As these industries are growing, it is important to evaluate the environmental impacts of these productions and to highlight the main sources of these impacts using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. This evaluation will also lead to propositions of improvements of the environmental performances. A comparison with the impacts of the related fossil fuels (petrol and diesel) should also be conducted. Even if these fuels are different and used in different types of engines, it is important to determine which one offers the best environmental performances, as both require arable land, which is the limiting parameter in biofuel production.
   Methods. The system boundaries include cultivation, extraction, processing and final use of the biofuels. The system has been expanded to take into account valorization of by-products in substitution of animal feed (rapeseed meat or pulps from sugar beet) or chemicals (glycerin). No economical, mass or energetic allocation was made. The yields and fertilizer consumptions of the crops are those of the Belgian conditions. Simapro 7.1 databases and the Eco-Indicator 99 method have been used for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment. The functional unit was road transport over 100 km.
   Results. The results show that, without valorization of the by-products, the impacts of the two biofuels over their whole life cycle are not significantly lower than those of the related fossil fuels. However, the credits accorded thanks to the valorization of by-products lead to improvements of the environmental performances in comparison to fossil fuels, especially for RME.
   Discussion. The impacts of agriculture and production of the fertilizers are more important in the case of RME, because the yield per hectare is lower than in the production of ethanol from sugar beet. However, the extraction of the sugar from the beet, fermentation, purification of the ethanol and drying of the pulps and slops consume much more energy than extraction and esterification of rapeseed oil. Moreover, the by-products of RME (rapeseed meal and glycerin) are more valuable than those of ethanol from sugar beet (pulps). This induces a more important environmental benefit in the production of RME. These parameters lead to a global environmental impact that is higher for the production of ethanol than for RME.
   Conclusions. Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been successfully applied to two of the major ways of production of biofuels in Belgium using specific local data. The assessment of the environmental impacts reveals that rapeseed methyl ester allows a considerable improvement of the environmental performances compared to fossil diesel, while ethanol from sugar beet offers a more limited benefit compared to petrol.
   Recommendations. Arable land is a limited resource, especially in West-European countries like Belgium. Therefore, choices must be made to have the most valuable environmental benefit. Soil quality and crop rotations should also be taken into account before making a decision.

AB  - Although understanding of nitrogen cycling and nitrification in forest ecosystems has improved greatly over the past several decades, our ability to characterize spatial patterns is still quite limited. A number of studies have shown linkages between canopy chemistry and N cycling, but few have considered the degree to which these trends can provide an indicator of forest N status across large, heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we examined relationships among canopy chemistry, nitrogen cycling, and soil carbon: nitrogen ratios across 30 forested stands in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Plots included a range of species (sugar maple, red maple, American beech, yellow birch, paper birch, red spruce, balsam fir, eastern hemlock) and were broadly grouped into two disturbance categories: those that were historically affected by intensive logging and/or fire and those that experienced minimal human disturbance.
   Across all plots, rates of not N mineralization and net nitrification were correlated with canopy nitrogen concentrations, but the relationships differed between disturbance treatments. In deciduous forests, historically undisturbed stands had significantly higher rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification than previously disturbed stands, but these differences were not clearly reflected in patterns of stand-level canopy chemistry. Although soil C:N ratios also differed between disturbed and undisturbed stands, a relationship between soil C:N ratios and canopy lignin:N ratios did not vary with either forest type or disturbance, suggesting that this trend is more consistent across diverse conditions.
   Relationships between foliar chemistry and N cycling within individual species revealed interesting differences between species and functional groups. For four out of five deciduous species, foliar N increased with increasing net N mineralization, indicating, that species were responsive to changes in N availability and suggesting a positive feedback between foliar chemistry and soil N status. These patterns led to significant differences in foliar N between disturbance treatments for some species, but at the stand level, these differences were masked by successional changes in species composition. Among coniferous species, foliar N showed no variation across wide N-cycling gradients, suggesting a fundamentally different plant-soil interaction.
   We also examined the potential for extending observed field relationships to the regional level using a high-quality data set of high spectral resolution remote sensing, obtained from NASA's AVIRIS instrument (Airborne Visible and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer). Cloud-free AVIRIS data from 56 scenes covering the White Mountain National Forest were calibrated to canopy lignin:N ratios and were applied to prediction of C:N ratios in soils. Validation at 10 independent plots showed good prediction accuracy but suggested some overprediction at the low end of the range. Preliminary regional estimates of soil C:N ratios indicate that 63% of the region's land area falls below a value of 22. This value is significant because our field data identified this as a critical threshold for the onset of nitrification. Below C:N = 22, we expect increasing but variable rates of nitrification, depending on other factors such as disturbance or species composition.

AB  - In this study body temperature (BT, A degrees C) and panting score (PS, 0-4.5; where 0 = no panting/no stress and 4.5 = catastrophic stress) data were obtained from 30 Angus steers housed outside over 120 days Steers were implanted with a BT transmitter on day -31, BT was recorded at 30-min intervals to a data logger and downloaded each day to a database. The cattle were housed in ten outdoor un-shaded pens with an earthen floor, eight of which had a pen floor area of 144 m(2) (three transmitter steers plus five non-transmitter steers; 18 m(2)/steer) and two had an area of 168 m(2) (three transmitter steers and six non-transmitter steers; 18.7 m(2)/steer). Only data from the transmitter steers were used in this study. The PS of the steers was obtained daily (+/- 15 min) at 0600 hours (AM), 1200 hours (MD) and 1600 hours (PM). At the same times climate variables (ambient temperature, black globe temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and rainfall) were obtained from an on-site weather station. PS observations were made from outside the pens so as not to influence cattle responses. The two closest BT values to the time when PS was obtained were downloaded retrospectively from a logger and averaged. A total of 8,352 observations were used to generate second order polynomial response curves: (AM) y = 39.08 + 0.009 x + 0.137x (2) (R (2) = 0.94; P < 0.001) (MD) y = 39.09 + 0.914x - 0.080x (2) (R (2) = 0.89; P < 0.001) and (PM) y = 39.52 + 0.790x - 0.068x (2) (R (2) = 0.83; P < 0.001) where y = BT (A degrees C) and x PS. These data suggest that PS is a good indicator of body temperature. The BT at MD corresponded to slightly lower PS compared with PM, e.g., for PS 1; BT at MD = 39.1 A +/- 0.05 A degrees C whereas BT at PM = 39.5 A +/- 0.05 A degrees C. However during AM, BT was lower (P < 0.05) at PS 1, 2 and 2.5 compared with MD and PM. For example, when PS was 2.5 the BT at AM was 40.2 A +/- 0.04 A degrees C, at MD it was 40.9 A +/- 0.04 A degrees C and at PM BT was 41.1 A +/- 0.04 A degrees C. When PS was 0 the BT at AM and MD were similar. The AM response curve suggests animals attempt to increase heat dissipation during the cooler AM period relative to MD and PM. Morning observation of cattle (before feeding) are crucial for effective heat load management especially on days when high heat load is expected. The MD and PM observations provide a good indication of the impact of high environmental heat load on cattle. Differences in PS between AM and PM observations suggest that more research is needed to determine the effect of night time conditions on BT, PS and overall respiratory dynamics of cattle during periods of hot weather.

AB  - A 274-lake calibration data-set for chironomid-based temperature reconstruction is presented which is based on the taxonomic amalgamation of a 117-lake data-set from Switzerland and a 157-lake data-set from Norway and Svalbard. Taxonomic consistency of the two data-sets was ensured by joint microscope sessions by the two involved analysts, re-identifying chironomid assemblages in the Swiss data-set to reach an identical taxonomic resolution as in the Norwegian data, and by double-checking selected samples of the Norwegian calibration data-set. The combined Swiss-Norwegian calibration data-set contains information on the distribution of 154 chironomid taxa over a July air temperature range of 3.5-18.4 degrees C, a pH range of 4.7-8.8, and an altitudinal range of 5-2815 m asl from lakes in temperate, subarctic, arctic, and alpine environments. Inference models developed based on this data-set using weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression outperformed inference models based on maximum likelihood regression. After outlier deletion WA-PLS regression predicted July air temperature with a bootstrapped (cross-validated) root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.40 degrees C. Inference models developed from the separate regional data-sets have an RMSEP of 1.16 and 1.43 degrees C for the Norwegian and the Swiss calibration data-set, respectively. The WA-PLS inference model based on the Norwegian data-set adequately predicted July air temperature based on chironomid assemblages in the Swiss data-set (RMSEP 2.05 degrees C; r(2) 0.74). In contrast, the WA-PLS model based on the Swiss chironomid assemblages performed poorly in inferring July air temperatures based on the Norwegian chironomid assemblages (RMSEP 2.70 degrees C; r(2) 039). We attribute this discrepancy to the large proportion of chironomid taxa in Norwegian samples not represented in the Swiss data-set, the larger range of both pH and lake types included in the Norwegian calibration data-set, and the lack of some chironomid taxa with an arctic and boreal distribution in the Swiss data-set. The WA-PLS inference model based on the combined Swiss-Norwegian calibration data-set is the largest taxonomically consistent chironomid-based inference model available to date and outperforms other existing models if the r(2) and RMSEP relative to the overall temperature gradient are examined. We demonstrate that the combined model can reconstruct a larger range of temperatures when applied to fossil assemblages than models based on the Norwegian or Swiss calibration data-sets only. The combined data-set includes the majority of chironomid taxa expected in late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments of lakes from Northern, Eastern, and Central Europe as well as from southern European mountain lakes. The newly developed WA-PLS inference model is therefore well suited for developing continental-scale reconstructions of late Quaternary temperature change based on chironomid records from different parts of Europe.

AB  - The ultimate object of this study is the replacement of the precipitator plus the rapid sand filter (RSF) used in the conventional water treatment plant (WTP) with single filtration equipment. The pore controllable fiber (PCF) filter which was one of the depth filters using the pump pressure was studied from 2008 to apply to the portable water production. In this study, the PCF was improved by thickening the filter media depth more than 2 times and adjusting the backwash conditions. The feed used in the main study was supplied from the Hoedong catchment of which hydraulic retention time was about 14 d. So, its average turbidity was very low as much as about 5.76 NTU and its particle size was very fine as much as about 8 mu m by weight average since it was naturally precipitated for 14 d. The purpose of this study is to discuss problems and to find solutions through performance tests of the improved PCF (let 150 mm PCF) for the WTP process. According to pilot test results, the filter showed more than 99% removal of the turbidity and so the turbidity of the filtrate was as low as 0.066 NTU after increasing the filter media depth to 150 mm even though the raw water's turbidity was as low as 8.97 NTU. Moreover, a similar pilot which was tested on the raw water of the Nacdong river for 2 months from June of 2020 showed that the filtrate turbidity was 0.065 NTU and 99.7% of the turbidity was removed from 24.9 NTU of the feed. These results hint that the PCF could be in a fair way to replace the conventional WTP in the near future. According to the performance data for nine equipment including the PCF and seven of UF membranes evaluated by BWQI that was the public organization of Busan city, Korea from to June 24 to September 17 of 2018, the PCF having 100 mm filter media depth (let 100 mm PCF) was lower than the UF by 0.3% in the turbidity removal but was higher than the UF by 11%, 22.7%, and 20% in dissolved organic carbon, Mn, and trihalomethane formation potential removal, respectively. On the other hand, results of SDI15 measurements that were the indirect indicator for colloidal showed 3.3 for the PCF and 2.3 for 6 of the UF by average which were satisfying the RO pre-treatment standard, 5.0 as the colloidal level. The colloidal removal of the 100 mm PCF was slightly worse than membranes through the comparison of the turbidity removal and the SDI15 between the 100 mm PCF and membrane. It was found that these problems were coming from the initial filtrate of the PCF. So, it was concluded that the circulation of the initial filtrate of the PCF to the feed is needed to obtain higher colloidal removal from the PCF, and it is expected that this work makes the colloidal removal of the PCF close to the membrane.

AB  - Electrical resistivity and self-potential are effective geophysical tools for monitoring the soil and groundwater pollution because they are accurate, rapid, costless and non-distractive techniques. Direct or indirect burying of the corpses into the soil is one of the main factors which pollute the soil and the groundwater after decomposition of the tissues and bones. Therefore, the main objective of this study are using these tools to evaluate the rate of soil and groundwater pollution due to burying the corpses in chipboard coffins at depths approximately 0.70-1.30 m (Christians burial method) and directly into the soil at depths about 1.5-1.8 m (Muslims burial method). Beside, assessing the contamination depths and flow paths of the groundwater investigated area. The study area was carefully chosen because of: 1- it contains two different burial methods, 2- presence of shallow groundwater aquifer, 3- the surface layer which contains the burial depth is porous and permeable, 4- the cemeteries are near enough to the population density and agricultural lands. The study area was divided to three main sites; site 1, site 2 and site 3 for Christian cemeteries, Muslims ones and control area that does not contains any cemeteries respectively. Five two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles were surveyed and analyzed using RES2DINV software (two profiles on the site 1, two profiles on the site 2 and one profile on the site 3). 121 points of vertical electrical sounding (VES) at the same depth were collected and analyzed in 3D iso-resistivity map. Self-potential survey (SP) were performed on the same 121 points of VES stations for comparison where the data was contoured to build 3D iso-potential map. The geophysical results were correlated with the available borehole data. The results revealed presence of three resistivity zones of high resistivities (1000-3000 Omega m), moderate ones (50-1000 Omega m) and low ones (<50 Omega m). The main constituents of these three zones are elastic sedimentary rocks with different grain sizes. The rapid decreasing in the resistivity values in the site 2 than that in the site 1 is resulting from the rapid decomposition of the death bodies due to direct burying in the ground without coffins leading to more pollution rates of the soil and the groundwater than burying in coffins. Increasing of the burial depth causes increasing of the contamination rate of the shallow groundwater aquifer. Positive and negative values of potentials were recorded in 3D iso-potential contour map reflecting the flow direction from low to high potentials. The negative values were attributed to the leakage of more the putrefactive liquid resulting from decomposition of the death body. Positive potential values were caused due to the semi-fluid masses consisting of water and putrefied tissues which are mostly generated by the corpses buried in coffins with less amount of fluids and the putrefactive liquid evaporation and low humidity.

AB  - Background: Forests and the forest sector may play an important role in mitigating climate change. The Paris Agreement and the recent legislative proposal to include the land use sector in the EU 2030 climate targets reflect this expectation. However, greater confidence on estimates from national greenhouse gas inventories (GHGI) and more comprehensive analyses of mitigation options are needed to seize this mitigation potential. The aim of this paper is to provide a tool at EU level for verifying the EU GHGI and for simulating specific policy and forest management scenarios. Therefore, the Carbon Budget Model (CBM) was applied for an integrated assessment of the EU forest carbon (C) balance from 2000 to 2012, including: (i) estimates of the C stock and net CO2 emissions for forest management (FM), afforestation/reforestation (AR) and deforestation (D), covering carbon in both the forest and the harvest wood product (HWP) pools; (ii) an overall analysis of the C dynamics associated with harvest and natural disturbances (mainly storms and fires); (iii) a comparison of our estimates with the data reported in the EU GHGI.
   Results: Overall, the average annual FM sink (-365 Mt CO2 year(-1)) estimated by the CBM in the period 2000-2012 corresponds to about 7 % of total GHG emissions at the EU level for the same period (excluding land use, land-use change and forestry). The HWP pool sink (-44 Mt CO2 year(-1)) contributes an additional 1 %. Emissions from D (about 33 Mt CO2 year(-1)) are more than compensated by the sink in AR (about 43 Mt CO2 year(-1) over the period). For FM, the estimates from the CBM were about 8 % lower than the EU GHGI, a value well within the typical uncertainty range of the EU forest sink estimates. For AR and D the match with the EU GHGI was nearly perfect (difference <+/- 2 % in the period 2008-2012). Our analysis on harvest and natural disturbances shows that: (i) the impact of harvest is much greater than natural disturbances but, because of salvage logging (often very relevant), the impact of natural disturbances is often not easily distinguishable from the impact of harvest, and (ii) the impact of storms on the biomass C stock is 5-10 times greater than fires, but while storms cause only indirect emissions (i.e., a transfer of C from living biomass to dead organic matter), fires cause both direct and indirect emissions.
   Conclusions: This study presents the application of a consistent methodological approach, based on an inventory-based model, adapted to the forest management conditions of EU countries. The approach captures, with satisfactory detail, the C sink reported in the EU GHGI and the country-specific variability due to harvest, natural disturbances and land-use changes. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of its kind at EU level, i.e., including all the forest pools, HWP and natural disturbances, and a comparison with the EU GHGI.The results provide the basis for possible future policy-relevant applications of this model, e.g., as a tool to support GHGIs (e.g., on accounting for natural disturbances) and to verify the EU GHGI, and for the simulation of specific scenarios at EU level.

AB  - In the review we analyzed short history of the establishment of a novel hematological parameter for systemic inflammation and stress coined as a neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Today NLR is widely used across almost all medical disciplines as a reliable and easy available marker of immune response to various infectious and non-infectious stimuli. We analyzed the immunological and biological aspects of dynamic changes of neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes in circulating blood during endocrine stress, dysbalance of autonomic nervous system and systemic inflammation. NLR reflects online dynamic relationship between innate (neutrophils) and adaptive cellular immune response (lymphocytes) during illness and various pathological states. NLR is influenced by many conditions including age, rice, medication, chronic disease like coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, psychiatric diagnosis, cancer of solid organs, anemia and stress. A normal range of NLR is between 1-2, the values higher than 3.0 and below 0.7 in adults are pathological. NLR in a grey zone between 2.3-3.0 may serve as early warning of pathological state or process such like cancer, atherosclerosis, infection, inflammation, psychiatric disorders and stress. NLR is used as a reliable and cheap marker of ongoing cancer related inflammation and a valid indicator of prognosis of solid tumors. Majority of meta-analyses have explored the prognostic value of NLR in various solid tumors and have found out the cut-off value of NLR above 3.0 (IQR 2.5-5.0). We summarized its privilege in oncology: NLR may be used for stratification of cancer, correlates with the tumor size, stage of tumors, metastatic potential and lymphatic invasion. NLR has independent prognostic role regarding overall, cancer free and cancer-specific survival. It is useful for monitoring oncological therapy, including biological and immune check point inhibitors treatment. NLR is a very sensitive indicator of infection, inflammation and sepsis, validated in numerous studies. Clinical research confirmed the sensitivity of NLR for diagnosis/stratification of systemic infection, sepsis, bacteremia as well as its robust predictive and prognostic value. NLR should be investigated daily, and follow-up its absolute values and dynamic course in acute disease or critical illness. The severity of critical illness, the level of stress and serious inflammation is expressed by dramatic increasing of NLR values above 11 >= 17, or even higher than 30. Improving the clinical course of sepsis, critical illness, lower risk of mortality are associated with decline of NLR values below 7. NLR is helpful in differentiating more severe disease versus milder one. NLR is cheap, simple, fast responding and easy available parameter of stress and inflammation with high sensitivity and low specificity, it should be used routinely in emergency departments, ICUs, in acute medicine including surgery, orthopedics, traumatology, cardiology, neurology, psychiatry and even oncology. Dynamic changes of NLR precede the clinical state for several hours and may warn clinicians about the ongoing pathological process early. NLR is a novel perspective marker of cellular immune activation, a valid index of stress and systemic inflammation, which open a new dimension for clinical medicine, for better understanding of the biology of inflammation, coupling and antagonism between innate and adaptive immunity and its clinical consequences for health and disease (Tab. 8, Fig. 3, Ref. 151).

TI  - COMPILING THE STRATEGIES OF ALFA MINING COMPANY AND PRIORITIZING THEM BY WASPAS METHOD
T2  - LOGFORUM
LA  - English
KW  - SWOT Matrix
KW  - Strategic Planning
KW  - WASPAS
KW  - ACCEPT
AB  - Background: Nowadays mining companies, as non-profit organizations like other organizations, face a complex and turbulent environment. The proper guidance of the organizations depends on understanding the internal and external environment and making smart strategic decisions. Therefore, to deal effectively with all the factors that affect the ability of the company in its profitable growth, because organizations need compiling strategic planning to increase their capabilities, long-term growth and survival and to reduce operational risk, organizations have turned to strategic planning in particular. After compiling strategies, determining the priority of strategies is very important. The statistical population of this research has consisted of 50 heads of operational and support affairs units [to determine internal factors] along with 10 managers and deputies [to determine external factors]. In this research, strategies were first identified via the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats [SWOT] matrix and then ranked by the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment [WASPAS] method.
   Materials and methods: In addition to the QSPM approach, multi-indicator decision-making models can also be used to prioritize strategies. Nowadays, as multi-indicator decision-making related topics are intensified and on the other hand, the increasing tendency towards interdisciplinary sciences and the use of theories of various groups and specialties in solving complex problems, the necessity to pay attention to decision-making analysis techniques and exploiting them in solving existing complex problems is of great importance. In these models, selecting one option among the available options is considered. In a general definition, multi-indicator decision making refers to specific [preferential type] decisions, such as evaluating, prioritizing, or selecting among the available options [which sometimes should be done among several contrasting indicators]. Some multi-indicator decision-making models are: AHP, ANP, ELECTRE, VICTOR, TOPSIS, SAW, GRA, SIR, PROMETHEE and WASPAS. In this article, the WASPAS method has been used to determine the prioritization of strategies.
   Results: In this research, strategies were first identified via the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats [SWOT] matrix and then ranked by the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment [WASPAS] method. Ultimately, the strategies of "assigning a part of the sale to individuals or qualified private companies", "creating the Technology Transfer Office [TTO] in order to move towards self-sufficiency", and "comprehensive planning in the field of human resources in order to create an effective and efficient culture" were selected as strategic priorities for the Alpha Mining Company.
   Conclusions: Various approaches have already been proposed to prioritize strategies; in this research, the criteria have been specified using the ACCEPT approach and finally by the WASPAS method, the strategies have been prioritized. The ACCEPT method unlike the QSPM method, which prioritized strategies by taking into account strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, regardless of environmental conditions and existing organizational status and externally by considering 6 main parameters of strategy evaluation including cost, time, popularity, effective, and so on, helps to prioritize strategies. In this research, it was tried to use one of the techniques of MADM according to relevant and important criteria to enhance the assurance coefficient of managers' decision making Multi-criteria decision-making techniques have this advantage that they evaluate various options according to various criteria that do not have equal units. Another important advantage of multi-criteria decision-making techniques is that they are capable of analyzing quantitative and qualitative criteria simultaneously.

AB  - Introduction
   It is recommended that pediatric patients be released from the post-anesthesia recovery area once they are no longer at risk for cardiorespiratory depression. However, these guidelines do not specify how a provider is to monitor recovery of neurocognitive status.
   Previous studies have evaluated the utility of psychomotor tests to measure anesthetic recovery; however, most of these tests are time consuming and are rarely used in the post-anesthesia recovery area. The Trieger Dot Test (TDT) is one of these tests and is a well validated measure of anesthetic recovery. The King Devick Test (KDT) has emerged as a scientifically valid test for a multitude of neurological medical conditions.
   The test uses a system of Rapid Number Naming which assesses the subject's ability to read aloud a series of numbers and determines their ability to discern levels of contrast. This test detects impairments of eye movements, language, attention, and overall neurological function and is validated down to an age of 5 years.
   Null Hypothesis:
   There is no measured difference in the return to baseline between the King Devick Test and the Trieger Dot Test in determining sedation recovery in non-neurological pediatric patients.
   Material and methods
   Subjects were recruited from the University of Iowa pediatric sedation clinic. The recruited subjects were children and adolescents between the ages of 6-17. No patients with a neurologic diagnosis were included in the study. Each patient performed both the KDT and TDT pre-sedation to establish a baseline. These tests were repeated once when the patient woke up (Post1) and again 20 minutes later (Post2). These tests did not interfere with clinical care, and the discharging physician was blinded to the results. After discharge, the family repeated both tests on the subject at home 24 hours post-sedation.
   Results
   A total of 41 patients were recruited for the study. Extraneous deviations for the TDT were compared to a total score for the KDT which summed the time and errors from all three cards. Baseline was established as baseline +/-1/5(median change in score after sedation) to account for natural random variation. The results of the paired ttests for KDT show that there is a highly significant difference between scores at baseline, Post1, and Post2 (p < 0.001). The p-values for the same tests for TDT were also all significant at the 5% level, however the difference between deviations at the Post2 after sedation is much less significant (p = 0.04). The results of McNemar's statistical test show no difference between the two assessments at Post1 (p = 0.31), but a significant difference between the assessments at Post2 (p = 0.04). 0.018).
   Conclusions
   The paired t-test results show that the KDT, like the TDT, can measure differences in a patient's cognitive ability during recovery from sedation. Furthermore, McNemar's statistical test shows that at Post2 the TDT significantly classified more patients at baseline than the KDT. This corresponds with the results of the paired t-tests, in that more patients were close to baseline at Post2 for the TDT, than for the KDT. Overall, we can conclude that there is evidence that the KDT is more sensitive to impairment than the TDT, and if it were used in place of the TDT it would take more time for children to return to baseline after sedation.

AB  - Background
   The impacts of climate change on surface water, waterborne disease, and human health remain a growing area of concern, particularly in Africa, where diarrheal disease is one of the most important health threats to children under 5 years of age. Little is known about the role of surface water and annual flood dynamics (flood pulse) on waterborne disease and human health nor about the expected impact of climate change on surface-water-dependent populations.
   Methods and findings
   Using the Chobe River in northern Botswana, a flood pulse river-floodplain system, we applied multimodel inference approaches assessing the influence of river height, water quality (bimonthly counts of Escherichia coli and total suspended solids [TSS], 2011-2017), and meteorological variability on weekly diarrheal case reports among children under 5 presenting to health facilities (n = 10 health facilities, January 2007-June 2017). We assessed diarrheal cases by clinical characteristics and season across age groups using monthly outpatient data (January 1998-June 2017). A strong seasonal pattern was identified, with 2 outbreaks occurring regularly in the wet and dry seasons. The timing of outbreaks diverged from that at the level of the country, where surface water is largely absent. Across age groups, the number of diarrheal cases was greater, on average, during the dry season. Demographic and clinical characteristics varied by season, underscoring the importance of environmental drivers. In the wet season, rainfall (8-week lag) had a significant influence on under-5 diarrhea, with a 10-mm increase in rainfall associated with an estimated 6.5% rise in the number of cases. Rainfall, minimum temperature, and river height were predictive of E. coli concentration, and increases in E. coli in the river were positively associated with diarrheal cases. In the dry season, river height (1-week lag) and maximum temperature (1 - and 4-week lag) were significantly associated with diarrheal cases. During this period, a 1-meter drop in river height corresponded to an estimated 16.7% and 16.1% increase in reported diarrhea with a 1- and 4-week lag, respectively. In this region, as floodwaters receded from the surrounding floodplains, TSS levels increased and were positively associated with diarrheal cases (0- and 3-week lag). Populations living in this region utilized improved water sources, suggesting that hydrological variability and rapid water quality shifts in surface waters may compromise water treatment processes. Limitations include the potential influence of health beliefs and health seeking behaviors on data obtained through passive surveillance.
   Conclusions
   In flood pulse river-floodplain systems, hydrology and water quality dynamics can be highly variable, potentially impacting conventional water treatment facilities and the production of safe drinking water. In Southern Africa, climate change is predicted to intensify hydrological variability and the frequency of extreme weather events, amplifying the public health threat of waterborne disease in surface-water-dependent populations. Water sector development should be prioritized with urgency, incorporating technologies that are robust to local environmental conditions and expected climate-driven impacts. In populations with high HIV burdens, expansion of diarrheal disease surveillance and intervention strategies may also be needed. As annual flood pulse processes are predominantly influenced by climate controls in distant regions, country-level data may be inadequate to refine predictions of climate- health interactions in these systems.

AB  - Precipitation is a key parameter for the study of climate change and variability and the detection and monitoring of natural disaster such as drought. Precipitation datasets that accurately capture the amount and spatial variability of rainfall is critical for drought monitoring and a wide range of other climate applications. This is challenging in many parts of the world, which often have a limited number of weather stations and/or historical data records. Satellite-derived precipitation products offer a viable alternative with several remotely sensed precipitation datasets now available with long historical data records (+3oyears), which include the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) datasets. This study presents a comparative analysis of three historical satellite-based precipitation datasets that include Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B43 version 7 (1998-2015), PERSIANN-CDR (1983-2015) and CHIRPS 2.0 (1981-2015) over Chile to assess their performance across the country and for the case of the two long-term products the applicability for agricultural drought were evaluated when used in the calculation of commonly used drought indicator as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this analysis, 278 weather stations of in situ rainfall measurements across Chile were initially compared to the satellite data. The study area (Chile) was divided into five latitudinal zones: North, North-Central, Central, South-Central and South to determine if there were a regional difference among these satellite products, and nine statistics were used to evaluate their performance to estimate the amount and spatial distribution of historical rainfall across Chile. Hierarchical cluster analysis, k-means and singular value decomposition were used to analyze these datasets to better understand their similarities and differences in characterizing rainfall patterns across Chile. Monthly analysis showed that all satellite products highly overestimated rainfall in the arid North zone. However, there were no major difference between all three products from North to South-Central zones. Though, in the South zone, PERSIANN-CDR shows the lowest fit with high underestimation, while CHIRPS 2.0 and TMPA 3B43 v7 had better agreement with in situ measurements. The accuracy of satellite products were highly dependent on the amount of monthly rainfall with the best results found during winter seasons and in zones (Central to South) with higher amounts of precipitation. PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS 2.0 were used to derive SPI at time-scale of 1, 3 and 6 months, both satellite products presented similar results when it was compared in situ against satellite SPI's. Because of its higher spatial resolution that allows better characterizing of spatial variation in precipitation pattern, the CHIRPS 2.0 was used to mapping the SPI-3 over Chile. The results of this study show that in order to use the CHIRPS 2.0 and PERSIANN-CDR datasets in Chile to monitor spatial patterns in the rainfall and drought intensity conditions, these products should be calibrated to adjust for the overestimation/underestimation of rainfall geographically specially in the North, zone and seasonally during the summer and spring months in the other zones.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. The development of ecotoxicity effect indicators (EEIs) for use in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) has only been going on for about two decades. Traditionally, noeffect indicators have been applied. In this paper we focus on the development of an effect-based (i.e. EC50-based) average indicator, the GM-troph. The indicator is estimated by use of the hazardous concentration for 50% of the covered species (HC50(EC50)) and is designed to work on a low substance data availability of only three acute data values, which is often required in LCIA.
   Methods. The study includes a theoretical description and a test on real data of three different effect-based average approaches (arithmetic mean, geometric mean and median) focusing on their statistical robustness. The data set used for the testing is composed of real ecotoxicity effect data for eleven different substances representing seven different toxic modes of action (TMoA).
   Results and Discussion. The theoretical considerations and the test on real data show that the geometric mean is the most robust average estimator for HC50(EC50), especially in the frequent situation where data availability is limited to a few data points. Test results indicate that in some cases of unequal representation of the different taxa (or trophic levels) in the underlying data set, estimations of average toxicity (i.e. HC50(EC50)) may be biased if each single test data (at a species level) is used as data points instead of averages at trophic levels.
   Conclusions and Recommendations. Based on these results, the following recommendations are given for the choice of estimation principle for the FEE The indicator shall be based on HC50(EC50) estimated as the geometric mean of three (average) EC50 values, covering the three main taxa, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, which represent the three trophic levels of the ecosystem, primary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers. In practice, the EEI shall be based on data from laboratory tests with algae, invertebrates (crustaceans) and fish. Instead of using the often wide 95% confidence limits, it is recommended to use the range given by the observed maximum and minimum values as limits around the HC50(EC50). Further, it is recommended to use EC50(chronic) values when possible. Often, only acute data will be available, and here the use of best estimate assessment factors is recommended to extrapolate from acute to chronic values. As a starting point, an acute to chronic ratio of 2 between HC50(EC50)(acute) and HC50(EC50) (chronic) is recommended, but more research is certainly needed in this area. Due to the comparative framework of LCIA it is recommended only to use test results from laboratory tests, fulfilling certain standard conditions, i.e. applying standard organisms, and measuring well defined endpoints over restricted test durations.
   Perspectives. The ability of a geometric, mean-based HC50(EC50) to represent the toxicity of very toxic substances and toxicity towards very sensitive species has not been dealt with here, and further research is needed. However, on the basis of the results from the tests on real data, it may be anticipated that the GM-troph with its max-min limits to some degree accounts for the toxicity even to the most sensitive species among standard organisms, if representative toxicity data are available.

AB  - Afforestation of degraded pastures can potentially enhance carbon sequestration, but little is known about the effects of eucalyptus plantations on soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. We used density and particle size SOM fractionations to evaluate changes in SOM for a chronosequence of eucalyptus plantations established on degraded pastures in two contrasting regions in southeastern Brazil. Declines in the content of soil C derived from the pasture (C4 photosynthetic pathway) and the accumulation of that derived from the eucalyptus (C3 photosynthetic pathway) were followed through 13 C natural abundance of the SOM. The two study areas were in the Rio Doce River Valley, Minas Gerais State, namely: 1, Belo Oriente (BO, a region with lower elevation, higher mean annual temperature, lower forest productivities and dominated by clayey Typic Haplustoxs); 2, Virginopolis (VG, a region of higher elevation, higher forest productivities and dominated by clayey Rhodic Ustoxs). In the BO region the chronosequence included 0, 4.2, 13.2, 22.2, 32.0 and 34.2 years of eucalyptus cultivation and in the VG region soils were cultivated with eucalyptus for 0, 8.2, 19.2, 29.2 and 33.2 years. The accumulated cultivation time corresponds to about five rotations. In both regions the initial soil condition was represented by a site that was still under pasture. Soil samples collected at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths were analyzed for: total organic carbon (TOC); C in the fulvic (FAF), humic (HAF) and humin (HF) fractions; C in the free (FLF) and occluded (OLF) light fractions; C associated with the heavy fractions, namely, the sand (SF), silt plus clay (S + CF) and clay (CF) fractions; and C in the microbial biomass (MB). Carbon stocks of virtually all SOM fractions were about twice as high in the VG region than in the BO region. Eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region increased C stocks in all SOM fractions, except for the MB fraction that was not altered and the SF fraction that declined with time of eucalyptus cultivation. Increases in TOC, FAF and HF organic C fractions were observed in the VG region. Mean annual accumulations across the entire cultivation period in the 0-10 cm soil layer showed virtually no difference averaging 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the BO region and 0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the VG region. However, gains of TOC peaked by the end of the third rotation in the BO region and the second rotation in the VG region, so the TOC accumulation rate during the respective aggrading periods would correspond to 0.35 and 0.57 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). There was no clear evidence that the more labile, fast cycling SOM fractions were more sensitive indicators of the impact of eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region, whereas in the VG region the FLF and OLF were more sensitive to the land use change than TOC.

AB  - Peculiarities of territorial community (hromada) development management are revealed and theoretical approaches to budget decentralization in Ukraine are substantiated. Based on the analysis of the composition and structure of local budgets, as well as the calculation of financial independence of territorial communities (hromadas), it is proved that the current budget system of Ukraine is characterized by a high degree of budgetary resources centralization, which does not provide real independence. Building an efficient model of fiscal decentralization consists in determining the tax potential of a separate administrative-territorial unit (territorial community). For further success of decentralization, it is necessary to determine the optimal amount of government functions that are appropriate and cost-effective to delegate to the appropriate local level on a permanent basis, thereby converting them into the local government's own functions.
   Purpose of study. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of budget decentralization on the sustainable development of territorial communities (hromadas), to determine its relationship with changes in the administrative territorial structure of Ukraine and to strengthen the financial independence of newly established institutions (amalgamated hromadas).
   Methodology. In the course of the research the following methods were used: analogy and comparative analysis to identify the features of the implementation of fiscal decentralization in different countries of the world and in Ukraine; settlement and constructive - used in determining the indicators of territorial communities' financial independence in the process of budget decentralization implementation in Ukraine; abstract-logical to reveal the main threats to the financial security of territorial communities and justify proposals and recommendations to ensure their sustainable development.
   Results of the study. The study showed the presence of certain features in the implementation of budget decentralization reform in Ukraine in modern conditions due to a number of macroeconomic and institutional factors with a long-term and globalization nature of manifestation. They led to the emergence of clearly defined trends and patterns of change in the choice of regional development financial instruments, which will further improve the process of development management of Ukrainian administrative-territorial units in terms of decentralization to achieve the priorities of socio-economic development.
   Peculiarities of territorial community development management are revealed and theoretical approaches to budget decentralization in Ukraine are substantiated. Based on the analysis of the local budget revenues composition and structure, as well as the calculation of the territorial community financial independence indicators, it was proved that the modern budget system of Ukraine is characterized by a high degree of centralization of budgetary resources.
   It has been substantiated that the difficulties arising in the financing of state budget expenditures under both unitary and federal systems are largely due to the imperfection or inconsistency of certain provisions of the Basic Law (the Constitution) with the current state of interstate relations and the domestic political situation.
   Conclusion. It is emphasized that the main problem to be solved to build an effective and efficient model of fiscal decentralization is to determine the tax potential of a particular administrative-territorial unit (territorial community) and the optimal volume of state functions that are expedient and cost-effective to delegate to the local level as own functions of local self-government.

AB  - This experimental work deals with preliminary studies concerning combined planar electrophoresis-electrochromatography system involving stationary phases composed of various natural materials applied for the separation of selected colorants. The main goal of the presented experiment is to investigate the key parameters (applied voltage, electrolyte composition, pH) and separation protocol setup (stationary phase/connection strips type and geometry) enabling the fast prototyping of simple analytical systems for the fractionation and/or separation of low-molecular mass compounds. Four water-based electrolytes that are as simple as possible (without additional organic liquid components or modifiers), including boric acid 100 mM (pH = 4.3), 1:1 mixture of boric acid 90 mM and Tris base 90 mM (pH = 8.2), boric acid 100 mM titrated with NaOH 1 m ( pH = 8.5), and formic acid 100 mM (pH = 2.4), were tested. As target analytes, two colorants, namely, methyl red and ponceau 4R, were selected. These dyes are commonly used as printing inks component or pH indicator (methyl red) and food products colorant (ponceau 4R). Electroseparation experiments were conducted using commercially available, temperature non-controlled, open-air electrophoresis box equipped with homemade support for the positioning of active separation layers and electrodes connection strips. Thirteen types of separation layers (working zone = 20 x 100 mm; total length with connection strips = 20 cm) including cellulose-based polymers (filtrating paper, office paper, chromatography paper, and two Japanese papers for aircraft paper models), potato starch on cellulose support, common thin-layer chromatography-high-performance thin-layer chromatography (TLC-HPTLC) glass-based plates coated with cellulose, silica gel 60W (wettable with water), silica gel RP-18W, and aluminum oxide as well as glass-based nutrient agar layers (0.5 and 1.0 mm, approximately) were investigated. Moreover, detailed preparation procedure for manufacturing starch layer on cellulose and agar glass plate supports is described. Conducted investigations have revealed substantial differences between the electrophoretic migration of target dyes within cellulose type layers and also in comparison to the remaining stationary phases studied. The best separation under the given analytical conditions (voltage applied Delta V = 500 V and run time 20 min) was observed for cellulose pre-coated TLC plate (R-s = 2.89) and starch layer on filtrating paper support (R-s = 2.26). Baseline separation of investigated dyes was observed for filtrating paper strip and agar 0.5-mm thick layer (R-s = 1.07 and 1.08, respectively). There was no electrophoretic mobility shift of the tested dyes on polyamide and RP-18W coated TLC-HPTLC plates, while dye short migration without separation was observed on the remaining layers. The obtained results, especially the recorded values of physicochemical parameters (the observed electric currents, migration distances, and peak resolution for different electrolytes, layer type, and thickness) create initial data set platform that can help in the further design of simple separation devices involving natural polymeric layers. Particularly, the described analytical protocol may be implemented for microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) enabling fast and non-expensive separation of complex samples.

AB  - Changes in the life cycle of organisms (i.e. phenology) are one of the most widely used early-warning indicators of climate change, yet this remains poorly understood throughout the tropics. We exhaustively reviewed any published and unpublished study on fruiting phenology carried out at the community level in the American tropics and subtropics (latitudinal range: 26 degrees N-26 degrees S) to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of fruiting phenology research throughout the Neotropics; (2) unravel the climatic factors that have been widely reported as drivers of fruiting phenology; and (3) provide a preliminary assessment of the potential phenological responses of plants under future climatic scenarios. Despite the large number of phenological datasets uncovered (218), our review shows that their geographic distribution is very uneven and insufficient for the large surface of the Neotropics (similar to 1 dataset per similar to 78,000 km(2)). Phenological research is concentrated in few areas with many studies (state of Sfio Paulo, Brazil, and Costa Rica), whereas vast regions elsewhere are entirely unstudied. Sampling effort in fruiting phenology studies was generally low: the majority of datasets targeted fewer than 100 plant species (71%), lasted 2 years or less (72%), and only 10.4% monitored >15 individuals per species. We uncovered only 10 sites with ten or more years of phenological monitoring. The ratio of numbers of species sampled to overall estimates of plant species richness was wholly insufficient for highly diverse vegetation types such as tropical rainforest, seasonal forest and cerrado, and only slightly more robust for less diverse vegetation types, such as deserts, arid shrublands and open grassy savannas. Most plausible drivers of phenology extracted from these datasets were environmental (78.5%), whereas biotic drivers were rare (6%). Among climatic factors, rainfall was explicitly included in 73.4% of cases, followed by air temperature (19.3%). Other environmental cues such as water level (6%), solar radiation or photoperiod (3.2%), and ENSO events (1.4%) were rarely addressed. In addition, drivers were analyzed statistically in only 38% of datasets and techniques were basically correlative, with only 4.8% of studies including any consideration of the inherently autocorrelated character of phenological time series. Fruiting peaks were significantly more often reported during the rainy season both in rainforests and cerrado woodlands, which is at odds with the relatively aseasonal character of the former vegetation type. Given that climatic models predict harsh future conditions for the tropics, we urgently need' to determine the magnitude of changes in plant reproductive phenology and distinguish those from cyclical oscillations. Longterm monitoring and herbarium data are therefore key for detecting these trends. Our review shows that the unevenness in geographic distribution of studies, and diversity of sampling methods, vegetation types, and research motivation hinder the emergence of clear general phenological patterns and drivers for the Neotropics. We therefore call for prioritizing research in unexplored areas, and improving the quantitative component and statistical design of reproductive phenology studies to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts on tropical plants and animals.

AB  - Grain size, carbonate and XRD-mineral data of surficial shelf sediments from 113 stations in the Aegean-Marmara-transition revealed the presence of three distinctive sectors which were controlled by the changing morphologic, hydrodynamic, benthic and terrigenous conditions that lasted during the late Quaternary.
   The northeastern Aegean Sea forms the western sector of the study area. This region shows several bank-and ridge-like bottom features at 60-70 m water depths which are widely capped with sand and gravel (up to 93%) of both biogenic (> 30% CaCO3) and terrigenous (< 30% CaCO3) origin. The low abundances of fine-grained materials (1-24% mud) in this biogenic belt are probably in response to higher current velocities in the sea and to low fluvial discharges from the adjacent land masses. Biogenic materials consist of a large variety of calcareous remains of benthic organisms, which are partly cemented by carbonate. It is hypothesized that this biogenic belt, at least in part, is a relict feature.
   Canakkale Strait is the central sector of the study area and its bottom is covered largely by terrigenous sand and gravel (< 30% CaCO3). The coarse-grained nature of the sea floor of Canakkale Strait can be explained by the prevailing high current velocities. Western Marmara Sea is the eastern sector of the study area where the local major rivers supply a great part of the terrigenous materials and the prevailing low current velocities favour fine grained materials' deposition here (< 30% CaCO3; up to 99% mud). Calcite (mainly Mg-calcite; 5-92%), quartz (3-72%), feldspars (mainly plagioclase; 7-56%) and micas are the major bulk minerals in the sediments. Except for Mg-calcite which is mainly derived from calcareous biogenic components, bulk minerals reflect a terrigenous source from the adjacent land masses. In particular, the overall lower qtz/fsp ratios in the study area (0.4-1.2) showed significant increases (i.e. enrichment of quartz relative to feldspars; qtz/fsp: 1.2-2.4) in the inner biogenic belt of the northern Aegean Sea where older or relic (early Holocene) sediments are suspected to occur. If so, these values can be used as an indicator for long duration of lowstands of sea level and associated intense current and wave activities. 17 Angstrom -expandable smectite (23-84%), illite (12-43%) and kaolinite (6-38%) determined in the less than 2 mum of the sediment are the major clay minerals. Higher abundances of smectite relative to illite and kaolinite found in sediments particularly off the mouths of rivers, Karamenderes, Gonen and Biga and off the Gokceada and Bozcaada Islands reflect mainly local sources for the clay minerals studied. The higher smectite/illite ratios of abundances are largely attributed to the weathered Volcanic rocks which are widely distributed on the surrounding land masses. However, the prevailing current and wind patterns seem to be important factors controlling clay mineral distribution in marine sediments of this study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Currently, health, wellness and aesthetics are relevant for consumers and are immersed in advertising through social networks. With regard to food and especially the consumption of functional milk drinks, advertising has specialized in transmitting a series of messages providing nutritional benefits of these products to improve the quality of physical and mental life in consumers, mainly acting as an adjuvant in digestive, immune, and cardiovascular systems. In correspondence with the above, the advertising of the registered trademarks of these beverages, supported by social networks such as Facebook and Instagram, is immersed in a set of dualities associated with self-gratification and pleasure for the functional food consumed; and, on the other hand, in the formation of premises and subjective beliefs, associated with feelings of guilt and displacement against the excessive consumption of calories and fats that are normally stipulated by medical societies and the same market, to encourage the consumption of these drinks. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between the advertisements seen through social networks, the emotional response and the intention of purchase of functional milk drinks in university students between the ages of 18 and 35 in the city of Bogota, Colombia. The methodology was quantitative, through a quasi-experimental design of a control group, with young students participating from a private university in Bogota, with pre and post-test measurement, based on the application of an attitude scale, who asked about beliefs and attitudes oriented to the properties of functional milk drinks, knowledge and associated buying and consumption behaviors. Electromyography records were taken, with the support of the biofeedback software, to verify the variations in the emotional response, taking as an independent variable the ads seen in the social networks of Instagram and Facebook. The analysis of the results was carried out through the Functional Data Analysis for the understanding of the behavior of the electromyographic signals and the registered emotional variations, and the Confirmatory Factor Analysis, to establish the relationships between the purchase intention and the announcements in the networks social, with support of statistical software R 3.5.3. The results confirm the influence that the ads seen on social networks have on the variations in the emotional response of the consumer of functional milk drinks. These results are consistent with the technical and empirical postulates that pose the role of facial expression of emotions as an indicator of adaptation to environmental conditions and the demands of the digital medium. With reference to the content of the public announcement as a determining factor in the intention to buy functional milk drinks, two types of consumers were identified, those who base their consumption decisions based on medical and scientific premises, and consumers influenced by social networks. The arguments are based on the intuitive, the power exerted by the groups of followers, the number of likes and the influence of technology. From this point of view, the planned action of the behaviors involved in the purchase intention is influenced by social networks and the information exposed through them, configuring normative beliefs and motivational aspects with a representative nutritional hedonic value.

AB  - Thousands of ancient terraces in the valleys of the Negev desert show that agriculture was conducted here in the past, based on the utilization of runoff and floodwater from local rainfall. A comprehensive collation and mapping is presented of the geographic distribution of such farming remains in the northern, central and southern Negev. The time range of these remains is also evaluated in detail with the inclusion of new data from the Neolithic to the present. Farming was and is conducted on a seasonal or annual timescale. However, proxy palaeoclimatic indicators in the southern Levant do not have such resolution. How do the ancient agricultural remains relate to climate? How do we define climate in order to make comparisons through time? How dry is dry? The conventional Koppen and Thornthwaite climatic classifications are cumbersome in both spatial and time-series analysis. This article presents for the first time the spatial positions of the climate zones in southern Israel based on the innovative P/PET climatic classification approach (P = annual precipitation; PET = annual potential evapotranspiration). Instrumental data from 13 meteorological stations were used for the required calculations and mapping. The decade 1990-2000 was selected, because of extreme climatic variations in this period, including the cold and wettest year ever recorded, 1991-92, as well as the warm and severe drought year 1998-99. Main conclusions are as follows: 1. The majority of remains of ancient runoff/floodwater farming are located south of Beer Sheva in the arid zone. 2. Only a few sites are situated in the hyper-arid zone in the southern Negev. 3. The southern and eastern borders of the ancient agricultural region in the central Negev coincide with the average decadal climatic boundary between the arid and hyper-arid zone (P/PET = 0.05). 4. The extremely wet year 1991-92 did not cause a significant displacement southward in the position of the arid and hyper-arid zones. Most runoff-farming areas remained within the arid zone. However, north of Beer Sheva the climatic zones shifted dramatically, as the humid zone, usually not extant in the southern Levant, and the sub-humid zone, moved into southern Israel. 5. The severe drought year 1998-99, on the other hand, caused a dramatic displacement northward of all climate zones. The boundary between the arid zone and hyper-arid zone (P/PET = 0.05) moved north of Beer Sheva and west of Arad. Most runoff/floodwater farming areas were situated in the hyper-arid zone. 6. An area with terraced valleys beyond the Negev in the southern foothills near Hebron experienced an arid climate in 1998/99, instead of average semi-arid conditions. This underlines the rational of runoff capture for drought mitigation in the semi-arid zone. 7. The investigation sets a modern standard of defined climate zones in the Negev and their shifts in wet and drought years as a basis for comparison with past climatic changes in relation to ancient agricultural remains.

AB  - The Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Chia Gara Formation, a proven marine source rock characterised by predominance of amorphous organic matter (AOM) is known from few outcrops in NE Iraq and a number of exploration wells in the Zagros Fold Belt. This study presents comprehensive organic petrographic and mineralogical investigations of the dispersed organic matter and rock-forming minerals of the Tithonian-Berriasian Chia Gara Formation intersected by the Kirkuk well K-109 drilled in the giant Kirkuk oil field, NE Iraq. The organic petrographic analyses, including incident light microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) were applied to carbonate source rocks with low to moderate organic carbon contents. Our data demonstrate the predominance of bituminite and solid bitumen among the examined dispersed organic matter followed by oil exudates and oil globule inclusions as well as the presence of minor contributions of alginite (i.e., Tasmanites and Leiospheridia), liptodetrinite and vitrinite. Based on optical characteristics and CLSM spectral fluorescence measurements, examinations of bituminite point towards the presence of bituminite type III. The bituminite type III encloses dark orange fluorescent amorphous components suggesting a genetic relationship either with liptodetrinite and/or with solid bitumen. The qualitative assessment of solid bitumen reveals several dissimilar forms identified in the analysed samples. The photometric and spectral fluorescence measurements point to distinct reflectance values ranging between 0.19% and 0.43% SBRr and lambda max values extending from 515 nm to 590 nm, respectively. The corresponding results of the solid bitumen exhibit (1) a lack of a relationship with depth and, (2) suggest its poor property as a reliable maturity indicator for the examined samples. The presence of oil exudates, oil globule inclusions and their association with solid bitumen suggests a genetic relation with the examined residues of liquid hydrocarbon phase. The performed thermal maturities assessments of dispersed organic matter point towards early-mature to peak-mature oil window with vitrinite reflectance values ranging between 0.52% VRr at 2801 m to 0.83% VRr at 3089 m depth. Mineralogical analyses revealed the predominance of calcite over dolomite in the examined limestone to marl lithofacies (e.g., clear rimmed dolomite) with localised intensive dolomitisation. In the phyllosilicate-rich matrix, predominance of calcite and siderite is observed, followed by zinc blende and pyrite. The composition of organic matter in the examined Chia Gara Formation with predominance of bituminite and solid bitumen makes the major marine source rock of Iraq's Cretaceous petroleum systems distinctive in terms of hydrocarbon generation and migration at an oil window stage as it provides suitable explanations for its generally low hydrogen index (HI) with only minor terrestrial input. In addition, the results presented herein can be helpful for future evaluation of thermal maturities and characterisation of optical appearances of dispersed organic matter in carbonates by incident light microscopy and especially by CLSM during hydrocarbon prospecting.

AB  - We conducted a 3-year study (May 2003-Apr 2006) of mortality of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) calves to determine the cause for the recruitment decline (i.e., 33 calves to 13 calves/100 adult F) following the restoration of wolves (Canis lnpus). We captured, fit with radiotransmitters, and evaluated blood characteristics and disease antibody seroprevalence in 151 calves <= 6 days old (68M:83F). Concentrations (x, SE) of potential condition indicators were as follows: thyroxine (T4; 13.8 mu g/dL, 0.43), serum urea nitrogen (SUN; 17.4 mg/dL, 0.57), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; 66.4 IU/L, 4.36), gamma globulins (GG; 1.5 g/dL, 0.07), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; 253.6 ng/mL, 9.59). Seroprevalences were as follows: brucellosis (Brucella abortus, 3%), bovine-respiratory syncytial virus (3%), bovine-viral-diarrhea virus type 1 (25%), infectious-bovine rhinotracheitis (58%), and bovine parainfluenza-3 (32%). Serum urea nitrogen, GGT, GG, and IGF-1 varied with year; T4, SUN, and GG varied with age (P <= 0.01); and SUN varied by capture area (P = 0.02). Annual survival was 0.22 (SE=0.035, n = 149) and varied by calving area but not year. Neonates captured in the Stephens Creek/Mammoth area of Yellowstone National Park, USA, had annual survival rates >3X higher (0.54) than those captured in the Lamar Valley area (0.17), likely due to the higher predator density in Lamar Valley. Summer survival (20 weeks after radiotagging) was 0.29 (SE = 0.05, n = 116), and calving area, absolute deviation from median birth date, and GG were important predictors of summer survival. Survival during winter (Nov-Apr) was 0.90 (SE = 0.05, n = 42), and it did not vary by calving area or year. Sixty-nine percent (n = 104) of calves died within the first year of life, 24% (n = 36) survived their first year, and 7% (n = 11) had unknown fates. Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus) accounted for 58-60% (n = 60-62) of deaths, and wolves accounted for 14-17% (n = 15-18). Summer predation (95% of summer deaths) increased, and winter malnutrition (0% of winter deaths) decreased, compared with a similar study during 1987-1990 (72% and 58%, respectively). Physiological factors (e.g., lowlevels of GG) may predispose calves to predation. Also, the increase in bear numbers since wolf restoration and spatial components finer than the northern range should be considered when trying to determine the causes of the northern Yellowstone elk decline. This is the first study to document the predation impacts from reintroduced wolves on elk calf mortality in an ecosystem already containing established populations of 4 other major predators (i.e., grizzly and black bears, cougars [Puma concolor], and coyotes [Canis latrans]). The results are relevant to resource managers of the Yellowstone ecosystem in understanding the dynamics of the elk population, in providing harvest quota recommendations for local elk hunts to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service regarding wolf and grizzly bear recovery, and to all areas worldwide where predators are increasing, by providing managers with information about potential carnivore impacts on elk populations.

AB  - Accounting provides data on the company's performance, finance flows, and this information is used to evaluate the company's performance, to make management decisions and future plans; therefore, accounting can very well be called universal or international business language. The success of any major international company, individual trader, or public organization depends on the knowledge of accounting conceptions and practice. Sceptics can maintain that accounting is strongly regulated by the legal basis, business accounting standards, so, the competence of the accountants depends on their knowledge and practical skills. Accounting requires constant research, the results of which facilitate forming the legal basis of accounting and accounting policy not only at the level of the enterprise, but, also at the state level, correcting and developing accounting standards, forming accounting systems for companies' management as well as study of their practical implementation. The problems of accounting lead to the necessity of research, and the latter requires practical results. All this helps to raise the qualitative level of accounting teaching and provide knowledge to future specialists. As economy is in the process of development and changes, modern knowledge society is formed, which changes the qualitative and quantitative requirements raised for specialists of accounting.
   In training specialists many different problems arise. What subjects have to be offered to prepare skilled specialists? How are skills developed? Which areas are the most popular among accountants, and in which areas would they like to improve?
   In reviewing study modules taught at the universities, it can be said that until the year 1998, only individual study modules in accounting were delivered, and only at the Faculty. Starting with the year 1998, accounting modules were delivered as subjects of general education throughout the University. In order to train high-skilled specialists in accounting, an appropriate educational basis is necessary. It includes rooms for teaching, teaching facilities, text books, computer programs, lecturers' skills and knowledge. The Department of Accounting carries out research, provides consultations to organizations and businessmen in implementing the results of research. This number is an indication of the skills of the lecturers. On performing analysis of legal environment of accounting and researches, the Department trained and published 32 educational books designed for accounting modules.
   To evaluate the training process of accounting specialists, evaluation models were applied, by means of methods of strategic planning, perspectives studies, education criteria of Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award and balanced indexes, the index system was worked out enabling coordination of indexes of studies, research and applied activity.
   There is no doubt that benefit of the assessment system under the current economic conditions is undeniable; scientific literature highlights different scientific and practical research results related to assessment. This is very important as diversified activities are developed in all areas with the aim to occupy leading positions. The implementation of the assessment model is going to require a lot of expenditure, nevertheless, it will be beneficial not only for the university, but also, for the study process. With regard to new theories, accounting management methods, business practice and regulation of legal environment, the training of specialists will be more consistent.

AB  - By influencing interannual rainfall variability in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also impact on corn and soybean yields at the main rain-fed agricultural production departments. Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production departments of Cordoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Rio Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Cordoba as a vegetation proxy to depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops productivity.
   Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p < 0.05) in all Cordoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS. Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case, the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small.
   The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May, at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11% and 10% of Rio Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19% when SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors. Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.

AB  - There is great scope in converting rice (Oryza sativa L.) fallows into productive agro- ecosystems through appropriate crop based interventions involving suitable varieties and appropriate resource conservation technologies (RCTs). Pulses such as chickpea, lentil, lathyrus and blackgram - through rotation or relay with rice - are the candidate crops for efficient utilization of conserved and scarce resources including soil moisture. Therefore, studying bio-physical aspects of popular rice - chickpea rotation so as to conserve resources and deriving maximum benefits is important and is the crux of the current investigation. A study was carried out in a vertisols at Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Raipur (India) during 2011-14 under the existing conditions guarded by a tropical sub-humid climate receiving an annual precipitation of 1582 mm. Two transplanted rice habit groups (a tall local rice Masuri, maturing at 130-140 days and a dwarf HYV of rice Swarna, with 110-120 days duration grown during rainy season) were combined with three residue management practices, viz. residue removal, stubble (30 cm) and mulch for growing two contrasting varieties of chickpea (early high biomass JG 130 and medium high biomass JG 226) grown during winter season. Chickpea was planted with a zero till drill after rice. The study showed that soil moisture depletion (SMD) pattern was decreased over the crop season in case of mulched or 30 cm stubble retained plots in comparison to absence of mulch due to its possible role as a soil cover. On the contrary, SMD was higher in case of tall rice (Masuri) habit due to its relatively longer duration as compared to dwarf rice (Swarna) habit. Similar although to a lower degree in SMD was apparent in case of early biomass accumulating variety (BAV) chickpea JG 130 over medium BAV JG 226. Soil health parameters in terms of its physical and microbiological parameters (like, bulk density, soil strength, dehydrogenase activity etc), crop physiological parameters (such as relative leaf water content (LWC) and specific leaf weight (SLW), plant population), nodulation activities (Rhizobium population, nodule number and its dry weights) and crop growth/yield parameters (pods/plant, root characteristics etc) were positively influenced by mulch or stubble retention (due to its beneficial role as a soil cover) and dwarf rice habit (Swarna). Small yet consistently superior values of soil fertility indicators, viz. soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrients (NPKZn, Fe, Mn and Cu) availability status were also evident following mulch or retention of stubble on the soil surface, whereas the values were abysmally small when comparison was made between chickpea cultivars (early BAV JG 130 and medium BAV JG 226). Besides these, weed dynamics, grain yield attributes and the resultant grain yield were especially favoured following soil moisture conservation strategies involving dwarf rice habit and mulch/stubble retention since availability of soil moisture was fairly extended over a period of time following these measures. Thus, it is inferred from the study on rice-chickpea system that efficient agronomic management of soil and land resources is crucial for augmenting soil health and enhancing output in prevalent rice fallow of Eastern Indian Plateau.

AB  - Eco-engineering aims at stabilising soil and slopes by applying technical and biological measures. Engineering structures are commonly well defined, immediately usable and operative, and their stability effects quantifiable. Differently, the use of plants requires more restrictive boundary conditions and the protection potential is rarely easily calculable and is developing as a function of growth time. Soil aggregation processes play a crucial role in re-establishing soil structure and function and, conclusively, for successful and sustainable re-colonisation. Mycorrhizal fungi are key-players that foster the development of a protective vegetation cover. They accelerate and increase plant growth and, additionally, contribute to soil aggregate stability which, on its part, was recently proposed as an appropriate indicator with regard to the quantification of biological effects on soil and slope stability.
   The objective of this study was to determine the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the host's root system as well as on soil aggregate stability. Furthermore, the biological contribution to soil aggregate stability was compared to mechanical stabilisation effects due to soil compaction. The site-specific plant-fungus symbiosis Alnus incana and Melanogaster variegatus s.l. of a recently stabilised steep catchment on moraine was used for laboratory experiments.
   Aggregate stability tests were performed with samples of differently treated moraine, including soil at low (similar to 15.5 kN m(-3)) and high (similar to 19.0 kN m(-3)) dry unit weight, soil planted with A. incana (White Alder) as well as the combination of planting with alder and inoculating with the mycorrhizal fungus M. variegatus s.l. After a 20 week growth period in a greenhouse, a total of 100 samples was tested and evaluated. Positive correlations were found between the soil aggregate stability and the three variables dry unit weight, root length per soil volume, and degree of mycorrhization. Based on robust statistics it turned out that over all samples dry unit weight and degree of mycorrhization were strongest correlated with soil aggregate stability. Simple linear regression models revealed a significant positive effect of root length per soil volume on soil aggregate stability. Compared to the non-inoculated control plants, mycorrhized White Alder produced significantly more roots and, consequently, higher soil aggregate stability. Furthermore, the combined biological effect of plant roots and mycorrhizal mycelia on aggregate stability in soil with low density (similar to 15.5 kN m(-3)) was comparable to the compaction effect of the pure soil from 15.5 to similar to 19.0 kN m(-3).
   Literature data on the effect of vegetation on the angle of internal friction Phi' of the same moraine showed similar correlations, i.e. that Phi'of low density soil material (similar to 15.5 kN m(-3)) increased by the same amount whether by planting with White Alder or by compaction to similar to 19.0 kN m(-3). Based on this coincidence and from a soil mechanical perspective, soil aggregate stability is suitable to estimate the joint effect of plants and mycorrhizal fungi with respect to their contribution to soil and slope stability in the near-surface layer.

AB  - Background The conditions of diminished ovarian reserve and primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by poor fertility outcomes, currently comprise a major challenge in reproductive medicine, particularlyin vitrofertilization. Currently in the IVF industry, blastocyst developmental success rate per treatment is routinely overlooked when a live birth results from treatment. Limited data are available on this significant and actionable variable of blastocyst development optimization, which contributes to improvement of treatment success Women with elevated basal FSH concentration are reported to still achieve reasonable pregnancy rates, although only a few studies report correlations with blastocysts development. Diagnostic values of AMH/basal FSH concentrations can be useful for determining the optimal stimulation protocol as well as identification of individuals who will not benefit from IVF due to poor prognosis. The objective of this study is to identify actionable clinical and culture characteristics of IVF treatment that influence blastocyst developmental rate, with the goal of acquiring optimal success. Methods and findings A retrospective observational study was performed, based on 106 women undergoing IVF, regardless of prognosis, over a six-month period from January 1, 2015 to June 31, 2015. Rate of high-quality blastocyst production, which can be used for embryo transfer or vitrification, per normally fertilized oocyte, was evaluated. Treatment was determined successful when outcome was >= 40% high-quality blastocysts. The data were initially evaluated with theEvtreealgorithm, a statistical computational analysis which is inspired by natural Darwinian evolution incorporating concepts such as mutation and natural selection (see Supplementary Material). The analysis processes all variables simultaneously against the outcome, aiming to maximize discrimination of each variable to then create a "branch" of the tree which can be used as a decision in treatment. The final model results in only those variables which are significant to outcomes. Generalized linear model (GLM) employing logistic regression and survival analysis with R software was used and the final fitting of the model was determined through the use of random forest and evolutionary tree algorithms. Individuals presenting with an [AMH] of >3.15 ng/ml and a good prognosis had a lower success per treatment (n = 11, 0% success) when total gonadotropin doses were greater than 3325 IU. Individuals that presented with an [AMH] of <1.78 ng/ml and a poor prognosis exhibited a greater success per treatment (n = 11, 80% success). AMH emerged as a superior indicator of blastocyst development compared to basal FSH. The accuracy of the prediction model, our statistical analysis using decision tree, evtree methodology is 86.5% in correctly predicting outcome based on the significant variables. The likelihood that the outcome with be incorrect of the model, or the error rate is 13.5%. Conclusions [AMH] is a superior indicator of ovarian stimulation response and an actionable variable for stimulation dose management for optimizing blastocyst development in culture. Women whose [AMH] is >= 3.2 mg/ml, having a good prognosis, and developing >12 mature follicles result in <40% blastocysts when gonadotropin doses exceed 3325 IU per treatment.
   IVF treatments for poor responders that present with infertility due to diminished ovarian reserve, if managed appropriately, can produce more usable blastocyst per IVF treatment, thus increasing rate of blastocyst developmental success and ultimately increasing live birth rates. Future studies are needed to investigate the intra-follicular and the intra-cellular mechanisms that lead to the inverse relationship of blastocysts development and total gonadotropin doses in good responders in contrast to poor responders.

AB  - Boron and lithium contents and isotopic compositions were determined in nucleating and growing nanometersized illite crystals (< 0.02 to 0.2 mu m) separated from mixed-layered illite-smectite particles of bentonite beds from East Slovak Basin. Substituted into tetrahedral and octahedral sites of illite, respectively, they were used to deduce fluid sources and chemical changes during nucleation and crystal growth. The positively correlated contents in most size separates suggest that the substitution of both B and Li is probably coincident and that illitization progressed via direct precipitation from pore fluids and not by solid-state substitution. As B and Li are released from their sources into the pore fluids, their trends are recorded in the isotopic compositions of the authigenic illite crystals. The overall concept is that the B and Li contents of nanometer-sized illite crystal record the abundance variations of the interacting fluids, while the isotopic ratios inform about the temperature and fluid isotopic compositions. Preliminary solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance( NMR) spectroscopic determinations of B in various size fractions of three bentonite beds demonstrate an excellent potential to distinguish its crystallographic location in nucleating illite relative to the initial smectite crystals, followed by growth of illite crystals and probable dissolution of smectite.
   Generally, bentonite beds collected near salt-bearing sediments contain illite crystals with high B contents (475 mu g/g) and heavy delta B-11 (+ 7%). This combination suggests precipitation of the coarse illite crystals older than 10 Ma from saline brines. The younger illite populations yield lower B contents (30-100 mu g/g) and lighter delta B-11 that decreased from - 5 to - 17% while B contents increased. The initial saline fluids were apparently not enriched in Li, as the older, coarse illite fractions yield low Li contents(< 20 mu g/g) and high delta Li-7 (+ 7%), reflecting in turn a water delta Li-7 composition of + 18 to + 26% similar to evaporite-type oilfield waters. Younger illite crystals contain increasing Li contents (up to 140 mu g/g) with decreasing d7Li (from - 7 to - 22%).
   Illite younger than 6 million years contains increasing B-10 and Li-6 during crystal growth. This correlation parallels an increase in the delta B-11 and delta Li-7 of kerogen from nearby host shales due to temperature increase, suggesting in turn a release of isotopically light B and Li from kerogen into the interacting pore fluids as hydrocarbons were released. It also suggests that hydrocarbons were generated during the recent 6 million years in the East Slovak Basin, while saline brines influenced illite crystallization before 10 Ma ago.
   A complementary conclusive aspect of this review is that the smaller the size of the illite crystals and the larger the analyzed field area, the more difficult it becomes to fit the illitization process into a uniform model. The mineral crystallo-chemical variations adapt to changing local conditions during burial and, therefore, reequilibration of entire crystal populations becomes increasingly difficult to interpret. It is likely that direct analyses at the nano-scale will improve interpretations of variable isotopic tracers, and it is clear that B and Li in illite can be robust indicators of environmental changes over time.

AB  - Background: Facilitation is an ecological process that has previously been discussed largely in relation to the modification of abiotic conditions in extreme habitats. Here, we introduce the concept of reflected radiation as a potential facilitation mechanism that may raise the beneficiary's resource level in light-limited habitats.
   Objectives: We examined whether plants may be able to use their spatial architecture to increase their light absorption through the use of radiation reflected by their neighbours. We tested if this interaction resulted in increased biomass or leaf area between the respective pairs of species.
   Methods: We determined the biomass and leaf area of eight common herb-layer species, composed of four grass and four herb species, in a beech forest. Plant three-dimensional architecture was digitised and used to simulate reflected and absorbed radiation between the species in a virtual black box. To accomplish this, a so-called light donor plant (which reflected light from its leaf surfaces) was surrounded by four receptor plants (which absorbed this reflected radiation) at a distance of 10 cm. This was repeated using every combination of the available species. We established a ray-trace simulation, including measured light reflection and transmission rates of leaves that enabled us to quantify the relative light absorption by receptor plants, expressed as brightness per leaf area, and estimated the amount of incoming photons. Furthermore, we calculated Seifan's importance index as an indicator for the relevance of the postulated facilitation effect on plant biomass and leaf area.
   Results: The leaves of the species studied reflected ca. 7% of radiation between 400 and 700 nm and 18% between 540 to 650 nm of daily incident photon flux density, corresponding to the accessory pigments' range of efficacy. An average of 0.19% of radiation reflected by a donor plant reached a receptor plant. The benefits to receptor plants varied significantly with donor identity. Conspecific donors supplied significantly larger benefits for Stellaria, Galium, Brachypodium and Hordelymus, which are rhizomatous plants with short stolons. Clones of these species may be able to increase their daily light intake through absorption of reflected light by 0.2%, 0.5-5.0%, 5.0% and 0.6-11.6%, respectively, depending on the number of donor ramets and on the distance between the donor and receptor ramets. Nonetheless, the estimated conspecific facilitation effects through light reflectance within a single clone did not translate into increased biomass.
   Conclusion: As light intensity decreases with distance according to Lambert's law, a significant increase of light intake through neighbours can only be predicted for plants with a high density of donor ramets, such as clonal species having many ramets within a short distance. We suggest that in strongly light-limited habitats there may be an advantage to a clonal growth strategy due to the observed facilitation effect of absorption of reflected radiation. To evaluate the magnitude of this effect, future studies should concentrate on 'payback times' of leaves with low light intake to gauge the period of time necessary for one leaf to offset the necessary investment in photosynthetic light capture, calculated as cost-benefit calculation between the cost of the leaf's production and the net carbon gain realised by it.

AB  - We present an integrated record of environmental change from Lake Omapere, Northland, New Zealand, based on palaeolimnological analysis of a 7-m-long core and eight adjunct cores spanning part of the last 80 calendar (cal.) ka. The chronology was developed using tephrochronology, palaeomagnetism and radiocarbon dating together with climato- and palyno-stratigraphy. Two of 14 tephra layers in the cores provide markers for correlating the record with other New Zealand climato-stratigraphic sequences, deep-sea cores and the global marine isotope record. Pollen, diatom, palaeomagnetic, sedimentologic and pigment analyses show that Lake Omapere, currently similar to 2 m deep, has had a discontinuous history. Occupying a shallow basin perched partly within old basalt lavas, the initial (alkaline) lake formed towards the end of MIS 5a at ca. 80 cal. ka, presumably because of blockage of local drainage of a swampy alluvial floodplain, inundating peat deposits and forest trees, including kauri (Agathis australis). The lake filled rapidly to a level similar to 1-2 m above that at present. Such filling was probably unrelated to climate but a subsequent phase of variable but generally failing lake levels and increasing dystrophy may have been climatically controlled, commencing during MIS 4 and culminating in periods early in MIS 3 when the lake became swampy or dry. Conditions of non-deposition (or non-preservation) obtained for most of the period after ca. 55 cal. ka (Rotoehu Ash) until formation of the modem lake approximately 600-700 cal. years ago or soon after, as indicated by the presence of Tephra-1, identified in part as Kaharoa Tephra (AD 1314), near the top of the core. The modem lake originated possibly through damming of the western outlet as a consequence of accelerated erosion accompanying earliest Polynesian deforestation, an interpretation supported by Maori oral tradition.
   The pollen record indicates that beech Nothofagus (presumably N. truncata) was much more common in Northland during the Last Glacial, and that for this region the relative abundance of Nothofagus vs. Agathis pollen serves as a better indicator of cooler versus warmer intervals during the Quaternary than the ratio of tree to non-tree pollen. However, it seems likely that moisture balance was a more critical factor than temperature in vegetation composition and distribution, particularly during the LGM, and the long periods of hiatus may also be linked to a drier climate than present. Correlation coefficients between the pollen curves confirm that several tree species (Halocarpus bidwillii, H. biformis and Phyllocladus alpinus), previously palynologically concealed within generic taxonomic groups, occurred about two degrees latitude further north and at a much lower altitude than their current limits during cooler or drier phases of the Last Glacial. A temperature depression in Northland of 4 degreesC at various times during the Last Glacial is inferred from these range expansions. Nevertheless, the persistence of widespread forest cover suggests that the late Pleistocene climate of Northland was less severe than for most of the rest of New Zealand and strengthens the argument for a heightened temperature gradient across northern New Zealand during the Last Glacial.

AB  - This work was originated from the concern for the availability of a short, acceptable and reliable instrument for self-assessment of perceived stress. The questionnaire was designed to be routinely applied within a visit at an Occupational Medical Center. A new questionnaire was developed with this aim, consisting of 9 subscales presented in a Lickert form, with 4 modes of answer, scored from 0 to 3. The content of the 9 items covers the multiple facets of perceived stress and its consequences : << feeling of beingunder pressure >>, << impatience >>, << irritability >>, << intrusive thoughts about work >>, << inability to entertain >>, << discouragement >>, << morning fatigue >>, << food compensation >>, << compensation by smoking >>. Stress global score is defined as the sum of the 9 elementary scores. The first 7 items are similar in their construct to the 7 factor solutions of the principal component factor analysis performed on Levenstein Perceived Stress Questionnaire (1993). On the other hand, in comparison with Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (1983), our instrument keeps an important place for affective, physiologic and behavioral impact of stressing situations. A study on the homogeneity of the scale, its factorial structure, and its time reproducibility after 6 weeks of interval, was carried out on a first population of 91 subjects seen during an occupational medical visit in several companies of Paris district (PCV-Metra group). The coefficient of infernal consistency is very high (Cronbach's alpha = 0,82). Principal component analysis extracted two factors, which were unchanged after a Varimax rotation and respectively represented 42% and 13% of the total variance. they can be interpretate as a general perceived stress component (being overwhelmed loss of control) and a behavioral bipolar component opposing food compensation to smoking, whilst facing stressing situations. Test-retest correlation coefficient is 0.88 (Pearson r as well as intraclass correlation coefficient), without any significant gap between the first and the second assessment. A second study was carried out on 761 working individuals seen in the same conditions during an occupational medical visit in the same companies (596 males and 65 females, aged 40.1 +/- 8.8 years). Socio-demographic data analysis showed higher stress scores in females (10.2 +/- 4.0), than in males (8. 5 +/- 3.7) (p < 0.0001). Detailed analysis showed differences related to gender in the same direction for the items << irritability >>, << discouragement >>, << morning fatigue >> and << food compensation >>. Highest stress scores, for both males and females, were found for the items << intrusive thoughts about work >> and << morning fatigue >>. Stress global score was correlated with socioprofessional status (SPS) : unskilled and skilled workers (n = 39) as well as technicians (n = 346) exhibited lower scores than clerical workers (n = 108) or engeneers (n = 162) (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). The comparison between mean scores performed separately by gender, given the different sex-ratio according to SPS (employees were mostly females) confirmed the association between stress score and SPS only in males, with blue collars and technicians looking less under stress than engeneers. Metrological properties of this Perceived Stress Questionnaire incite to perform studies focused on the associations between such a stress index measured in an occupational setting, and several other clinical or biological variables, especially those supposed to constitute classical cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - A relatively broad consensus has formed that the purpose of developing and using the social life cycle assessment (SLCA) is to improve the social conditions for the stakeholders affected by the assessed product's life cycle. To create this effect, the SLCA, among other things, needs to provide valid assessments of the consequence of the decision that it is to support. The consequence of a decision to implement a life cycle of a product can be seen as the difference between the decision being implemented and 'non-implemented' product life cycle. This difference can to some extent be found using the consequential environmental life cycle assessment (ELCA) methodology to identify the processes that change as a consequence of the decision. However, if social impacts are understood as certain changes in the lives of the stakeholders, then social impacts are not only related to product life cycles, meaning that by only assessing impacts related to the processes that change as a consequence of a decision, not all changes in the life situations of the stakeholders will be captured by an assessment following the consequential ELCA methodology. This article seeks to identify these impacts relating to the non-implemented product life cycle and establish indicators for their assessment.
   A conceptual overview of the non-implemented life cycle situation is established, and the impacts which may be expected from this situation are identified, based on theories and empirical findings from relevant fields of research. Where possible, indicators are proposed for the measurement of the identified impacts.
   In relation to the workers in the life cycle, the non-implemented life cycle situation may lead to increased levels of unemployment. Unemployment has important social impacts on the workers; however, depending on the context, these impacts may vary significantly. The context can to some extent be identified and based on this, indicators are proposed to assess the impacts of unemployment. In relation to the product user, it was not possible to identify impacts of the non-implemented life cycle on a generic basis.
   The assessment of the non-implemented life cycle situation increases the validity of the SLCA but at the same time adds a considerable extra task when performing an SLCA. It is therefore discussed to what extent its assessment could be avoided. It is argued that this depends on whether the assessment will still meet the minimum criterion for validity of the assessment, that the assessment should be better than random in indicating the decision alternative with the most favourable social impacts.
   Based on this, it is concluded that the assessment of the non-implemented life cycle cannot be avoided since an assessment not taking into account the impacts of the non-implemented life cycle will not fulfil this minimum criterion.
   To mitigate the task of assessing the impacts of the non-implemented life cycle, new research areas are suggested, relating to simpler ways of performing the assessment as well as to investigations of whether the effect of SLCA can be created through other and potentially simpler assessments than providing an assessment of the consequences of a decision as addressed here.

AB  - The article deals with questions of distribution of expenses of agricultural producers of goods for the purposes of management accounting and control. Methodology. In the course of the research, the arguments in support of the proof of the managerial nature of accounting of expenses and calculation of the prime cost of agricultural products are advanced. It causes the shift of emphases of management accounting to this section as to one of the key instruments of management of expenses of the agricultural enterprises. Results. Expense management on the basis of accounting tools is the main leverage over the administrative strategy of agrarian producers in the conditions of strengthening of the volatility of the market, aggravation of the competition, and the growing influence of the world prices for products of agricultural production on pricing at the subjects of the agrarian market. At the same time, cost accounting and calculation of product costs make a separate subsystem of management accounting, based on a combination of various elements of a method of accounting. This subsystem consists of its internal divisions and parts, and a segment of cost distribution for the maintenance of machines and equipment of agricultural enterprises is investigated in the article. In particular, the article demonstrates the statement about the discrepancy of the actual state of distribution of these expenses to the order provided by Ukrainian normative and methodical documents in the field of accounting, and the key reasons of this negative phenomenon are being established.The first of such reasons is insignificance of sanctions for violation of accounting legislation, which exists in Ukraine, and the international accounting rules, which according to the established statutory requirements or their own initiative are used by agricultural producers. The second reason lies in an optional character of methodical approaches, developed at the level of the relevant ministries and departments, to the accounting of expenses for cars and the equipment, at the low initiative of accountants with the PostSoviet style of thinking that is fatal to the idea of the reliable distribution of these expenses. Practical implications. To resolve the problem of reliability of information about costs of machines and the equipment negotiated in prime cost of agricultural products (works, services), an automatic algorithm of distribution of these expenses is offered, which is supposed to be realized via the corresponding accounting software. The point of use of the software is caused, on the one hand, by considerable by labour input of the process of accumulation and allocation of costs on the offered algorithm, and on the other hand, by technical capabilities of the agrarian enterprises which, according to data of the last researches in this sphere, point at the almost completed process of automation of accounting in agriculture on the basis of computer accounting programs. Value/originality. The methodological basis of such an algorithm is created by the developed suggestions for improvement of the distribution of costs for machines and equipment maintenance by ensuring the personified accounting of expenses on every object of these means of labour. It is proposed to carry out the further distribution of accumulated expenses on direct fuel consumption expenses on these objects when using active machines and mechanisms in terms of directions of expenditure and in proportion to productivity when using motorless mechanisms.

AB  - Germanium (Ge) and gallium (Ga) are slightly to moderately incompatible trace elements during magmatic processes and may be indicators of the nature of the mantle source. Because of their solubility in fluids, Ge and Ga are also geochemical tracers of various hydrothermal processes. Understanding high-pressure/low-temperature (HP-LT) recycling processes of Ge and Ga through fluid-mediated mass transfers in subduction zones can then allow discussing whether they can be source of geochemical heterogeneities in the mantle wedge. We have analysed Ge and Ga abundances and Ge isotope composition of a series of well-characterised HP-LT metabasites of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORE) affinity and pelitic micaschists from the Ile de Groix (France), to determine Ge and Ga behaviour and Ge isotope fractionation during subduction zone metamorphism (SZM). Metabasites have Ge and Ga contents of 1.2-2.1 ppm and 17-22 ppm, respectively, typical of tholeiitic basalts. Garnet-bearing blueschists and eclogites have delta Ge-74 values (+0.42 to + 0.65 parts per thousand) similar within error to that of tholeiitic basalts (+ 055 to + 0.57 parts per thousand; Luais, 2012).
   Our study shows that during the prograde metamorphism, Ge and Ga abundances and delta Ge-74 values do not vary from blueschists to eclogites, owing to the large stability field of Ge- and Ga-hosting minerals (epidote, garnet, titanite, amphiboles and omphacite) under varying P-T conditions. During the retrograde metamorphism, the slight decrease of the Ga content of c. 8% in greenschists (19 +/- 1 ppm; 2 sigma) compared to HP rocks (21 +/- 1 ppm; 2 sigma) suggests Ga loss during retrogression, whereas Ge abundances remain within the same range as blueschists and eclogites. In the garnet-bearing greenschists (early stages of retrogression), the delta Ge-74 values (+038 to + 0.49 parts per thousand.) remain similar within error to HP rocks. However, albite- and calcite-bearing greenschists have higher delta Ge-74 values (+ 0.84 to + 0.98 parts per thousand), showing evidence of Ge fractionation under intensive fluid rock interactions (late stage of retrogression). Micaschists have Ge and Ga abundances within the same range as continental crust and schists. Their variations in delta Ge-74 (+ 0.29 to + 0.70 parts per thousand) reflect variations in the sedimentary source and protolith composition.
   The relatively small variation of delta Ge-74 values in metabasites compared to mantle rocks implies that the subducted oceanic crust cannot trigger Ge isotopic heterogeneities in the mantle through fluid-induced metasomatism or recycling in the deep mantle. However, during the late stages of retrogression, migration of oxidising fluids along the crust-mantle wedge may be responsible for a resolvable increase of the delta Ge-74 value of the mantle wedge along the subduction channel. Besides, the larger range of Ge concentrations and delta Ge-74 values in the micaschists suggests that recycling of subducted sediments may generate mantle Ge elemental and isotopic heterogeneities.

AB  - Water-rock interaction in sandstone aquifers can potentially mobilize U-and Th-series radionuclides, resulting in elevated levels of radioactive constituents such as radium (Ra) in groundwater. Previous studies have delineated the sources of Ra in groundwater by assuming that Ra-228/Ra-226 of groundwater parallels the Th-232/U-238 activity ratio of aquifer solids. We present an integrated geochemical and isotopic study of groundwater and aquifer solids for major and trace elements, radium (Ra-224, Ra-226, Ra-228), strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86), and tritium in the Cambrian Jordan quartz sandstone aquifer of southeastern Minnesota (USA). The Jordan aquifer, part of the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system of the upper midwestern USA, is characterized by a wide range of Ra activities in groundwater. Uniform Ca-Mg-HCO3- major element composition and patterns in Sr-87/Sr-86 indicate that interaction with carbonate minerals controls water chemistry. At least one contributing Sr source is radiogenic, yielding Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios up to 0.71347. Radium-226 activities exhibit especially large variations (<1-418 mBq L-1), and the highest radium activities occupy a 100-km-long north-south region. Consistent with the carbonate-like elemental and Sr isotope signatures, Ra-226 activity (median 85 mBq L-1) is higher than Ra-228 (median 47 mBq L-1), yielding low Ra-228/Ra-226 ratios (median 0.5) that would be expected from a lithology preferentially containing U relative to Th, such as carbonate rocks. Collectively, results indicate the primary source of radium to the aquifer is alpha recoil from aquifer solids rather than external inputs of high-Ra waters, indicated by (1) similar Ra-228/Ra-226 ratios in aquifer solids and groundwater, including low, carbonate-like values in the high-Ra-226 samples: (2) some association between whole-rock Ra-226 levels and groundwater Ra-226 activities; and (3) groundwater Ra-224/Ra-228 averaging near unity. Furthermore, hydrogeologic setting (e.g. presence or absence of overlying carbonate units) is inconsistent with systematic inputs of high-Ra waters from overlying carbonate aquifers. The most proximate source of carbonate material in the sandstone aquifer seems to be the calcite and dolomite cement that yields different geochemical and isotopic fingerprints than silicate minerals would impart. Whole-rock Ra-226/U-238 approximate to 1 implies that any U enrichment in the carbonate cement occurred at least 350,000 years ago. High groundwater Ra activities relative to solids are attributable to anoxic conditions that play a role in maintaining inefficient radium removal for a fresh groundwater system, indicated by the estimated dimension-less whole-rock Ra distribution coefficient of 150-920 (median 560). Coprecipitation of Ra into barite is a potential but unquantified Ra removal mechanism. Overall, radium in the Jordan aquifer provides an example of a naturally-occurring trace element of health significance that may be derived not mainly from the quartz sandstone matrix, but from carbonate material such as calcite and dolomite cement.
   Especially when combined with complementary tracers such as Sr-87/Sr-86, this study demonstrates the usefulness of the Ra-228/Ra-226 ratio as an indicator of the key mineral phases (silicate vs. carbonate) involved in supplying radium to groundwater. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the interaction between a reflective particle film and water use efficiency (WUE) response of irrigated and non-irrigated apple trees (Malus xdomestica)over a wide range of environmental conditions. The objectives were to measure isotopic discrimination (Delta C-13 and delta O-18), specific gas exchange, and WUE response of 'Empire' apple treated with a reflective particle film (PF), with and without supplemental irrigation, compared with an untreated control, with and without supplemental irrigation, over a range of leaf area indices (LAI), seasonal evapotranspiration (ETo), and vapor pressure deficits (VPD) to determine the mechanisms of action affecting WUE in apple. Short-term whole canopy gas exchange studies and isotope discrimination analysis were used to test the hypothesis that WUE was modified by the use of a PF. In whole canopy gas exchange studies, carbon assimilation (A) and transpiration tended to increase, and WUE and canopy conductance tended to decrease, with VPD within each LAI class from 2 to 6. For VPD > 1 kPa, the PF irrigated treatment consistently had the greatest WUE and other treatments were intermediate for LAI of 2 to 4. The PF irrigated and non-irrigated treatments had greater WUE than the control irrigated and non-irrigated treatments for VPD <= 2 kPa and there were no treatment effects for VPD > 2 kPa in the LAI range of 4 to 6. The PF non-irrigated was equivalent to the control non-irrigated treatment at VPD of 1 to 3 kPa, but was significantly lower at VPD of 3 to 4 kPa. PF irrigated and non-irrigated treatments had the greatest carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13), the control non-irrigated treatment had the lowest Delta C-13, and the control-irrigated treatment was intermediate. Oxygen isotope enrichment (delta O-18) was positively correlated with the mean growing season VPD and mean growing season evapotranspiration. Delta C-13 was significantly and positively correlated with delta O-18. Seasonal WUE was negatively correlated with Delta C-13 and there was an interaction with LAI. The seasonal water use of apple is better evaluated with stable isotope discrimination integrating seasonal variation rather that the use of whole canopy gas exchange measurements that measure WUE for brief periods of time. Delta C-13 was an accurate measurement of apple WUE and indicated that the PF irrigated treatment had the greatest Delta C-13 and so the lowest WUE compared with the control non-irrigated treatment at LAI from 4 to 6. The reduced WUE of the PF irrigated treatment compared with the control non-irrigated treatment is likely due to increased g(s) from lower canopy temperature and increased canopy photosynthetically active radiation diffusion that drove increased A. delta O-18 was an indicator of seasonal water use over six growing seasons due to its high correlation with ETo. In 'Empire' apple, A can be increased with PF and irrigation treatments, but at the cost of decreased WUE.

AB  - Non-mycorrhizal Brassica does not produce specialized root structures such as cluster or dauciform roots but is an effective user of P compared with other crops. In addition to P-uptake, utilization and remobilization activity, acquisition of orthophosphate (Pi) from extracellular sparingly P-sources or unavailable bound P-forms can be enhanced by biochemical rescue mechanisms such copious H+-efflux and/or carboxylates exudation into rhizosphere by roots via plasmalemma H+ ATPase and anion channels triggered by P-starvation. To visualize the dissolution of sparingly soluble Ca-phosphate (Ca-P), newly formed Ca-P was suspended in agar containing other essential nutrients. With NH4+ applied as the N source, the precipitate dissolved in the root vicinity can be ascribed to rhizosphere acidification, whereas no dissolution occurred with nitrate nutrition. To observe in situ rhizospheric pH changes, images were recorded after embedding the roots in agar containing bromocresol purple as a pH indicator. P-tolerant cultivar showed a greater decrease in pH than the sensitive cultivar in the culture media (the appearance of typical patterns of various colors of pH indicator in the root vicinity), and at stress P-level this acidification was more prominent. In experiment 2, low P-tolerant class-I cultivars (Oscar and Con-II) showed a greater decrease in solution media pH than low P-sensitive class-II (Gold Rush and RL-18) cultivars, and P-contents of the cultivars was inversely related to decrease in culture media pH. To elucidate P-stress-induced remodeling and redesigning in a root architectural system, cultivars were grown in rhizoboxes in experiment 3. The elongation rates of primary roots increased as P-supply increased, but the elongation rates of the branched zones of primary roots decreased. The length of the lateral roots and topological index values increased when cultivars were exposed to a P-stress environment. To elucidate Pi-uptake kinetics, parameters related to P influx: maximal transport rate (V-max), the Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m), and the external concentration when net uptake is zero (C-min) were tested in experiment 4. Lower K-m and C-min values were better indicative of the P-uptake ability of the class-I cultivars, evidencing their adaptability to P-starved environmental cues. In experiment 5, class-I cultivars exuded two- to threefold more carboxylates than class-II cultivars under the P-stress environment. The amount and types of carboxylates exuded from the roots of P-starved plants differed from those of plants grown under P-sufficient conditions. Nevertheless, the exudation rate of both class-I and class-II cultivars decreased with time, and the highest exudation rate was found after the first 4 h of carboxylates collection. Higher P uptake by class-I cultivars was significantly related to the drop in root medium pH, which can be ascribed to H+-efflux from the roots supplied with sparingly soluble rock-P and Ca-3(PO4)(2). These classical rescue strategies provided the basis of P-solubilization and acquisition from sparingly soluble P-sources by Brassica cultivars to thrive in a typically stressful environment.

AB  - As a result of water regulation measures and the subsequent introduction of intensive use practices, riverine floodplains have suffered severe habitat and species losses. With the changed economic conditions and decrease in animal stocking rates after 1990, opportunities arose for the partial restoration of species-rich vegetation areas in East Germany. Sixty permanent plots were established in the lower Havel Valley in the federal state of Brandenburg from 1993 to 1999. We studied the effects of extensification and partial rewetting in this area during a monitoring programme that lasted until 2018. For this purpose, groundwater levels, historical land use, and soil chemical parameters were investigated, and the soil seed bank and phytosociological releve ' s were sampled. Previous research has shown that an extended period of intensive grassland use eliminates the possibility of success in short- to medium-term natural restoration because of the lack of suitable propagules. Our question was as follows: how does a floodplain grassland respond to extensification and decreased water regulation in an area that experienced a shorter period of intensification in the past, such as the lower Havel floodplain? Tests of soil samples showed a depleted soil seed bank at the beginning of the monitoring period, but the seed bank was less depleted than those in other areas. Using cluster analysis followed by discriminant analysis, we identified water regime parameters and historical land-use intensity as the main drivers of vegetation differentiation. The classification resulted in the differentiation of vegetation into 13 plant communities. Plant communities were combined into 5 main groups based on their location in the ordination diagram of a detrended correspondence analysis. The shift in group centroids over time correlated with increases in the species diversity and moisture level for all groups. The altered species composition as a result of the changed water regime after 1990 influenced the usability of the grassland differently depending on the relief level. At the end of monitoring, vegetation at sites in the mesic moisture range was determined to have the highest fodder quality observed in this study. With increasing mean groundwater levels, the forage quality of the vegetation decreased until it was so low that the vegetation was hardly suitable for use as animal forage. The plant species diversity was negatively correlated with the plant-available P and Ellenberg N indicator value. Plant-available P, K and Mg showed evidence of leaching during the later study period. The abundance of red-listed species and extensive-use indicator species increased over the course of the study period. This positive trend was reversed by the extreme flood event in the summer of 2013. However, the high species richness and the species compositions of the reference communities were not equal in the other communities, even after almost 30 years of extensification. This finding underlines the importance of the few remaining meadows that are rich in typical floodplain species as donor areas of autochthonous seeds. The results of this study are discussed in light of sustainable management practices and global climate change.

AB  - The prospects and directions of improvement of the methodology for strategic enterprise management have been highlighted. The subject of the research is theoretical and methodological aspects of creating a strategic enterprise management system based on the concept of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). It has been revealed that in the context of changing the concept of the enterprise strategic development toward the growth of its intellectual capital as the main factor of competitiveness, the evolution of the enterprise management and planning system from strategic enterprise management to balanced enterprise management is taking place. The balanced scorecard has been defined as the basic concept of balanced enterprise management. The purpose of the study is to outline the prospects and directions for improving the methodology of strategic enterprise management under the conditions of its evolution into balanced enterprise management. Results. On the basis of a mathematical representation of the sphere of strategic responsibility (SSR) of the enterprise as an organizational and infrastructural environment for balanced enterprise management, it has been proved that the interaction of the SSR content components results in a synergistic effect of its expansion. This, in turn, determines the necessity and possibility of distributing the company's SSR beyond its management and involving the initiative owners in the process of balanced enterprise management. Accordingly, the prospects for improvement of the strategic enterprise management methodology have been defined as an integration of strategic management systems, approaches, methods and the BSC with non-traditional eventological methods combined with the analytic hierarchy process. It has been proved that, from the standpoint of the eventology, subjective observations and the mathematical apparatus of the theory of random events allow identification of general statistical regularities of the probabilistic set distribution in various, including management, systems. From the standpoint of a balanced approach, the need for enriching the methodology of the BSC as a system of balanced enterprise management, using the eventological analysis, is being boosted by the need to take into account the growing number of random, multi-directional and seemingly unrelated factors in the management process. Methodology. The following research methods were used in the study: the expert assessment method, factor analysis - for the formation of the management panel of the BSC; the eventological scoring and analytic hierarchy process - for balancing and structuring key performance indicators (KPI), economic and mathematical methods - to analyse the SSRs of the enterprise as an organizational and infrastructural environment for balanced enterprise management; a critical analysis - to compare alternative approaches to the formation of the BSC. Value/originality. To achieve the purpose of the study, the BSC methodology has been presented as a system of balanced enterprise management. A methodical approach to balancing and structuring KPIs, using the results of eventological analysis and analytic hierarchy process, has been proposed. Its practical implications include the possibility of reaching the target balance of indicators taking into account weighing coefficients of the main indicator selection criteria, the possibility to determine the whole system balance index as the average of the balance indices of each of the indicators that characterize the enterprise performance.
   The ways of implementing the methods of e-scoring and analytic hierarchy process for the assessment and correction of the enterprise's strategy have been studied. Integration of e-scoring with the strategic enterprise management method and the BSC methodology provides an effective vertical communication as the basic principle of balanced enterprise management, which extends the scope of strategic responsibility to subordinate initiative owners.

AB  - The purpose of the research is to identify the influence of Ukraine's economic development on the international agencies' credit rating of its banking system. The instability and ambiguous geopolitical position of Ukraine are complicating any predictions for its economic developments. In the meanwhile, massive restructuring of all sectors of the economy became the necessary minimum for the reformation of the country and the achievement of the international standards. It is interesting to see how exactly these international standards, as represented by the evaluation of the rating agencies, appraise Ukraine, and particularly its banking sector. The methodology involves the analysis of the three major Ukrainian banks -The methodology involves the analysis of the three, Oschadbank, and Ukreximbank using Fitch's credit quality assessment systematic as an example.The comparative analysis was performed using Tier 1 capital ratio and loan-to-deposit ratio of these banks, year-to-year quarterly GDP growth, consumer price index (CPI) year-to-year change, UAH/USD exchange rate, 2-year and 5-year government bond yield, as well as 2-year and 5-year credit default swap (CDS). Results show that the most influential credit rating drivers for Ukrainian banks are: exchange rate; funding and liquidity; capital position and asset quality; sovereign risk. The research showed that the 2-year and 5-year government bond yield in USD and 2-year and 5-year CDS were influenced by similar trends. The yield on short-dated Ukrainian governmental bonds has shown a parallel increase with the corresponding CDS that indicated the market's evaluation of the stressed condition of the country's government and economy. Additionally, conventional yield structures displayed inversed nature with 2-year governmental bond yield in USD trading at significantly higher yields than 5-year government bond yield in USD during times of economic distress. Although longer maturity instruments should usually trade at a higher rate, such a development could have reflected the public markets' scepticism to the Ukrainian government's short-term solvency. The closer look at the Tier 1 capital ratio, which is considered to be a key indicator of the financial health of the banks, revealed analogy between it and three major Ukrainian banks rating development, indicating the Tier 1 capital ratio as a strong influencing factor. Loan-to-deposit ratio as an indicator of bank liquidity moved in parallel with decreasing credit ratings. The strong decrease in the UAH/USD exchange rate mirrored a strong increase in inflation and overall worsening state of the Ukrainian economy also being reflected in the major banks' ratings. Practical implications. The correlation of these factors is relevant for bank managers and investors who can use financial market indicators to forecast and plan their own ability to conduct business. Likewise, academic researchers can further build on this study to add to the literature on country-specific reviews of sovereign debt crises and their impact on national banking systems. Value/originality. This research demonstrates that a worsening of financial indicators of the health of Ukraine's financial system as measured by government bond yields and the trading of credit default swaps, as well as the country's economic downturn, go along with a decline of local banks' credit ratings.

AB  - Since the 1970s, winter wheat management in France has focused on growing high-yielding cultivars with the intensive use of external inputs. However, over the last 10 years, breeding priorities have changed in favour of the development of cultivars with multiple resistance to fungal diseases and lodging. Low-input strategies have also been developed, to reduce costs and to meet environmental targets. In this study, we assessed the economic, energetic and environmental performances of three cultivars (C) grown under four management intensities. Two of these cultivars (Isengrain and Tremie) are both high-yielding and disease-susceptible, whereas the third (Oratorio) is multiresistant to diseases and lodging but has a lower potential yield. The four crop management systems (CM) were designed with a decrease in input level (seeds, N fertilizer, fungicides, growth regulator) from CM1 to CM4. We set up a multi-year ant multi-site network to test the C-CM pairs in a wide range of environments.
   The evaluation of C-CM pairs was based on a set of indicators dealing with economics (profitability, input and machinery costs per tonne), environment (pesticide use, N recovery), and energy (energy use efficiency, energy costs). As regards profitability and costs per tonne, we assessed the vulnerability of the C-CM pairs to several grain and oil price scenarios.
   The demonstration of synergy between the two types of innovation (multiresistant cultivars, low-input management) is a major result: each makes the other more profitable, increasing its chances of adoption in the field. The ecology-based technology package, involving the use of lower-yielding multiresistant cultivars under lower external input levels, was more profitable when grain prices were low (less than (sic)123-157 per tonne (for low and high oil prices, respectively)). By contrast, the intensive technology package, consisting of high-yielding cultivars and high levels of external inputs (N, fungicides and growth regulators), was more profitable when grain prices exceeded (sic)123-157 per tonne (for low and high oil prices, respectively). However, it was less optimal in terms of fossil energy use and potential on environmental impact. In a context of fluctuating grain and oil prices and a need to preserve resources (e.g. fossil energy, water quality), our results demonstrate the potential benefits of using low-input crop management systems. with cultivars displaying multiple resistance to diseases and lodging (Oratorio-CM3). The loss of productivity (1 t ha(-1) less than for Isengrain-CM2) due to the lower yield potential of the multiresistant cultivar and the lower levels of inputs must be seen as a necessary evil if we are to decrease the overuse of resources. There is a need to adapt current procedures for cultivar evaluation, to promote the breeding of multiresistant cultivars for low-input systems. New cultivars should be evaluated under a range of conditions, from high- to low-input systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The European surfactant and detergent industry initiated a project to conduct an EUSES-based environmental exposure assessment for the total volume of alkyl sulfate (AS) surfactants, and to verify if the EUSES assessment leads to a realistic prediction of the environmental exposure or to an over- respectively under-estimation of the environmental concentrations of the surfactants. Verification of the EUSES environmental concentration prediction (Clocal(effluent)) was carried out by benchmarking them against environmental monitoring data. Recently published data from the United States of America adjusted to the European Union (EU) frame conditions were used for the assessment, as for the EU only historical data from the mid-1990s are available. In addition to the standard (default) EUSES assessment, a higher tier assessment using substance-specific properties, particularly increased biodegradation rates (192 per day instead of the default of 24 per day for WWTP), was conducted.
   Results: A figure of 178,400 tonnes of AS was established as the total maximum volume (2016) handled annually in Europe. This total volume includes the volumes from all EU manufacturers and all registered AS > 100 t/a, as well as the amount of AS contained in EU REACH registered alkyl ether sulfates (AES). The total tonnage was split and assigned to the different uses as reported to ECHA in the C12 AS, Na (151-21-3) registration dossier in 2010. The EUSES calculation was limited to widespread (professional and consumer) uses, covering in total 97,889 t of AS homologues. The EUSES calculation gave a Clocal(effluent) of 335 mu g/L for the SimpleTreat "readily" biodegradation rate default and a Clocal(effluent) of 44.6 mu g/L for the AS-specific degradation rates. Recent US monitoring data showed a mean effluent concentration of 4.24 mu g alkyl sulfates/L ( n-ary sumation C12 + C14 + C16 homologues). Taking into account the different annual per capita AS use (including AS from AES) in the US (295 g) and the EU (348 g), the daily per capita water use (EU 200 L, US 408 L), and the WWTP efficiency in the EU and the US (comparable), an US to EU adjustment factor of 2.4 was established. Application of the adjustment factor to the US monitoring data resulted in a calculated EU mean effluent concentration = 10.18 mu g alkyl sulfates/L ( n-ary sumation C12, C14, C16 homologues). This value was used as an independent benchmark for the EUSES calculations.
   Conclusions: Comparing the predicted Clocal(effluent) = 335 mu g alkyl sulfates/L (SimpleTreat default) and a Clocal(effluent) = 44.6 mu g Alkyl Sulfates/L (AS-specific degradation rates) with the 10.18 mu g alkyl sulfates/L from the adjusted monitoring data it is evident, that the EUSES calculation overestimates the AS environmental exposure by factors of > 32 and > 4, respectively. Taking into consideration, that only widespread uses (covering only 50% of the total AS volume) were included in the EUSES calculation, the overestimation of the default exposure by a factor of 4 is still conservative, despite the fact, that eightfold higher, substance-specific biodegradation rates were used. In conclusion, using the 2010 C12-AS REACH dossier (CAS-No. 151-21-3) as an example, it has been shown, that EUSES model exposure calculations using default biodegradation rates significantly overestimate effluent concentrations.

AB  - In scientific literature value is referred to as the most complete and exact indicator of business condition that reflects changes in internal and external environment of an enterprise. In a dynamic environment where risk and uncertainty are inevitable attributes of the process of the enterprise's business forecast, due to the change of various drivers, business value may fluctuate in a rather wide range. On one hand, risk and uncertainty prompt to think in terms of future scenarios and to anticipate the full range of value dimensions. On the other hand, the fluctuation of business value within a wide range predetermines the problematic aspect of rendering the final conclusion on business value. Since business value changes with the change of influencing drivers, the analysis of drivers that have impact on business value becomes urgent. Based on such an analysis it would be possible to calculate the most probable dimension of business value.
   In scientific literature focusing on the issues of business valuation the aspect of the analysis of business value drivers is discussed very fragmentally. Though researchers emphasise the importance of determining the impact of value drivers that influence the dimension of business value, there is no unified approach to the classification and investigation of these value drivers. The linear classifications of influencing business value drivers presented in the works of authors who explore the issues of business valuation are inconsistent and insufficient for the evaluation of business value drivers. Given a linear presentation of drivers it is difficult to see the interrelations of the influencing business value drivers and business value or to measure quantitatively the impact of change of business value drivers on business value. Having proved the limitation of linear classifications of influencing business value drivers, a classification of business value drivers was formed by grouping the drivers that have impact on business value in levels one to five. This classification is based on the decomposition of business value established by the method of discounted cash flows. Such a graded presentation of drivers enables to have an insight to the inter-relations of business value drivers and business value and to evaluate the impact of each driver change not only on the change of the business value but also on the change of a higher level driver.
   The analysis of scientific literature shows that references to the application of methods in establishing the impact of drivers on business value are very limited. It is not enough to lean upon the results of the sensitivity analysis, which is presented in scientific literature as the most widely used in determining the impact of drivers on business value, because it only enables to evaluate the impact of one driver change (increase/decrease) on business value, leaving aside possible change of other drivers. Since in a factual situation the change is usually present in more than one driver, there occurs a need to apply those methods of factorial analysis which would enable a complex evaluation of the impact of change of many drivers on the change of business value.
   By discovering the limitation of references to the methods that may be used for value drivers investigation as well as the complexity of these methods' selection and application, the authors of this article propose for the establishment of the impact of business value drivers on business value to adapt the integral method of economic factorial analysis, which allowed to wholly evaluate the impact of different level drivers on business value.
   Theoretical and empirical researches resulted in the creation of a business valuation model based on the analysis of business value drivers, which incorporates the classification of business value drivers and the establishment of their impact on value into the process of business valuation, and enables to provide the final result of business valuation - a dimension of business value.

AB  - Background: Leptospirosis is a worldwide disease that impacts health, welfare and animal production. Manifestations in swine range from subclinical to severe cases of reproductive failure, generating abortions, embryonic resorption, litters with few piglets, and piglets born weak or dead, which causes great economic losses. Tropical conditions in Colombia favor transmission and maintenance of Leptospira, highlighting the importance of implementing direct diagnostic techniques such as isolation through culture to reach a definitive diagnosis. The objective of the present study was to relate reproductive indicators behavior with the presence of Leptospira spp. in two pig farms in Cundinamarca, Colombia.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Sows in reproductive stage in two pig farms were selected. A clinical examination of the animals was performed to demonstrate the presence of signs suggestive of Leptospirosis, also the sow records were reviewed to find reports of any of these clinical manifestations, and the average of the reproductive indicators was calculated to set which were altered in the sows. Blood and urine samples were obtained and analyzed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and isolation through culture, respectively. Among the altered reproductive indicators were identified: total pigs born (TPB) in 72.5%, stillbirths (SB) by 70%, mummified pigs (MUM) in a 52.5%, pre-weaning death (PWD) by 40% and the 24 h mortality (M24h) in the 20%. The 77.5% of the sows were positive by MAT. The predominant serovars of Leptospira spp. included Grippotyphosa (67.5%), Canicola (22.5%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (20%), Hardjo (17.5%) and Pomona (12.5%). The bacterium was isolated in 32.5% of the analyzed urine samples. There is increased risk of alteration in the indicators M24h (1.27), TPB (1.08), SB (1.15) and MUM (1.27) with the presence of Leptospira by isolation through culture.
   Discussion: The birth of weak piglets and the alteration of indicators such as SB were the most common findings in this study, which are of the major alterations caused by the bacteria because Leptospira can be located in the uterus. Positive cultures, 32.5% (13/40), indicate a high percentage of positive animals in the population. The total of positive culture results reveal that humans, pigs and other animal species from the farms and surrounding areas, are at risk of exposure to the bacteria, because these positive sows are eliminating the microorganism through urine to the environment, representing a problem for public health. This is why it is important to perform the identification of bacteria in urine. It establishes whether the animal is a carrier, although the non-detection of the microorganism in the urine does not rule out that this is a chronic renal carrier because it may indicate that at the moment of the test the animal was not excreting detectable amounts of the bacteria. The total of positive sera (77.5%) indicates a high seropositivity of swine leptospirosis in the population. Regarding serovars of Leptospira spp. identified, Grippotyphosa has the largest presentation (67.5%), therefore, as pigs are not maintenance hosts of this serovar, the results of this study suggest that synanthropic rodents that are found on farms may be transmitting the bacteria to pigs. The reproductive indicators related to the Leptospira serovars by X-2 test, demonstrated significant association between the average of SB and the serovar Pomona, which has as reservoir the swine species and it is related with the production of piglets born dead, while through the Pearson correlation coefficient it was found that the greater the number of positive samples to serovar Pomona there is a greater presentation of weak piglets, and also was demonstrated that animals with Leptospira spp. have a higher risk to present alterations of the M24h, the average of TPB, SB and MUM.

AB  - This article reflects on the implementation of the human development approach in labor organizations. We will explain the socio-historical elements that led to its creation, the role of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the main pillars of the paradigm, base on a theoretical discussion of the concept of capabilities. We propose that the human development approach, and in particular that of human capacities, has diverse applications in the organizational context, not limited to the development of labor competencies. We recognize that the capacities for life in common can be strengthened in the work environment, since the organizations are also spaces of social interaction. Accepting these premises, employees can be educated for citizenship, while acquiring skills for productive life. A vigorous implementation of these approaches requires overcoming the economicist view of labor relations, giving organizations the chance to offer real opportunities, including agency freedom and subjective decision, as a shared responsibility for the development of people.
   The paradigm of human development has been widely applied in community work because of its impact on the design of public policies and social programs. In the 1980s, the ideas of the Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq were materialized in the first Human Development Report. Since 1990, to date, UNDP has continued to publish annual reports. Indian philosopher and economist Amartya Sen contributed to the creation of the Human Development Index; along with the American philosopher Martha Nussbaum have developed proposals to develop capabilities. The authors' work proves a high commitment to freedom, human rights and democracy, bringing the welfare economy to political science, economics and ethics.
   Although the focus has gained attention in government policies and social institutions, its application in labor organizations has not achieved the same diffusion. Recently, the UNDP Human Development Report 2015 has addressed this issue in studying work and its impact on people. Perhaps its lack of application in the labor organizations is that in these the subject is usually conceived as a means of production, not as an end in itself. Hence, development opportunities are usually measured in criteria of productivity and economic growth of the organization, instead of growth and development of people.
   This approach initially emerges as a critique of the economic model focused on the production of consumer goods, which sought to bring the benefits of increased output to the lower income groups. Far from enumerating the errors and neglects of the models that have sustained injustice, the approach proposes alternatives to pay for this "social debt" that has left great inequality gaps in the vulnerable population. Since its first report, UNDP has emphasized the importance of offering people and Communities options to economic alternatives for empowerment and the expansion of human freedoms.
   In this sense, the Human Development approach does not deny the important role that the economic conditions of individual, group or collective subjects fulfill, but its message is broader. While it is true that economic factors help meet the essential needs of men, economic growth has no automatic link with human progress (UNDP, 1990). It does not mean neglecting the GDP indicator, but how to translate that growth into the strengthening of human capabilities.
   We consider it is the development of the subjects that drives the organization, not vice versa. Therefore, the interest that people have in this proposal is special.
   The central issues for its implementation require defining this paradigm and its main foundations. For this it is necessary to contrast the concept of human capabilities and their possible equivalent in organizations: labor competencies. Finally, we present the implications of free agency and co-responsibility of organizations, since human development obeys a subjective decision.

AB  - Purpose The importance of board composition, especially female directors' presence on boards, is thought to influence corporate responsibility performance, has attracted significant scholarly interest. This study aims to examine how board gender diversity (BGD) affects corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and the moderating factors that influence the relationship. There is a lack of research on the moderating indicators (variable measurement, geographic location, data sets and gender parity score) that impact the BGD and CSR relationship. Design/methodology/approach This study uses content analysis and meta-analysis to combine the findings of 44 selected papers published from 2010 to 2019, comprehensively reviewing the academic literature on gender diversity in the board composition. Independent and dependent variables are classified based on the variable measurement; this study examines the moderator indicators, such as geographical location, research data sets and gender parity score to investigate the BGD and CSR relationship. Findings The findings indicated a significant positive relationship between BGD and CSR performance. The meta-method results showed that the measurements of BGD and CSR limited to impact on the relationship. But a significant moderating effect of the geographical location on the BGD-CSR relationship, the BGD-CSR relationship would be stronger in the firms located in North America than firms located in Asia and other areas. Empirical results also showed a significant moderating effect of gender parity score. There would be stronger BGD-CSR relations in the firms located in the countries with higher gender parity score than the firms located in the countries with low gender parity score. This means the female status is an essential indicator of moderating the BGD-CSR relationship. Research limitations/implications The main shortcoming is a lack of sufficient articles on the BGD-CSR relationship. In a future study, researchers may use other databases, such as Google scholar or Ebscohost, to increase the number of relevant articles. These studies would offer new insight into the meta-analysis of the relationship between the BGD and CSR. Finally, the authors identify the potential trend in future research, future research on BGD will need for standardized metrics. The Geographic location is an important indicator that will influence the female director role in CSR. A systematic measure and data of gender research are more important for study in this field. Practical implications Meta-analysis is conducted on the independent and dependent variables to examine the causality between BGD and CSR performance, which could better explore diversity among different countries' boards and, more generally, to investigate the degree to which diversity may influence CSR. Firms may try to balance the BGD to improve future development prospects. Specifically, the results of this study have important implications for corporate governance and policymakers. Social implications First, this systematic study uses meta-analysis to combine the findings of previous research on the BGD-CSR. The current research attempts to incorporate mixed empirical results based on the different variable measurements. Second, this study develop and test a contingency model of female on boards and CSR that considers uses the geographic location factors that may enhance or diminish the influence of female on boards on CSR.
   Specifically, the authors examine whether and under what conditions, boards with more female directors differ for inter-country heterogeneity to which they engage in monitoring roles and are involved with strategy management. Originality/value First, this study could be the first systematic study that uses the meta-analysis to combine previous research findings on the BGD-CSR. Second, the current research attempts to incorporate mixed empirical results based on the different variable measurements. Third, this study uses the "gender parity score" to account for inter-country heterogeneity in the BGD-CSR relationship. This study also identifies the potential trend in future research.

AB  - Relevance. Obtaining quantitative estimates of the efficiency of image analysis algorithms is a very urgent problem, including the problem of evaluating the efficiency of contour detectors. The choice of reliable algorithms for extracting contours on images of wave fields is of particular importance when constructing digital twins of oil fields. So, to study borehole and interwell space, it is necessary to use contouring algorithms that have high noise immunity in difficult seismic and geological conditions. The choice of such algorithms should be based on a comprehensive analysis of the quality of the selected contours, including such elements as displacement, break and blurring of boundaries. In this regard, the method of obtaining estimates of the efficiency of contour detectors based on the calculation of the generalized indicator of the quality of boundary detection proposed in the work of I. Boaventura and A. Gonzaga in 2009 is of great interest. The generalized quality indicator is defined by the authors of the article in the form of a vector norm in Euclidean space. One of the coordinates of the vector is the reciprocal of the Pratt metric, which takes into account the integral value of the displacement of the elements of the detected contour. The rest of the coordinates of the vector are formed on the basis of binary classification. The works of D.V. Dubinin, A.I. Kochegurov and B. Goringer introduce the studies of the efficiency of the quality indicator of I. Boaventura and A. Gonzaga by a computational experiment. In the course of the experiment, the reference images were approximated by a twodimensional point recovery stream, which made it possible to implement the principles of setting up an experiment according to Fischer (the principle of randomization). The analysis of the obtained experimental data showed a number of shortcomings of the generalized quality indicator of A. Gonzaga and I. Boaventura. In particular, at low signal-to-noise (s/n) ratios, overestimated values of the Pratt's criterion were obtained, which in its turn led to underestimated estimates of the generalized quality indicator. Indeed, being sensitive to local displacements of the boundary, Pratt's criterion reacts poorly to omissions of elements in broken contours, which leads to unjustifiably high values of the criterion at low s/n ratios. This statement was made by A.V. Yaskorskiy in 1987 and found its proof in the results of a computational experiment. Thus, there is a real need to improve the reliability of the detection quality estimates obtained on the basis of the generalized index of I. Boaventura and A. Gonzaga. For this purpose, it is proposed to introduce into the generalized quality indicator instead of the Pratt's criterion its modified analogue (Modification Pratt's Figure of Merit), proposed and considered in detail by us in earlier works. This work is devoted to the study of the generalized indicator of I. Boaventura and A. Gonzaga with the modified Pratt criterion.
   Methods and means of research: system analysis, stochastic simulation modeling, digital image processing, data visualization methods, as well as the methods of analysis, based on the gradual formalization of models by activating the intuition of specialists. The computational experiment was carried out in the Delphi environment, and the numerical model was validated using the Mathcad environment. The research results will make it possible to choose an objective criterion for assessing the quality of building contour boundaries when creating a digital twin of an oil field.

AB  - Background and Aim: Macro- and micro-elements are required to ensure the normal course of biochemical processes in the development of an animal's body. Any excess, deficiency, or imbalance in chemical elements in an animal's body can cause the development of various latent or clinically expressed pathological conditions. Diselementosis in pregnant cows may lead to impaired embryo and fetal development, as well as reduced neonatal viability. The aim of this study was to analyze the content of macroelements and microelements in the blood serum of both calving cows and their calves to evaluate the relationship between indicators of mineral metabolism in the mother and newborn and to establish what role separate chemical elements play in making newborn calves more prone to bronchopneumonia.
   Materials and Methods: The content of potassium (K), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Strontium (Sr), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and selenium (Se) in the blood serum of 33 pregnant cows between 239 and 262 days of gestation and their 33 1-day old calves was determined using the Shimadzu AA6300 (Japan) atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content was determined using ion-selective electrodes from the Olympus-400 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA). During the 1st month of life, all calves in the sample set had some sort of respiratory diseases and seven of the calves had bronchopneumonia. Retrospectively, the samples of adult and newborn animals were divided into two groups each: Dams I - cows whose calves had uncomplicated bronchitis (n=26); Dams II - cows whose calves got bronchopneumonia (n=7); and Newborns I - calves with uncomplicated bronchitis (n=26); Newborns II - calves with bronchopneumonia (n=7).
   Results: The content of Ca, Mg, K, Na, Mo, and Se in dams in both groups of cows was within the reference range; the concentrations of Fe and Ni were higher than the reference range; and the concentrations of Cu, Zn, As, Co, and Cr were lower than the reference range. There were no significant differences in elemental status between the Dams I and Dams II groups. In newborn calves, the concentration of Ca and Mo corresponded to the reference range; the concentrations of Mg, Fe, Co, and Ni in both groups exceeded the reference range; and the concentrations of Cu, Zn, As, Cr, and Se were lower than the reference range. Results highlighted that there was a tendency to decrease concentration of Fe, Mo, and Se and a significant increase in the Ni concentration in calves of the Newborns II group compared with calves of the Newborns I group. It was also found that Zn, Co, Cr, and Mo actively accumulated in the body of newborn animals while the transplacental transfer of Cu, As, and Sr was limited; and transfer of Se and Ni was regulated by concentration ratios in the blood of the mother and the fetus. The excessive concentrations of Ni and Fe in the blood serum of cows and calves and the imbalance in the ratio of elements Fe-Cu-Zn, Fe-Cu-Co negatively affected erythropoiesis, formation of the immune system, and antioxidant status of the fetus and newborn. These changes were considered to be risk factors for the development of bronchopneumonia in calves.
   Conclusion: An excess of serum Fe and Ni and deficiency of Cu, Zn, As, Co, and Cr in cows during the gestation period can lead to similar impairments of the mineral status in newborn calves. At the systemic level, dyslementosis in combination with the influence of other adverse factors, can lead to an increased load on the respiratory and hematopoietic systems of calves during postnatal adaptation and can subsequently cause a decrease in the natural resistance of calves and development of bronchopneumonia.

AB  - Flow-parallel linear bedforms, consisting of ridges and tunnels have been reported widely in soft and consolidated cohesive sediments within intertidal and subtidal coastal waters. Less frequent are reports of these systems incised into soft bedrock. Despite their common occurrence there are few data concerning the hydrodynamic controls on the initiation and maintenance of ridge-runnel systems. Rather, several hypotheses have been advanced to account for them. In tidal environments a theory based upon the evolution of 'streamwise vorticity' transverse to the main flow direction is favoured, and has been supported recently by detailed hydrodynamic data obtained from above a ridge-runnel system on an intertidal zone of the Severn Estuary, UK. In the present paper, a detailed description of the sedimentology of the same ridge-runnel system is provided and interpreted within the framework of the 'streamwise vorticity' hypothesis. This objective is accomplished by measurements of the morphology and sampling the bulk characteristics of the sedimentary ridges and tunnels but also with reference to ridges and tunnels incised into soft bedrock beneath the sediment body. Grain-size composition, sediment compaction, radionuclide distributions and elemental distributions and X-radiography are used to describe the sediment structures within ridges and their inferred histories of development. These descriptions are interpreted with respect to the known hydrodynamic climate and the deposition and erosion behaviour of the sediments in laboratory experiments using an annular flume.
   Runnels contain liquid mud at low tide but contain very little fine gravel and shell debris. In contrast, fine suspended sediment is present at high concentrations in the flow. Thus fluid evorsion, aided by a dense suspension of fine sediment that impacts the mud bed, must be the primary tool to initiate and maintain the tunnels, rather than scour by a coarse bedload. The ridges are composed primarily of fine silt or sand laminae some of which are approximately horizontal but most of which are slightly domed upwards such that they drape the ridge topography. This relationship between lamination and form demonstrates that the ridges are distinct accretion units and not residual masses of un-eroded planar-laminated mud incised by runnels. Laminae thicken, or thin and pinch-out, or are truncated, laterally at the sides of the runnels. Truncation occurs probably by damped spanwise turbulence structures which were recorded at this location.
   A notable characteristic is that the mud in the upper portion of the ridges is of low density and low compaction whilst the sediment in the lower part is more dense and well-compacted; often the two units are distinct, being separated by major reactivation surfaces; the latter indicative of occasional stripping of the surface sediments from above a residual 'core' at the base. The presence of coarse-grained laminae and lenses and minor reactivation surfaces throughout the sediment body indicates that high energy conditions, possibly other than the Neap-Spring cycle, are also important in developing the ridges. In this respect, consideration of the erosion potential of deposited sediment, using field and flume data, shows that the relatively low density, low-compaction mud constituting the crests of the ridges is not readily eroded by the present-day Neap-Spring tidal flow regime. Further, for the same flow regime, when the shear stresses on the bed fall below critical for suspension, potential deposition rates are very low, which supports the interpretation of the coarse-grained layers and reactivation surfaces as indicators of the significant role played by additional high-stress events, such as storm surges, in ridge-erosion and rebuilding.

AB  - The Piedra Clavada Formation (PCF), Austral Basin, Argentina, reaches 70 in in thickness in the Santa Cruz area and has been, Subdivided into two Members (lower and upper) and 9 facies associations. These are represented by 22 coarse- to fine-grained deposits from bioclastic, polygenic onhoconglomerates. to lithoarenites, pelites and heterolitic (sand and pelite) facies. In the type locality, near Tres Lagos, PCF spans from Albian to the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary;. In this area four logs have been made recording lithostratigrapghy, Sedimentology and ichnology (Piedra Clavada PPC. Tres Lagos PTL, Arroyo los Paisanos PAP and Quebrada Don Niken QDN). Invertebraie, vertebrate fossil and plant remains (large log) have been sampled, mainly bivalve shelf beds (Eriphyla, Corbula, Trigonia, Mytilus, Panopea), ostreids, gastropods, fish teeth or scales of semionotiform Lepidotes, and plates of turtles. Facies assemblages of the lower Member suggest a coastal, estuarine-deltaic environment with minor tidal-stomi influences. in the lower part of PCF, alluvial (ebb) currents of the deltaic system. mainly from land through open shelf, prevailed over the open-sea a influence of waves, tides, combined flows and storms, as indicated by palaeocurrents, facies distributions and taphonomic features of Shell be/plant remains. In the upper Member the paleoenvironmental System of PCF evolved proqressively, through a typical estuarine-bay environment, with tidal/storm (flood) waves and combined nows prevailing! over the deltaic/alluvial land influences, a indicated mainly by paleocurrents, facies distribution and taphonomic Features of shell beds. Therefore, the narrow-mouthed channel system with a sandy bar complex which characterzed the lower Member seems to be replaced by a wider and relatively uniform area which in the upper Member was dominated by tidal/storm umve currents of the esuuarine system.
   (in trace fossils, 22 ichnogenera and several ichnospecies (not previously studied) have been analyzed. A total number of S ichnocoenoses has been distinguished front the backshore/foreshore throughout the lower Shoreface environment: Gaslrochaenolites (IGa), Polykladiclmus (IPy) of backshore/foreshore, Ophiomorpha nodoso (IOn), Arenicolites isp. (LA). Teichichnus (IT) of upper shoreface, and Gyrochorte (IG). Ph - %-codeVCuno!iJms (fPC), Rhizocorallium/Chondrites (IRC) of lower Shoreface, respectively. Palaeoeto- logic, palaeoecologic and palaeoenviromnental indicators inferred from ichnocoenoses reveal a close relationship between infaunal activity and facies distribution promoted by ebb or flood currents ' confirming that tracemakers were particularly sensitive to change, of energy parameters and substrate conditions.
   High-resolution stratigraphy allows a IV-V order cyclicity to be defined, and reveals nine shallowing-upward parasequences, reaching eight to ten meters in thickness in the lower Member (total 4), and of five to eight meters thick (total number of 5) in the Upper Member. Parasequences are both fining-thinning upward and coarsening-thickening Upward, revealing in the first case a progradation of tidal, heterolitic facies above sandy prodelta facies, and, in the second, sandy front bar facies above pelitic-lieterolitic prodelta facies, respectively. The Piedra Clavada Fin. may be subdivided into two depositional sequences of third order. For the lower one the highstand systems tract includes the parasequences 1, 2, 3 and 4 which show a prograclational stacking pattern. The type 1 sequence boundary may be placed at the transition between parasequences 4 and 5. The transgressive systems tract with shell lags has been placed in parasequences 5-6 which reveal a retrogradational stacking pattern. The maximum flooding surface shows phosphatic-rich skeletal concentrations and the highstand systems tract can be recognised in the parasequences 7, 8 and 9, which were deposited before the continental pelitic deposits of the Mata Amarilla Formation.

AB  - The goal of the study is to determine the actual areas and the geographical distribution of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) in Kyiv; compile and analyse the ratings of the city administrative districts by key UGS indicators and substantiate the level of comfortable living in each district according to the concept of a green compact city. The goal stems from the announcement of an official strategy of transforming Kyiv into a comfortable compact city with an attractive green infrastructure. To achieve this goal, we have calculated a number of major indicators of the modem green infrastructure of Kyiv in all ten city districts. According to the method we developed, we analysed the drawings of the urban development master plan and regulatory documents, and conducted a field survey of significant UGS sites in Kyiv. The data obtained were used to make a UGS map of Kyiv and other thematic maps. For the most accurate calculation of key UGS indicators, we processed several thousand contours in Kyiv's cartographic base. The sizes of Urban Protected Areas (UPA) were found separately, and their share in the total city territory and of each district (Conservation Coefficients) was determined. In so doing, UPA distribution was found to be very irregular, with a total area of 174.9 km(2), or about 21.2% of that of Ukraine's capital. We analysed the ratio of the city population and the areas of green spaces in each Kyiv district. To identify districts with a different UGS coverage, we calculated the Greenness Coefficients (GC) and compiled a rating of Kyiv districts by their level of greenness, using the Greenness Coefficients Index. Significant GC variations in different city districts were substantiated. In contrast to previous studies, we calculated the provision of Kyiv residents with green zones of not merely common usage, but also with those of all other kinds, including UPA. We also calculated the Green space provision per person and compiled ratings of Kyiv districts by the Green Space Provision Index. The results were presented on a relevant map. Based on calculating the share of protected areas in the total UGS area, we found the ratings of Kyiv districts by the Green space legally protected Index. Wherein, we found significant variations among the districts by the ratio of protected areas and green spaces deprived of any legal protection. This increases their vulnerability to projected development attempts. We calculated the Integral Green Space Index (GSI) based on processing all significant UGS indicators of Kyiv. GSI allows for an integral assessment of the condition of the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in Kyiv, and it is the key criterion of its compliance with modern requirements to an ideal compact city. Holosiivskyi District received the highest GSI rating. It is uniformly replete with UGS, which are provided for quality recreation and, at the same time, are protected by environmental legislation. Solomianskyi District received the lowest rating, and almost all the elements of its existing UGI require a cardinal optimisation. As a whole, the indicators we calculated can create an illusion of adequate provision of Kyiv with UGS. Actually, they are distributed very irregularly in the majority of districts. The results of our study are indicative of the presence of many challenging locations that require an extension of existing UGS and the development of new ones pursuant to the principles of compact city planning.
   Since UGI planning depends on the implementation of the Urban Development Master Plan, it makes sense to include the Green Space Index to the key indicators of the Kyiv Development Strategy. The draft new City General Plan should also be refined with account of the above-mentioned problems.

AB  - The article is based upon assumption that in search for best sustainability any organization is leaning towards the value-oriented approach in management. This approach is grounded in the stakeholder theory, and addresses needs and expectations of consumers and other stakeholders on a long-term basis. When contributing to the best practices, companies produce shared values, able to act as a social power, to enter into the public consciousness, and to transform into behavioural norms. At the same time, these practices support best handling of resources and opportunities thus leading companies to success.
   The system dynamics model presents enterprises with potential strategies grounded in the target indicators, provides objective assessment of the target indicators sensitivity to changes at one or several parameters, sets and corrects their controllable limits, identifies specific causes of variation and, thus, insures necessary adjustments to the business management.
   Today, the system dynamics modelling is supported with mathematical software: Maple, MathCAD, Maxima, AnyLogic, Vensim, iThink (computer experiments software).
   In our research, we support the idea to develop methodology and improve practices of value-oriented approach in organization management based upon key tools of process efficiency, i.e. the system dynamics model. To build a system model and to run simulation analysis, we used AnyLogic software system.
   In this research, system dynamics model is tested against the case of supply chain management in the food industries, which include production facilities of high seasonal demand and products distribution network.
   To meet volatile demand, the company keeps certain stock of products in the chain of regional warehouses, and shipping the products as soon as new order is received. The market conditions and customer requirements are such that if the products cannot be shipped to the customer on time, then they buy these products from other sources. the system works steadily and does not require adjustments. Minor fluctuations in demand also do not break the system's balance. The system works steadily and does not require adjustments. Minor fluctuations in demand also do not break the system's balance.
   Simulation of seasonal demand increase (40% seasonal upsurge) proved the rate of new production shifts is almost twice higher than that of demand and two times smaller than the production cycle length.
   The experiment draws us to the following conclusions. The first response to increased demand is the shrink of stocks due to the delivery delays because of the duration of production cycle. A natural reaction of the company to such sharp reduction in stocks is striving for extreme intensification in reply to the demand upsurge. This causes a multiplicative effect. Since the stocks are initially shrinking, the only way to meet such shortfall is to raise the production rate above the shipments rate. The production shall exceed the shipments rate by sufficiently in volume and time to replenish the stocks in full. The launching peak value should lag behind the moment when the demand increases. The output adjustment reaches maximum at the moment when the stocks reach its minimum. The stocks start to grow only when the output rate exceeds the shipments rate which is always with delay. The research concludes on how to assess the response of targeted strategic indicators to the changes in one or more parameters of the system dynamics model. Our conclusions also help to determine controlled variation limits of the key performance indicators and causes of variation, and hint on how to implement rational adjustments as well.
   The application of system dynamics tools in performance forecasting to better address customers and other stakeholders' expectations and needs would allow enterprises to introduce value-oriented approach in management on a long-term balanced basis and to strengthen their competitive advantages.

AB  - Introduction. - The necessary evidence of new therapies of clinical interest extends beyond clinical trials in a less controlled population and closer to clinical practice justified since several years the need of conducting observational, noninterventional studies. Observational studies must include epidemiological (quantitative observational) data to define prevalence and natural history of the target conditions. Moreover, pharmacological interventions in patients populations, selected by clinicians as per clinical judgment within the scope of the target disease will allow to generate data to complement clinical trials. Clinical trials designed to show robust data on efficacy and tolerability particularly during registration trials must be complemented by robust observational research to confirm and better describe clinical effectiveness in the target population. A noninterventional, observational trial is a study where the medicinal product(s) is (are) prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorization. The assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnosis or monitoring procedures shall be applied to the patients and epidemiological methods shall be used for the analysis of collected data. Olanzapine is a new antipsychotic therapy registered in Europe for the treatment of schizophrenia since 1996.
   Aims of the study. - The primary objective of this observational research was to study the evolution of the olanzapine dosage under naturalistic settings. Secondary objectives included patients characteristics, severity of disease, therapeutic evolution and coprescriptions, in a patient's cohort, suffering from schizophrenia, adult patients, diagnosis based on ICD-10; patients were followed during a total of 12 months.
   Design of the study. - The cohort study was conducted in France. Between the period of June 2000 and February 2001, 407 psychiatrics randomized to participate in the study had consolidated the patient's cohort.
   Results. - A total of 1810 patients were included, 1093 (60, 4%) male, 717 (39, 6%) females. Age was recorded for a total of 1802 (99, 6%) patients, mean age was 37.8 years as per inclusion criteria and patients consent according to current regulations. Patients entered in the cohort as per clinicians decision underwent a treatment with olanzapine during an outpatient's consultation or at hospitalization. More than two thirds of the patients were followed up during 12 months after onset of this treatment. Clinical outcome was assessed at three, six, nine and 12 months following cohort inclusion using the following tools: CGI, PANSS, Calgary and GAF; as per CGI 78% of the patients cohort were severely ill, the mean PANSS score was 94.1. At second month of treatment clinicians were requested to very well document any changes in olanzapine dosage as well as reasons for the dosage modifications and potential coprescriptions.
   Discussion. - The daily mean dosage of olanzapine was 9.5 mg at initiation of treatment, 10.5 mg after one month and 11.2 mg after 12 months of follow-up. The increase of the dosage after one month was associated with factors such as younger age, schizophrenia diagnosis and severity of the symptoms as measured by CGI and PANSS scores evolution, low initial dosage and hospitalization at treatment initiation. Within the 1810 participants included in the cohort, 1383 (76.5%) received a coprescrition of a psychotropic, for example, 811 (44.8%) a benzodiazepine, 506 (28.0%) an antidepressant. Among the patients cohort that were followed during 12 months, all the clinical and patient-functioning indicators progressed in the direction of a significant improvement.

AB  - The nonlinear dynamical analysis of biomedical signals has always been the research focus in academic fields. It better uncovers the essential rules in life activities than conventional linear and time-frequency analysis methods. Human body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is non-stationary and frequency-varying by nature, which belongs to a typical nonlinear signal. Therefore, traditional linear analysis methods cannot completely disclose its nonlinear nature. The existing nonlinear dynamic tools, such as correlation dimension (D-2), Lyapunov exponent, entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis, multifractal singularity spectrum etc., have already been applied to the studies on heart electrical signals, which proved that this signal has definite chaotic characteristic. The aforementioned nonlinear methods perform better in the analysis of deterministic stochastic signals.
   In our viewpoints, because all the probabilities in the original data set can be exactly expressed by the corresponding points in the multifractal singularity spectrum f(alpha), the area of the spectrum must comprise the total information of the data. This two-dimensional expression is more accurate than the computation of spectral width Delta alpha in analyzing the heartbeat signal. With regard to ECG time series, the areas of singularity spectrum should include all the information about the heartbeat dynamics. Considering the irregularity and anisotropy of the heartbeat electrical signal propagation, we investigated the arithmetic mean and dispersing degree of the area calculated from synchronous 12-lead ECG signals obtained from a large number of subjects, who were under different physiological and pathological conditions. The 12-lead ECG records were obtained from 12 sensors positioned on body surfaces, including the limb and chest leads. In addition, the ECG signals were in high frequency section (HFECG), whose frequency components were above 100 Hz (approximately 100 Hz-2 kHz). Some early heart diseases can first be reflected by high-frequency ECG signals, which are often associated with sharp notches and slurs in the time domain. Furthermore, we set sampling frequency of HFECG signal to 1 kHz so that all the components below 500 Hz could be analyzed according to the sampling theorem. Thereafter, by the virtue of the multifractal theory, we investigated the arithmetic mean and dispersing degree computed from singularity spectrum area of synchronous 12-lead ECG signals obtained from different crowds of human subjects. Variance analysis tests revealed all 12-lead ECG signals from above cohorts were statistically identifiable using these two indicators. The experimental results suggest that the arithmetic mean of the area of the 12-lead ECG signals was apparently large for healthy young but small for myocardial infarction (MI) sufferers. Besides, the dispersing degree of the area of the 12-lead ECG signals was obviously small for healthy young but large for MI sufferers. For the other cohorts, such as ischemia sufferers and healthy elderly, these two values were of middle magnitudes. This indicates that with deeper lesions, the fractal-like structure of the heartbeat system is damaged or structurally changed, which may lead to decline in the nonlinear complexity of the system and concomitant increase in the irregularity and anisotropic propagation of ECG signal. In addition, we found that the 12-lead mean value of singularity spectrum area of human ECG signals can reflect the self-discipline control status of human autonomic nerve to some degree. This value gradually decreased with aging. These findings suggest that the self-discipline control of the human autonomic nervous system weakens with aging. The nonlinear complexity of ECG signal then descends and tends to turn from multifractality to monofractality, implying weakened human individual adaptabilities. Our studies on the nonlinear dynamical features of heart electrical signals and ECG variations with age, disease, and human autonomic nerve control, demonstrate theoretical and diagnostic significances.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of the article is to develop scenarios of consumption of the main types of organic livestock products in Ukraine. These scenarios should include the creation of an effective institutional environment aimed not only at strict quality control, but also at stimulating the modernization of production, the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies and genetic technologies for the production of safe products.
   Methodology / approach. The methodological basis of the study is an integrated (systemic) approach, which allows forecasting more accurately the reproduction of the processes of quality supply of organic livestock products, taking into account the factors that affect it. Methodological aspects of calculations in forecasting the capacity of new segments of the organic market (which replace the market segments of traditional or mass products) are based on criteria of rational consumption, taking into account the influence of such factors: potential of organic livestock production in Ukraine, number of households (consumers), income of households (consumers), differentiation of household incomes (consumers), prices for organic livestock products, prices for livestock products originating from the traditional (mass) sector, consumer confidence in the quality assurance system for livestock products (including state quality control systems), consumer confidence in the organic certification system of livestock products.
   Results. The main factors influencing the consumption of organic livestock products in Ukraine are identified, among which the main ones are the price and quality of products. The reasons of low rates of production of livestock products development with protected geographical names and organic products in Ukraine are described. In particular, it is substantiated that due to the high cost, complexity of production technologies, high cost of certification, the long transition period to organic production, the production of organic livestock products does not reach potential.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The forecasting of the capacity of the organic sector is made under the conditions of partial or complex implementation of measures aimed at improving the quality of livestock products with the definition of inertial, innovative and systemic scenarios. The authors identified the system scenario as a priority. According to the systemic variant in Ukraine for the period up to 2025 the forecasted capacity of the internal market for organic meat and meat products (in terms of meat) will amount to 3.26 bln UAH; organic milk, dairy products and butter (in terms of milk) will amount to 2.65 bln UAH; organic eggs will amount to 0.47 bln UAH. In general, the market potential capacity of the main types of organic livestock products (at prices in 2019) will be 6.38 bln UAH (0.2 bln Euro) or 151.9 UAH (4.9 Euro) per one person. This is much less than the current European figure of 50 euros per person. In the potential consumer market, the share of organic livestock products in accordance with the systemic version of the solution of the quality problem will be from 1.6 % (meat and meat products) and 1.5 % (milk and dairy products) to 2.3 % (eggs), which is much lower than European indicators.
   Practical value / implications. Scenario forecasting of the dynamics of potential demand for organic livestock products allows understanding the pace of development of the domestic market of organic products, justification of measures and tools to stimulate domestic organic production, determining the impact of these measures on the capacity of the organic market. Otherwise, a significant market share of organic livestock products and food products of animal origin, including milk and dairy products, will be filled by imported products of European producers. The authors identified as a priority systemic scenario for the development of consumption of the main types of organic livestock products in Ukraine.

AB  - Common carp (Qyprinus carpio), black bass (Micropterus spp.), and channel catfish (Ictalurus 1)unctatus) were collected frorn 14 sites in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) to document spatial trends in accumulative contaminants, health indicators, and reproductive biomarkers. Organochlorine residues, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin- like activity (TCDD-EQ), and elemental contaminants were measured in composite samples of whole fish, grouped by species and gender, from each site. Selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish were elevated throughout the CRB, and pesticide concentrations were greatest in fish from agricultural areas in the Lower Colorado River and Gila River. Selenium concentrations exceeded toxicity thresholds for fish (> 1.0 mu g/g ww) at all CRB sites except the Gila River at Hayden, Arizona. Mercury concentrations were elevated (>0.1 mu g/g ww) in fish from the Yampa River at Lay, Colorado; the Green River at Ouray National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Utah and San Rafael, Utah; the San Juan River at Hogback Diversion, New Mexico; and the Colorado River at Gold Bar Canyon, Utah, Needles, California, and Imperial Dam, Arizona. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE were relatively high in fish from the Gila River at Arlington, Arizona (> 1.0 mu g/g ww) and Phoenix, Arizona (>0.5 mu g/g ww). Concentrations of other formerly used pesticides including toxaphene, total chlordanes, and dieldrin were also greatest at these two sites but did not exceed toxicity thresholds. Currently used pesticides such as Dacthal, endosulfan, gamma-HCH, and methoxychlor were also greatest in fish from the Gila River downstream of Phoenix. Total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; > 0.11 mu g/g ww) and TCDD-EQs (> 5 mu g/g ww) exceeded wildlife guidelines in fish from the Gila River at Phoenix. Hepatic ethoxyresorufm O-deethylase (EROD) activity was also relatively high in carp from the Gila River at Phoenix and in bass from the Green River at Ouray NWR. Fish from some sites showed evidence of contaminant exposure as indicated by fish health indicators and reproductive biomarker results. Multiple health indicators including altered body and organ weights and high health assessment index scores may be associated with elevated Se concentrations in fish from the Colorado River at Loma, Colorado and Needles. Although grossly visible external or internal lesions were found on most fish from some sites, histopathological analysis determined many of these to be inflammatory responses associated with parasites. Edema, exophthalmos, and cataracts were noted in fish from sites with elevated Se concentrations. Intersex fish were found at seven of 14 sites and included smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu), largemouth bass (M. salmoides), catfish, and carp and may indicate exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds. A high proportion of smallmouth bass from the Yampa River at Lay (70%) was intersex but the cause of this condition is unknown. Male carp, bass, and catfish with low concentrations of vitellogenin were common in the CRB. Comparatively high vitellogenin concentrations (> 0.2 mg/mL) were measured in rnale bass from the Green River at Ouray NWR and the Colorado River at Imperial Dam and indicate exposure to estrogenic or anti-androgenic chemicals. Anomalous reproductive biomarkers including low GSI and gonadal abnormalities (calcifications, edema, and parasites) observed in fish downstream of Phoenix are likely related to the poor water-quality of the Gila River in this area.

AB  - Megacities present both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. This ambiguous role has prompted a scientific attention in recent years in three directions and lines of interest. A first line takes a phenomenological perspective on the 'dramatic' reality, i.e., the tremendous problems and sustainability deficits that megacities and their population face. A second interest focuses on the emerging and changing functions of large urban agglomerations and their role in national and global economic, political and social networks. A third interest seeks to understand megacities from the point of systems dynamics and their relation with sustainability, risk and urban governance as related fields. This article is written to encourage further debate particularly in relation to the third line of interest. It departs from the proposition that the extreme size, change dynamics and complexity of megacities require novel research efforts for providing orientation and implementation knowledge for current and future sustainability. It presents an integrative research approach of the Risk Habitat Megacity (RHM) research initiative applied to the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile. This approach firstly analyses current levels of sustainability on the basis of a complementary indicator set for the case of the metropolitan region in general and, more specifically, for the current sustainability performance in a quite comprehensive range of fields or sectors, including transportation, land use, energy, water resources and services, waste, air quality, and processes of socialspatial differentiation. The integrative sustainability concept of the Helmholtz Association that guides this analysis consists of a set of rules that describe minimum conditions for sustainable development that ought to be guaranteed for all human beings living in present and future generations. This framework permits the application to different contexts and serves as a tool to make explicit current sustainability performance and to develop normative targets on desirable sustainability levels. Based on the historic trends and the current sustainability situation, the approach secondly performs a scenario analysis of 'likely' development paths and futures for a set of scenario alternatives. The explorative scenario framework contains the identification of a set of forces that drive the development of the entire metropolitan region and, again, their influence on likely alternative trends in particular aspects of the fields and sectors included in the analysis. Beside illustrating the analytical approach and its methodology, the article also highlights initial results of the ongoing work. With respect to current sustainability performance in the case study region, the analysis at the general level of the metropolitan region reveals for example contrasting trends with positive sustainability performance on indicators relating mainly to economic and ( to some extent) social development ( e. g. poverty, child mortality) and rather negative trends with respect to environmental quality ( e. g. energy use, CO 2 emissions). The discussion likewise takes a closer look at the specific sustainability performance of two of the included fields or sectors: water resources and services, and processes of socio-spatial differentiation. Building on the current situation, the paper moves on to illustrate some results of the scenario analyses.
   Using the example of social-spatial differentiation processes, it examines the future trends in housing construction and its relationship wth segregation patterns for each of the scenario alternatives. Regarding the water sector, it sheds light on the access to drinking water and sanitation as well as on the storm water discharge situation, and it reflects the future water resource availability considering existing knowledge about regional climate change impacts. A final section discusses some of the insights and lessons learnt from the application of the approach which hopefully prove inspiring for similarly comprehensive research efforts that focus on megacities.

AB  - In the context of globalization, the development of foreign trade, the simplification of customs formalities, the strengthening of economic relations with the EU and other countries of the world are priorities of the foreign economic policy of most countries of the world. At the same time, the priority is to ensure national security, in particular, such components as economic, including customs, environmental security, protection of interests of public and private persons, domestic producers, compliance with the requirements of international pacts, other instruments ratified by a particular state. In this regard, particular attention is given today to the problems of international trade liberalization through customs policy instruments, in accordance with the International Convention (Kyoto Convention) on the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures dated 18 May 1973, the provisions of which concern cooperation with authorities, customs services, including those in the field of counteraction to customs offenses, which include any violation of customs legislation (Kyoto Convention, 1973). The key to the development of states' social security is the stability of receiving revenues to the budgets of all levels, which are paid by taxpayers in accordance with certain regulations on the basis of voluntariness. Despite the recognition of the urgent task of establishing close interaction and activation of common efforts to counter violations in this area, it is quite difficult to harmonize the provisions of current legal acts in the EU countries regarding the definition of such concepts as "smuggling", "counterfeit", etc. as a variety of offenses in the customs field, establishing the consequences and the main measures of responsibility for their commission. According to a study by Frontier Economics, each year, the counterfeit costs the G20 countries 2.5 million jobs and about $ 120 billion in lost taxes and increased costs of crime, the cost of treatment and death costs resulting from the use of dangerous counterfeit goods (Iliupolu, 2017). The urgency of detecting offenses in the customs field, the use of the most effective tools aimed at preventing their spread, stopping and preventing negative consequences can hardly be denied. At the same time, the quality of such instruments is characterized, on the one hand, by the indicators of securing the expected budgetary revenues, which will allow the implementation of the approved Government programs for social protection of the population, on the other the maximum focus on maintaining positive gains in forming a favorable business climate, the possibility of continuation by them, activities in the field of economics in the regulatory field. This research is aimed at solving this problem. Methodology. The achievement of the purpose of this publication is based on the cognitive potential of a number of philosophical, general scientific and special methods. The main method of research, given the desire to determine the directions of development of national scientific opinion on the subject of the publication, was the dialectical methods of analysis and synthesis, the comparative-legal method allowed to identify promising measures to counteract these offenses, taking into account the experience of highly developed EU countries.
   Methods of grammatical consideration and interpretation of legal norms contributed to the identification of gaps and other shortcomings of the legislation governing the grounds and the procedure for bringing to justice the perpetrators of them, to develop proposals for its improvement. Practical implications. Experience of formation and development of quality assurance of legal institutions defining the principles of activity of subjects of the national security system is connected with the clarity of determining the consequences of offenses including, in the customs sphere, activation of means of their neutralization with the use of justifiable coercion, to the extent corresponding to public the dangers and consequences of such an offense.

AB  - Sewage from the meat processing industry present a potential risk to the water environment, due to the presence of many pathogenic microorganisms, including Listeria monocytogenes. Contamination of untreated sewage with those bacteria is high, which is expressed by the percentage of positive samples reaching up to 93%. The aim of the study was to determine the elimination rate of three chosen strains of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111; ATCC 19114 and ATCC 19115 in meat processing post-production sewage at temperatures 4 and 20 degrees C. Experiments were conducted according to the standard of EN ISO 11290-2:1998/A1:2004. At the beginning of the experiment, in sewage samples stored at 4 degrees C the number of cells of L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111 was amounted to 1.5.10(8) cfu/ml, the number of ATCC 19114 was 2.5.10(8) cfu/ml, however the number of ATCC 19115 was 7.5.10(7) cfu/ml. In the initial period of the study, i.e. for the first 4 weeks, a slight decrease by one logarithmic unit of the L. monocytogenes cells number was observed in the first two strains, whereas of the strain ATCC 19115 by two units. In the 11th week of the study there was a marked decrease in the number of indicator bacteria to a level of 10(1) cfu in 1 ml of sewage. In the next week of the experiment, no cells of L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111 or ATCC 19115 were noticed in the sewage, whereas bacteria of the strain ATCC 19114 were inactivated first in the 14th week of the study. In the temperature of 4 degrees C it was shown, that the weekly elimination rate of bacteria L. monocytogenes derived from sewage ranged from 0.66 (ATCC 19114) to 0.81 (ATCC 19111) log cfu/ml. Cells of the strain ATCC 19115 expired at a rate of 0.74 log cfu/week. In sewage stored at 20 degrees C the initial number of cells of individual L.monocytogenes strains was at the same level as in sewage stored at 4 degrees C. After the first week of the experiment no rapid decrease was recorded in the number of the studied bacteria, and it ranged from 7.5.10(7) to 2.5.10(8) cfu/ml. In the strain ATCC 9111, after 4 weeks of the experiment there was a decrease in the number of bacteria by 4 logarithmic units, whereas in ATCC 19115 by 5 logarithmic units. Cells of the strain ATCC 19114 were isolated from sewage at 20 degrees C for the longest time, since in the 5th week of the study they still had a level of 1.5.10(1) cfu/ml, whereas the other two strains underwent inactivation earlier. Statistical calculations showed that weekly elimination rate of the tested bacteria at 20 degrees C was different for individual strains and amounted respectively to 2.03 log cfu (ATCC 19111), 1.86 log cfu (ATCC 19114) and 1.75 log cfu (ATCC 19115). Obtained results of the present study proved that during the experiment all the tested strains of L. monocytogenes survived shorter at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. In the presented study the theoretical maximal survival time of L. monocytogenes at 4 degrees C calculated from regression equations was the longest for the strain ATCC 19114 and amounted to 14.50 weeks (102 days), whereas cells of the two other strains, ATCC 19111 and ATCC 19115, survived definitely shorter, from 11.90 weeks (84 days) and 11.60 weeks (82 days). At 20 degrees C, the survival time of the tested strains was similar and ranged from 5.3 weeks (37 days) to 5.7 weeks (40 days).

AB  - Background: Canine Leishmaniasis (CanL) is a multisystemic and chronic inflammatory disease characterized by nonspecific clinical manifestations. In CanL, inflammatory cells and chemical mediators released in response to the parasite play a role in disease development and progression. Alterations on hematological parameters have been documented in CanL. These changes can also be assessed in relation to systemic inflammation caused by this disease. The circulating leukocyte counting, such as neutrophils, as well as the albumin level, are considered direct indicators of an inflammatory host environment. Several studies point to the use of biomarkers on the assistance in diagnosis and prognosis of several canine pathologies. The present study investigated the Neutrophils to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Albumin to Globulin Ratio (AGR), and Neutrophils to Albumin Ratio (NAR) on systemic inflammatory response induced by Canine Leishmaniasis (CanL).
   Materials, Methods & Results: For this purpose, adult dogs with confirmed diagnosis to CanL were divided into symptomatic (SD, n = 33) and asymptomatic (AD, n = 20) dogs for L. infantum and control dogs (CD, n = 20). Routine hematological and biochemical parameters were determined in blood samples using a veterinary automatic hematology and biochemical analyzers. Asymptomatic dogs (AD) had a higher number of white blood cells and neutrophils (16.48 +/- 4.93; 13.41 +/- 3.60, respectively) in relation to symptomatic dogs (SD) (13.54 +/- 5.13; 10.42 +/- 3.69, respectively) (P = 0.015 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Neutrophils to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) was higher in dogs with leishmaniasis (9.45 +/- 3.76) than in healthy dogs (3.39 +/- 1.19) (P < 0.0001). Serum total proteins (STP) and globulins increased in CanL, while albumin and AGR decreased in CanL, when compared to CD and references values to canine species. Neutrophils to Albumin Ratio (NAR) was higher in AD and SD (5.02 +/- 1.14; 4.79 +/- 1.07, respectively) when compared to CD (2.36 +/- 0.55) (P < 0.0001).
   Discussion: As reported in scientific researches, dogs with Leishmaniasis present alterations in circulating cell counts. Based on these data, we decided to expand this information using the NLR as a parameter in an attempt to better clarify the changes in these cells in CanL. We observed that NLR was increased on CanL in relation to healthy dogs, which could be a consequence of relative neutrophilia rather than lymphopenia. Neutrophils to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is a biomarker that conveys information about inflammatory conditions. An elevated NLR can reflect an upregulated innate immune response, since neutrophils are effector cells of innate immunity and are involved in several acute and chronic inflammatory processes. Albumin is an acute phase protein that is considered an immune-inflammatory biomarker, which can be found reduced systemically in progressive inflammatory response. Serum total proteins (STP) and globulins were increased in CanL. These data are already well documented in CanL, which serum globulins are mainly associated with the increase of acute phase proteins, cytokines, and increase of specific antibodies to Leishmania infantum. Our results showed neutrophilia with hypoalbuminemia in CanL. So, in an attempt to assess the relationship of these two available markers, we used NAR calculation in order to evaluate the changes induced by CanL. In this study NAR was higher in CanL when compared to control dogs. Thus, our data indicate that NLR and NAR could be used as biomarkers in veterinary medical clinics in order to assess inflammatory profile in CanL, mainly in asymptomatic dogs. These parameters obtained from routine blood tests might be useful as cost-effective, easily accessible and helpful markers in order to distinguish the inflammatory response intensity in CanL.

AB  - The study, the results of which are described in the article, is devoted to analysing and substantiating approaches to the assessment and quality assurance of tourism services, which form their competitiveness, namely factors and indicators of quality. After all, the integration and globalization of the world society determine the development of tourism as a catalyst for these global processes, and world practice has proved that tourism can be an effective way to solve many socio-economic problems. The subject of the study is the peculiarities of assessing the quality of tourist services. Methodology. The methodological basis of the work is a system of general scientific and special scientific methods, mainly, in the process of research, there are used such methods as system-analytical and dialectical methods - for the theoretical generalization of the investigated material; structural and logical method in systematizing factors and indicators of the quality of tourist services. The purpose of the article is a theoretical justification of approaches to the quality of tourist services and optimization of their quality assessment. In the research, approaches to the interpretation of the concept of quality are presented and analysed, features of services in general and tourism in particular are concentrated, and it is suggested to group and classify factors and indicators of their quality. The interpretation of the notion of quality is ambiguous, both in Ukrainian and in foreign literary sources, and depends on the point of view on this notion. In our opinion, the most thorough definition characterizes the quality of products and services as a complex feature that determines their suitability to the needs of the consumer. Taking into account the specificity of the term "service", peculiarities determining the approaches to their evaluation are studied, such a service can be considered a product dominated by intangible elements and also there are separate material components. The peculiarity of tourist services is that they provide the satisfaction of financial and intangible (spiritual) tourist needs of the person, which includes transportation services, accommodation services, and other travel services, not related to transportation and accommodation. Awareness of factors that determine quality is the starting point for improving it. We carried out an extrapolation of factors of the quality of goods, tourism services as a special type of goods, and made their classification. Quality score is a quantitative or qualitative set of specific requirements for the characteristics (properties) of an object that make it possible to implement and verify them. To determine the quality level, we have suggested a classification of quality indicators of tourism service. Conclusions. Tourist service is considered as a specific activity aimed at creating the conditions for the effective realization and use of tourism product, which is the result of the purposeful activity of the tourist enterprise.
   Factors of the quality of tourist services should be grouped according to peculiarities of their manifestation (forming, restraining and storing), and managing individual determinants (tourism potential, material base, personnel qualification, marketing research on the relevance and life cycle of services, ongoing maintenance of facilities, timely overhaul of production capacities services, measures of ecological and economic stability, introduction of standards of service and analysis of their observance, material interest personnel, using the principles of quality system) can be directed to act on the overall quality. Indicators of quality of tourist services are pointers of their quality. Establishing the optimal value of a certain quality index (according to the classification suggested in the study) and its comparison with the actual manifestation of this indicator, one can characterize the degree of conformity of the tourist service to its requirements. The latter is aimed at improving the quality of tourist services, and, indirectly, the requirements to them.

AB  - Salinization in groundwater systems can induce water-rock interaction, including the release of naturally-occurring trace elements of health significance such as radium (Ra), with possible implications for the usability of water resources in addition to the increase of dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. In general, radium mobility is limited by chemical removal mechanisms including adsorption onto clays and/or Mn and Fe oxides, exchange processes, and coprecipitation with secondary barite. In order to examine the effect of aquifer salinity gradients on the distribution of naturally-occurring Ra in fresh to saline groundwater and the relationship to water-rock interaction and Ra removal mechanisms, two contrasting systems were investigated: the shallow unconfined coastal aquifer in Agadir (southwestern Morocco) and the confined Cretaceous (Cape Fear) and Pliocene (Yorktown) aquifers of the Atlantic Coastal Plain (North Carolina, USA). Geochemical and isotopic indicators of salinity sources (e.g. cation ratios, delta O-18, delta H-2, Br-/Cl-, delta S-34-SO42-; delta O-18-SO42-) were used to identify the relative contributions of seawater and other saline waters and subsequent geochemical modification by water-rock interaction. Radium activities (Ra-224, Ra-226, Ra-228), radon-222, alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) concentrations and ratios, and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were analyzed to identify water-rock interaction processes affecting alkaline earth metals including Ra. The Morocco coastal aquifer is generally oxic, exhibits a range of salinity and water types (Cl- 163-2120 mg/L, median 932 mg/L), and exhibits Ca/Na ratios above the seawater value, typical of monovalent-divalent cation exchange (base-exchange reactions) in coastal aquifers. In contrast, the Atlantic Coastal Plain aquifers are anoxic, sulfate-reducing, cover a wider salinity range (Cl- 5-9890 mg/L, median 800 mg/L) representing a transition between Na-HCO3- and Na-Cl- waters, and exhibit Ca/Na ratios below that of modern seawater typical of reverse base-exchange reactions. Possible salinity sources in the Morocco coastal aquifer include seawater intrusion, Mesozoic evaporites, other natural saline waters, and/or wastewater, whereas the Atlantic Coastal Plain is primarily affected by old seawater present in the aquifer system. Radium activities are generally low and vary significantly within each aquifer, for example Ra-226 ranges from 1.8-27.7 mBq/L in the Morocco coastal aquifer (median 8.1 mBq/L) and 1.9-214 mBq/L in the Atlantic Coastal Plain (median 18.9 mBq/L). The highest Ra activities were observed in the most saline wells sampled in the Atlantic Coastal Plain. At total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations above an apparent threshold of similar to 5000 mg/L, radium activities increase in a generally linear fashion with salinity in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, broadly comparable to previous studies indicating a threshold range of similar to 3000-10,000 mg/L. At lower TDS concentrations, water-rock interaction processes that vary with local aquifer conditions appear to control Ra distribution rather than merely salinity. In the Morocco coastal aquifer, adsorption of Ra and coprecipitation with secondary barite are apparently favorable to control Ra levels in groundwater.
   Radium removal in the anoxic Atlantic Coastal Plain aquifers appears to be associated with adsorption and/or exchange processes, with the additional possibility of barite precipitation in the Cape Fear aquifer indicated by barite saturation. Overall, the locally-variable factors that can control Ra sources and mobility in fresh to brackish groundwater at near-neutral pH include variation in solid-phase radioactivity, redox state affecting adsorption sites, availability of competing divalent cations, and barite saturation.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the role of different plant covers on brown soil profile development changing SUM stability in the epipedons. In particular, two brown soils (Eutric Cambisols), located in Monghidoro at the Italian Apennines, were analysed in order to test the hypothesis that plant cover affects the brown soil profile development under eutric qualifier changing SUM stability and soil pH. Also we verified if soil biochemical activities and microbial biomass size could be promoted by factors supporting Eutric Cambisols development. The two soil profiles were formed under coniferous (M-con) and beech cover (M-beech), respectively: both of, them had similar lithology, morphology, exposition, slope and elevation. The development of soil profiles was evaluated by the determination of their physical, chemical and biochemical properties, while SUM stability of the epipedons was assessed through the determination of some properties of humic substances by thermal (TG-DSC) and spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis, humification indexes and eco-physiological indicators such as microbial quotient (C-mic:C-org) and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)).
   The C-org content decreased along both soil profiles. The epipedon of M-beech, soil was richer in SUM that in turn showed a higher level of humification than M-con. The pH value. CEC and the concentrations of all earth-alkaline cations were also higher in M-beech than in M-con soil profile. Differences in soil reaction and SOM quality seemed to affect weathering process, since the content of all Al forms (amorphous-Alo, crystalline-Ald and linked to SOM Alp) increased as the soil pH decreased, and the Fe forms increased as the humification level of SOM increased. Nevertheless, the active iron ratio (Feo/Fed) calculated in the two soil profiles did not highlight significant differences between them in terms of podzolitation intensity. The activity of hydrolytic enzymes (beta-glucosidase, cellulase and chitinase) was higher in M-beech soil than in M-con soil profile. The activity of all enzymes, on mass basis, decreased along both soil profiles, while the specific activity (per unit of organic carbon), increased only in the endopedons of M-beech. Although biochemical properties were not correlated with physical and chemical properties of soil profile, significant correlations were observed between enzyme activity and the soil organic carbon or nitrogen content. As far as the epipedons SOM quality is concerned, the content of humified C, the microbial biomass carbon (C-mic), as well as the C-mic: C-org were higher in M-beech than in M-con, whereas the qCO(2) was lower in M-beech than in M-con. Also the FTIR and TG-DSC analysis showed differences on HAs and FAs hydrophilic character and thermal stability between epipedons of M-beech and The SUM quality of epipendon under coniferous resulted in a more recalcitrant and hydrophobic composition than that of epipedon under beech.
   In conclusion the type of plant cover (coniferous vs. beech-tree) affected the weathering of the pedogenetic substrate changing the SUM properties and soil pH. Even if the beech-tree cover promoted SUM accumulation in soil profile, which represented the organic substrates for microbial biochemical activities, the weathering of soil under coniferous appeared more marked than beech-trees covered soil. Consequently, soil biochemical activity of microbial biomass along soil profile was not promoted by factors supporting weathering processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objective. In the OMNIITOX project 11 partners have the common objective to improve environmental management tools for the assessment of (eco)toxicological impacts. The detergent case study aims at: i) comparing three Procter & Gamble laundry detergent forms (Regular Powder-RP, Compact Powder-CP and Compact Liquid-CL) regarding their potential impacts on aquatic ecotoxicity, ii) providing insights into the differences between various Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods with respect to data needs and results and iii) comparing the results from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with results from an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA).
   Material and Methods. The LCIA has been conducted with EDIP97 (chronic aquatic ecotoxicity) [1], USES-LCA (freshwater and marine water aquatic ecotoxicity, sometimes referred to as CML2001) [2, 3] and IMPACT 2002 (covering freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity) [4]. The comparative product ERA is based on the EU Ecolabel approach for detergents [5] and FUSES [6], which is based on the Technical Guidance Document (TGD) of the EU on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of chemicals [7]. Apart from the Eco-label approach, all calculations are based on the same set of physico-chemical and toxicological effect data to enable a better comparison of the methodological differences. For the same reason, the system boundaries were kept the same in all cases, focusing on emissions into water at the disposal stage.
   Results and Discussion. Significant differences between the LCIA methods with respect to data needs and results were identified. Most LCIA methods for freshwater ecotoxicity and the ERA see the compact and regular powders as similar, followed by compact liquid. IMPACT 2002 (for freshwater) suggests the liquid is equally as good as the compact powder, while the regular powder comes out worse by a factor of 2. USES-LCA for marine water shows a very different picture seeing the compact liquid as the clear winner over the powders, with the regular powder the least favourable option. Even the LCIA methods which result in the same product ranking, e.g. EDIP97 chronic aquatic ecotoxicity and USES-LCA freshwater ecotoxicity, significantly differ in terms of most contributing substances. Whereas, according to IMPACT 2002 and USES-LCA marine water, results are entirely dominated by inorganic substances, the other LCIA methods and the ERA assign a key role to surfactants. Deviating results are mainly due to differences in the fate and exposure modelling and, to a lesser extent, to differences in the toxicological effect calculations. Only IMPACT 2002 calculates the effects based on a mean value approach, whereas all other LCIA methods and the ERA tend to prefer a PNEC-based approach. In a comparative context like LCA the OMNIITOX project has taken the decision for a combined mean and PNEC-based approach, as it better represents the 'average' toxicity while still taking into account more sensitive species. However, the main reason for deviating results remains in the calculation of the residence time of emissions in the water compartments.
   Conclusion and Outlook. The situation that different LCIA methods result in different answers to the question concerning which detergent type is to be preferred regarding the impact category aquatic ecotoxicity is not satisfactory, unless explicit reasons for the differences are identifiable. This can hamper practical decision support, as LCA practitioners usually will not be in a position to choose the 'right' LCIA method for their specific case. This puts a challenge to the entire OMNIITOX project to develop a method, which finds common ground regarding fate, exposure and effect modelling to overcome the current situation of diverging results and to reflect most realistic conditions.

AB  - The mixing zone between the Danube and the Black Sea was investigated at the front of the Chilia and Sulina branches of the Danube delta, in April-May 1997, during two periods corresponding to conditions at the end of winter (Chilia and Sulina branches) and the beginning of spring (Sulina branch). The distribution of the organic matter in the particulate, colloidal and truly dissolved pools along the salinity gradient was characterized at both global and molecular levels using biochemical parameters. The distribution of particulate organic carbon (POC) paralleled that of total suspended matter in winter, whereas decoupling was observed in spring, reflecting active biological mechanisms in the mixing zone off the Sulina branch during this period. This is supported by distribution patterns of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and branched fatty acids (BrFA), which are indicators of phytoplankton and bacteria activities, respectively. The delta(13)C isotopic signature of POC in the Danube-Black Sea mixing zone varied of between -29.1 and -24.6parts per thousand, which is consistent with the usual temperate range of estuarine systems. In spring, the observed shift towards lower values in the area of salinity 0-5 suggested a gradual change in the composition of POC, such as that caused by cell lysis of riverine planktonic populations induced by a salinity increase. A subsequent increase of delta(13)C values towards higher salinities indicated phytoplankton growth in the estuarine/marine zone, as assessed by high concentrations of PUFA. Indirect evidence of sedimentation of terrestrial particles in the upper part of the salinity gradient in the range of 2-3 was suggested by the decrease of die content of particles and POC in fatty acids (C(24)-C(32)) and n-alkanes (C(25)-C(35)), both constituents of cuticular waxes of higher plants. A tight coupling was suggested between phytoplankton and bacteria by similar distributions of PUFA and BrFA along the salinity gradient. The distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied according to the season. In spring, the DOC concentrations remained constant across the salinity gradient in front of the Sulina branch at about 2.7 mg 1(-1), whereas higher concentrations, >4 mg 1(-1), were observed in winter at stations located in the low salinity (2-4 and 5-8) area. A few data were obtained for delta(13)C of the DOC pool, with an average of -26.9%. in the Danube River end-member and values close to those of POC off the various branches. The low molecular weight (LMW) fraction of DOC isolated from water by sequential cross-filtration was evaluated by summing the pool of the combined and free amino acids and that of the combined and free carbohydrates. The distribution of LMW DOC along the salinity gradient was similar in the three investigated areas. Off the Sulina branch, proportions of LMW DOC fluctuated between 17 and 37parts per thousand in winter and between 23 and 35parts per thousand in spring. Two zones of high LMW DOC were located in two ranges of salinity-between 2 and 4 and between 5 and 8-probably originating from the release of decaying diatoms, assessed by high molecular proportions of serine in the combined amino acids. LMW DOC indicated a high potential for microbal activity, as shown by concomitant distributions of branched fatty acids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight a not yet recognized hazard for mass failure (landslides) of contaminated soils into rivers and to provide an understanding of important interactions of such events. A first effort to investigate the problem is made focusing on the south eastern part of the Gota A"lv river valley, in Sweden, by combining geographical information on potentially contaminated sites with slope stability levels on maps. The objectives of this study were to: (1) Review current Swedish risk assessment methodologies for contaminated areas and landslides, and analyze their capability to quantify the risk of contaminated areas being subject to landslides. (2) Investigate the presence of contaminated areas at landslide risk along the Gota A"lv river valley. (3) Provide an overview of the national methods for landslide risk analysis and for environmental risk classification, followed by a comparison between the methods and the results from the superposition of the two methods for the study site. (4) Make a first attempt to conceptualize the release and transport mechanisms.
   Environmental risk assessment data of the study site was combined with data on slope stability levels. Conceptual issues of the release and transport scenario were identified and a first conceptual model was created.
   Of 31 potentially contaminated sites, eight had moderate to high probability for landslide, and of these eight sites, five were classified as having a high or very high environmental risk. These findings had not been revealed when the data had only been considered separately. The 'actual' risk could hence be even higher than the highest environmental risk class actually suggests. By visualizing results from the landslide risk analysis with the results from the environmental risk classification of contaminated sites, a better understanding of the potential hazard involved is obtained.
   The release mechanisms as a result of a landslide into surface water were conceptualized using two time scales: the instantaneous and the long-term release. It is clear that the Swedish method for landslide risk assessment and for environmental risk assessment of contaminated soil considers hazard events that are characterized by different time scales. The method for landslide risk assessment addresses events that are rapid (occurring over minutes) with instantaneous impact and consequences. Measurements are made within a short time after the event (days to months). The environmental risk assessment is done with respect to events that are slowly evolving (over years or decades) and any possible consequence materializes after a long period of time.
   The combined data provided a more solid basis for decisions; however, inherent difficulties when combining data based on different methods were revealed. Separate assessment methodologies executed by different authorities may lead to incorrect assessments and inappropriate protective measures.
   The effects and the consequences of landslides in areas with contaminated soil need to be further investigated. The climate change expected to occur over the next hundred years will increase the probability of slope failures, such as landslides, in many parts of the world where the precipitation is predicted to increase (e.g., in Scandinavia). This will accentuate the need for methods and models to assess the impact of such events. In order to achieve established environmental quality objectives there is an urgent need for models and assessment principles (criteria) for contaminated areas that are at risk of experiencing slope failure. Knowledge of the governing processes that control the release and transport of substances under a variety of conditions, taking into account characteristic spatial and temporal scales, is required.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Sustainability is a well recognised goal which is difficult to manage due to its complexity. As part of a series of sustainability management tools, a Product Sustainability Index (PSI) is translating the sustainability aspects to the organization of vehicle product development of Ford of Europe, thus allocating ownership and responsibility to that function. PSI is limiting the scope to those key environmental, social and economic characteristics of passenger vehicles that are controllable by the product development organisation.
   Materials and Methods. The PSI considers environmental, economic and social aspects based on externally reviewed life cycle environmental and cost aspects (Life Cycle Assessment, Cost of ownership / Life Cycle Costing), externally certified aspects (allergy-tested interior) and related aspects as sustainable materials, safety, mobility capability and noise. After the kick-off of their product development in 2002, the new Ford S-MAX and Ford Galaxy are serving as a pilot for this tool. These products are launched in Europe in 2006. The tracking of PSI performance has been done by engineers of the Vehicle Integration department within the product development organization. The method has been translated in an easy spreadsheet tool. Engineers have been trained within one hour trainings. The application of PSI by vehicle integration followed the principle to reduce the need for any incremental time or additional data to a minimum. PSI is adopted to the existing decision-making process. End of 2005, an internal expert conducted a Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) study for verification purposes using commercial software. This study and the PSI have been scrutinized by an external review panel according to ISO 14040 and, by taking into consideration the on-going SETAC, work in the field of LCC.
   Results. The results of the Life Cycle based indicators of PSI as calculated by non-experts are fully in line with those of the more detailed expert study. The difference is below 2%. The new Ford Galaxy and Ford S-MAX shows significantly improved performance regarding the life cycle air quality, use of sustainable materials, restricted substances and safety compared to the previous model Galaxy. The affordability (Life Cycle Cost of Ownership) has also been improved when looking at the same engine types. Looking at gasoline versus diesel options, the detailed study shows under what conditions the diesel options are environmentally preferable and less costly (mileage, fuel prices, etc.).
   Discussion. The robustness of results has been verified in various ways. Based also on Sensitivity and Monte-Carlo Analysis, case study-specific requirements have been deduced defining criteria for a significant environmental improvement between the various vehicles. Only if the differences of LCIA results between two vehicles are larger than a certain threshold are the above-mentioned results robust. Conclusions. In general terms, an approach has been implemented and externally reviewed that allows non-experts to manage key environmental, social and economic aspects in the product development, also on a vehicle level. This allows mainstream functions to take ownership of sustainability and assigns accountability to those who can really decide on changes affecting the sustainability performance. In the case of Ford S-MAX and Galaxy, indicators from all three dimensions of sustainability (environment, social and economic) have been improved compared to the old Ford Galaxy.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Based on this positive experience, it is recommended to make, in large or multinational organizations, the core business functions directly responsible and accountable for managing their own part of environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainability. Staff functions should be limited to starting the process with methodological and training support and making sure that the contributions of the different main functions fit together.

AB  - Background: Dairy cows are exposed to numerous environmental hazards, such as heavy metals. Milk and dairy products could be harmful to humans when maximum tolerable amounts of heavy metals are exceeded. Analysis of heavy metals in milk is important because milk is a source of essential nutrients and is an indicator of environmental contamination. Some heavy metals are essential to maintain proper metabolic activity in living organisms, but at exceeded levels they could be toxic to living organisms. The main objective of the present study was to determine the residue levels of ten heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in cow milk in Serbia.
   Materials, Methods & Results: The experiment was conducted at three farms at Vojvodina district, Serbia. Cows from all three farms were on pasture during spring and summer time. Randomly 50 cows from each farm were taken for this experiment. The cows have similar body condition score they were in their third or fourth lactation and gave approximately the same amount of milk in the previous lactation. Total 150 milk samples were collected from cows during the morning milking, in the period between April to May in 2016. All 150 milk samples were transported to laboratory as soon as possible and analyzed for the heavy metals. Heavy metals were analyzed by Inductance coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry. Data are presented as mean values +/- sd. Statistical analysis was done by one way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. The highest average concentration in cow milk was determined for Iron (283.9 mg/kg), then for Zinc (60.21 mg/kg) and Copper (4.404 mg/kg), while the lowest concentration was for Cobalt and Lead (less than 0.005 mg/kg).
   Discussion: Bioaccumulation is one of the biggest problems with heavy metals. Heavy metals residues in milk can be very dangerous for the calves and humans as well. The existence of trace elements and heavy metals in dairy products and milk has been recorded in various countries since it is considered as one of the most dangerous aspects of food contamination. The presence of heavy metals in cow's milk may be attributed to contamination due to exposure of lactating cow to environmental pollution or consumption of contaminated feeding stuffs and water. Heavy metals after intake in cow organism distributed to all organs and glands such as udder. By that, secretory udder tissue gets intoxicated with heavy metals and after that they can be found in milk. After analyses the results in this experiment the highest average concentration of Fe in cow milk it might be because cows were fed with hay from pasture rich in iron between April to May. Some researchers found the amounts of Cu in the milk of individual varied from 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg. Contrary to this finding, in current study the average value of Cu in cow milk was 4.404 mg/kg. It is found that the highest concentration of Zn in cow milk is 10.75 mg/kg, lower compare to result in current study (60.21 mg/kg). Arsenic (As) concentration was 0.058 mg/kg, cadmium (Cd) was 0.01 mg/kg, cobalt (Co) was 0.002 mg/kg, chrome (Cr) was 0.018 mg/kg, manganese (Mn) was 0.493 mg/kg, nickel (Ni) was 0.119 mg/kg and lead (Pb) was 0.08 mg/kg what is just above recommended values by International Dairy Federation. The results showed that most of the milk samples from the different farm contained all the studied metals with concentration higher than those recommended by International Dairy Federation and Codex for cow milk.

AB  - At the beginning of the 21st century, most subjects of international economic relations announced a course to liberalize the world economy both as a whole and as its individual components. At the same time, under the influence of geopolitical and geo-economic aspirations, state instruments of a protectionist nature were increasingly used. Global economic development has become a hostage to such processes. In such circumstances, the efficiency of individual business entities has begun to decline. Innovative tools were needed to prevent this. One of them was economic diplomacy, which has acquired a special role in providing the promotion of the interests of both national economies as a whole and their individual subjects. At the same time, economic diplomacy itself covers different areas of economic activity and not all of them are investigated to the same extent. The purpose of the article is to study and analyze the financial component of economic diplomacy in modern conditions, the specifics of its formation and development, aimed at improving the national system of promoting national interests both within the state and abroad. To achieve this goal, the research is focused on the following tasks: to consider and analyze the theoretical basis of the financial component of economic diplomacy, to highlight its manifestations in various forms of international economic relations, to determine the main imperatives of state support for international investment partnership. Special attention is paid to the issues of external borrowing and the movement of public debt funds from the point of view of the influence of economic diplomacy on them. Based on the results of this review, a whole number of theoretical conclusions were made, which at the same time establish the basis for further research of the considered problem. Methodology. In the process of preparing the article, methods of scientific abstraction, observation, analysis and synthesis, generalization, as well as statistical and economic methods were used to assess a number of financial and economic indicators of state development in order to identify the weaknesses and prospects for the impact of economic diplomacy tools on them. The information and analytical base for the study are materials and analytical reports of international organizations dealing with the issues under consideration (UNCTAD, IMF, World Bank), regulatory and statistical data of state authorities of Ukraine and the United States, the results of scientific research of modern scientists from different countries. The results of the study show that providing the proper efficiency of foreign economic activity requires the use of a set of tools to promote and support its subjects. Economic diplomacy plays a significant role in this sphere. The development level of international economic relations actualizes the justification of the modern paradigm of the financial component, mechanisms for applying the tools of economic diplomacy in financial issues. All this requires a clear delineation and structuring of object-by-object areas and directions of efforts. Only on this basis, an effective mechanism for implementing the financial component of economic diplomacy can be formed. The practical implications of the scientific research are to find out the current state of economic diplomacy mechanisms in the financial sphere, trends in their development, and potential consequences for other states (including Ukraine). Value/originality.
   The studied mechanisms and practice of using economic diplomacy in the sphere of the financial component, in particular in issues of interstate investment partnership, external government borrowing, and work with public debt deserve attention from the relevant state structures of Ukraine on the implementation of tools and standards of economic diplomacy in this area. In addition, this study can serve as a basis for further research, since the considered problem contains the significant potential for further investigations in subsequent scientific publications.

AB  - The Introduction provides an overview of research findings related to danger and risk in the forestry profession toward other sectors through the standard indicators of safety at work on the example of the United States, Spain, Germany, Austria and other countries. On the other hand, training and periodical qualification verifying of the employee to work with the operating machinery and safe working practice are emphasized as an essential element in the process of improving the quality of work and safety in operational forestry. In addition, trends and changes in the education and training of human resources in forestry in general and the role of vocational training of forest workers in the prevention of injury and increase operational safety levels at work are cited.
   The subtitle material and method provides the most relevant sources that are used as the basis for drafting paper, such as, a document entitled Professions and Training in Forestry - results of an inquiry in Europe and North America, Eduforest International internet platform and internet platform of the European Forestry and Environmental Skills Council. Also, for the purpose of the paper forming the application of analysis and synthesis, comparison and compilation methods is explained.
   The third subtitle displays situation analysis of workers vocational training in forestry sector within which the Copenhagen Declaration is highlighted, which advocates strengthening and popularization of vocational education and training.
   Networks and programs in the field of forestry training within Europe are listed in the Table 1., and more detailed analysis of registered educational institutions in the Eduforest network basis and the results of the analysis are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Heading 3.1 clarifies the role of vocational training of workers in forestry. In addition, a positive step of vocational training of workers in forestry at European level is highlighted through the establishment of the European Forestry and Environmental Skills Council whose mission is to simplify the mobility of workers in forestry and arboriculture within the EU through processes of accreditation and promotion of individual national qualifications between the partner countries at European level. Current condition on vocational training for chainsaw operator in the forestry of Croatia are explained insubtitle 3.2. Inconsistent and incomplete programs and training activities, a significant reduction, or the absence of practical training and the use of non-transparent criteria in the carried out training assessment are cited as the biggest problem. Subtitle 3.3 clarifies the role and contribution of the European Forestry and Environmental Skills Council in the training of workers. The subtitle lists the criteria for acquiring the status of a national center / agency prescribed by EFESC Handbook, and the list of national agencies accredited by the EFESC in Table 2. The logo of the European Forestry and Environmental Skills Council is presented in Figure 4. Implementation of the European Chainsaw Standard is explained in the text and four levels of European Chainsaw Standards are presented in Figure 6. Figure 7 displays German example of the European Chainsaw Standards implementation, and Table 3 shows the implementation of European Chainsaw Certificate within EFESC countries.
   The heading Discussion and Conclusion specify the limits of training and vocational training in the scope of forestry on the example of the dual education within the specialized institutions, namely, forestry training centers that provide comprehensive training in technical, safety and vocational aspect. In conclusion, in this paper the technical, organizational and legislative guidelines are listed for the potential implementation of the European model of certification of forest workers in the Croatian forestry with the aim of improving the current situation.

AB  - Diel migration patterns of fishes in nearshore (15-80 m depth) and offshore (>80 m) waters of Lake Superior were examined to assess the potential for diel migration to link benthic and pelagic, and nearshore and offshore habitats. In our companion article, we described three types of diel migration: diel vertical migration (DVM), diel bank migration (DBM), and no diel migration. DVM was expressed by fishes migrating from benthopelagic to pelagic positions and DBM was expressed by fishes migrating horizontally from deep to shallow waters at night. Fishes not exhibiting diel migration typically showed increased activity by moving from benthic to benthopelagic positions within demersal habitat. The distribution and biomass of fishes in Lake Superior was characterized by examining 704 bottom trawl samples collected between 2001 and 2008 from four depth zones: <= 40, 41-80, 81-160, and > 160 m. Diel migration behaviors of fishes described in our companion article were applied to estimates of areal biomass (kg ha(-1)) for each species by depth zone. The relative strength of diel migrations were assessed by applying lake area to areal biomass estimates for each species by depth zone to yield estimates of lake-wide biomass (metric tonnes). Overall, species expressing DVM accounted for 83%, DBM 6%, and non-migration 11% of the total lake-wide community biomass. In nearshore waters, species expressing DVM represented 74% of the biomass, DBM 25%, and non-migration 1%. In offshore waters, species expressing DVM represented 85%, DBM 1%, and non-migration 14% of the biomass. Of species expressing DVM, 83% of total biomass occurred in offshore waters. Similarly, 97% of biomass of non-migrators occurred in offshore waters while 83% of biomass of species expressing DBM occurred in nearshore waters. A high correlation (R-2 = 0.996) between lake area and community biomass by depth zone resulted in 81% of the lake-wide biomass occurring in offshore waters. Accentuating this nearshore-offshore trend was one of increasing estimated total areal biomass of the fish community with depth zone, which ranged from 13.71 kg ha(-1) at depths <= 40 m to 18.81 kg ha(-1) at depths > 160 m, emphasizing the importance of the offshore fish community to the lake ecosystem. The prevalence of diel migration expressed by Lake Superior fishes increases the potential of fish to link benthic and pelagic and shallow and deepwater habitats. These linkages enhance the potential for habitat coupling, a condition where habitats become interconnected and interdependent through transfers of energy and nutrients. Habitat coupling facilitates energy and nutrient flow through a lake ecosystem, thereby increasing productivity, especially in large lakes where benthic and pelagic, and nearshore and offshore habitats are often well separated. We propose that the application of biomass estimates to patterns of diel migration in fishes can serve as a useful metric for assessing the potential for habitat linkages and habitat coupling in lake ecosystems, and provide an important indicator of ecosystem health and function. The decline of native Lake Trout and ciscoes and recent declines in exotic Alewife and Rainbow Smelt populations in other Great Lakes have likely reduced the capacity for benthic-pelagic coupling in these systems compared to Lake Superior. We recommend comparing the levels and temporal changes in diel migration in other Great Lakes as a means to assess changes in the relative health and function of these ecosystems.

AB  - Financial stability is an important measure used by stakeholders to assess the financial situation of an entity concerned. Economic worries caused by internal business issues, global processes, and international economic (regional) integration may increase the entity's exposure to external factors. Financial stability considers the entity's dependence on creditors and investors, i.e. the debt-to-equity ratio. Significant liabilities that are not fully covered by the entity's own liquid funds create preconditions for bankruptcy should any large creditor demand settlement of any debts owed to it. However, borrowed funds can significantly increase the return on equity. Therefore, in analyzing financial stability, it is very important to use a system of indicators that indicate the entity's future risks and profitability.
   Financial stability is the principal objective of financial analysis. The nature and scope of such economic analysis are aimed to determine the entity's internal capacities, means, and methods for improving the entity's financial stability. Thus, financial stability is understood as the entity's guaranteed solvency and creditworthiness resulting from the effective formation, distribution, and application of financial resources in the entity's business operations. Financial stability is assessed based on the working capital to inventory ratio and debt to equity ratio.
   Business entities are independent in establishing business relationships with their contract partners; therefore, they are fully responsible for the decisions they make. The increasing importance of financial analysis for the entity's own financial situation and for its business partners is explained by the increasing demand for additional sources of business financing and the requirement to increase the productiveness of capital resources.
   Entity's financial stability analysis should not focus on the current financial activities only. It should also determine what measures should be taken on a continuous basis to maintain and improve the entity's financial situation. Both current and future stability, i.e. the entity's sustainability, must be ensured to provide conditions for state-of-the-art competitive production.
   An entity is a complex system consisting of many subsystems; therefore, a complex method must be applied to analyze its stability, i.e. using a system of financial stability indicators. Present-day diversity of financial stability indicators, including both absolute and relative indicators, makes the analysis difficult and overcomplicated, creating difficulties in combining the findings of the analysis to make conclusions about the entity's financial stability. Absolute indicators, namely equity, borrowed capital, assets, cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, profit, play an important role in the analysis of an entity's financial stability. Equally important are absolute indicators calculated in the analysis of financial statements: net assets, working capital, working capital to inventory ratio, stable liabilities. These indicators are criterial as they are used to establish the criteria used in the financial analysis.
   An entity should have a flexible structure of financial resources and, if necessary, be able to borrow funds. Therefore, another manifestation of an entity's potential financial stability is its creditworthiness, i.e., the ability to settle its payment obligations when due. Thus, an entity is considered creditworthy if it meets a certain requirement for granting a loan and is able to repay the loan when due subject to any interest accrued. This concept is closely related to the concept of financial stability and shows whether the company is able to raise funds from different sources to repay its debts. Credit analysis may predict solvency and is closely related to the analysis of solvency, financial stability and return on equity. Entity's stable operation, high profitability and working capital turnover also guarantee loan repayment to a certain degree.

AB  - Laeso is the largest island of the Kattegat-Skagerrak region and exposes a vast array of relative sealevel (RSL) indicators, mainly raised beach ridges, swales, lagoons and saltmarshes. The physical environment of continuous glacial rebound, excessive supply of sediment, shallow surrounding waters, low amplitudes of near-shore waves, and micro-tidal conditions produced numerous sealevel proxies of both barrier coasts and saltmarshes. About 1200 RSL/age index points reflect not only short-term sea-level highstands as in most other parts of Europe, but also short-term sea-level lowstands, which in less regressive environments have normally been removed by coastal erosion or obscured by berms from subsequent highstands. Based on a high-precision lidar digital terrain model, the beach ridges have been mapped, typified, levelled and correlated relative to their order of appearance. Transformation of this relative chronology to a robust absolute age model of the RSL changes has been made on the basis of 119 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) datings, C-14 datings, and tree-ring datings. By ground penetrating radar (GPR) and terrain analyses, the height of the swash zone (run-up) has been determined in order to transform the ridge elevations to a detailed curve of the RSL/age relation. The curve reveals eight centennial sea-level oscillations of 0.5-1.1 m superimposed on the general trend of the RSL curve, including a Little Ice Age lowstand of 0.6 m at 1300 AD. The island grew from now eroded landscapes of Weichselian glacio-marine deposits, including the oldest known post-Weichselian forested area in Scandinavia. During the last 4900 years new coastal landscapes have formed continuously, resulting in around 4000 km of still visible, raised palaeo-shorelines in mostly uncultivated landscapes. After formation of the oldest preserved beach-ridge complex, numerous sea-level proxies formed in a strongly regressive environment caused by glacial rebound supplemented with local uplift due to extensive erosion during Boreal and Atlantic time of the 1700 km(2) glacio-marine platform upon which the island is still being built. The combined uplift produced a relative sea-level fall of 10.3 m, corresponding to a mean vertical regression rate of 2.1 mm/year and a mean horizontal regression rate of 2 m/year, and formed eight distinct types of raised coastal landscapes where well separated beach ridges and saltmarshes developed continuously.
   The oldest preserved part of Laeso appeared 4900 years BP as the eastern tip of a 10 km long barrier-spit system growing from a raised glacio-marine landscape, now represented only by boulder reefs west and north-west of the present island. Around 4000 years BP another barrier-spit system appeared to the south, growing northwards from another raised glacio-marine landscape at the raised boulder reefs in the town of Byrum and the abrasion landscapes of Ronnerne. Around 3000 years BP these two inital barrier-spit systems united and formed one major barrier between the present towns Vestero and Byrum. To the north-east, a third glacio-marine landscape provided materials for the development of the eastern end of the island. Thus, around 2500 BP the island had become one triangular, completely detached island ('the old triangle') between Vestero, Byrum and Bansten Bakke. From this detached stage, nine subsequent barrier-spit systems grew to the east and formed the present Osterby peninsula, while a series of nine barrier-island complexes developed south-west of 'the old triangle'. To the south and south-east, low-energy coasts developed and formed low beach ridges and saltmarsh landscapes.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. In recent years, the automotive industry has been experiencing an increasing concern with environmental requirements. A particular focus, is being given to light-weighting of cars, to reducing fuel consumption and to the use of different recycling materials. Consequently, decisions on product design and development must involve economic and technological as well as environmental considerations. In adequate conditions, the LCA methodology enables one to assist an effective integration of the environmental considerations in the decision-making process [1]. In this paper, a multi-material car component which is part of the current automotive brake system, has been modified by its original manufacturer. Such a modification included the use of a new multi-material injection moulding process and the consumption of recyclable materials. The new and the current component were comparatively assessed throughout their life cycles in order to evaluate their respective environmental impacts and, thus, to verify if the new component offers a lower environmental load. The results described in this paper are part of the outcome of a broader research project involving industrial companies, university, technological centres and research institutes based in Portugal, Spain and Germany.
   Main Features. The car component under focus has four subcomponents whose base materials consist of steel and plastic. The LCA methodology is used to evaluate two scenarios describing the new car component, on the one hand, and the reference scenario, which consists of the existing car component, on the other. The former results from the selection of new subcomponents materials, aiming to use a new production process together with a recycling strategy.
   Results and Discussion. The inventory analysis shows a lower energy consumption in the alternative scenario (4.2 MJ) compared to the reference scenario (6.1 MJ). Most of that energy is still non-renewable, relating in particular to crude consumption in the car use phase and in the production phase (transports and plastics production). The life cycle inventory analysis indicates also that the alternative scenario has lower air emissions of COD CO, NOx, SOx, NM VOC and PM10, as well as lower solid wastes and water emissions of oils and BOD5. Otherwise, the water emissions of undissolved substances and COD are higher for the alternative scenario. Most of the energy consumed and the air pollutants inventoried occur as a consequence of the use phase. Otherwise, for most of the life cycle water emissions inventoried and solid wastes, the production phase is the major contributor. The impact assessment, performed with the CML method, allows one to conclude that the alternative scenario exhibits lower results in all the impact categories. Both scenarios have similar environmental profiles, being: (i) the use phase, the major contributor for the abiotic depletion, global warming, photochemical oxidation, acidification and eutrophication; and (ii) the production phase, the main contributor for ozone depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The sensitivity analysis, with respect to the fuel consumption reduction value, the impact assessment method and the final disposal scenario, performed in this study allows one to confirm, as a main conclusion, that the alternative scenario is environmentally preferable to the reference scenario.
   Conclusion. The results obtained through the application of the LCA methodology enable one to conclude that the alternative component has a lower environmental load than the reference component.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Considering that the time required for the inventory data collection is a critical issue in LCA practise, the insights provided by this particular case study are likely to be useful to product developers in the car component manufacturing industry, particularly to brake system manufacturers supporting the environmental design within the sector.

AB  - Genotoxic agents known to modify DNA by alkylation reactions (alkylating agents, AAs), either directly or after metabolic conversion to ultimately reactive intermediates, by no means represent a homogeneous class. For instance, their effectiveness for genotoxic damage, when expressed as the number of events (e.g., mutations) per unit exposure dose, varies over a more than 1-million-fold range in dose. Despite the multiplicity of chemical and biological processes involved between DNA adduct formation and expression of genotoxic damage, the principal aims of studies on structure-activity relationships (SARs) are to (a) dissect the multi-step process of genetic damage formation into its most essential components, (b) use SARs for making predictions and, at a later step (c) as a basis for regulatory measures.
   The analytical tools available for such a comprehensive analysis in eukaryotic systems include determination of multiple genetic endpoints: molecular mutation spectra, relative clastogenicity (clastogenic events in relation to forward mutation induction) and the quantitative measure of enhanced mutagenicity in repair-deficient conditions. The genetic activity profiles obtained in this way can then be compared with fundamental physico-chemical properties of the AAs under consideration (such as Swain-Scott's s value, a useful indicator of the selectivity of an AA in its reactions with nucleophiles of distinct nucleophilic strength n in DNA, RNA and proteins), their functionality (monofunctional versus cross-linking) and their tumorigenic potency (TD(50)s compared with measures of initial DNA interaction, i.e., O-6-/N7-alkylguanine ratios, s values or the covalent binding index determined in the liver in vivo).
   The combination of these different methods revealed that carcinogenic potencies of AAs in rodents vary over a 10,000-fold range in dose, with the extremes having the following characteristics: (i) Chemicals of a relatively ''high carcinogenic potency'', as indicated by a low TD50 in rodents, either have low nucleophilic selectivity (and therefore mainly act through O-alkylation in DNA) or are capable of cross-linking DNA. The monofunctional members of this group, typified by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, are active in both spermatogonia and post-spermatogonial stages in the mouse and in Drosophila. Cross-linking agents also have a low TD50 value in rodents but are expected generally not to display genetic action in premeiotic stages (exceptions mitomycin C and chlorambucil). (ii) A relatively low carcinogenic potential is associated with AAs of high Swain-Scott s values, typified by trimethyl phosphate, epichlorohydrin or methyl methanesulphonate. Efficient error-free repair of N-alkylation damage appears the responsible mechanism for their high TD,, in rodents and why they tend to be inactive in repair-competent germ cells of the mouse. Since AAs of high s values give relatively high degrees of alkylation of proteins (e.g., with the -SH group of esterified cysteine, n = 5.1) reaction products with strong nucleophiles are often formed in amounts orders of magnitude larger than the products at n = 2 (DNA). As a consequence, the ''window'' of the dose range not causing cell lethality but, at the same time, still producing a significant amount of damage (e.g., mutations) will be very small. These type of agents are expected to be ''trouble-makers'' particularly in the in vivo mutagenicity assays. Examples are acrolein, chloroethyl isocyanate, chloroethylene oxide (s = 0.71), epichlorohydrin (s = 0.93), 1,2-epoxybutane, methyl bromide (s = 1.0), methyl iodide (s = 1.20), methyl vinylsulphone and 2-oxopropyl methanesulphonate (s = 2).

AB  - The vast majority of reports from governments of the European Union member states and applicants for such membership contain a separate provision on ensuring their effectiveness in the system of combating money laundering and terrorist financing, adherence to the requirements of leading international groups and organizations for such measures. In particular, the assessment of compliance with the 40 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on combating money laundering and counteraction to terrorist financing, conducted in Ukraine in 2017 and ended with the relevant report of the Committee of Experts of the Council of Europe MONEYVAL (Report, 2018), is systematically evaluated. The mentioned monitoring body of the Council of Europe assesses, in particular, compliance with the main international standards of organizational, technical, and legal provision of counteraction actors in the respective country, making emphasis on the fact that corruption and illegal (shadow) economic activity (and, according to a well-founded author's approach - "shadowing of the economy"- Tylchyk, 2017) are the main threats (risks) of money laundering (Report, 2018). Today it is possible to state the awareness of the need to introduce generally accepted standards into the practice of special subjects of providing economic security, although in the absence of a single vision of their place in the overall system of subjects of national security. At the same time, there is a significant complication regarding the gradual, system, and systematic nature of this activity, which is determined by the aggravation of social tension in society, external aggression, features of the formation of domestic doctrine and legislation traditionally oriented towards the application of the maximally defined concepts, at the same time, to date contain ambiguous provisions as to the content, in particular, the concept of illegally-obtained income, which does not coincide with that specified in the mentioned Standards and other international documents. The above stipulates the urgency to search for optimal ways to eliminate these inconsistencies, which lead to real hampering activities related to providing a counteraction to the legalization (laundering) of illegally-obtained income, in order to secure not only the national interests of Ukraine but also of the entire world. Methodology. The solution of the set purpose is realized using the cognitive potential of the system of philosophical, general scientific, and special methods. Analysis and synthesis allowed identifying the signs of illegally-obtained income, shadow economy, fight against the shadowing of the economy, and forming the latter concept. Methods of grammatical review and interpretation of legal rules helped to identify gaps and other shortcomings of legislation on problems of providing counteraction to the legalization (laundering) of illegally-obtained income, to develop proposals for its improvement, in particular regarding the features of defining the meaning of the concept of"illegally-obtained income" in domestic law field, the correlation of this concept and other economic and legal concepts.
   The comparative legal method allowed determining the development directions for domestic statutory acts in order to bring them in line with the generally accepted European standards. Practical implications. The level of shadowing of the Ukrainian economy, as well as many other countries of the world, requires the introduction of effective, timely, and consistent measures, in particular, to ensure control over the mentioned processes and create conditions for minimizing the possibilities of legalization laundering) of illegally-obtained income by the efforts of the system of subjects of providing national (including economic) security to counteract the shadowing of the economy, for which it is necessary to formulate uniform unambiguous basic concepts that are "legalization (laundering) of illegally-obtained income", "counteraction to the economic shadowing", which determine the actual direction of the activities of these subjects and correlate the use of appropriate complex measures and facilities.

AB  - The presence and the development of imposex were investigated in the common whelk (Buccinum undatum) and the red whelk (Neptunea antiqua) from the open North Sea and the Skagerrak. Imposex development was related to levels of organotins in snails and in the fine fractions (< 63 mum) of the sediments they inhabit. The sampling locations were classified according to three levels of traffic densities of ships of greater than or equal to 100 gt per day passing within 15 Nautical miles of the sampling station, shipping levels being: high (> 10 ships day(-1)), intermediate (5-10 ships day(-1)), and low (< 5 ships day(-1)). Sampling stations were also classified according to presence or absence of a vertically stratified water column. In the snails the body levels of the butyltin metabolites MBT and DBT and the parent phenyltin compound TPT, were higher than those of TBT and PT metabolites. In the sediment, the parent compounds and the mono-substituted metabolites MBT and MPT were present in-the highest concentrations. The highest body levels of all organotin compounds and the highest imposex indices for the common whelk were found at those locations in the Southern Bight and the German Bight that had a high shipping density as well as a homogeneously mixed water column during the whole year. At these locations sediment levels of organotins were also higher than at other sites. In contrast, the body levels of organotins were low and imposex was sometimes even completely absent in snails from stratified deep-water stations in the Skagerrak, despite a very high shipping density in the entrance area of the Baltic. In sediments from stratified locations with low or intermediate shipping densities, organotin compounds were below or close to their respective limits of detection. These stations were located in areas with a stratified water column during the whole year. The results can be explained by postulating a much higher resistance for dissolved organotins to migrate through a pycnocline. Organotins could only transgress through a pycnocline when adsorbed to settling particles that manage to transgress the boundary between layers. N. antiqua could only be obtained in sufficient numbers from deeper water stations, which almost all had a stratified water column. At stations where both snail species were obtained and imposex was present, the imposex index was higher in the red whelk. Hence N. antiqua seems to be the more sensitive species of the two. In the red whelk, imposex development increased with shipping density too, though in the smaller samples the trend was not significant. Average biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs; normalised for lipid content in snails and TOC content in the fraction < 63 Pin in sediments) for Buccinum ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 for butyltins and were similar to literature values reported for TBT in other marine species. Higher average BSAF values were found for phenyltins 1.5 (MPT) to 17 (TPT). The high values for TPT match the ranges expected from equilibrium partitioning concepts of persistent hydrophobic compounds. The ratio of live snails to the total number of live snails plus empty shells ranged between 2.5 and 93%. This parameter might be a useful indicator to compare past and present densities of populations of both species in different areas of the North Sea. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Groundwater resources in the Pannonian Basin (Hungary, Romania, Croatia and Serbia) are known to contain elevated naturally occurring As. Published estimates suggest nearly 500,000 people are exposed to levels greater than the EU maximum admissible concentration of 10 mu g/L in their drinking water, making it the largest area so affected in Europe. In this study, a variety of groundwaters were collected from Romania and Hungary to elucidate the general geochemistry and identify processes controlling As behaviour. Concentrations ranged from <0.5 to 240 mu g/L As(tot), with As predominantly in the reduced As(III) form. Using cluster analysis, four main groups of water were identified. Two groups (1 and 2) showed characteristics of water originating from reducing aquifers of the area with both groups having similar ranges of Fe concentrations, indicating that Fe-reduction occurs in both groups. However. As levels and other redox characteristics were very different. Group 1, indicative of waters dominated by methanogenesis contained high As levels (23-208 mu g/L, mean 123 mu g/L), with group 2 indicative of waters dominated by SO42--reduction containing low As levels (<0.5-58 mu g/L, mean 11.5 mu g/L). The remaining two groups were influenced either by (i) geothermal and saline or (ii) surface contamination and rain water inputs. Near absence of As in these groups, combined with positive correlations between delta Li-7 (an indicator of geothermal inputs) and As(tot) in geothermal/saline influenced waters indicate that elevated As is not from an external input, but is released due to an in-aquifer process. Geochemical reasoning, therefore, implies As mobilisation is controlled by redox processes, most likely microbially mediated reductive dissolution of As bearing Fe-oxides, known to occur in sediments from the area. More important is an overlying retention mechanism determined by the presence or absence of SO42-. Ongoing SO42--reduction will release S2-, removing As from solution either by the formation of As-sulfides, or from sorption onto Fe-sulfide phases. In methanogenic waters. As released by reductive dissolution is not removed from solution and can rise to the high levels observed. Levels of organic C are thought to be the ultimate control on the redox conditions in these 2 groups. High levels of organic C (as found in group 1) would quickly exhaust any SO42- present in the waters, driving the system to methanogenesis and subsequent high levels of As. Group 2 has much lower concentrations of organic C and so SO42- is not exhausted. Therefore, As levels in waters of the Pannonian Basin are controlled not by release but by retention mechanisms, ultimately controlled by levels of TOC and SO42- in the waters.
   delta D and delta O-18 analysis showed that groundwaters containing elevated As dated mostly from the last ice-age, and are sourced from Late Pliocene to Quaternary aquifers. The importance of TOC and retention capabilities of SO42--reduction have only previously been suggested for recent (Holocene) sediments and groundwater, most notably those in SE Asia as these are the most likely to contain the right combination of factors to drive the system to a redox situation leading to high aqueous As concentrations. In contrast, it is shown here that a much older system containing As bearing Fe-oxides, also has the potential to produce elevated levels of As if the TOC is suitable for the microbial population to drive the system to the correct redox situation and SO42- is either absent or wholly consumed.

AB  - Throughout its history, one of the most fascinating topics of psychiatry has been that of the causes and consequences of mental disorders. The desire to strengthen the reliability of diagnosis in this area has led to significant advances in two important fields: psychopathological description and the formulation of an integral diagnosis. Classifications allow the definition of categories and in the case of the two most read taxonomies in the field of mental health, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), these provide the most commonly used criteria for diagnosis. The revised fourth edition of the DSM is now insufficient to cover the ever greater clinical challenges and research. For over ten years, work has been carried out on the structure of DSM-V (the fifth edition), but despite the planning, organization, prediction, and the contributions of guest experts, it is feared that all the requirements of modern psychiatry will not be met. The first edition of DSM was published in the 1950s. It was based on the terminology developed by William Meninger. This version of the manual and the following, published several years later, reflected the psychodynamic psychiatry which prevailed at the time. The third edition was published in 1980 and its revised edition seven years later. The emphasis here was on descriptive and syndromatic considerations. The fourth edition appeared several years later. The most striking change in this edition was the inclusion of variables resulting from empirical studies. A later edition was published in the year 2000.
   The first attempts to put together DSM-V started in 1999. From 1999 until 2007 work was done on the planning of the investigation and technical documentation of DSM-V and the inclusion of the so called investigation schedules. The second phase of the project, known as the refinement of the research program for DSM-V, was carried out between 2004 and 2007. A pilot test was undertaken between January and May 2010, among different segments of the population and different settings, to evaluate the revisions proposed by the working teams. Between March and April 2011, as a result of the field tests, the proposed criteria for diagnosis were reviewed. The dimensional measurements and the criteria for diagnosis will be reviewed again during the rest of 2011. The year 2012 will see the preparation of the final version of the text, and finally, in May 2013, DSM-V will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco, California.
   Several external and independent authors have offered numerous proposals on topics related to psychopathology in general to the working groups formed for the preparation of DSM-V. Only some of these are mentioned below. One of the first factors to be taken into consideration in the revision of the manual is the need to distinguish between empirical questions or approaches and those of a more conceptual or philosophical nature, which should, by no means, be excluded. Another point to be evaluated is the advisability of defining phases according to the development of the condition, which would ideally create a schema focused on prevention. One of the expectations of psychiatry is that eventually laboratory criteria of diagnosis could be established, which could be measurable and would lead to clear statistics of psychiatric pathologies. As far as somatomorphic disorders are concerned, many practitioners agree that the current terminology and the systems of classification are inaccurate. One proposal is that this category should be eliminated altogether and that diagnoses should be made using an additional multidimensional description. One of the most interesting features of DSM is that it has had to accommodate changes brought about by new technologies. These advances go hand in hand with a new series of pathologies which need to be classified, as is the addiction to Internet.
   Undoubtedly, one of the greatest dilemmas facing DSM is how to classify eating disorders, as many people feel that the rather simplistic distinction between nervous anorexia and bulimia is not altogether convincing. There are two interesting proposals to consider in DSM-V: one is known as night eater syndrome and obesity, as in this case there is a compulsive consumption of food and an inability to limit this intake, in spite of a desire to do so. With regard to the compulsive, obsessive disorder, most experts believe that it is necessary to see the disorder as a spectrum, but defining criteria. Undeniably, a grave current problem which makes no distinctions is suicide. Different researchers recommend that suicidal behavior be considered and documented as a separate diagnosis in a sixth axis of the multioxis schema. Another important aspect concerns the giving of quality attention to patients. This has led to the proposal to expand DSM-V to include indicators for situations which could eventually be a cause for treatment. The proposal is to structure something different from what can be found in axis IV. In the case of paraphilias, it is deemed necessary that DSM-V should deal not only with the strictly descriptive aspect, but also with the semantic and linguistic. The importance of post-traumatic stress has been described, but there exists the doubt whether it is necessary to experience an adverse incident for this to be triggered. There has been a suggestion that the term "pre-traumatic" stress disorder be included in DSM-V to diagnose this condition. In the case of anxiety disorders, some authors advise the creation of a category known as "disorders caused by stress and fear", which would allow linking the diagnostic classification with etiology and thus define a "true" anxiety nosology. It would be advisable that the DSM-V included a category for "seasonal affective disorder" as such, and not simply as a variant in the "specification of the seasonal pattern" of depression. In the field of substance consumption, it has been argued that it is necessary to establish a classification which is not only categoric but also dimensional so as to improve its taxonomic usefulness. The organization of mental disorders in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 (tenth edition) is complex and this has led to exploring the feasibility of developing a meta-structural system of classification based on risk and clinical factors. For disorders originated in infancy, childhood and adolescence, it has been suggested that the disorder known as "temperament disorder by disphoria" be included in the forthcoming taxonomy, as well as the use of the terms insensitive/emotionless for behavioral disorders, among others. In the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the current criteria are considered insufficient and it has been suggested that the starting age for this disorder be increased from 7 to 12 years of age. It is suggested that autism be considered autistic spectrum, thus eliminating the other disorders covered in this section, including Asperger syndrome.
   The question as to whether this taxonomic-diagnostic system, to be implemented world-wide, will be both valid and reliable enough to cover all variations and particular characteristics of different cultures, ethnic groups, social groups and geographical regions in Mexico is another matter of concern, due to the lack of tools available for daily clinical work, except for the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization. There are, at present, a number of doubts and queries which will need to be laid open and evaluated in all seriousness in order to obtain concrete and integral answers, given that the manual will continue to be used for clinical purposes in different parts of the world. The challenge will be to find the best way to apply diagnostic criteria, avoiding omissions and oversimplifications and taking into account the cultural and social context worked in.

AB  - Infant crying is a complex phenomenon that implies several functions: breathing, action of laryngeal and supra-laryngeal muscles under the control of the neurovegetative systems of the brainstem, and the limbic system, and the association of cortical areas and the cerebellum. Although it is a communication system different to babbling and language, it is related with the future development of phonation. Cry analysis provides information about the neurophysiologic and psychological states of newborns and the identification of perinatal abnormalities. It is necessary to discuss the subject extensively because there are new data on situations such as laringomalacia, congenital hypothyroidism, deafness and sleep apnea that seem to be associated to infantile crying behaviors.
   Infant cries can be analyzed as behavioral conditions (hunger, anger and pain cries) allows knowing of mother-child relationship or the effect under diverse cultural conditions, such as stress, emotional deprivation or illness. A spectrographic analysis of the cries may identify several characteristics: threshold, latency, duration of phonation, maximum and minimum of the fundamental frequency (F0), occurrence and maximum pitch of shift, gliding, melody, biphonation, bifurcation, noise concentration, quality of the voice, double harmonic break, glottal plosives, vibratos, melody types, F0 stability and inspiratory stridor. To date, it has not been possible to establish alteration patterns. The best studied variables are F0, its harmonics and the duration of each emission; it is accepted that F0 varies between 400 and 600 Hz, during 1.4 +/- 0.6 s. Under such approaches, diverse alterations and risk factors have been studied: congenital alterations, malnutrition, sudden death, maternal exposition to drugs, prematurely born babies or perinatal asphyxia and disturbances of the central nervous system. Authors have reported F0 equal or less than 300 Hz in cases of sudden death or with high frequencies, near the 1000 Hz in the cri du chat syndrome, perinatal asphyxia and other cases who died suddenly During the cry. there is an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, heart rate and blood pressure, reduction of oxygen saturation, increase of the intra cranial-pressure, beginning of stress reactions, depletion of the energy anf oxygen reserves, such as the found in the Valsalva's maneuver. Every event of prolonged cries implies alteration of the breathing control like a Hering-Breuer reflex. Considering that some authors have proposed early vocalizations are a good predictor of deafness, in a previous paper we reported the characteristics of the cry of 20 deaf neonates. However, we were not able to demonstrate differences when comparing them with normal hearing neonates and infants, using only parametric methods. Still, we decided to go further and investigate the quality of infant cries of deaf neonates and infants.
   Material and methods. Twenty zero-to two-year old cases were studied; they were deaf children of both sexes; all cases were included in a follow-up program on the Human Communication Department of the National Institute of Perinatology of Mexico and were compared with 20 normal hearing children. We recorded Brain Stem Evoked Auditory, Responses (BEAR) and cry recording using a digital Sony recorder during the physical exploration. We analyzed the frequency (Hz) and duration of the espiratory cries, the duration of inspiration between two cry, emissions and the characteristics of the spectrogram.
   Quantitiative analysis. The usual estimates of means and standard variation were obtained and they, were compared with one way analysis of variance. We organized typologies of frequency by means of cluster techniques (Ward method). The distribution of the duration of the periods of crying and silence was explored with a contingency tables.
   Qualitative analysis. Two standardized observers visually analyzed all the cries to determine any variation of F0 and of harmonic frequencies. Whenever a variation of F0 was observed, we obtained maximum and minimum frequencies, as well as average duration of each cry emission. The procedure was validated by means of the graphic comparison with a Fourier's analysis.
   Results. Mean duration of cries in the deaf group was 03845 0.6150 s (range 0.08-5.2 s), while in the group of normal hearing cases was 0.5387 coproduct 0.2631 (range 0.06-1.75 s). From the deaf group, five cases had very prolonged duration of cries, without statistical significance. The mean duration of the inspiration was 0.3962 +/- 0.2326, with a range of 0.06 to 1.75 in the deaf group and of 0.4083 +/- 0.1854, with a range of 0.21 at 0.96, in the controls, without difference among groups. There was no correlation between the time of espiratory cry and that of the inspiration. Three cry topologies were organized: one of shorter duration (mean 0.30 s), with 111 spectrograms, an intermediate one (mean 0.73) with 85 spectrograms and one of prolonged duration (mean 4.5 s) with spectrograms of three cases. Three topologies of the inspiratory period were obtained: one of short periods (mean 0.33 s), with 171 spectrograms, one of intermediate duration (mean 0.80 s) with 18 spectrograms and one of prolonged duration (mean 1.60 s) with three cases. There were no statistical differences of tipologies between the deaf groups and normal hearing cases. On the qualitative analysis of cries, we came across several variations which are interpreted as abnormalities: vibratos, poor melodic control, loss of fundamental frequencies, harmonic limited production, plosives, gliding, bi phonation, and a loss of intensity at end of cry emissions. These changes were also observed on the control cases, but only in a very limited number.
   Discussion. Cry spectrogram analysis are non invasive indicators of the neonate's neurophysiologic organization. Although cry duration varies in healthy newborns, the accepted variation for a normal range is 1.1 to 2.8 s, with standard deviations around 0.6 s. Consistent differences have not been demonstrated between risk and control groups. However, abnormal cases such as Down syndrome or severe asphyxia have very short cries, whereas on the Cri du chat syndrome the duration of cries is prolonged. Extended cries imply cardiac and respiratory risks which have been associated with later outcomes as development retardation and Sudden death. There are also some questions to solve, such as the regulation and control of cry, starting from breathing mechanisms or from a sensorial afferent, mediated by hearing. The deaf infants are constituted in a study model, considering that the auditory, afference is suppressed and the control of the cry is restricted to the breathing environment.In the studied spectrograms, the duration of the cry was within reported normal limits by other authors, inasmuch in the normal hearing control cases as in the deaf, except the dissident cases, but without these reaching statistical significance. Further research of brainstem function is needed for the abnormal cases with prolonged cry periods, since such cries are interpreted as an alteration of the breathing reflexes of Hering-Breuer, which might have a pathological meaning in the sense of the sob's spasm or even more severe risk factors as sleep apnea and even sudden death.
   The qualitative analysis in the deaf individuals demonstrated a poor quality and unstable character of melodic control, with a smaller number of harmonics. The deaf cases lost the relationship between the fundamental frequencies and their harmonics, mainly because of the participation of supraglottic structures that modulate pitch and due to the poorness of melodic control, either for monotony or due to the impossibility of returning to a normal pattern, following variations such as vibrato, plosives or noise concentration. In the cases of prolonged cries, starting from the third second, the sound intensity tends to diminish and the harmonics are lost, perhaps due to a decrease of the subglottal pressure of phonation. This finding supports the auditory control of crying related to breathing mechanisms.
   Conclusions. In preliminary terms, by means of the melodic analysis of the spectrograms, differences are demonstrated between the cries of the deaf and of the normal hearing cases. The increase of the complexity of the melody of the cry, or their poverty,, are indicative of the neuromuscular function and they may support the evaluation of phonation before language development. The study of the spectrograms of deaf individuals does not constitute an element for the detection or for diagnosis since, to date, estimators of sensibility or of specificity have not been established, but they constitute a support for its integral evaluation, with the possibility of evaluating and of improving therapeutic rehabilitation.

AB  - Objectives. According to the International Labor Organization, one of the main barriers to the development of the cooperative model throughout the world is the lack of knowledge and social awareness about its values and its contribution to development. This study a aims precisely to know the level of knowledge and social awareness that citizens have about the contribution of cooperative enterprises to the development of a more economically and socially responsible economic model, favoring the reduction of poverty, the creation of more stable jobs and that favors social integration. The main objective of this work was to study the level of knowledge that citizens have about the cooperative business model and its inspiring principles. Secondly, to check its reputation level against conventional capitalist companies, approaching their level of excellence based on the value that citizens give to these companies through seven large dimensions of reputation. To achieve this goal, a field study was designed, with which to gather primary information about the impressions, news and values that citizens have about cooperative societies.
   Methodology. For the study of the level of knowledge that citizens have about cooperative companies, a questionnaire was designed with 21 questions, which was used with 321 citizens in year 2014 at different locations in the Region of Murcia, located in the southeast of Spain. With this questionnaire, besides approximating to the level of knowledge and the global assessment people have of this type of collective enterprise, also was studied the image that citizens have about these companies. For the study of business reputation, respondents were asked to value companies based on seven dimensions, following the RepTrak Pulse model. The seven dimensions considered were: D1. Quality: it offers excellent products and quality services. D2. Degree of innovation: offers innovative products or services or innovates in the way of doing things. D3. Treatment of employees: the company is an attractive place to work as an employee. D4. Ethics in management: is a company managed responsibly, behaving ethically and shows its operations with transparency. D5 Concern for society: the company cares about society, invests in good causes and does not harm the environment. D6. Leadership: is a wellled company, having recognized leaders and is managed with professionalism. D7. Profitability: it is a profitable company, obtaining good financial results. In addition to calculating a composite indicator of the level of reputation of the companies, the valuations achieved identify the dimensions in which the cooperatives have a higher or lower reputation.
   Results. The extensive first information generated with this survey made it possible to verify how two thirds of the surveyed citizens trust cooperative enterprises. Although the number of people who trust cooperatives is lower than those who trust small and medium enterprises, it is practically twice as many as the number of citizens who trust large companies, which barely reaches a third of the population.
   Social Economy concept is scarcely known among citizens, given that it was found that only three out of ten citizens know that involves different types of companies, such as cooperatives, insertion companies or foundations, as established in Spanish Social Economy Law since 2011. In the specific case of cooperatives, almost 8 out of ten citizens know that they are a " specific type of company form", the other respondents not knowing what form of organization this is. In particular, a small percentage thinks they are the same as non- profit entities. The level of knowledge of particular cooperative companies is wide, since 7 out of ten citizens are able to identify and name a cooperative company they know. However, only 15% knew that in 2012 the International Year of United Nations Cooperatives was celebrated. Social link with the cooperatives was found to be high, seeing as 11% of the respondents wer - or had been- a member of a cooperative, such as agrarian, consumer, housing, teaching or banking. 45% indicated that they had a relative or close person who was linked to a cooperative, as a partner, worker or consumer. Then they were asked about three large cooperatives (food distribution and a bank), with a large presence throughout the Spanish territory, only 3 out of ten citizens knew these companies have the legal form of cooperative.
   The study of cooperative movement in the Region, continued analyzing the image that the citizens surveyed have about this type of firms. Nearly 7 out of ten highlighted several values that identify these entities: they are more democratic companies; they are as competitive as other companies; they are a type of companies that support and promote values such as collaboration or democracy, clearly differentiating themselves from other types of capitalist companies. However, only one out of two respondents believed that it is a modern business model with a promising future given that it is a more responsible type of company.
   The aggregation of the qualifications given by the respondents in seven dimensions of the reputation from cooperatives and from specific capitalist companies, allowed to analyze the global valuation granted each of them. Thus, the level of reputation of the cooperatives is globally slightly lower than that reached by the capitalist companies (6,1 < 6,3 according to a scale of 1 to 10). Both among cooperatives and capitalist companies, are financial entities (Banks) those achieving a lower average reputation, followed by super- hypermarkets, with the highest value been given to cooperatives and capitalist companies of " Other sectors". The capitalist companies achieve a higher valuation in several dimensions: in Profitability (D7); in Quality of the offer (D1); in Leadership (D6); in Degree of innovation (D2); and finally, in Employee Treatment (D3). On the contrary, cooperative firms outperform capitalists in only two dimensions, such as: Ethics in their management (D4), and second, in Concern for society (D5). Although this study has generated ample information about areas for improvement of the cooperative model, it would be necessary to extend this study to other geographical areas, carrying out larger studies that measure the level of reputation and image that this type of company has in Spain and in Europe.
   Practical conclusions and original value. In spite of having verified that the citizens of Murcia have an adequate level of knowledge of the cooperative companies, very common in Spain, especially in rural environments, it is still important the educational task that should continue to be carried out in order to let this type of company be better known through the values it promotes and on which it is based, and how cooperative principles allow to develop more responsible and sustainable companies.
   The image that citizens have about cooperatives, in comparison with that about capitalist companies, is particularly good in terms of their contribution to the "development of the rural areas", the "internal democracy" and their "professionalism", being able to "compete in equal conditions" with other companies. Although it has been possible to verify that the level of reputation that cooperatives generally have is "Weak" or "Vulnerable", this is better overall than that reached by capitalist companies.
   Similarly, dimensions have been identified in which it is necessary for cooperatives to increase their competitive efforts, such as innovation or product quality. The social reputation of cooperatives only stand out in two dimensions, related to a more ethical behavior (Responsibility) and a greater concern for society (Citizenship). On the contrary, there is no greater reputation of cooperatives - in front of the capitalist companies - in other areas, such as their ability to generate quality working conditions, and it is urgent that cooperative enterprises recover the recognition of some of the cooperative principles that identify and differentiate them.
   This work provides an unprecedented comparative study of the business reputation of cooperatives versus capitalist companies. The information generated through a survey has allowed to study the reputation of cooperatives, in a total of seven large dimensions, which provide very relevant information about their strengths and weaknesses in the opinion of citizens, and about spaces for competitive ness improvement of the cooperative model.

   Current legislation allows including social issues in public contracting processes, which account for more than 15% of GDP in European Countries, hence the interest of this study, which defines the procedures for a socially efficient public procurement.
   Procurement procedures conducted from the public sector not only have the objective to provide goods and services, but they are also, or they should be, a tool for developing public policies, oriented to create value for different stakeholders. Nowadays, criteria used in evaluating the results generated in public contracting processes is incomplete, taking in consideration basically economic aspects. This evaluation is made from a limited perspective, hindering decision-making practices that could improve the total valued created for the society in general. The objective of this study is to facility the inclusion of social value in public tenders with the Social Accounting model, developed by Retolaza, San-Jose and Ruiz-Roqueiii, identifying value generated in these processes for the different stakeholders, which would provide information from a wider perspective, helping in maximizing total value.
   Theoretical Framework
   Previously, European directives specified that public contracts should be awarded to the lowest bidder or the bidder with the economically most advantageous tender (Bergman & Lundberg, 2013). However, even though obtaining the best quality/price relationship, probably they are not optimizing the value for the community. This problem arises because we would be analyzing value from a narrow economic view of business (Freeman, 2006), considering price as an optima indicator for value. It is necessary to consider a global perspective of the created or destroyed value, contemplating other externalities generated. Public procurement is a set of relationships among different stakeholders, which, at some particular point along the process development, may be more important than another. In the developing of this activity, it is necessary an appropriate understanding of the value creation process to maximize these stakeholder interests.
   McCrudden (2004) considers how governments currently attempt to use contracts to produce desired social policy outcomes through public procurement. Administration attempts to combine these two functions: participating in the market as purchaser and at the same time regulating it by using its purchasing power to advance conceptions of social justice. It is also a paper of the Public procurement to contribute to the improvement of labor standards and employment conditions.
   A new Law, 9/2017, was approved in Spain following this new interest in incorporating a wider analysis of the value created in the procurement process, indicating that in all Public procurement "social and environmental criteria" should be incorporated, in a "transverse and perceptive" way, being related with the object of the clauses of the contract. These social clauses incorporated in the Spanish new law, have their origin in the concept of "Social Responsible Public procurement", defined by the European Community as the procurement practices that have in consideration one or more of the following aspects: job opportunities, decent work, social and labor rights observance, social inclusion, equal of opportunity, providing accessibility for everyone and social criteria considered. This new framework should become an important part of the sustainable development strategy, opening an opportunity to encourage the participation of the Social Economy organizations in it, aiming to contribute to different social and environmental objectives (Mendoza J., 2019).
   There is a relevant output variability that is not usually took into consideration in the Public bids: Quality, territorial impact, savings in public funds, social innovation, risks, and emotional value (Retolaza eta al, 2015). There are other costs and benefits, but not identified in monetary terms, that has also need to be considered, as, impact in employment, social and equal opportunities, environmental impact, that is, value generated in these processes for the different stakeholders.
   Methodology / Proposed Model
   Repeatedly mentioned in previous comments, it is necessary to offer a tool to evaluate procurement processed led by public actors, taking into consideration an integrated value analysis, which collect economic, but also social values, generated to the stakeholders, giving a wider view of the whole process. The Social Accounting model provides a starting point for this project (Retolaza, San Jose & Ruiz-Roquefii 2015). This methodology is supported in the Stakeholder theory (Freeman 1984), analyzing in terms of those involved, who affect and are affected, required to identify the valued created by the procurement process.
   We contemplate the design of a social efficiency model, based in the indicated Social Accounting model, that could be applied to the Public Procurement. During a previous phase of the project, a Delphi technique with an online questionnaire has been utilized in order to gather improvement proposals to incorporate to public procurement processes proposed by experts from University, Public Administration and Companies, all around Spain. These experts confirmed the existence of a growing consensus for the need to include social value in public tenders. They identified 35 potential research issues related to the social impact of public procurement, considering the creation of tools to improve the objectivation of additional criteria, limiting discretion during the assessment procedure, to be of particular potential value.
   In the current phase of the project, supported in a case study, we have incorporated the Social Accounting model to a specific public procurement process, managed by the local administration "Viviendas Municipales de Bilbao", already evaluated and awarded. We incorporate this new concept, social value to be created in the development of the activity of the contract, in a new calculation of the evaluation process, with the same conditions and structure as the other quantifiable criterion, economic proposal. In this process, we have calculated social integrated value created by the companies participating in the process in the previous year and, by applying a ratio of social value created for each euro of revenue, estimated social value that they will create developing the activity of the procurement process and assigned a valuation to any of the proposals.
   To finalize the process, we have completed again the evaluation process, with the previous analyzed criteria, technical and economic proposals, and this new one, social value to be generated in the activity, integrated with the same structure and evaluation method than the other concepts.
   Results
   As indicated in the introduction, this project aimed to change the perspective in which public procurement processes had been working, from a price-based bidding model to an analysis of the results from a stakeholder perspective view. This new tool provides information to orient public procurement to work on the efficiency of the outputs in relation to inputs.
   In this case study, we have tested how this additional concept, social value to be generated by the organization awarded with the public tender, can be incorporated in the evaluation procedure. This information generated in the process will improve the transparency of the procedure and increase the alternatives to create cross and specific value, with no limitation. Public procurement will focus on purpose, on creating value for the stakeholders, and not in minimizing the cost of the products or services.
   Limitations of the investigation
   It would be necessary to contrast the results from this case study in other public procurement processes to generalize conclusions. In this analysis, we have only evaluated "market social value" to be created by the different organizations, as "no market social value" information was not available for the evaluation.
   Another limitation of the introduced analysis is how to evaluate organizations of recent foundation, not having completed a whole accounting exercise, as they would not provide the ratio of social value created in the previous year for the estimation of results in case of being awarded.
   Practical conclusions
   Theoretical implications correspond to a perspective change, price-based bidding model is substituted with public procurement systems, where the results are analyzed from a stakeholder perspective view and the efficiency of the outputs in relation to inputs is considered the main goal. Our findings suggest the need to develop an objective social accounting system, capable of calculating, in a standard and predictable way, the social value generated to the various interest groups and society in general, and consequentially, looking for the option that would maximize total value created.

AB  - Since the industrial revolution, the greenhouse effect caused by greenhouse gas emissions has led to an increase in the net radiative forcing on the Earth's surface, and the global mean surface temperature (GMST) has continued to rise, accompanied by multi-time scale oscillations including inter-annual decadal and multi-decadal oscillations. Changes in GMST, which reflect the integrated response of the climate system to the combination of external radiation forcing and internal natural variables, are one of the key indicators for understanding the impact of human activities on global climate change.
   Previous studies have basically determined the contribution of major physical modes of the global surface temperature, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) method. In addition to the above climate modes, the physical processes affecting GMST changes also include volcanic eruptions. observation data system errors and so on. Based on the above research progress and these two basic assumptions (there is no long-term changing trend due to factors such as natural variabilities, volcanic eruption events, or system error of observation equipment; a single event does not affect the remotely related structure of the main physical mode), EOF decomposition is applied to the surface temperature of ERSST v3b and HadISST v1.1 ocean observation data in this paper, so as to obtain the TR warming trend item with ENSO. PDO and AMO removed, and thus. by using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, to break down each TR time series into components on multiple different time scales and summarize them into low frequencies, high frequency and trend items. The land and ocean data (HadCRUT.4.6) are used to compare ocean data (ERSST v3b and HadISST v1.1) results and conduct a statistical analysis on the errors introduced by EMD methods.
   This study found that the main physical processes affecting changes in the GMST include global warming caused by the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the cooling effects caused by aerosols. the internal variables in the global climate system, the system errors caused by changes in the observing system, data noise, and other factors that have not yet been identified. Based on ERSST V3b and HadISST v1.1 observational data, this study also analyzed and determined the impact and contribution of each factor to GMST changes. This could be a key step to identify the effects of human activities and natural variability on global climate change. There are two main conclusive contributions in this paper. One contribution was to quantify the time scale and intensity of the impact of volcanic eruptions on GMST. We estimated the impact of five major volcanic eruptions since 1950 (Agung, 1963; Merapi, 1974; St. Helens. 1980; Pinatubo, 1991; Nabro, 2011). The cumulative effects of these five major volcano events in ERSST and HadISST approximately caused global warming to slow down by 0.32-0.47 and 0.45-0.67 degrees C, respectively. Another major contribution is to find that the TR item of GMST still has a recent global warming mitigation phenomenon after the removal of the three major climate models, that is, there are some processes in the Earth's climate system that are different from the above three physical models. which could significantly affect the TR changes. Therefore, global warming tends to slow down (warming hiatus). In modem climate conditions, anthropogenic radiative forcing continues to increase, and the heat absorbed by the global climate system continues to increase during global warming hiatus period. That is, even if the amount of heat energy used to heat up the surface of the global surface reduced, this "reduced" amount of heat still remains in the climate system. such as the mid-deep ocean. The results further underscore the necessity for understanding the critical physical processes that lead to global warming from the perspective of the energy balance of the climate system.

AB  - Development of the world economy requires energy supply, which under stable growth must be based on alternative energy resources. Bioenergy is an integral part of energy security supply in volatile countries. It can satisfy a considerable part of energy demand of agribusinesses and other companies as well as facilitate problem-shooting in energy, ecological and social sectors in some regions. Enhancing bioenergy in Ukraine is one of the strategic ways in the development of the alternative energy sector, taking into account high volatility of the country and significant potential of biomass available for energy production.
   This research intends to determine conditions and mechanisms of development and functioning of bioenergy clusters based on preliminary specification of the bioenergy potential of the territories, taking into account modern marketing approaches.
   This article contains evaluation of the bioenergy production growth in countries such as China, Germany, France, the USA, Canada, Brazil and Ukraine. The feasibility of the cluster approach for Ukrainian bioenergy development has been proved. In order to combine Ukrainian regions according to all types of energy resources the authors applied the method of clustering analysis. The key point of the method implies that, based on the given set of indicators which are defined as the main characteristics of the object, every object of the population belongs to a similar class. Therefore, in order to study the efficiency of usage of bioenergy resources in a particular region, it is necessary to classify a set of indicators to identify standard forms. To systemize Ukrainian regions, the Isodata algorithm Isodata, based on the types of the economic and energy potential of biomass, is taken into account. To implement the analysis, the following indicators are considered: the biomass energy potential of primary cell waste, the biomass energy potential of trimming, the biomass energy potential of refining, the energy potential of wooden biomass, the mold biomass potential, the energy potential of bioenergy crops, the corn energy potential (biogas).
   Market players organize groups with regard to their industries, territories and other factors, namely clusters which are likely to become effective tools in while carrying out scale projects under tough competition. In the minor energy sector cooperation between research and manufacturing enterprises, which satisfies energy needs both of cities and individual customers, is growing. This approach perfectly meets all requirements of the regional development of Ukrainian bioenergy.
   The main goal of bioenergy clusters is to develop competitive advantages of regions by increasing all types of biomass and biofuel production. This implies the following priorities: creation of a database of agribusiness enterprises, which potentially are members of the cluster and corresponding infrastructure, establishment of marketing communications in order to inform members and potential investors about bioenergy advantages, introduction of regional databases by means of webpages, newsletters, public discussions etc., enhanced vocational training of bioenergy industry employees and investment attraction to finance bioenergy projects.
   As a result, the authors of the paper propose a classification of Ukrainian regions based on the indicators of the economic energy potential of wastes and energy crops in agribusinesses, which is the basis for cluster formation. Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Khmelnitsky and Chernihiv regions refer to the first type with the biggest bioenergy potential, which makes it possible to create 2 energy clusters by combining central-west and north-east regions. Such a methodology gives an opportunity to satisfy the needs of the regions and districts which need additional energy resources taken from own biomass.
   Priority tasks of the bioenergy cluster include: development of the database of agribusiness entities which potentially are the cluster members and corresponding infrastructure, informing members and investors about bioenergy benefits, creation of the regional information database identifying the resources, capacity and the transport system, vocational training, investment attraction in order to implement bioenergy projects. Based on clusters, economic relations build up a competitive and sound investment climate to support the economy, which, in turn, provides high living standards. The authors have defined the procedure for exercising the cluster initiative and determined the structure of marketing support for cluster projects.

AB  - Currently, very few people deny that modern foreign language education along with cognitive development must focus on familiarizing students to important social values, development of their emotional-volitional sphere, the production of affective stereotyping which is the basis of human behaviour. The solution to this problem requires changes and additions to the content of foreign language education which should be aimed at forming a student's integrated personality in the totality of their intellectual, volitional and emotional-valuable spheres. The required content of foreign language education should be free from manifestations of negative rationalistic and technocratic tendencies in favour of personal-activity and emotionally valuable bases. However, still unilateralism is viewed in the design and implementation of the content of foreign language education. This is evident in the fact that among its components the experience of emotionally valuable relations is not fixed. The purpose of this article is to present a typology of emotionally valuable foreign-language texts as means to meet broad cognitive, aesthetic, moral and professional needs of students. Such texts must possess the qualities of text emotivism and axiological (valuable) orientation. Working with them "establishes" a connection between intelligent components of the content of foreign language education and its emotionally valuable component (EVC). The latter is based on social experience, associated with emotionally valuable sphere of a personality and considered to be a system of valuable, emotional subcomponents, a volitional one and their constituents, as well as personal universal educational action (UEA). Mastering the experience of emotionally valuable attitude to the world is expressed not in subject knowledge and skills, but in the form of personal philosophical dispositions, value orientations, gained life experience which has become an integral essence of one' self-concept. So, the object of our research in this article is a foreign-language text. Research objectives are: to consider a text as a unit of the implementation of the EVC of foreign-language education content; identify principles and criteria for the selection and organization of foreign-language texts of emotionally valuable content; give the definition and characteristics of a foreign-language text of emotionally valuable content; present a typology of foreign-language texts of emotionally valuable content; discuss techniques for working with foreign-language texts of emotionally valuable content. To create a methodical typology of foreign-language texts of emotionally valuable content a typological approach was used which assumes the partition of systems of objects and their grouping with the help of a generalized type, and a comparative study of the features, function, levels of the organization of the allocated types. During the study, methods of theoretical analysis: systemic-structural, organizational, functional, comparative, typological, modelling, designing were resorted to. A text is characterized as a unit of language and speech that expresses a complete statement. The study of emotional and valuable significance of the content of speech material is not possible without considering such a category as text emotivism.
   It is one of the basic properties of a text that corresponds to emotiogenic knowledge, materialized in it, and is actualized with the help of emotively charged textual components, embodying the author's emotional intentions, and the likely emotions of the addressee, associated with the perception and interpretation of textual reality. An emotive text allows you to tie together the information from a text, and emotions, caused as a result of processing of this information by the addressee and the addresser. We regard a foreign-language text of emotionally valuable content as an utterance of various degrees of authenticity which meets the general didactic principles of compliance of the content of education (CE) in all its elements and at all levels of design to the requirements for the development of the society, science, culture and a personality; the unity of substantive and procedural aspects of teaching in the selection of the CE; educational, developing and upbringing functions of teaching; its variability and problematic character; as well as specific principles of emotional and valuable significance of speech material, a dialogue of cultures, a cross-cultural character, communicativeness and authenticity. A foreign-language text of emotionally valuable contents provides reflection of higher humanistic values which a story of human life has developed (person, happiness, society, nature); representation of desired emotionally volitional and emotionally valuable relations of students to the world, to each other, to the reality, to what they do in the process of mastering of foreign-language culture; the description of the objective socio-cultural reality; students' acquaintance with the life of people, belonging to different social strata, races, minorities; accounting the identity and uniqueness of representatives of different communities; the vision of the world picture by a speaker of another language; understanding of the world through the prism of the culture of students' country and the perception of the uniqueness of their own cultural values in the context of global processes; consideration of the level of students' multicultural and bilingual development, the compliance of the content of the text to students' cognitive-communicative needs and abilities, their life experience and background knowledge; the shift from narrow subject formation of skills and abilities to their integration with other disciplinary and interdisciplinary skills for a complex spiritual and intellectual development of the individual. The leading method of investigating the problem allows us to present a typology of emotionally valuable foreign-language texts for teaching different kinds of foreign-language speech activities. The proposed typology of emotionally valuable texts for teaching different kinds of foreign-language speech activities involves the accentuation of emotionally-valuable and volitional components of students' perception of a different linguistic culture and the experience of communication with it. These components represent the displacement of the targets from the results of students' practical mastering of different types of foreign-language speech activities to an individual learner as the subject of speech, knowledge, cultures, intercultural communication and ethics, i.e. the implementation of the EVC of the content of foreign-language education.
   The typology of emotionally valuable foreign-language texts is an important component of the realization of the basic model of the EVC of the content of foreign-language education and is used to create its various modifications, able to function in any point of teaching a FL in the secondary school. It consists of types, sub-types, forms, sub-forms, varieties, variants and sub-variants of speech material within which the EVC of the content of foreign language education acquires the ability to perform its functions effectively provided that speech material, intended to teach various kinds of foreign-language speech activity, is sufficiently emotionally-valuable. The multilevel structure and organization of this typology creates the preconditions for the functioning of the EVC of the content of foreign language education in terms of teaching speaking, listening, reading and written speech at different stages in a secondary school. In its turn, the creation of a methodical typology requires the development of techniques for working with such texts while teaching students of different age groups. At the top level of the designed typology there are three types of foreign-language texts, located in the order of descending the degree of their emotional value: these are texts of a high (type I), sufficient (type II) and insufficient (type III) degree of emotional value. In order to give a functional character to a greater number of typology components, sub-types were selected inside types I and II of emotionally-valuable speech material. Realizing that a secondary school foreign-language text cannot be wholly original, it often undergoes some methodical processing for learning purposes. So, we assume some degree of didactic organization of an original text. However, didactic organization and methodical processing should not compromise much the validity and authenticity of speech material. Thus, its sociocultural background and indicators of emotional value cannot be lost. That's why in the transition from the first to the second level of the designed typology we exclude from it type III texts, characterized by an inadequate level of emotional value. If such texts are available in the educational-methodical complex, their methodical processing is required to ensure a sufficient level of emotional value of speech material. This will create all necessary and adequate preconditions for the implementation of the EVC of the content of foreign language education. The sub-types of texts constitute the second level of the designed system and vary in degree of authenticity. Texts of sub-type I are didactical. These are texts, specifically prepared for methodical purposes. Texts of sub-type II are semi-authentic. These are authentic texts, adapted, usually by reduction, to implement the objectives of education. Texts of sub-type III are quasi-authentic. They allow some reduction at the expense of proper names if they are numerous; and historical footnotes, i.e. particularly difficult places are removed from the text. Texts of sub-type IV are authentic. These are actually original texts, written by native speakers for native speakers. At the next level, texts are classified according to the kinds of foreign-language speech activities. Texts of form I are intended for teaching speaking; form II -listening; form III -reading; form IV type -written speech. In the context of teaching speaking the specificity of sub-forms I and II of speech material were taken into consideration. They are dialogical speech and monological speech respectively.
   In the frame-work of teaching listening comprehension we call three sub-forms of speech material texts of sub-form I are intended for teaching listening for the main information; texts of sub-form II are for teaching detailed listening; texts of sub-form III are for teaching listening with critical assessment. For teaching reading the following sub-forms of texts are used: for the implementation of scanning/skimming reading (sub-form I); for teaching reading for the main information (sub-form II); and for detailed reading (sub-form III). In teaching written speech in secondary school the above-named authors of textbooks and manuals on methods of teaching a FL the following sample texts are proposed: samples of letters (sub-form I); samples of essays (sub-form II) and samples of abstracts/synopses (sub-form III). The next step in improving the functionality of the typology was the consideration of the degree of complexity of educational and speech problems, addressed by a text at various stages of foreign-language speech activities. So, at the stage of improving lexical and grammatical skills texts of variety I are used. These are texts of a small volume, i.e. micro-texts. At the stage of speech skills development texts of variety II are used. These are the whole speech products, or rmacro-texts. The contents of both micro-and macro-texts must be relevant to the selection criteria and the organization of speech material of high and sufficient degree of emotional value. Another step in the development of the typology of emotionally-valuable texts is distinguishing of five variants of texts in accordance with their belonging to various styles of speech: artistic (variant I), publicistic (variant II), conversational (variant III), official (variant IV), scientific (variant V). The final step was the consideration of the means of information transmission in the text. So, all texts are subdivided verbal and creolized (mixed). Emotiogenic properties of nonverbal texts (painting, graphics, architecture, photography, drawings, posters, signs, symbols, maps, diagrams, charts, etc.) allow us to consider them as material means in the framework of the techniques of work with verbal (sub-variant I) and creolized (sub-variant II) micro-and macro-texts. The techniques of working with foreign-language texts of emotionally-valuable contents include conditions, means and ways of learning. A similar understanding of a technique is characterized by capacity, purposefulness and an organizational structure. Thus, a technique as a technological unit that integrates the basic elements of foreign language education, is able to provide the most adequate organization and management of a learning process for mastering the EVC of the content of foreign language education through work with texts of emotional value. Having an idea about the nature of a technique and its components, a teacher can choose a technique that is adequate to achieve the objective under certain conditions, what we intend to do in the future. All of the above allows us to assert that the designed typology of texts of the emotionally valuable content through its multilevel structure and organization provides the necessary prerequisites for functioning of the EVC of the content of foreign language education in terms of teaching different kinds of foreign-language speech activity. The typology can be used at different stages of teaching English in secondary school.
   In the future, in the context of developing techniques for working with these texts we intend to pick up the entire set of means and ways, adequate to the goals of teaching speaking, listening, reading and written speech, and describe conditions for their implementation in working with schoolchildren of different age groups.

AB  - One of the important problems in the development of the food industry in Ukraine is the influence of globalization processes, accompanied by cyclical development of the economy. The cycles are manifested in periodic ups and downs of the business climate, taking into account the influence of various factors (climate change, risks in agricultural production, legislative changes, etc.), i.e. when the economy seeks to find equilibrium. Therefore, the identification of fluctuations in economic activity and, accordingly, changes in market conditions that arise as a reaction to the action of well-defined, predictable factors of the market environment are relevant and necessary. The purpose of the article is to reveal the influence of globalization processes and economic cyclicality on the innovative development of the food industry in Ukraine, to identify the phases of business cycles, to determine the criteria for the effective functioning of individual food industry sectors during periods of crisis and depression in order to develop effective tools for leveling and smoothing their consequences at different levels of management. Methods. Based on the application of classical and modern methods for assessing economic cycles, we developed a methodological approach to justifying the phases of the business cycle and identifying the development specificities of individual sectors of the food industry of Ukraine (meat processing, milk processing, baking, sugar production) in these phases. In the authors' algorithm, at the appropriate stages of the study, the following methods were applied: factor analysis. to calculate the indicator of the business climate; smoothing time series. to identify individual phases of the business cycle; average values of growth rates. to summarize the characteristics of the phases of the business cycle and identify the characteristics of the development of food industry sectors of Ukraine in these phases. The primary data for the calculations were the data of global and national statistics. Results. It has been established that the consequences of the impact of globalization on the development of the food industry of Ukraine since the beginning of the new millennium are: changes in the industrial structure; its formation under the influence of an external market, where raw materials and primary processing products are most in demand; accelerated growth in consumer prices for food products, which does not correlate with real incomes of the population; expanding the monopolization of food markets; the imbalance of supply and demand, which leads to differences in the development of economic phenomena, in particular. in the innovative development of the food industry, etc. The study showed that the development of individual sectors of the food industry is affected by the cyclical development of the national economy. The periods of the business cycle phases for the Ukrainian economy (from 2002 to mid-2019) and their impact on the activity of the food industry are determined. It was established that during this period the Ukrainian economy went through 4 business cycles with five major downturns and peaks in economic activity. It was revealed that a sign of its development is the presence of separate business cycles in which there is no depression phase. Conclusions. The assessment of the intensity of the development of the food industry sectors during the phases of business cycles gives grounds for the justification of their slower innovative development.
   The main reasons for this phenomenon in the food industry are as follows: imbalance in supply and demand for goods; low purchasing power of the population; investing significant amounts of finances in increasing production volumes, and not in innovative development, inefficient pricing policy. The methodological approach proposed in the article, based on the identified signs of the phases of the business cycle, makes it possible to justify the problem periods of the food industry in the short term, as current problems significantly affect the implementation of long-term plans. This confirms the feasibility of applying the proposed methodological approach in further research.

AB  - The aims of this experiment are to explore the accumulation of metal contamination of different varieties of rice planted in paddy fields and to provide a basis for the further research. The rice specimens were grown in and collected from a total area of 8.24 acres of rice planting fields where local farmers cultivated 50 different kinds of rice. The crops were grown using the methods of seedling, transplanting, fertilizing, and irrigation, under the guidance of professional and technical personnel. The 50 kinds of paddy rice contain 20 kinds of conventional rice, 15 kinds of two-line hybrid rice, 15 kinds of three-line hybrid rice, and the whole experiment lasted 100 days. To begin our analysis of the data, we first gathered 15 irrigation water samples respectively from the first day of the experiment. This was then followed by gathering water samples from the tittering stage, then the development stage, the solid phase, and finally, the last day of the experiment. On the first day and at the end of the experiment, we had respectively gathered 6 mud samples from the rice paddies, with a total 12 parts of it. In addition to this, by the end of the experiment, we had gathered 6 samples of rice spike from each type of the investigated rice, with a total 300 parts of it. These samples were then analyzed in the laboratory to detect the contents and amounts of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, copper, calcium, fluoride, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium in the samples, and the pH quality of the samples. The quality of irrigation water was evaluated according to irrigation water quality standards (GB 50842005); the rice paddy mud samples were detected and evaluated respectively according to farmland soil environment quality monitor technology standards (NY/T 395-2012) and the journal of environmental quality assessment standard of edible agricultural products (HJ 332-2006); the rice grains were detected and evaluated according to the limited food standards (GB 2762-2012); the bioaccumulation factors (BCFs) were adopted to evaluate the accumulation ability of metal contamination in rice. As a result, the test values of the irrigation water samples were within irrigation water quality standards. Only the content of cadmium was beyond the environmental quality assessment standard of edible agricultural products, by 0.07 mg/kg. The content of lead and cadmium in 50 different rice were 0.41 +/- 0.01 similar to 0.49 +/- 0.01 mg/kg and 0.22 +/- 0.01-0.25 +/- 0.01 mg/kg, respectively. The varietal differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Lead BCFs, cadmium BCFs, and chromium BCFs in 50 different kinds of rice had no statistical difference (P>0.05). For the content of lead, cadmium, chromium, inorganic arsenic and copper in the conventional rice samples, two-line hybrid rice samples, and three-line hybrid rice samples, there was no statistical difference (P>0.05). Lead BCFs, cadmium BCFs, chromium BCFs, arsenic BCFs, and copper BCFs also had no statistical difference (P>0.05). This means the content of cadmium and lead contaminant in the 50 kinds of rice exceeded food quality and limits. The content of cadmium of mud samples exceeded the assessment standard by 0.07 mg/kg, the content of cadmium, of the 50 kinds of rice, exceeded the limited food standard by 0.04 mg/kg. The content of lead in the paddy mud was within the limited value, but the content of lead exceeded the limited food standard by 0.24 mg/kg. For the lead BCFs, cadmium BCFs, and chromium BCFs of the 50 kinds of rice, there was no statistically significant difference.
   This was the same for lead BCFs, cadmium BCFs, chromium BCFs, arsenic BCFs, and copper BCFs during conventional rice, two-line hybrid rice, and three-line hybrid rice. For the above, the rice had a strong adsorption capacity of lead. The conclusions of this data lead us to not only implement measures of control hut also to conduct research on the suitable levels of lead in edible agricultural products.

AB  - Integrating environmental issues into the traditional product design process, for powerful eco-efficiency, is now one of the major priorities for steelmakers. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is currently undertaken as the most holistic approach for assessing environmental impact and selecting new technologies to reduce emissions for steel industry. However, in order to identify new ways for environmental friendly production of steel, it is essential to carry out the process Life cycle inventory (LCI) which is the core part of LCA. According to LCA practitioners, the quality and the availability of data are the main important limiting factors when applying this methodology for new steelmaking processes without large industrial application. In this paper, we propose a new approach of LCIA of steelmaking, based on the simulation of traditional processes which guarantees the quality of data, the mass and the energy balances. This approach is validated for an existing integrated plant and will be used to assess the inventory for breakthrough steelmaking technologies.
   The proposed methodological framework combines physicochemical modelling approach with LCA thinking, in order to carry out the LCI of steelmaking process. Using Aspen Plus commercial flow-sheeting software, physicochemical models have been developed for each steelmaking unit: coke plant, sinter plant, blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace and hot-rolling. The association of the five separately developed modules builds the complete flow sheet of the integrated steelmaking plant. Based on chemical reactions, thermodynamics laws and mathematical equations, the model calculates the mass of each pollutant released by the process, the masses and the chemical compositions of products and by-products simultaneously. For a better understanding of this approach, a brief description of the module developed for coke-making plant is given in the current paper.
   Thanks to the developed model, the LCI of an existing European integrated steelmaking plant has been calculated and inserted into GaBi software for environmental impacts assessment. In order to check the maturity of the developed approach, simulations of the model have been carried out for virtual cases describing an integrated steelmaking plant, characterised by the best available technology. Comparisons between inventories calculated with the model for "virtual" cases and for existing European plant showed good consistency of results and allowed us to validate the proposed approach.
   The new approach proposed for LCI calculation offers some important benefits that cannot be obtained when the inventory is carried out in the traditional way. First of all, the model allows us to control the mass and energy balances, something that is basically impossible to assure when only data from industry and/or literature are used. Secondly, calculating emissions based on physicochemical and mathematical considerations gives a strong credibility to the inventory. Predictive model simulations, for special operating conditions (e.g. recycling of different wastes, use of new fuels or mix of fuels), give access to certain environmental information which is not available. The LCI of the integrated steelmaking plant can then be carried out for different operational practices, and the best scenario can be identified in minimal time.
   The integrated classical steelmaking route (via blast furnace/converter) has been modelled with Aspen, and the results were successfully compared with industrial data. Consistency of results obtained for simulations of real and virtual integrated plants have shown that the new concept strengthens the LCA method in order to supply rigorous "gate to gate" LCI. It has been shown that the current approach, developed for steelmaking classical route, is mature for modelling new steelmaking breakthrough technologies for environmentally friendly production of steel, such as smelting reduction, direct reduction, hydrogen reduction and use of biomass.
   After the selection of steelmaking alternatives and before testing these technological proposals at industrial scale, it is crucial to assess their inventories. As perspective of the current work, the approach proposed in this paper can be used as a powerful tool in order to assess the LCI of new technologies mentioned above.

AB  - The evoked expression of the immediate early gene (IEG)-encoded proteins c-Fos and Krox-24 was used to monitor spinal visceronociceptive processing that results from cyclophosphamide cystitis in behaving rats. Animals received a single dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. of cyclophosphamide and survived for 30 min to 5 h. Longer survival times were not considered because of ethical considerations. Cyclophosphamide-injected animals developed characteristic behavioral signs in parallel with development of bladder lesions and spinal evoked expression of IEG-encoded proteins. Histological examination of the urinary bladder was used to evaluate the degree of cystitis and as a criterion for selection of groups of animals to be quantitatively analyzed. Controls consisted of freely behaving animals including control (uninjected), sham (saline-injected) or diuretic (furosemide-injected) animals. Behavioral modifications consisted of lacrimation, piloerection, assumption of a peculiar ''rounded-back'' posture, which was accompanied by head immobility and various brief ''crises'' (tail hyperextension, abdominal retractions, licking of the lower abdomen, backward withdrawal movements). Abnormal behaviors, which first appeared (lacrimation, piloerection) at the end of postinjection hour 1, progressively increased in severity (rounded-back posture) over the following 90 min to reach a plateau at about postinjection hour 2; the rounded-back posture was maintained up to time of death. Histological modifications of bladder tissue were assessed using a 4-grade scale in a blind setting. The 1st grade consisted of control or sham animals with no bladder lesion; 2nd grade, animals with simple chorionic edema; 3rd grade, animals with chorionic edema associated with mucosal abrasion, fibrin deposit, and onset of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration; 4th grade, animals with complete cystitis corresponding to an increase in severity and spread of all the signs of cystitis described above plus petechial hemorrhage. Simple chorionic edema was observed from 30 min to 3 h postinjection, but with a progressive increase in severity over time. Edema accompanied by epithelial abrasion was observed for animals that survived 3-4 h postinjection; complete inflammation was observed in animals that survived 4-5 h postinjection. The study of c-Fos- and Krox-24-encoded protein expression demonstrated that few lumbosacral spinal areas were specifically involved in the processing of visceral inputs in response to bladder stimulation. These areas were the parasympathetic column (SPN), the dorsal gray commissure (DGC as the caudal extent of lamina X), and superficial layers of the dorsal horn. Differential basal and evoked labeling between c-Fos and Krox-24 allowed a functional distinction between these spinal subregions: Krox-24 was an indicator of the first signs of inflammation (simple chorionic edema); c-Fos was an indicator of more pronounced impairments. DGC, which displayed a high level of basal Krox-24 expression and in which both Krox-24 and c-Fos were evoked in relation to disease evolution, probably codes inputs from both physiological (progressive bladder filling) and all types of pathological (inflammatory processes, overdistension) conditions. SPN, which, except for basal Krox-24 expression, responded like DGC and contains preganglionic motor cells, probably codes inputs involved in eliciting motor activity that results in bladder emptying as needed from natural filling and/or pathological situations.
   Laminae I and II, which responded like DGC and SPN with respect to Krox-24 expression, may code inputs from physiopathological changes of the bladder, though lamina I would be primarily involved in pain processing as it was the only region in which c-Fos expression increased during abrasion and complete inflammation. The cyclophosphamide-cystitis model has the following unique features compared with other visceral models: first, the stimulus is a ''pure'' visceral one, confined to one viscus (bladder; no somatic stimulation is induced by either introducing a stimulating device or from surgical wounds, and no anesthesia is required); second, it is the exact replica of a human disease, and its evolution can be efficently monitored through behavioral and histological observations; third, it can be used in behaving animals without departing from ethical rules.

AB  - The study analyses the effects of genotypes and performance of boars in individual test of the performance proper on their culling. High culling rate of animals during rearing brings about, except economic losses, also the problems in the formation of lines and rotating of boars, as in breeding work as a whole.
   The results of experiment were Obtained on the basis of individual test of the performance proper [60 days]. In the trial, performed in special rearing house, 194 boar piglets breeding crossbreds of the F1 generation [SL-F2] from the crossing LB X DU were tested. Two types of feeding were used - ad libitum and semi-ad libitum. In semi-ad libitum feeding, the daily feed ration was administered twice. 151 boar piglets were tested for ad libitum feeding, 43 boar piglets for semi - ad libitum. In both types of feeding, dry granulated mixture APP containing 15.6 % SNL was used. The beginning of an individual test was determined from the weight of 30 kg onwards. The test lasted 80 days. After its finishing, the boar piglets were placed from individual boxes into group ones [3 to 4 boars in each box] where the same kind of feed mixture was fed, only feeding was changed for standard and meal feeding twice a day. Boars were housed in group boxes to the tests of performance proper [average daily weight gain, average back fat height, pH value of meat by bioptic method].
   The studied set of animals was divided into six groups according to the way of feeding and the combination of parental crossbreds.
   [GRAPHICS]
   The culling rate of potential breeding animals was recorded during the tests in dependence on their genotype and the level of performance gained.
   The results obtained are presented in Tabs. I to V.
   It follows from the results that of 194 tested boar piglets, 88 boars were demonstrated on the purchase markets. [45.4 %], 61 breeding boars were intended for further breeding [31.5 %].
   The most frequent reasons for culling were unrepresentativeness, unsuitable constitution, exterior defects [zootechnical reasons] and disorders of locomotor apparatus [in particular of rear legs].
   The higher rate of culled animals was recorded in boar piglets of higher generations of crossing. The lowest rate of culled was observed in boars fed semi-ad libitum feed rations [48.5 % of culled]. The number of culling boar piglets was of rising tendency with increased growth intensity in the test. Average daily weight gains above 940 g were associated with about 70 per cent culling of animals, whereas, at the same time, the rate of culled animals [boars] was higher as a result of disorders in locomotor apparatus, especially in pelvic legs.
   By decreasing the average back fat height below 18 mm, the ratio of culled boars caused by disorders in locomotor apparatus was increasing, whereas a lower number of culled animals as a result of unsuitable exterior and performance type was observed in this group [Tab. IV].
   In evaluating the effects of gained pH value of meat [biopsy], the tendency for higher ratio of culling [58.3 %] was found in boars where the pH value of meat was below 5.60. There was no significant dependence in other subgroups when the ratio of culled animals was ranging from 52.4 to 55.6 % of the number of stopped boars Tab. V. Other culling reasons death losses, forced slaughtering, other health reasons formed higher ratio of culling in boars having the pH values of meat up to 5.70. This can be explained probably by increased sensitivity of animals in these subgroups to the environmental conditions.
   High ratio of culled potential breeding animals in the rearing worsens economic parameters of rearing and selective progress in most significant indicators. Symptoms of leg weakness, unsuitable type, constitution and appearance are affected by several factors. More attention will be paid to problems of reasons of boar culling, especially in association with extanding capacity of central testing stations with individual housing. In analyses of culling reasons, it will be necessary to use objective methods of classifying the disorders of legs which could simplify and at the same time, make more accurate diagnostics in the testing facilities.

AB  - The increase in natural gas consumption by the general public and industry development, in particular the petrochemical and chemical industries, has made increasing the world interest in using gas replacement for natural gas, both as mixtures of flammable gases and gas mixtures as LPG with air (SNG - Synthetic Natural Gas). Economic analysis in many cases prove that to ensure interchangeability of gas would cost less than the increase in pipeline capacity to deliver the same quantity of natural gas. In addition, SNG systems and installations, could be considered as investments to improve security and flexibility of gas supply. Known existing methods for determining the interchangeability of gases in gas gear based on Wobbe index, which determines the heat input and the burning rate tide, which in turn is related to flame stability. Exceeding the Wobbe index of a value increases the amount of carbon monoxide in the exhaust than the permissible concentration. Methods of determining the interchangeability of gases is characterized by a gas in relation to the above-described phenomena by means of quantitative indicators, or using diagrams interchangeability, where the gas is characterized by the position of a point in a coordinate system. The best known method for determining the interchangeability of gases is Delbourg method, in which the gas is characterized by the revised (expanded) Wobbe Index (Wr), the combustion potential, rate of soot formation (I-ch) and the ratio of the formation of yellow ends (I-j). Universal way to determine the interchangeability of gas is also Weaver accounting method. It does not require determination of the reference gas. It is designed for utensils for household gas and gas pressure p = 1.25 kPa.
   The criteria and definition of gas interchangeability volatility in practice to the combustion in a gas gear. In the case of gas exchange in industrial furnaces, interchangeability criteria are usually not very useful because of other conditions of combustion and heat exchange. In industrial reheating furnace gas is combusted in a sealed combustion chambers. Air supply is regulated. The exhaust gases are discharged into canals and the chimney to the atmosphere. The temperature difference between load (fuel gas) and the flame is much less than in the case of gas household appliances. In the furnace heat exchange takes place mainly by radiation in 85% to 95%. The value of heat flux flowing from the gas to a heated charge is not proportional to the heat load burners. Interchangeability of gas is linked by adding to natural gas, a certain amount of gas that is a substitute for natural gas in meeting the criteria for substitution in order to ensure certainty of supply of natural gas to customers. Gases that can be used in the processes of blending and used as replacement gases are mainly a mixture of propane and propane - butane (LPG - Liquid Petroleum Gas), landfill gas or biogas (LFG - Landfill Gas) and dimethyl ether (DME). One of the more well-known gas mixtures used in many countries around the world to compensate for peak demands is a mixture containing about 75% of natural gas and approximately 25% propane / air (LPG / air). Also in Poland is prepared to amend the provisions in this regard (at this moment oxygen in the gas network can not exceed 0.2%).
   In this paper, the calculations of interchangeability of gas mixtures LFG - LPG and LPG - air (SNG) for natural gas was made. It was determined whether the analyzed mixtures have similar stable flame zones regardless of the quality of LFG fuel and whether they may in whole or in part replace CH4, without any modification of equipment suction air for combustion. The obtained results will determine whether the fuel can be used as a replacement for natural gas used in such household appliances and, possibly, industrial burners. In connection with the possibility of changes in the quality of LFG, depending on such factors as storage time, as pre-treatment, will be determined the degree of interchangeability of LFG as a fuel mixed with regard to its quality.

AB  - This study examined the influence of the structure of new ventures' entered industries on eight alternative measures of new venture performance for 199 high potential independent new ventures. Each of the 199 entrepreneurial ventures had undertaken an initial public offering (IPO) within the first 6 years of the venture's founding date and were free of corporate sponsorship or prior corporate parentage.
   Specifically, this research examined the influence of (1) stage of the life cycle; (2) industry concentration; (3) entry barriers; and (4) product differentiation on eight alternative measures of new venture performance. The eight measures of new venture performance examined in this research consisted of (1) change in sales; (2) sales level; (3) net profit; (4) earnings before interest and taxes; (5) return on sales; (6) return on assets; (7) return on invested capital; and (8) return on equity.
   Most prior research examining the influence of industry structure an new venture performance has: (I) utilized only one or two measures of new venture performance as indicators of the venture's overall effectiveness and efficiency; (2) often failed to provide theoretical justification for the measure(s) of new venture performance or industry structure examined; and (3) utilized data derived from questionnaires and/or the PIMS data base of corporate-sponsored new ventures. In addition, prior industry structure studies examining independent new ventures have often utilized relatively small sample sizes.
   This study sought to advance the progress in the field of entrepreneurship with regard to understanding the influence of the structure of new ventures' entered industries on new venture performance by: (I) examining eight alternative measures of new venture performance; (2) providing theoretical justification for the measures of new venture performance and industry structure examined; and (3) utilizing the largest nonquestionnaire data base of independent new ventures developed to date.
   This research found that the stage of the life cycle of the venture's entered industry was the most important determinant of new venture performance among the four industry structural elements examined. Stage of the life cycle had a statistically significant relationship, at a 0.05 level, with the majority of the new venture performance measures examined in this research. In addition, ventures entering industries in the introductory stage of the life cycle achieved the highest levels of venture performance, particularly when compared with those ventures that entered industries in the mature stage of the life cycle.
   However, this study did not find a statistically significant relationship between stage of the life cycle and change in sales. This suggests that there is a trade-off between profitability and sales growth, and that new ventures that undertake an IPO have a stronger focus on achieving profitable operations rather than sales growth during the initial years after their IPO. This may be due to pressures placed on the new ventures to achieve profitability by the external credit market.
   Conversely, this research found that: (I) industry concentration; (2) entry barriers; and (3) product differentiation did not have statistically significant relationships, ata 0.10 level, with any of the eight alter native measures of new venture performance examined in this research. However, this research did find that over 90% of the new ventures entered industries characterized by: (I) a low degree of industry concentration and (2) a high degree of product differentiation.
   The relative absence of new venture entry into industries characterized by: (I) high degrees of concentration and (2) low degrees of product differentiation provides support for prior theory, which suggests that successful entry into such industry environments may be substantially more difficult
   In sum, the results of this research suggest that high potential independent new ventures that undertake an IPO should enter industries in the introductory stage of the life cycle. Irt addition, the results of this research suggest that industries characterized by: (I) relatively low degrees of industry concentration and (2) highly heterogenous products may be necessary but not sufficient conditions for successful entry by high potential independent new ventures seeking to mise equity capital through an IPO.

AB  - 1. Diatoms are recognised as indicators in temperate streams, but only recently have assessments begun of their value in indicating stream quality in the tropics and sub-tropics. Here, we extend previous studies by assessing stream diatom assemblages in relation to water quality and habitat character in the Kathmandu Valley, and in the Middle Hills of Nepal and northern India. We also assessed whether the U.K. Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) was sufficiently portable to reveal pollution in Himalayan rivers. In the more urbanised and highly agricultural Kathmandu Valley, we compared diatom response to water quality classes indicated by a local invertebrate index, the Nepalese Biotic Score (NEPBIOS).
   2. Thirty and 53 streams in the Kathmandu Valley (2000) and Middle Hills (1994-96), respectively, were sampled in October and November during stable flows following the monsoon. Diatoms were collected in riffles, water samples taken for chemical analysis, and habitat character of the stream channel, bank and catchment assessed using river habitat surveys. In the Kathmandu Valley, macroinvertebrates were collected by kick-sampling.
   3. In total, 113 diatom taxa were found in the Kathmandu Valley streams and 106 in the Middle Hills. Of 168 taxa recorded, 62 occurred only in the Kathmandu Valley, 56 only in the Middle Hills and 50 were common to both areas. Most taxa found only in the Kathmandu Valley belonged to the genus Navicula while most taxa confined to the Middle Hills were Achnanthes, Fragilaria and Gomphonema.
   4. In the Kathmandu Valley, richness and diversity increased significantly with K, Cl, SO4 and NO3, but declined significantly with Al, Fe, surfactants and phenols. Richness here also varied with habitat structure, being lowest in fast flowing, shaded streams with coarse substrata in forested catchments. In all streams combined, richness increased significantly with Si, Na and PO4, but declined significantly with increasing pH, Ca and Mg.
   5. Diatom assemblage composition in the Kathmandu Valley strongly reflected water chemistry as revealed by cations (K, Na, Mg, Ca), anions (Cl, SO4), nutrients (NO3, PO4, Si), and also substratum composition, flow character and catchment land use. The commonest taxa in base-poor forested catchments were Achnanthes siamlinearis, A. subhudsonis, A. undata and an unidentified Gomphonema species; Cocconeis placentula and Navicula minima in agricultural catchments; and Mayamaea atomus var. alcimonica, M. atomus var. permitis, and Nitzschia palea at polluted sites near settlements. Diatom assemblages in none-agricultural catchments of the Kathmandu Valley and Middle Hills were similar, but they contrasted strongly between urban or agricultural catchments of the Kathmandu Valley and the less intensively farmed catchments of the Middle Hills.
   6. In keeping with variations in assemblage composition, most streams in the Kathmandu Valley had higher TDI values (33-87, median = 64) and more pollution tolerant taxa (0-78%, median = 16) than streams in the Middle Hills (25-82, median 45, 0-26%, median = 2). TDI values correlated significantly with measured PO4, Si, and Na concentrations in the Kathmandu Valley, and with Si and Na concentrations in the Middle Hills. There was some consistency between water quality classes revealed by NEPBIOS and diatoms, but also some contrast. Water quality class I-II sites had lower TDI values and were less species rich than water quality II sites, however, there were no significant differences in detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) assemblage scores and relative abundances of pollution tolerant taxa between NEPBIOS classes.
   7. While diatoms in the Middle Hills indicate unpolluted or only mildly enriched conditions, they reveal pronounced eutrophication and organic pollution in the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. In addition, diatoms appear to respond to altered habitats in rural agricultural and urban areas. As demands on water resources in this region are likely to increase, we advocate the continued development of diatoms as indicators using methods based on what appear to be consistent responses in the TDI between Europe and the Himalaya.

AB  - Types of rock, such as komatiite, which formed entirely or dominantly during restricted time periods in solar system history, are important indicators of how planetary bodies evolved in deep time. In this paper we characterize three different types of temporally-restricted anorthosites, and discuss their significance to the broad scale evolution of planetary processes. Primordial anorthosites, which constitute the bulk of the lunar crust, were sampled during Apollo and Luna missions, and have subsequently been identified in our meteorite collections. They are characterized by very calcic plagioclase (An(93-98)), and all have magmatic crystallization ages > 4.3 Ga, suggesting that the earliest planetary crust-forming processes on the Moon, and possibly elsewhere, involved substantial, if not total melting. The "magma ocean" hypothesis, which has endured for nearly 50 years, argues that the lunar anorthositic rocks represent global flotation cumulates of plagioclase, which crystallized after extensive precipitation and sinking of olivine and pyroxene. Another possibility, revitalized by critical filtering of age data, involves "serial magmatism", whereby the lunar crust was constructed by younger, smaller, episodic magmatic events. On Earth, two distinct types of temporally-restricted anorthosites offer opportunities to understand the evolution of terrestrial geodynamics, tectonics and magmatic processes. Archean megacrystic anorthosites formed only between 3.73 and 2.49 Ga as small bodies ( < 500 km(2)) associated with the mafic magmatic assemblages of many greenstone belts. They are typified by accumulations of equidimensional, almost spherical megacrysts (1-30 cm across) of calcic plagioclase (An(61-94), avg. An(80)) in a mafic groundmass of broadly basaltic composition, and probably formed in shallow magma chambers. The unusually calcic plagioclase compositions may reflect crystallization from hydrous and/or Ca-rich basaltic parents that were fractionated derivatives of more primitive magmas, possibly even komatiites. Isotopic and geochemical data for many Archean anorthosite complexes indicate little to no evidence for contamination by silicic continental crust, suggesting magma formation in oceanic environments, most likely by subduction in oceanic arcs. Their temporal restriction might be explicable in terms of a hotter or wetter Archean mantle, especially if a genetic connection to komatiites can be. demonstrated. Alternatively, higher Archean heat flow may have influenced oceanic crustal thickness, subduction rate, sites of magma generation and/or melt composition, producing favorable conditions for the generation of calcic megacrystic anorthosites. Proterozoic massif-type anorthosites are distinctly different from other anorthosite types, and occur as small plutons (1-10 km(2)), to large (up to 18,000 km(2)) composite batholiths, that are temporally restricted to a 2000 m.y. period between similar to 0.5 and similar to 2.6 Ga. The rocks are dominated by lath-shaped, intermediate plagioclase (An(30-78), avg. An(53)), with lesser pyroxenes and/or olivine. There is extensive evidence from petrology, geochemistry and isotope data for variable contamination with continental crust, and the most plausible physical model involves deep-crustal ponding of basaltic magmas, crystallization and sinking of mafic silicates, and eventual flotation of buoyant plagioclase.
   Massifs were constructed by the coalescence of plagioclase-rich mushes, which ascended to mid crustal emplacement sites. The basaltic parent melts or magmas for massif-type anorthosites were mantle-derived; alternative models involving melting of crustal sources, mafic or otherwise, cannot be supported. Collective features most readily support an Andean-type continental arc setting, and careful geochronology is beginning to suggest that magmatism in individual massifs may have occurred over long time-scales of up to 100 m.y. The onset of massif-type anorthosite formation at similar to 2.6 Ga probably reflects global secular cooling of the Earth, resulting in increased lithospheric strength and crustal thickness, which promoted Moho-depth ponding and slow crystallization of basaltic magmas in continental arc environments. The apparent disappearance of anorthosite massifs at similar to 0.5 Ga may also relate to global secular cooling that changed the thermal structure of subduction zones, and promoted the onset of high and ultra-high pressure metamorphism.

AB  - Quaternary molluscs are useful tools as indicators of environmental and climatic changes through time. The Patagonian coastal area exhibits a series of Quaternary marine terraces (MT) at various elevations with a well-preserved molluscan fauna. The assemblages from Mid- to Late Pleistocene and Holocene raised beach deposits exposed between Bahia Vera and Bahia Camarones (44.2 degrees S-45 degrees S) were examined, and systematic, palaeoecological and palaeobiogeographical aspects were reviewed and updated in terms of interpretation of the littoral area and biotic responses to climate changes. Collections at 10 fossiliferous localities and four modem sites of the adjacent nearshore show that molluscs (41 taxa: 24 gastropods and 17 bivalves) represent 91% of the total faunal content. Identification of the typical taxa for at least four sea-level highstands was based on the occurrence, relative abundance, species richness, and diversity indices (Margaleff's; Sannon Weaver's). Variations between terraces MTIII (Camarones, higher than +30 m, probably ca. 400 ka), IV (Punta Pescadero and Camarones,+22-29 m, 178-239 ka), V (Bahia Vera, Punta Pescadero, Camarones,+16-18 m, 92-135 ka) and VI (Punta Loberia, Punta Pescadero, Camarcones,+6-12 m, 2.5-8 ka) add to a better understanding of palaeoenvironments and palaeoclimates linked to sea-level highstands since MOISII. Their original habitat was typical of rocky-shore, high-energy and euhaline waters, similar to the modem conditions of adjacent benthic communities. The most characteristic taxa are: Patinigera deaurata (Gm.), Fissurella spp., Crepidula protea d'Orb., C. acideata (Gm.), C cf. unguiformis Lam., Natica isabelleana d'Orb., Trochita pileus (Lam.), Buccinanops spp., Pareuthria phumbea (Philippi), Acanthina monodon (Pallas) and Trophon spp. (Gastropoda); Brachidontes purpuratus (Lam.), Protothaca antiqua (King), Clausinella gayi (Hupe), Mactra aff. patagonica (d'Orb.) and Ostrea tehuelcha (Feruglio). New records in this area for the Late Pleistocene are: C aculeata (Gin.), C onyx Sow., C. protea d'Orb., T patagonica (d'Orb.). N. isabelleana (d'Orb.), B. rodriguezi (d'Orb.), A. tehuelchus (d'Orb.) and C. gayi (Hupe). Ostrea tehuelcha d'Orb. became extinct and Tegula atra (Lesson), IV. isabelleana (d'Orb.), B. rodriguezi (d'Orb.), C. patagonica (d'Orb.) and D. vilardeboana (d'Orb.) migrated into the area. Exclusive for MTIII (MOIS11) are Pectinidae indet., Ostrea tehuelcha and Mactra cf patagonica d'Orb. which, together with other taxa (i.e., Corbula patagonica, Diplodonta vilardeboana), suggest warmer sea surface temperature (SST) than at present. Typical of MTIV (MOIS7) are T atra, biggest R antiqua (King), and Veneroida indet. The assemblage from MTV (MOIS5c?, 5a?), T. atra, T. patagonica, C. dilatata Lamk., M. edulis Linn., B. purpuratus, P. antiqua, and P. rostratus (Koch), is not indicative of a climatic optimum and thus of the Last Interglacial maximum highstand (MOIS5e). MTVI (MOIS1) is characterized by B. cf. purpuratus, N. (Patinigera) magellanica (Gm.), N. (R) deaurata (Gm.), Trophon geversianus (Pallas), B. purpuratus, and Aulacomya atra (Molina). N. delicatissima (Strebel), Chlamys sp., Panopea abbreviata, and Lyonsia sp. exclusively occur in the modem nearshore. According to the global isotope curve, MOIS5e highstand (125 ka BP) was the warmest since the Mid-Pleistocene. The innermost MTIII assemblage provides an opportunity to hypothesize that along the eastern coast of South America the corresponding highstand (probably MOIS11, ca.
   400 ka BP ?) belongs to the warmest of the Pleistcene interglacials preserved, as proposed earlier for the Chilean coast (Ortlieb et al., 1996). This assemblage could be correlated with the Belgranense of the Bonaerensian littoral. The Holocene Climatic Optimum (5-8 ka) is confirmed to have influenced the littoral biota. A slightly higher SST (1-3 degrees C) implied atmospheric and palaeoceanographic changes, with a southwards shift of the dominant warm (Brazilian) and cool (Malvinas=Falkland) currents along the SWAtlantic and, consequently, of the Argentinean and Magellanean marine zoogeographical provinces.

AB  - The Valdorria carbonate platform, in northern Spain, features a well-preserved and continuous outcrop of a Bashkirian platform to basin transect During the Asatauian (late Bashkirian), the platform growth changed gradually from a progradational to an aggradational mode, recording 10 most likely short-eccentricity-controlled cyclothems. The fades of the platform-top and slope have been mapped, and the architecture of each cyclothem schematically reconstructed. The distribution of microbial carbonates (microbially mediated precipitates), skeletal (grazers/burrowers, corals/filter feeders, algae, foraminifera, Osagia-like oncoids and Thartarella-Terebella worm tubes) and non-skeletal grains (faecal pellets) has been quantified for the transgressive regressive periods of deposition (transgressive, maximum flooding, early and late regressive intervals) of each cyclothem.
   This study shows that the distribution of microbial carbonates, skeletal and non-skeletal grains along a carbonate platform transect is variable through time and mainly governed by a set of measurable interconnected factors regulating the local palaeoenvironments: the water depth and the wave energy (fades) along the platform profile (inner, outer, break, slope) during periods of sea-level fluctuations (transgressive to regressive intervals of deposition). Auloporid corals, siliceous sponges, phylloid algae and Osagia-like oncoids are characteristic of a low-energy environment situated from estimated palaeo-water depths of 25 to 80 metres below sea level (mbsl onward) that formed in the outer platform during the maximum-flooding intervals. Anthracoporella Archaeolithoporella boundstone is characteristic of the moderate-energy environments created in the horizontal inner-platform during the transgressive intervals. Microbially mediated precipitates are reliable indicators of the slope and Masloviporidium(?) indicator of low-energy environments of the upper slope. On the platform-top, Ungdarella and Donezella are more abundant during the early regressive intervals than during any other interval. Stacheoids are mainly present in the water depth range of 10 to 60 mbsl, tournayellids from 15 to 35 mbsl and archaediscids from 15 to 75 mbsl, all in low- to moderate-energy conditions. Rugose corals are common in the water depth range of 5 to 35 mbsl, either during the transition from the early to the late regressive intervals, as solitary forms or forming boundstone, or during periods of higher sea-level stand, as solitary forms in floatstone. Fenestellids, fistuliporids and trilobites occur mainly in the slope, but are also common in the platform top during the maximum flooding and/or the early regressive intervals. Archaeolithoporella is a reliable indicator of the platform top deposits, but its abundance is closely linked to the presence of adequate substrates. A high abundance in the assemblage of gastropods, endothyrids, palaeotextulariids, bradyinids and fusulinids characterizes the platform top shallow-water coated-grain grainstones formed under high-energy currents during the late regressive intervals. Tetrataxids act as encrusters on microbial precipitates of the slope or on phylloid algae and Archaeolithoporella of the platform top, but are also observed as nuclei of coated grains. Brachiopods are more abundant in low- to moderate energy and 35 to 55 mbsl environments that prevailed during the transgressive intervals. Faecal pellets were commonly observed in low-energy environments, from 50 to 325 mbsl, at the platform break and in the slope, and the same applies for Thartarella-Terebella worm tubes that are virtually absent in high-energy deposits. Finally, crinoids, lasiodiscids and tuberitinids are randomly distributed and are not indicative of any specific environment.
   The here well-constrained distribution patterns of microbial carbonates, skeletal and non-skeletal grains in Valdorria outcrop hold the potential to serve as a reference for interpretation of depositional environments of other platforms using biota associations and depositional texture, particularly in regions where the platform geometry is not preserved or is not fully exposed.

AB  - Identifying and mapping the location, extent, severity, and causal agent of forest change events is necessary for obtaining a wide range of information. Using 6 ecologically representative test sites (each approximate to 800km(2)) in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, for the period 1998-2012, our objective was to prototype an object-based approach for identifying spectral change features, filling data gaps in Landsat reflectance annual best-available-pixel (BAP) composites, and attributing change processes to the derived stand-like spatial objects. The tasseled cap angle (TCA), which combines information from the visible, near-infrared, and midinfrared, enabled the description of landscape condition and its temporal derivative, the process indicator (PI), relates the rate and directionality of change at the landscape level. Data gaps, as well as anomalous values identified using time-series similarity analysis with dynamic time warping and cross-correlation measures, were replaced by spatiotemporal interpolation, resulting in annual proxy composites with no missing values. An assessment of proxy values against surface reflectance values indicated high agreement for reflectance bands (R = 0.79-0.96, RMSE = 0.005-0.021) and for TCA (R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.005), and a decrease in reliability of the proxy value as the size of the spatiotemporal gap increased, with longer temporal gaps having a greater impact on infill reliability than larger spatial gaps. Distinctive change dynamics of the sample sites were captured, demonstrating a capacity to simultaneously identify low and high magnitude changes as well as positive (e.g., growth) and negative (e.g., wildfire) trajectories using the PI. The approach presented herein provides a robust option for monitoring forest change by simultaneously describing state and ongoing change processes.Resume. L'identification et la cartographie de la localisation, de l'etendue, de la gravite et de l'agent causal des evenements de changements des forets sont necessaires pour un large eventail de besoins d'information. En utilisant 6 sites ecologiquement representatifs (d'environ 800km(2) chacun) en Saskatchewan, au Canada, de 1998 a 2012, notre objectif etait de developper une approche basee sur l'objet pour identifier les caracteristiques de changements spectraux, de combler les donnees manquantes dans des composites annuels de meilleur pixel disponible (BAP) de Landsat pour la reflectance, et d'attribuer les processus de changements aux objets spatiaux derives. Le << tasseled cap angle >> (TCA), qui combine les informations du visible, du proche infrarouge et de l'infrarouge moyen, a permis la description de l'etat du paysage et sa derivee temporelle, le << process indicator >> a permis la description des taux et la direction des changements au niveau du paysage. Les lacunes dans les donnees, ainsi que les valeurs anomales qui ont ete identifiees en utilisant l'analyse de similarite de series temporelles avec le << dynamic time warping >> et les mesures d'intercorrelation, ont ete remplacees par l'interpolation spatio-temporelle, qui a conduit a des composites d'estimateurs annuels sans valeurs manquantes. Une evaluation des valeurs d'estimateurs contre les valeurs de reflectance de surface a indique un accord eleve pour les bandes de reflectance (R = 0.79-0.96, RMSE = 0.005-0.021) et pour le TCA (R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.005), et une diminution de la fiabilite des valeurs d'estimateurs lorsque la taille de l'ecart spatio-temporelle augmente.
   Les plus longues lacunes temporelles ayant un plus grand impact sur la fiabilite de remplissage que les lacunes spatiales plus grandes. Les dynamiques de changement distinctives des sites d'echantillonnage ont ete capturees, demontrant une capacite a identifier simultanement les changements de magnitudes faibles et elevees ainsi que des trajectoires positives (par exemple, la croissance) et negatives (par exemple, feu de foret) a l'aide du PI. L'approche presentee ici fournit une option robuste pour le suivi des changements forestiers en decrivant simultanement l'etat actuel et les processus de changements.

AB  - This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3) radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determinations of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry.
   The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establish the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quality discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence (eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented.
   The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Method for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information.
   The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH.
   The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants.

AB  - Title of the paper: Height growth features of spruce and other tree species which do not depend on site factors.
   There is a long tradition in forest sciences to concentrate on the investigation of aggregated processes. The aim was according to ALEXANDER v. HUMBOLDT "to find out the mean state around which because of the seeming freedom of nature all phenomenon oscillate within narrow limits". Especially this approach has been used in the construction of yield tables. In this contribution the important role of the height of the tree X(m) and the age t(m) at the maximum of the increments is shown for the analysis of the tree height growth. The used method of the determination of these parameters by the help of growth data series is described.
   With the help of examples it will be shown, that the growth curves for mean values of the height of spruces and also the growth curves for stand heights of spruces become nearly identically after a simple trans formation of the axes independent of the site quality. After this transformation the age is practically measured in units of the age reached when the maximum of increments appears and the height is measured in units of that height which was reached at the entrance of the maximum of increments. This speaks for a unique growth principle of spruces independent from the site. Furthermore it follows that the influence of different characteristics of sites oil the growth of the height of trees leads essentially only to a change of the age t(m) and the height X(m) at the entrance of the maximum of the increments.
   An equal result has been obtained for red oaks. Their transformed growth Curve is nearly in agreement with the unique transformed growth curve for spruces. For additional tree species (fir, red beech and douglas fir) indications have been found that their transformed growth curves also are in rough agreement with the corresponding unique growth curve for spruces. This indicates possibly an additional unique growth principle which only weakly depends on the tree species.
   The important role of the time t(m) at which the maximum of increments appears for description of the growth of tree heights was already pointed out by BACKMAN in 1943. But for the second important parameter he used the value of the maximum of the increments max(dX/dt) instead of the height of the tree X(m) reached at the moment t(m) when the maximum of increments appears.
   The findings reported here may be used in different ways for forestry and for forest science. But first of all they should be checked by the help of additional growth data on trees and stands. Having this in mind just a few possible examples for an application of the mentioned findings shall be mentioned:
   1. The data collected on different test areas may be integrated after the transformation (I).
   2. It seems to be hopeful to find out the future growth curve of a site using step by step the growth data in the early growth period by looking for a couple of t(m) and X(m) which transforms the data by (1) to the state independent growth curve.
   3. Stable sites may be distinguished from influenced sites e. by climate change) by comparing their transformed growth a a series.
   4. Looking for a relation between I. and X., one may try to characterize a site influence on the growth of tree heights only by one parameter.
   5. First attempts indicate that transformation (1) may be successful applied to other growth indicators also.
   For the precise determination of the transformation parameters t(m) and X(m) a sufficient number of measurements of the growth indicator before and after t(m) are necessary. This should be taken into account for further applications of the described transformation.

AB  - Region 2 comprises arctic and subarctic North America and is underlain by continuous or discontinuous permafrost. Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4 degrees C in summer and 9 degrees C in winter for a 2 x CO? scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of >1 degrees C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warning would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive, Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America.
   There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The primary purpose of this research article is to present existing and forecasted sustainability indicators for Guyana in order to assess the country's sustainable development pathway. Genuine Savings, Carbon Emissions and Forest Cover were selected as appropriate measures of weak sustainability to investigate the country's sustainability trajectory. Further exploration of macro-economic variables such as natural capital stocks, wealth accumulation, resource rents and economic growth as empirical indicators, revealed that despite the effective forest management policies currently implemented in the country, Guyana is not on a sustainable pathway especially on the outlook for Genuine Savings. The country will experience an increase in economic growth primarily from the expansion of its oil sector. The potential boom in the economy from the non-renewable oil industry will provide a surge in foreign exchange that will require a robust investment structure to utilize resource rents in building the country's renewable capital stock. Positive Carbon Emission predictive trends emerging from this study are indicative of the country's growth towards more carbon intensive industries as the potential oil industry can stimulate a positive emission rating globally, indirectly from downstream industries on the international markets that purchases the country's oil.

AB  - Sanitation networks are extremely important infrastructures because of their function and capital-intensive nature. Indeed, network knowledge is essential for a reliable prioritization of maintenance work. In this context, this research work is interested in the evaluation and the prioritization of the defects of an Urban Sanitation Network (USN), taking into account the criteria of the FMECA method (failure mode and effects and criticality analysis), namely the probability of defect occurrence (P), the defect's detectability (D) and the defect impact (I). The methodology adopted is based on the combination of three methods: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) used to assign weights to FMECA criteria, the weighted product model (WPM) method to determine the defect impact and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution method (TOPSIS) to classify sanitation defects in descending order in order to prioritize maintenance interventions. A case study of a real sewerage project in the city of Bejaia (Algeria) essentially composed of eight non-visitable sections evaluated from television inspections was used to illustrate and validate the proposed model. The results show that the following defects: collapse, chemical attack, pipe surface degradation, and abrasion are considered as critical defects requiring immediate intervention due to their significant influence on the section performance rate, which is between 0%<= p<50%, contrary to the other studied parameters which present a performance rate of p>50%. These results prove that the combination of AHP-WPM-TOPSIS methods can be used to design an effective management and maintenance system.

AB  - Access to irrigation is considered critical for agricultural growth in Bangladesh. Solar-powered irrigation system (SPIS) has emerged as a promising technology for sustainable irrigation practice in the country. This study reports the factors that affect the adoption process of SPIS in the farming community. It also explores the impact of SPIS projects on the livelihood status of the farmers. In this regard, 140 farmers were directly interviewed from the Meherpur district of Bangladesh. Random sampling techniques were followed, and probit model analysis was conducted to identify the socio-economic factors that affect the adoption process. Capital and composite livelihood indices were prepared to examine the impact of SPIS projects on farmers' livelihood status. The result shows that education and extension services had a statistically positive effect on adoption. By contrast, access to credit, farm size, and off-farm income had a significantly negative impact on the adoption process. The result also shows that farmers using solar-powered irrigation technology had a better livelihood index in different indicators, i.e., human, social, natural, and technical capital, than diesel-powered irrigation system users.

AB  - In today's creative economy, ideas and intellectual capital have replaced natural resources, and human creativity is the ultimate source of economic growth. Creative Capital selects specific cities and regions for work and living, known as creative cities; Cities that have the greatest capacity to attract, retain and nurture creative capital. This research aims to assess where Teheran stands both internationally and nationally among the most creative cities, known for their capacity to attract, retain and nurture creative economy, ideas and intellectual capital. First, a creative city framework is developed based on a review of 11 existing creative city indices. Second, based on their frequency of use, relevance and data availability 40 indicators were identified and computed. Using the VIKOR Method, an effective multi-criteria decision-making approach for diverging indicators, a national and international benchmarking analysis is performed on Teheran and selected cities. Results from the national benchmarking suggest that Teheran generally outperform the other Iran metropolis in 16 indicators. However, results from the international benchmarking show mix findings, where Teheran is well ranked in the human capital factor, and needs improvement in other factors including territorial assets, tolerance and resilience, and R&D and technology. Policy implications are discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent organisations disclose on accountability for biodiversity and species extinction (B/E). We present some examples of what disclosure looks like from forward-thinking companies that have been engaging in tremendous efforts to protect and preserve nature. Our justification for this paper is to provide guidance and encourage other companies to disclose transparently. We believe that B/E accountability is essential in post Covid-19 reporting as the lack of valuing, promoting and investing in biodiversity is considered to be one of the main drivers of the Covid-19 pandemic. The study's sample is the Top 200 companies from the Fortune Global with the years 2012, 2014 and 2016 and companies' websites in 2019. We believe that our paper is providing some guidance on how to repair nature and eliminate biodiversity loss. This is because organisations are reliant on natural capital resources for survival. Also, biodiversity loss and extinction can significantly affect social, economic and financial viability for survival. Our results have some implications for practitioners, policymakers and academics.

AB  - We consider a spatial extension of genuine savings and wealth as a capital-based indicator of sustainability. In both inefficient and efficient economies, where well-being is locally or globally maximized, respectively, the well-known Hotelling rule and Hartwick (Dixit-Hammond-Hoel) investment rules and results are extended, depending on the extent of the spatial diffusion of natural capital. It is shown that the net present value of any future change in neighboring resource stocks affects the current change in intergenerational well-being. Numerical examples show the relevance of such parameters as the diffusion rate, discount rate, and marginal utility of consumption. Moreover, they suggest the exact adjustments to be made in aggregating or disaggregating the sustainability of different spatial units, which is not addressed in the current practice of green or wealth accounting.

AB  - Purpose This research contributes to current debates on automation and the future of work, a much-hyped but under researched area, in emerging economies through a particular focus on India. It assesses the national strategy on artificial intelligence and explores the impact of automation on the Indian labour market, work and employment to inform policy. Design/methodology/approach The article critically assesses the National Strategy on AI, promulgated by NITI Aayog (a national policy think tank), supported by the government of India and top industry associations, through a sectoral analysis. The key dimensions of the national strategy are examined against scholarship on the political economy of work in India to better understand the possible impact of automation on work. Findings The study shows that technology is not free from the wider dynamics that surround the world of work. The adoption of new technologies is likely to occur in niches in the manufacturing and services sectors, while its impact on employment and the labour market more broadly, and in addressing societal inequalities will be limited. The national strategy, however, does not take into account the nature of capital accumulation and structural inequalities that stem from a large informal economy and surplus labour context with limited upskilling opportunities. This raises doubts about the effectiveness of the current policy. Research limitations/implications The critical assessment of new technologies and work has two implications: first, it underscores the need for situated analyses of social and material relations of work in formulating and assessing strategies and policies; second, it highlights the necessity of qualitative workplace studies that examine the relationship between technology and the future of work. Practical implications The article assesses an influential state policy in a key aspect of future of work-automation. Social implications The policy assessed in this study would have significant social and economic outcomes for labour, work and employment in India. The study highlights the limitations of the state policy in addressing key labour market dimensions and work and employment relations in its formulation and implementation. Originality/value This study is the first to examine the impact of automation on work and employment in India. It provides a critical intervention in current debates on future of work from the point of view of an important emerging economy defined by labour surplus and a large informal economy.

Drawing on panel data for 140 countries between 1990 and 2010, within-country analysis reveals that many countries convert their depleted natural capital sufficiently into human- and produced capital such that the comprehensive stock of wealth grows. However, some developed economies are struggling to harness their natural wealth for sustainable development. The policy implication is that there is no universally applicable recipe for the effective management of countries' natural resources. Countries that are poorly endowed with human- and produced capital, in particular, may have a window of opportunity in which natural capital depletion is temporarily able to foster rather than hamper sustainable development.

AB  - The paper examined the causal effects of macroeconomic predictors on the dividend return performance of the Nigerian Real Estate Investment Trusts (N-REITs) the macroeconomic indicators considered was interest rate (INTR), an exchange rate (EXGR), inflation rate (INFR), market capitalisation (MKCP) and all share index (ASI). The study is quantitative based on secondary data collected from various government institutions and annual financial reports of the Nigeria REITs for the study period (2008-2017). Autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) and Bound test were used to analyse the data. The result of the Bound test indicated that N-REIT, INTR and ASI with F-statistic values of 11.07, 5.71 and 4.18, respectively, co-integrated with other macroeconomic predictors, especially for the variable vectors. ASI with t-stat and prob. value 2.9491 and 0.0065, respectively, implies statistically significant contribution of ASI to REIT performance in the long run (p < 0.05). Through ECM, the series was good at convergence and nonexplosive series ect (-1): -4.98 and p-value 0.0000, the macroeconomic predictors have significant explanatory power on N-REIT performance in the short run. The no capital gain nature of the N-REIT constitutes a limitation in this study, while the competitive dividend return is the driving force for the study.

AB  - Bangladesh is one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries. The appraisal of household vulnerability and capacity to adapt under climate change is therefore crucial for developing effective disaster risk reduction policies. This study explored the nexus between vulnerability and capacity of rural drought-prone households using survey data of 400 respondents from northern Bangladesh. Through extensive rigorous literature review, 22 and 25 indicators were employed to develop the vulnerability and capacity index, respectively. Co-occurrence network analysis was employed to show the nexus among different classes of capacity and vulnerability. Spearman correlation was also performed to analyze the nexus between vulnerability and capacity. The results reveal that households' vulnerability varies across livelihood assets (human, social, financial, physical, and natural), but capacity follows a similar distribution pattern. A significant negative association was found between vulnerability and adaptive capacity, whereas the strong correlations between social and human capital, human and financial capital, social and financial capital, and physical and natural capital were identified in this study. Future projection (up to 2024) using support vector machine algorithm shows that overall drought adaptive capacity will increase, while vulnerability will decrease. The outcomes of this study would help planners and policy-makers in planning and taking proper initiatives that might be useful for adopting efficient disaster risk reduction strategies.

AB  - Residential gardens make up 30% of urban space in the UK, yet unlike many other green space typologies, their role in the health and well-being agenda has largely been overlooked. A horticultural intervention introduced ornamental plants to 38 previously bare front gardens (approximate to 10 m(2)) within an economically deprived region of North England, UK. Measures of perceived stress and diurnal cortisol profiles (as an indicator of health status) were taken preand post-intervention (over 3 months). Residents reported significant decreases in perceived stress post-intervention. This finding was aligned with a higher proportion of 'healthy' diurnal cortisol patterns post-intervention, suggesting better health status in those individuals. All residents derived one or more reported socio-cultural benefits as a result of the front garden plantings, although overall scores for subjective well-being did not increase to a significant level. Further qualitative data suggested that the gardens were valued for enhancing relaxation, increasing positive emotions, motivation, and pride of place. The results indicate that adding even small quantities of ornamental plants to front gardens within deprived urban communities had a positive effect on an individual's stress regulation and some, but not all, aspects of subjective well-being. The research highlights the importance of residential front gardens to human health and well-being, and thus their contribution to the wider debates around city densification, natural capital and urban planning.

AB  - Vulnerability to climate change is a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Econometric and indicator-based approaches have been used to assess vulnerability at regional, national and global scales. However, these approaches often fail to capture how vulnerability varies within regions and communities. Within regions there is often little capacity to distinguish between exposure and sensitivity, while there is potentially considerable variability in adaptive capacity. This study presents a new approach for assessing adaptive capacity at household and village-levels by combining econometric data and landscape ecology measures to generate new types of indicators that provide new insights into local level adaptive capacity. Livelihood security is a key contributor to adaptation and we used the sustainable livelihood framework as a basis for analysis. We combined social survey information with spatial data on different livelihood capitals and integrated these using multivariate statistical methods to generate indicators of adaptive capacity for households and villages. A mixed method approach was used in two contrasting localities in the Nikachu watershed in central Bhutan to gather social and economic data and spatial data on landscape variables. A total of 144 households were selected through simple random sampling and were interviewed across 22 villages in the watershed. Indicators revealed a strong link between adaptive capacity and landscape position. Households at higher elevations generally had lower adaptive capacity, and therefore higher vulnerability to climate change, due to differences in physical, financial, natural and human capitals. These households and villages had lower diversity in income sources, greater dependence on natural resources, less education and training, less access to infrastructure (such as roads), and access to markets than households at lower elevations. Gender was also important, with female headed households having lower adaptive capacity scores. However, some higher elevation households had higher adaptive capacity scores than others due to their capacity to collect the valuable insect fungus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, from high altitude meadows. These new indicators provide insights into how adaptive capacity varies across scales. They can be used to identify policies and actions to improve adaptive capacity of vulnerable households and communities.

AB  - The gross domestic product is usually the indicator used to measure economic progress worldwide. However, GDP growth does not necessarily reflect the well-being of a nation, since there are cases of countries where there is economic growth measured by GDP; But, there is poverty, unemployment and inequality. For this reason, we Calculated the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) using the information of Ecuador a Latin American developing country for the period 2001-2015. Additionally, we compared (ISEW) with the GDP as progress indicators, emphasizing the difference between welfare and economic growth. The results show that from the positive components, personal consumption is the one that contributes the most to the increase of ISEW, while the degradation of natural capital affects negatively, in a greater proportion, Ecuadorians welfare; the existence of the gap between the ISEW and the GDP is confirmed, so it's deduced that welfare in Ecuador is overestimated, demanding analysis and institutional reform.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (JA) is a crop with excellent potential for application in biorefineries. It can resist drought, pests, and diseases and can thrive well in marginal lands with little fertilizer application. The JA tubers contain considerable quantities of inulin, which is suitable for the production of inulooligosaccharides (IOS), as a high-value prebiotic, dietary fiber. In this study, five JA tuber biorefinery scenarios were simulated in Aspen Plus (R) and further evaluated by techno-economic and sensitivity analyses. Production of IOS, proteins and animal feed was studied in scenarios A and C, applying various biorefinery configurations. Scenario B explored the option of producing only IOS and the sale of residues as animal feed. Scenarios D and E investigated the economic potential of biofuel generation from residues after IOS and protein production by generation of biogas and ethanol respectively, from residues. Based on the chosen economic indicators, scenario B resulted in the lowest minimum selling price (MSP) of 3.91 US$ kg(-1) (market price 5.0 US$ kg(-1)) with correspondingly reduced total capital investment (TCI) and total operating cost (TOC) per mass unit produced of IOS of 18.91 and 2.59 US$ kg(-1) respectively, compared with other studied scenarios. Considering the set production scale, it is more profitable when the residues are sold as animal feed instead of being converted into biofuel, due to the capital-intensive nature of the biofuel production processes. The coproduction of protein had a negative impact on the economics of the process as the associated capital and operating expenditure outweighed the associated revenue.

AB  - Whether or not reduction of natural capital should be a focus in assessing relocation policies is addressed by investigating a resettlement project for disaster prevention (also for poverty alleviation) in Baihe County in western China. Using multiple linear regression, the associations between livelihood assets (including natural capital) and the acceptance of relocation policies are examined. Two index systems are employed to measure resettlers' livelihoods and policy acceptance. Livelihood assets are shown to have a positive relationship with resettlers' acceptance of relocation policies. Of the five indicators of livelihood assets, higher physical, social, human and financial capital correlate with increased policy acceptance, while natural capital does not. This suggests that reducing or losing natural resources does not necessarily increase the risk of impoverishment in the process of resettlement. Land-based resettlement could be an option but is not indispensable for the livelihood maintenance of resettlers.

AB  - Understanding the adaptive capacity (AC) of farmers is crucial to planning effective adaptation. Action to promote farmers' AC is required because climate change (CC) is resulting in unpredictable alterations in weather patterns. Based on the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF), this study explored how access to natural, physical, financial, social and human capitals enhances the AC. Quantitative data from 269 African indigenous vegetable (AIV) farmers in three selected agro-climatic zones in Kenya were analysed. Four indicators in each capital were selected based on previous studies and judgments collected from an expert online ranking survey (n = 35). The Kruskal-Wallis H test and an independent sample t-test were used to test the independence of AC scores and access to the different resources. The findings showed that the majority of farmers (53%) had a moderate AC, while fewer (32%) and (15%) had low or high AC levels respectively. Disparities in adaptive capacity scores were recorded between respondents in terms of their age, marital status and location. Farmers had high access to social capital but low access to financial, natural and human capitals. Female farmers showed lower capacities in the areas of financial, human and natural resources, while their male counterparts had low access to some human and social capitals. Resilient interventions that target individuals with low adaptive capacities are required.

AB  - Household dietary diversity (HDD) is an important nutrition outcome measuring the economic ability of a household to access a variety of foods during a determined period. For this, it has been increasingly used as indicator of food security. This paper examines the determinants of HDD. Data for this paper comes from the cross-sectional survey collected from two districts of Illu Ababora Zone, Oromia region of Ethiopia. Overall, 334 farm households of which 71 female headed households and 263 male headed households were surveyed. Twelve different food groups were used to calculate the HDD score, which is a continuous score ranging from 0 to 12. This score was then recoded to a three-level ordered categorical variable. Ordered probit, OLS regression and Poisson regression were used to check for robustness and consistency of the results. The result shows that human capital, natural capitals and physical capitals are the main explanatory factors for HDD variations in the study context. Mediating the utilization of livelihood assets, social relations, institutions, organizations, shocks and seasonality are also explaining variations in HDD. Livelihood strategies such as farm production diversity and non-farm income are significantly and positively influencing HDD. Similarly, livelihood outcomes such as meal frequency and household wealth status are also positively influencing HDD. The current promotion of export crops at the expense of crops diversity will hurt HDD given the apparent poor market-integration, rugged terrain, poor infrastructure development and fragmented institutional arrangements at the study areas.

AB  - The outcomes of subsidizing natural and fishing capital were studied in nearshore coral reef fisheries initiated by the devolution of governance and management from national to county governments. One county promoted a net subsidy program of preferred mesh sizes with a distinct purchase and distribution date, while the other supported the ongoing maintenance of fisheries closures. This provoked a BACI design where standard fisheries statistics were measured 3 years prior to and 2.5 years after the net subsidy, or the life expectancy of these nets. Only similar to 50% of the purchased nets were utilized, indicating a replacement rather than addition of capital and low need. For example, net fishing effort did not change and there was an overall demographic change in gear use away from traps toward lower cost spearguns. Net subsidized fisheries displayed a 9% increase in the mean length of captured fish but also a decline in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) and personal incomes and no change in prices, yields, and per area incomes. In contrast, the fisheries surrounding closures displayed increased fishing effort and a 4% decline in fish lengths but increased CPUE, yield, incomes, and per area revenues. The net cost of maintaining closures was less than the gear subsidy purchase. Significant time x treatment interactions in all indicators support the conclusion that gear subsidies, apart from larger fish sizes, worsened the fisheries, while closures improved it. Increased recruitment rather than growth of fish appeared to be the mechanism for improvement.

AB  - It is increasingly common to judge the sustainable development of nations by non-declining social well-being. Determinants of social well-being have been measured and used for sustainability analysis. In particular, inclusive wealth per capita, which comprises produced, human, and natural capital, was reported in the Inclusive Wealth Report in 2012 and 2014. Here, we report the updates of the third edition of the report, which covers 140 countries from 1990 to 2014. In per capita terms, only 60% out of 140 countries show non-declining wealth for the past quarter century. Most countries, both developed and developing, fall into the group of running down natural capital and increasing produced and, to a lesser extent, human capital. We also include fishery stock as part of natural capital, and we find that only a few countries have increased their fishery capital in the studied period. Inclusive wealth has typically grown much less than GDP per capita and does not resemble change in other development indices. Globally aggregated produced and human capital per capita increased 94% and 28%, respectively, while natural capital per capita declined by 34%. In 2014, produced, human, and natural capital account for 24%, 64%, and 11%, respectively, which is similar to the recent findings by the World Bank. In addition, inclusive wealth is approximately 12 times GDP on average, much higher than conventional wealth-income ratios globally, and is at least at par with those ratios in high-income countries under financialization.

AB  - The article describes a new methodology designed with the aim of finding a comprehensive, unobtrusive, and accurate way of capturing social recovery capital development in online communities of recovery from alcohol and drug (AOD) addiction. Recovery capital was conceptualised as both engagement in the online recovery community and identification with the community. To measure recovery capital development, naturally occurring data were extracted from the social media page of a specific recovery program, with the page being set up as a resource for a face-to-face recovery program. To map engagement with the online community, social network analysis (SNA) capturing online social interaction was performed. Social interaction was measured through the linkages between the online contributors/members of the online community as represented by program clients, staff, and supporters from the broader community. To capture markers of social identification with the online community, computerised linguistic analysis of the textual data (content from posts and comments) was conducted. Recovery capital captured in this way was analysed against retention data (a proxy outcome indicator), as days spent in the (face-to-face) recovery program. The online data extracted was linked to participant data in regards to program retention to test prediction of a key recovery outcome. This approach allowed the examination of the role of online support communities and assessment of the association between recovery capital (developed via the online community of recovery) and recovery outcomes.

AB  - Air pollution presents a major risk to human health, resulting in premature deaths and reduced quality of life. Quantifying the role of vegetation in reducing air pollution concentrations is an important contribution to urban natural capital accounting. However, most current methods to calculate pollution removal are static, and do not represent atmospheric transport of pollutants, or interactions among pollutants and meteorology. An additional challenge is defining urban extent in a way that captures the green and blue infrastructure providing the service in a consistent way. We developed a refined urban morphology layer which incorporates urban green and blue space. We then applied an atmospheric chemistry transport model (EMEP4UK) to calculate pollutant removal by urban natural capital for pollutants including PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O-3. We calculated health benefits directly from the change in pollutant concentrations (i.e. exposure) rather than from tonnes of pollutant removed. Urban natural capital across Britain removes 28,700 tonnes of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O-3. The economic value of the health benefits are substantial: 136 pound million in 2015, resulting from 900 fewer respiratory hospital admissions, 220 fewer cardiovascular hospital admissions, 240 fewer deaths and 3600 fewer Life Years Lost.

AB  - The Land Degradation-Neutrality (LDN) framework of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is underpinned by three complementary interactive indicators (metrics: vegetation cover, net primary productivity; NPP and soil organic carbon; SOC) as proxies for change in land-based natural capital. The LDN framework assumes that SOC changes slowly, primarily by decomposition and respiration of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, there is growing evidence that soil erosion by wind, water and tillage also reduces SOC stocks rapidly after land use and cover change. Here, we modify a physically-based wind erosion sediment transport model to better represent the vegetation cover (using land surface aerodynamic roughness; that is the plant canopy coverage, stone cover, soil aggregates, etc. that protects the soil surface from wind erosion) and quantify the contribution of wind erosion to global SOC erosion (2001-2016). We use the wind erosion model to identify global dryland regions where SOC erosion by wind may be a significant problem for achieving LDN. Selected sites in global drylands also show SOC erosion by wind accelerating over time. Without targeting and reducing SOC erosion, management practices in these regions will fail to sequester SOC and reduce land degradation. We describe the interrelated nature of the LDN indicators, the importance of including SOC erosion by wind erosion and how by explicitly accounting for wind erosion processes, we can better represent the physical effects of changing land cover on land degradation. Our results for Earth's drylands show that modelling SOC stock reduction by wind erosion is better than using land cover and SOC independently. Furthermore, emphasising the role of wind erosion in UNCCD and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporting will better support LDN and climate change mitigation and adaptation globally.

AB  - Attaching weights to the list of capital assets is crucial in inclusive wealth accounting and sustainability assessments. These weights, or shadow prices, can be constructed in theory by looking prospectively at future social profits that the capital in question is expected to yield. In practice, however, both backward- and forward looking shadow prices are used. This study confirms that these two approaches are theoretically equivalent under strong assumptions and reviews how and why the two approaches are taken. The two approaches are then applied to renewable energy capital (REC), which has rarely been done in either produced or natural capital accounting and sustainability assessments. Renewable energy capital provides an ideal example with which to compare the two approaches, as it is a class of produced capital that substitutes both produced and natural capital. The numerical results of both approaches demonstrate that renewable energy capital starts to account for as large a share as natural capital does, if not produced capital or inclusive wealth, in those countries where natural capital is poorly endowed and investment in renewable energy capital has been witnessed.

AB  - In this study, a gender analysis of various dimensions that affect the food security status of households in the villages of Kermanshah County was conducted based on a sustainable livelihood framework. The non-experimental research method involved data collection, which was performed to identify causal relationships. There were 25,671 households in the agricultural sector of the villages of Kermanshah County. Among them, 750 people (375 women and 375 men in 375 households) were selected as a proportional sample based on a stratified sampling method. A questionnaire was used for data collection. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by expert opinions, and its reliability was confirmed by sequential theta coefficients (0.714-0.838). Structural equation modeling was implemented based on the Multiple-Indicator, Multiple-Cause (MIMIC) Bayesian approach. Then, the structural MIMIC model was presented as the basis for comparison between two groups. The results of the research indicate that men had greater food security than women in terms of food availability, accessibility, and stability in the studied households. Men had more financial capital, social capital, and natural capital than women and were more affected by vulnerability and the transformation of structures and processes. Conversely, women had more human and physical capital and better livelihood strategies than men. Therefore, the economic empowerment of women and the professional training of men in the region should be prioritized to improve food security and development programs. These results can play a decisive role in the continuation or halting of programs for achieving food security and sustainable development.

AB  - The sustainable livelihood approach was introduced as a sustainable rural development approach in the late 1980s with the aim of poverty alleviation in the rural communities. This approach has offered a broad framework for assessing the various dimensions of sustainability. An important component of this framework is livelihood capitals in a way that it is not possible to achieve sustainable rural livelihood with no regard to the livelihood capitals and assets in rural areas. Thus, the purpose of this descriptive-analytic survey research was zoning the villages of the Central District of Dena County in terms of the sustainability of livelihood capitals. The statistical population of this study was 2500 rural households in the Central District of Dena County, of which 300 households were selected using cluster random sampling method with appropriate allocation based on Krejcie and Morgan's table. The research instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire whose face validity was confirmed by a panel of experts, and its reliability was confirmed in a pre-test and calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Findings of the research showed that, in most studied villages, 3 capitals (social, physical, and human) were above the average and 2 capitals (financial and natural) as well as the total capital was less than average. Additionally, there was a gap and heterogeneity between the villages in terms of social, human, natural capital as well as financial capital, whereas there was a homogeneity in terms of physical and total capital as well. Besides, the most studied villages were potentially unsustainable in terms of financial and natural capital, average level in terms of human and physical capital and total capital, and potentially sustainable in terms of social capital. In addition, cluster analysis to categorize villages indicated that 9, 4, and 7 villages were categorized as non-privileged, semi-privileged, and privileged, respectively. Furthermore, the result of Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) indicated that there was a significant difference between three categories of villages in terms of social, physical, financial and natural capital, and total capital. Therefore, non-privileged and semi-privileged villages should be given more consideration by planners, who need to pay more attention to regional planning than general planning.

AB  - Rural farm households in sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to climate variability due to their limited adaptive capacity. This paper explores how adaptation strategies are adopted by small-holders in sub-Saharan Africa as a function of their adaptive capacity. The latter is characterised by five types of capital: natural, physical, financial, human, and social. We use responses from farm households in sub-Saharan Africa dating from 1536 obtained by Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). This data provides information on the adoption of adaptation practices during the study period as well as information with which we develop indicators for the five types of capital. The results suggest that all the five types of capital positively influence adoption of adaptation practices. Human and social capital both displayed a positive and significant effect on the uptake of most adaptation practices. This finding suggests that the effect of less tangible kinds of capital such as knowledge, individual perceptions, farmers' networks and access to information may be stronger than normally assumed. Directing more development policies towards enhancing human and social capital may therefore be more cost-effective than further investments into physical and financial capital, and could help in overcoming social barriers to adaptation to climate change.

AB  - The advent of global financial crisis in 2008, unleashed volatile short term capital flows to the emerging markets. This has forced many central banks in the developing world to adopt innovative policy measures to address concerns related to financial instability caused by the volatile nature of capital flows. In 2010 Turkish Central Bank included financial stability in addition to price stability as one of primary goals of its monetary policy. Several macro-prudential measures had been taken and corridor system' of setting the short-term policy rates had been introduced. In this paper, we have estimated an extended Taylor rule, using error correction model, to examine the impact of global financial factors in impacting the setting up of the policy rate in the pre and post 2010 periods in Turkey. It has been found that in the post-2010 period, global financial factors and monetary policy stance of the core economy, USA, have become major factor(s) in shaping up the monetary policy. Particularly our results of variance decomposition show that global financial indicators such as, VIX and EMBI have taken prominence in the setting of the short-term policy rate. This has not only made the domestic monetary more dependent on external factors but has also made pro-cyclical in nature.

AB  - Sustainability can be assessed by non-declining inclusive wealth, which refers to man-made capital, human capital, natural capital, and all other types of capital that are sources of human well-being. As the previous studies-including Arrow et al. (J Econ Perspect 18(3): 147-172, 2004) and the Inclusive Wealth Report (2012 and 2014)-suggest, total factor productivity (TFP) is one determinant of inclusive wealth, because it is related to the resource allocation mechanism. TFP is one important component of sustainability. When considering the contribution of TFP toward inclusive wealth, attention needs to be paid to the improvement in the usage of human and natural capital as well as the traditional man-made capital. However, in the previous studies, only man-made capital and labor force have been considered. This study extends current measures of sustainability by capturing the efficient utilization of natural resources, giving us inclusive wealth-based TFP. Therefore, in contrast to conventional TFP measures, we consider both human and natural capital in addition to man-made capital. We examine 43 countries and find that a new indicator which asserts countries previously considered sustainable by earlier studies such as Arrow et al. (J Econ Perspect 18(3): 147-172, 2004) as no longer sustainable.

AB  - This study aims to examine the potential substitute natural gas (SNG) production by integrating black liquor gasification (BLG) island with a small wheat straw-based non-wood pulp mills (NPM), which do not employ the black liquor recovery cycle. For such integration, it is important to first build knowledge on expected improvements in an overall integrated non-wood pulp mill energy system using the key performance indicators. O-2 blown circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasification with direct causticization is integrated with a reference small NPM to evaluate the overall performance. A detailed economic analysis is performed together with a sensitivity analysis based on variations in the rate of return due to varying biomass price, total capital investment, and natural gas prices. The quantitive results showed considerable SNG production but significantly reduced electricity production. There is a substantial CO2 abatement potential combining CO2 capture and CO2 mitigation from SNG use replacing compressed natural gas (CNG) or gasoline. The economic performance through sensitivity analysis reflects significant dependency on both substitute natural gas production and natural gas market price. Furthermore, the solutions to address the challenges and barriers for the successful commercial implementation of BLG based polygeneration system at small NPMs are discussed. The system performance and discussion on the real application of integrated system presented in this article form a vital literature source for future use by large number of small non-wood pulp industries.

AB  - We describe a climate risk index that has been developed to inform national climate adaptation planning in Italy and that is further elaborated in this paper. The index supports national authorities in designing adaptation policies and plans, guides the initial problem formulation phase, and identifies administrative areas with higher propensity to being adversely affected by climate change. The index combines (i) climate change-amplified hazards; (ii) high-resolution indicators of exposure of chosen economic, social, natural and built-or manufactured capital (MC) assets and (iii) vulnerability, which comprises both present sensitivity to climate-induced hazards and adaptive capacity. We use standardized anomalies of selected extreme climate indices derived from high-resolution regional climate model simulations of the EURO-CORDEX initiative as proxies of climate change-altered weather and climate-related hazards. The exposure and sensitivity assessment is based on indicators of manufactured, natural, social and economic capital assets exposed to and adversely affected by climate-related hazards. The MC refers to material goods or fixed assets which support the production process (e.g. industrial machines and buildings); Natural Capital comprises natural resources and processes (renewable and non-renewable) producing goods and services for well-being; Social Capital (SC) addressed factors at the individual (people's health, knowledge, skills) and collective (institutional) level (e.g. families, communities, organizations and schools); and Economic Capital (EC) includes owned and traded goods and services. The results of the climate risk analysis are used to rank the subnational administrative and statistical units according to the climate risk challenges, and possibly for financial resource allocation for climate adaptation.

AB  - Green growth is a global priority strategy for responding to climate change. This paper applies the OECD (2011a) green growth monitoring indicators framework to analyze 20 indicators of progress toward green growth specific to Taiwan. Principal Component Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process are used as weighting methods to calculate an aggregating composite index and perform sensitivity testing. The results show that for the past decade (2002-2011), Taiwan has been moving toward green growth but has been negatively impacted by its natural capital stock. This indicates that improving natural capital stock is a key for sustaining green growth in Taiwan.

AB  - The consequences of the crisis have been mainly analyzed at national/international levels, neglecting its differential effects on local areas. Notwithstanding the international character of the Great Recession, the different local structural features might have influenced the economic and social impact of the crisis, determining effects on the resilience and recovery chance. In this paper, we focus on the role of different territorial indicators by looking at how their relevance has changed during the recent crisis at provincial level. Our aim is threefold. First, we identify the strategic territorial elements which might be particularly relevant in ensuring a greater local absorption capacity. Second, we test whether the crisis has increased the role of specific local factors. In doing that, we use different measures of performance (GDP, exports and employment). Third, we control for macro-regional characteristics (i.e., North versus South) and local specific effects through a panel analysis of the dynamics of the performance variables in three sub-periods over the years 2000-2014. For that purpose, we use a multidimensional dataset for Italian provinces aiming at estimating the empirical relations between the set of territorial elements (i.e., the components of the so-called territorial capital) and the change in local performance. The results stress the role of some localized variables (i.e., human and cultural/natural/capital, agglomeration economies) over the whole period and the changing role of other territorial dimensions (material and non-material) according to the performance variable considered and during the crisis.

KW  - Natural capital accounts
KW  - Public policy
AB  - There have been many initiatives and policy commitments in natural capital accounting in the recent years. Based on a survey for statistical offices, ministries and independent experts worldwide, we provide some preliminary evidence that there is very little use of natural capital accounts for public policy decisions and, more so, in developing countries. The most relevant obstacles are the lack of political support by key people and institutional leadership unable to promote policy use by other ministries. Concerning developing countries, the factor which is considered as the most relevant in preventing the use of natural capital accounts for policy making is the stage of development of the country. In addition, respondents from statistical institutes and developing countries are firstly, concerned about institutional obstacles and secondly, about data availability and cooperation. Respondents from ministries and independent experts are particularly concerned about design obstacles. Not many accounts may be available to be used in the policy-making process due to data gaps, design challenges and the required investment, the problem being more acute in developing countries. A key result of the survey is the need to evaluate the added value of natural capital accounts with respect to statistics.

AB  - Wehea forest is a highland of tropical rain forest on East Kutai Regency in East Kalimantan. The community especially Wehea ethnic in Nehas Liah Bing Village is well known for their traditional wisdom in utilizing the forest resources. Wehea Forest Area is a cluster of Maput and Pendreh land systems, and both land systems are irregular hilly regions that have steep to very steep slopes. Because of the uniqueness of biodiversity, landscapes, and traditional wisdom of Wehea ethnic the forest has been declared as forest reserve. This study aimed to assess the natural resources, culture, and participation local community as potential for nature based turism development. The result showed that the Wehea forest has biodiversity of flora dan fauna. Species of flora which are often founded are families of Dipterocarpaceae, Annonaceae, Lauraceae, etc. Fauna potentials are not less important and interesting than flora ones. There are several species which have endangered and protected status. The uniqueness of natural forest landscape really supports to various ecotourism activities. Wehea forest wealth also comes from local community presence. Their awareness is relatively high about Wehea forest existence, especially communities in Nehas Liah Bing. Dayak ethnic of Wehea has unique culture to be developed as tourist attraction. There are also other ethnics are Dayak kayan in Miau Baru Village and Java ethnic community in Makmur Jaya Village wich was once a transmigration village. Both communities in the village are familiar about the Wehea forest existence. Culture value diversity, awareness, and participation of local communities become strong capital to develop natural based turism and are expected to contribute to economic diversification region.

AB  - Comprehensive Investment (CI) may provide an indicator of future changes in a country's per capita consumption. The authors explore the utility of the CI indicator for Australia by constructing CI data since 1861 and by estimating their relationship with changes in future consumption over periods of 50 years ahead. The CI measures include changes in natural, produced and human capital, and make allowance for exogenous technological progress. The results are used to consider how Australia's natural capital exploitation influenced the consumption of future generations. Further, the authors gauge if low CI relative to other leading OECD countries resulted in lower consumption levels in Australia over time than feasible, had it saved more.

AB  - The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) highlights the positive relationship between a broad portfolio of household livelihood capitals and adaptive capacity to climate change. However, the SLF overlooks the interactions and transformations that occur between different types of capital. To test our hypothesis that complementarity-substitution exists between the five livelihood capitals, and that only increasing complementary capital can improve adaptive capacity, we assessed the adaptive capacity of apple farmers to drought events in the Loess Plateau, China. This was done through a substitutive-complementary analysis of the relationships between social, human, physical, natural, and financial capital. Using Pearson's correlation analysis, we tested the impact of 13 livelihood capital indicators on farmers' adaptive capacity. We found that some forms of capital have a substitutive effect, some have a complementary effect, and others have both. It is the overall product of these complementary indicators that increases adaptive capacity. We conclude that a substitutive-complementary approach can enhance our understanding of the role of livelihood capital in reducing farmers' vulnerability and strengthen approaches to increasing adaptive capacity.

AB  - Soils underpin our existence through food production and represent the largest terrestrial carbon store. Understanding soil state-and-change in response to climate and land use change is a major challenge. Our aim is to bridge the science-policy interface by developing a natural capital accounting structure for soil, for example, attempting a mass balance between soil erosion and production, which indicates that barren land, and woody crop areas are most vulnerable to potential soil loss. We test out our approach using earth observation, modelling and ground based sample data from the European Union's Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) soil monitoring program. Using land cover change data for 2000-2012 we are able to identify land covers susceptible to change, and the soil resources most at risk. Tree covered soils are associated with the highest carbon stocks, and are on the increase, while areas of arable crops are declining, but artificial surfaces are increasing. The framework developed offers a substantial step forward, demonstrating the development of biophysical soil accounts that can be used in wider socio-economic and policy assessment; initiating the development of an integrated soil monitoring approach called for by the United Nations Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils.

AB  - Extending the wealth accumulation model of Piketty and Zucman [2014] to include net depreciation in fossil fuels, minerals, and forests produces two key indicators: the net national saving rate adjusted for natural capital depreciation, and the ratio of this rate to long-run growth. These indicators are applied to eight rich economies over 1970-2013 and developing countries for 1979-2013. Whereas in developing economies capital accumulation has largely kept pace with rising natural capital depletion, in the rich countries adjusted net savings have fallen to converge with the rate of natural capital depreciation, suggesting less compensation by net increases in other capital.

AB  - The article describes how economic resilience of farming households can be measured using a composite indicator of revealed adaptive actions, and investigates how capabilities of farm households to recombine human, financial, natural and physical capitals are linked to observed economic resilience to land set aside interventions. The land set-aside intervention known as the Grain for Green Project (GGP), which has been altering livelihoods of farming households in China's Loess Hills since 1999, is taken as a case study. Household surveys were conducted in three V-shaped valleys and three riparian areas in Yanhe Township in northwestern China in an effort to measure household resilience and explore its' relationship to forms of capital. A composite index of adaptive strategies that can reorganize livelihood activities under land set aside intervention into a new economic equilibrium is crafted using an objective weighting scheme based on principal component analysis. Subsequently, a multiple regression model was utilized to examine the relationship between the composite resilience index and various indicators related to human, social, financial, natural and physical capitals. The results reveal the latent structure and internal correlations of adaptive strategies, and present quantitative evidence about the relationship between livelihood capitals and household economic resilience. The analysis shows that household resilience deteriorates when the ratio of GGP land to cultivated farmland goes above a threshold level, and revealed that interventions targeting various forms of capitals can enhance the economic resilience for households to conservation efforts.

AB  - The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a significantly more comprehensive approach to assessing economic progress than conventional measures, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We estimated the GPI for the state of Oregon from 1960-2010. We found that it tracked the Gross State Product (GSP) for the period 1970-2000, but began to diverge and flatten out in 2000. The major reasons for this divergence were increasing inequality, loss of farmland, and decreasing personal consumption expenditures as a fraction of GSP. Oregon GPI/per capita leveled off in 2000, while the US GPI/capita leveled off in 1975. The GPI is not the perfect indicator of economic and social well-being, but it is a better approximation than GDP. As more states and countries begin to recognize the inappropriateness of GDP as a policy goal we can expect to see much more emphasis on and use of alternative indicators like GPI. We recommend extending these indicators to include a comprehensive shareholder's report that reflects all the state's capital assets, including built, human, social, and natural capital.

AB  - Considering the capital intensive nature of the chemical industry, redesign of existing production plants is a strategic decision. In this study, retrofitting is performed using a systematic path flow decomposition method, enriching it with hazard assessment and life cycle analysis path flow indicators and proposing a classification scheme for coupling these new path flow indicators with relevant heuristics for process alternative generation. The developed methodology is applied in a batch production plant from the pharmaceutical industry. The method highlights solvent recovery or substitution as important retrofitting actions, generates diverse process layout structures to achieve this task and evaluates them from cost, hazard and life cycle assessment point of view. Extractive distillation using glycol as an entrainer is identified as the multiobjective optimal option for separating the THF/Water azeotrope with improvement up to 40% for the various objectives compared with a base case where the waste solvent is incinerated.

AB  - Given the projected climatic changes, building resilient agricultural systems is of vital significance in protecting vulnerable agrarian communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Under this scenario, the article attempts to identify a set of resilience-building adaptive strategies (intensification, diversification, alteration, migration, etc.) among farmers in Morogoro, Tanzania, and crafts a composite index of these strategies using a principal component analysis-based weighting scheme. The analysis also reveals the latent structure and internal correlations of actions intended to build resilience of the farming systems. Subsequently, the linkages of livelihood resources (natural, human, social and financial capitals) to the resilience-building strategies are examined. A multiple regression analysis is employed to link the composite index to variables representing the four capitals. The results bring quantitative evidence to the linkages and highlight the need of enhancing livelihood resources to enhance the ability to undertake adaptive strategies that denotes the ability to withstand stresses and shocks from climatic changes. Actions to improve human capital (awareness campaigns on climate change impacts as well as possible adaptive strategies), social capital (strengthening social networks, improving tenure security), financial capital (increasing credit availability) and natural capital (measures to enhance agricultural potential, support for adaptive action in areas with low agricultural potential) are needed in order to impart resilience to the farming systems against the changing climate.

AB  - Conceptual design of two options of carbon dioxide utilized gas-to-liquids process (CUGP), which mainly produces light olefins and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthetic oils, has been implemented with the aid of Aspen Plus software. The mass and energy stream results as well as the process efficiencies and CO2 emissions of the proposed options were obtained from the developed models. The capital investment and the product cost estimations were conducted before the following economic analysis. Several indicators such as net present value (NPV), discounted payback period (DPBP) and internal rate of return (IRR) were calculated to evaluate the profitability of the two proposed options. In the economic analysis, sensitivity analysis as well as break-even analysis was carried out. In addition, effects of several sensitive factors such as the prices of synthetic oil, olefin and natural gas, capital investment, carbon tax and plant scale on the IRR of each option were analyzed in detail. It was found that the CUGP, regardless of option, was economically feasible at the plant scale of 40,000 BPD and was more competitive compared with conventional GTL processes, in case of high carbon tax.

AB  - Genuine Savings (GS) has emerged as the leading economic indicator of sustainable economic development at the country level. It derives from the literatures on weak sustainability, wealth accounting and national income accounting. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of GS, focusing on the relationship between changes in a nation's extended capital stock and the future path of consumption. The indicator has entered widespread use propelled by the World Bank's publications, despite its varying performance as a predictor for future consumption. Notwithstanding the extensive body of literature reviewed, promising future research avenues are identified.

AB  - The multivariate character of seven dynamic soil properties from a national soil quality data set was explored to determine if generalizations can be made about the status of the properties from land use and soil order. The genoform-phenoform concept (where soil phenoforms arise from a genoform due to modification of dynamic soil properties through specific land use history) was used to frame three hypotheses. Hypothesis one proposed that managed sites were distinct from native sites. This was supported by discriminant analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Hypothesis two proposed that managed sites were clustered into statistically significant distinct classes. This was supported by principal components fuzzy-c means clustering, with recognition of five to seven statistically significant clusters. Hypotheses three proposed that the clusters had functional meaning. This was supported by inspecting the clusters for rational relationships between land use, soil order and soil quality status as estimated by indicator mean values for each cluster. While organic status (e.g., soil C and N) appeared to be the primary driver of clustering, other soil quality indicators (such as macroporosity) were also important in differentiating the effects of land use and soil type on cluster patterns. The results indicate that a taxonomy of phenoforms is possible, but would require input of both inherent and dynamic soil properties. Such a phenoform clustering approach would provide a more quantitative framework for defining intergrades and uncertainty in mapping. Used in conjunction with spatial inherent-property-based databases, the phenoform clustering approach could also be beneficial to assess soil natural capital and to predict susceptibility of specific soils to land-use intensification.

AB  - This paper developed a Sound Investment (SI) indicator of sustainability that allows the interaction of natural capital with changing population and technology. This indicator was tested in the Philippines using 1988-1993 data. Compared with the Genuine Savings (GS) indicator that includes only depreciation of total capital, the results show that the SI indicator exhibited a downward pull on the sustainability evaluation of GS. This implies that investment on man-made capital should match not only the depreciation of man-made and natural capital, but also the increase in the total capital stock needed to maintain a growing population that utilizes advancing technology.

AB  - This paper extends the concept of the resource curse by studying whether and through which transmission channels natural resource wealth affects social spending. Even though the availability of vast natural capital reserves has commonly been linked to the neglect of human development, most of the literature has continued to focus on economic performance. This paper is the first to empirically investigate the link between natural resource wealth and public health expenditures in light of the hypothesis that resource wealth as a source of unearned state income enhances state autonomy and increases volatility, which leads to policies that fail to prioritize human development. Using a large panel dataset of world countries covering the period from 1995 to 2009, we find a robust, significant inverse relationship between natural resource dependence, and even abundance, and public health spending over time. The effect remains significant after controlling for state autonomy, volatility, and other factors. These findings have implications for national authorities as well as the extractive industry. Governments should be made accountable for natural resource wealth and correct taxation could provide additional resources, earmarked for health. The extractive industry could increase their investments in sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility operations, specifically in the health sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wealth is a stock, not a flow. The country with the highest flow of GDP in a particular year is not necessarily the richest country. The richest country has the highest capital stock, whether endowed or accumulated, implying a higher potential for future income and consumption. This should be obvious, yet concepts of wealth are often poorly understood or ignored. Many countries do not maintain adequate wealth accounts; those that do would admit that a great deal of work on national accounts remains to be completed. This is remarkable: investors would not accept corporate balance sheets of a quality akin to those of many countries. However, with progress on wealth accounting, including the accounting of natural wealth, this situation may be set to change, enabling the rate at which nations are becoming richer or poorer per capita to undergo popular examination. A focus on wealth, and changes in wealth, would lead to attention on investment in important assets and to sharper attention on sustainability. This paper, and this issue of the Review as a whole, provides an examination of wealth, its definition, constituent parts, geographical distribution, and change over time, and provides policy guidance on accounting and management. We also explore the degree to which successful wealth management may even make us happier.

AB  - Estimates of Britain's comprehensive wealth are reported for the period 1760-2000. They include measures of produced, natural, and human capital, and illustrate the changing composition of Britain's assets over this time period. We show how genuine savings, GS (a year-on-year measure of the change in total capital and a claimed indicator of sustainable development) has evolved over time. Changes in total wealth are compared to alternative, investment-based measures of GS, including variants augmented with the value of exogenous technology. Additionally, the possible effects of population change on wealth, and the implications of including carbon-dioxide emissions in natural capital are considered.

AB  - In June 2010 Poland was electrified by the big news: the country claimed to hold the largest shale gas reserves in Europe. Following the enthusiastic approach of the government and extractive companies, the public discourse has focused on the expected economic and geopolitical benefits of shale gas extraction. Meanwhile, the broader context of sustainability tends to be neglected. Some recent references to sustainable development in the context of shale gas extraction in Poland indicate that this concept needs a more thorough understanding. This article explores the following three aspects of sustainable development that need to be considered in the discussions on shale gas extraction in Poland. (1) Will the extracted natural capital be replaced with other forms of capital to ensure the well-being of future generations? (2) Will the formal institutions ensure that extractive companies prevent and mitigate all real and potential negative effects resulting from shale gas extraction? (3) How will the contribution of shale gas extraction to human well-being and national wealth be measured? The above issues link to important theoretical considerations within the concept of sustainable development, such as the weak vs. strong sustainability dilemma, internalizing external costs, and sustainability indicators (e.g. greening the GDP).

AB  - We propose a composite drought vulnerability indicator (DVI) that reflects different aspects of drought vulnerability evaluated at Pan-African level for four components: the renewable natural capital, the economic capacity, the human and civic resources, and the infrastructure and technology. The selection of variables and weights reflects the assumption that a society with institutional capacity and coordination, as well as with mechanisms for public participation, is less vulnerable to drought; furthermore, we consider that agriculture is only one of the many sectors affected by drought.
   The quality and accuracy of a composite indicator depends on the theoretical framework, on the data collection and quality, and on how the different components are aggregated. This kind of approach can lead to some degree of scepticism; to overcome this problem a sensitivity analysis was done in order to measure the degree of uncertainty associated with the construction of the composite indicator. Although the proposed drought vulnerability indicator relies on a number of theoretical assumptions and some degree of subjectivity, the sensitivity analysis showed that it is a robust indicator and hence able of representing the complex processes that lead to drought vulnerability.
   According to the DVI computed at country level, the African countries classified with higher relative vulnerability are Somalia, Burundi, Niger, Ethiopia, Mali and Chad. The analysis of the renewable natural capital component at sub-basin level shows that the basins with high to moderate drought vulnerability can be subdivided into the following geographical regions: the Mediterranean coast of Africa; the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa; the Serengeti and the Eastern Miombo woodlands in eastern Africa; the western part of the Zambezi Basin, the southeastern border of the Congo Basin, and the belt of Fynbos in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
   The results of the DVI at the country level were compared with drought disaster information from the EM-DAT disaster database. Even if a cause-effect relationship cannot be established between the DVI and the drought disaster database, a good agreement is observed between the drought vulnerability maps and the number of persons affected by droughts.
   These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on how to assess drought vulnerability and hopefully contribute to the development of drought early warning systems in Africa.

AB  - The interaction among different livelihood capitals is a key to generate a deeper understanding of the livelihood sustainability. In this paper, we use net income per capita (economic capital), meat and milk production per capita (physical capital), and areas of fenced pasture, livestock shelter, grassland rodent control and planted grassland (physical capital) as proxy indicators of livelihood promotion, livelihood provision, and livelihood protection respectively. By developing a correlation model between pastoralists' livelihood protection and improvement, we found that (1) there is a statistically significant correlation between the pastoralists' livelihood protection and promotion; (2) based on the maximum effect of pastoralists' livelihood promotion and provision, there is a benchmark in the effect of the intervention intensity of livelihood capital (grassland resource protection) on livelihood improvement; (3) on basis of two indicators, i.e. net income per capita and meat production per capita, the reasonable scales of fenced pasture, livestock shelter and planted grassland are less than 843, 860 and 46 thousand hectares (hm(2)) per year respectively. With the marginal effect of livelihood protection, moderately decreased areas of fenced pasture and planted grassland, and increased area of livestock shelter is a critical to ensure pastoralist's livelihood sustainability.

AB  - The main objective of the study was to assess the impact of Comprehensive Agricultural Support Program (CASP) on livelihoods of emerging farmer beneficiaries in Ngaka Modiri Molema District, North West Province, South Africa. A simple random sampling approach was used to select nine villages from the district and nine farmers were selected randomly from each village to give a total of 81 farmers as the sample size. Data was collected using structured questionnaire on personal and socio-economic indicators, physical, human, financial, natural and social capitals and CASP pillars before and after benefitting from CASP. Data was analyzed with SPSS using frequency counts, percentages and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The results show that 56.8% of the farmers are females, 50.6% married, 70% are above 40 years of age while 45.7% had secondary school education. In general, farmers' access to financial, social, human, physical and natural capital improved after the introduction of CASP. Similarly, food security status among farmers increased after CASP. However, some important physical capital indicators were lowly achieved such as means of transport for the farmers, feed and watering facilities, established markets, road accessibility and electricity. Some of these resources play vital role in the sustainability of farm businesses. The result of the Wilcoxon Signed rank test of livelihood capital before and after CASP among farmers shows that significant difference exist in financial, human physical, and natural (Z = -7.60, -6.49, -3.56 and -7.77, p < 0.05) respectively. The result indicates an inverse relationship in terms of the impact of CASP on the livelihood capitals of the farmers. This implies that a discontinuation or non-participation in CASP will lead to a reduction in the livelihood capital among farmers.

AB  - The interplay of human actions and natural processes over varied spatial and temporal scales can result in abrupt transitions between contrasting land surface states. Understanding these transitions is a key goal of sustainability science because they can represent abrupt losses of natural capital. This paper recognizes flickering between alternate land surface states in advance of threshold change and critical slowing down in advance of both threshold changes and noncritical transformation. The early warning signals we observe are rises in autocorrelation, variance, and skewness within millimeterresolution thickness measurements of tephra layers deposited in A.D. 2010 and A.D. 2011. These signals reflect changing patterns of surface vegetation, which are known to provide early warning signals of critical transformations. They were observed toward migrating soil erosion fronts, cryoturbation limits, and expanding deflation zones, thus providing potential early warning signals of land surface change. The record of the spatial patterning of vegetation contained in contemporary tephra layers shows how proximity to land surface change could be assessed in the widespread regions affected by shallow layers of volcanic fallout (those that can be subsumed within the existing vegetation cover). This insight shows how we could use tephra layers in the stratigraphic record to identify "near misses," close encounters with thresholds that did not lead to tipping points, and thus provide additional tools for archaeology, sustainability science, and contemporary land management.

AB  - Effective monitoring is a fundamental requirement for adaptive management. The need for better tools for monitoring livelihoods is particularly acute. A simple indicators-based livelihoods monitoring tool to be used at the village scale was developed and tested. Participatory methods were used to elicit local perceptions and aspirations about development and conservation. That information was used to develop a prototype set of indicators, organized using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. Data were collected for the indicators in six villages to calibrate and test the tool. Indicators of financial and physical capital worked well. Social capital and natural capital were more difficult to capture with low-cost indicators. Most of the indicators are applicable in rural areas of the district and beyond. Despite some shortcomings, the tool shows good potential as a way to focus attention on key aspects of rural development and as a way to inform and facilitate discussion and negotiation between communities and other stakeholders.

AB  - Of the plethora of studies that discuss requirements for successful irrigation management, few pay close attention to what actually happens when the supply of water becomes extremely low. Such an oversight in the literature is unfortunate, because this is precisely when management matters. To understand what separates success from failure in irrigation management at times of critical water shortages, the authors conducted emergency fieldwork in February 2010 along four major irrigation channels in a drought-stricken rice-growing area within the Chinese province of Yunnan. Separately, satellite images of the four villages dated February 2009 and February 2010 were jointly analysed to produce a novel indicator for a village's success in water management. Called the in-crisis delivery rate, this indicator compares water delivery between normal and drought years and directly evaluates performance in water management during crisis periods. The results led to an unexpected discovery that, contrary to common expectations, the only village of the present study that deployed a traditional earthen water channel secured substantially more water throughout the drought period than those with concrete-lined channels. It is hypothesised that the labour intensive, rather than capital intensive, nature of repair work of the earthen channel enabled flexible operations, and hence had the comparative advantage under a skilled management team. This result confirms the importance of daily maintenance work, which tends to occur less often after modernisation of water paths.

AB  - This paper shows the strong relation between the factors that lead to the resource curse (RC) and factors that lead to a decline of genuine savings (GS). There is substantial empirical evidence that economies that rely predominantly on their natural resources are also characterized by slower economic growth. This so-called RC is commonly traced back to the fact that natural resources' generate rents that are independent of a country's economic performance, which can lead to suboptimal reinvestments of this consumed natural capital. We argue that the factors responsible for the RC also have a negative effect on GS, a concept that measures weak sustainable development by considering reinvestment of natural capital rents in physical and human capital. We discuss whether the RC hampers possibilities for resource abundant countries to obtain sufficiently high rates of GS, and find indeed many reasons why resource-dependent countries have problems achieving positive GS rates. We survey both areas of research, emphasizing the influence of the exogenous and endogenous determinants of economic growth, which are usually used to theoretically and empirically explain the RC on the three different forms of capital considered by GS. We specify why most countries suffering from the RC have negative GS rates and explain in detail where the linkages are. This overview could help with potential advancements in the explanation of GS through the inclusion of RC effects.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the plethora of approaches that are available to measure welfare and sustainable development. Many methods exist but there is no consensus on the 'correct' approach. Furthermore, we also show that the wide variety of sustainable development indictor (SDI) sets which have been adopted also show significant differences. We argue that this is mostly because many of these studies do not use a theoretical approach. We argue that the 'capital approach', which is used in the sustainability debate, is the most promising method to enhance international harmonization. Support is mounting in the scientific, policy and statistical communities for this approach in which economic capital, human capital, natural capital and social capital are distinguished. Many applications of this method express these capital stocks in monetary units (the 'monetary capital approach'). This paper argues that the 'hybrid capital approach', in which the capital stocks can also be measured in nonmonetary units, is probably more likely to achieve consensus over a large number of countries and institutes. Also a number of challenges remain for the capital approach. We argue that ideally the indicators should be based on satellite accounts of the national accounting framework. Also the capital approach Could be further expanded to current welfare, progress of societies, inequality, and the international dimension of sustainability. We conclude that if the hybrid capital approach is adopted it may become easier to make consistent, theoretically sound and policy relevant comparisons between countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper makes an inventory of the natural capital on earth in terms of exergy, which includes not only renewable and non-renewable energy resources, but also non-fuel minerals. The exergy method is very suitable for the accounting of our natural capital because all kinds of resources can be assessed with a single property. For the case of minerals, exergy allows to unify properties tonnage and grade. Furthermore, the exergy replacement costs of minerals includes additional information of the state of technology. The aggregation capacity of the exergy and exergy replacement cost indicators increases the analysis potential of the results. This way, the non-fuel mineral's wealth can be compared to that of fuel minerals or even to other natural resources. The results of this study reveal that the real scarcity problems that humankind are facing are not based on the lack of energy sources, but on the lack of minerals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Poverty maps are an increasingly popular mode Of Visualizing the spatial dimension of poverty. They help guide priority-setting and target poverty-alleviation interventions. The utility of poverty maps can be enhanced by spatially disaggregating the underlying causes of poverty. One promising approach explored in this paper is the use of livelihood assets natural, physical, human, social and financial - the building blocks of sustainable livelihoods. We illustrate the approach by mapping and contrasting poverty and livelihood assets within the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains drawing on district-level indicators and livelihood asset-based principal components. The relatively low poverty incidence in the north-western plains is associated with an overall favorable livelihood asset base, particularly pronounced for natural and financial capitals. There is a marked gradient with poverty increasing eastwards, reflecting a similarly marked decline in livelihood assets. The overall unfavorable livelihood asset base in the mid-Gangetic Plains of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh provides a particularly challenging spatial poverty trap. The maps and regional contrasts of poverty and livelihood assets provide a foundation for future research and development work and reiterate the need for cross-sectoral and inter-disciplinary approaches.

AB  - One of the recurring themes in the sustainability literature has been the extent to which a loss of natural capital can be made up for in welfare terms by an increase in other forms of capital. This issue was raised early on in the debate on sustainability by Pearce and has never really been resolved. This paper is an empirical attempt to measure the degree of substitutability between different forms of capital. A nested CES production function is used to allow flexibility in the estimated elasticities of substitution. Also, within this specification, natural resources and other inputs are combined in different levels of the function, thus allowing for different levels of substitutability. Institutional and economic indicators are also incorporated in the production function estimated. Results show that the elasticities derived from functions involving land resources were generally around one or greater, implying a fairly high degree of substitutability. Furthermore, changes in trade openness and private sector investment have a statistically significant and direct relationship on the efficiency of production and hence on income generation. No statistically significant relationship between income and any of the institutional indicators was found.

AB  - Enhancing Quality of Life (QOL) has long been an explicit or implicit goal for individuals, communities, nations, and the world. But defining QOL and measuring progress toward meeting this goal have been elusive. Diverse "objective" and "subjective" indicators across a range of disciplines and scales, and recent work on subjective well-being (SWB) surveys and the psychology of happiness have spurred interest. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we present an integrative definition of QOL that combines measures of human needs with subjective well-being or happiness. QOL is proposed as a multi-scale, multi-dimensional concept that contains interacting objective and subjective elements. We relate QOL to the opportunities that are provided to meet human needs in the forms of built, human, social and natural capital (in addition to time) and the policy options that are available to enhance these opportunities. Issues related to defining, measuring, and scaling these concepts are discussed, and a research agenda is elaborated. Policy implications include strategies for investing in opportunities to maximize QOL enhancement at the individual, community, and national scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainable development in mineral economies: the example of Botswana
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA  - English
AB  - The Hartwick-Solow rule for sustainability requires that depletion of natural capital be offset by a compensating increase in other forms of capital capable of generating as much income as the natural capital they replace. Many countries have not been successful in transforming natural capital into other forms of wealth. This paper investigates the process of wealth transformation for Botswana, one of the most successful resource-rich countries. Using an expanded measure of wealth that includes manufactured capital, natural capital and net foreign financial assets, Botswana's per capita wealth has increased over the past 20 years. Government has recovered and reinvested rent. However, examination of the public sector capital budget reveals considerable unproductive investment. While correction for unproductive investments still indicates sustainable development, results suggest that aggregate indicators such as national wealth or genuine savings may be misleading without further attention to the process by which natural capital is transformed into other forms of wealth.

AB  - This paper proposes to qualify a country's human development as potentially unsustainable if the net depreciation of its manufactured and natural capital stock is bigger than its investment. Linking the Human Development Index with sustainability in this way would allow the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to check whether a country is 'mortgaging the choices of future generations'. An analysis for 155 countries leads to the conclusion that the indicated human development of 42 countries is potentially unsustainable. Most of these countries have a low HDI, which means that even this low achievement is not sustainable into the future. The results make a case for both a policy reform within these countries and for external assistance to help maintain at least this low level of human development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper applies the concept of natural capital stock, and identifies its critical elements, in a regional sustainable development context in order to assess its conceptual and practical relevance. Assessment of the physical stock of natural capital was undertaken for Central Region in Scotland. It was found that the concept can be a useful way of assessing, and giving greater recognition to natural resources at a regional or local level. However, identification of critical levels of resources was less straightforward. The lack of clear guidelines relating to criteria of criticality, natural capital category aggregation issues, and conflicts between types of critical natural capital were encountered as major issues. The application of an absolute preservation rule was found to suffer from the same general disadvantages as any absolute rule. Nevertheless, the assessment of natural capital and identification, where possible, of critical elements were thought to be a useful adjunct to sustainable development work.

AB  - Over the last decade there has been a growing interest in depreciation of natural capital in national income accounts. Within this literature there has been limited discussion of the sensitivity of measurement to the choice of discount rate and the effect of using depreciated measures of growth in empirical analyses. Without attempting to estimate or justify a specific discount rate, this paper presents alternative sets of growth data for 18 African countries based on different assumptions of the appropriate discount rate to apply to natural capital. The data sets are then used in a statistical test of the causes of economic growth. Results of the statistical analysis indicate sensitivity to the choice of discount rate.

KW  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Whatever other factors may be necessary, in the end a sustainable world economy is possible only if there is a perpetual source of energy to drive it. We explore the ability of the world economy to replace fossil and fissile energy sources with solar-flux-driven renewable energy sources using a natural capital accounting procedure known as ECCO, in the form of the world model GlobEcco. It is found that the dynamics of substitution are favourable for the developed (First) world in that, with appropriate policies, a transition can be made before easily accessible oil and gas resources are seriously depleted. However, this is not so for the less developed (Third) world, owing to the latter's low capacity for wealth creation and its higher population growth, even when aid from the First World is increased by a factor of six. The interim conclusion of this study is that, given the database and solar capture technologies currently available, the transition from a world economy based on the depletion of natural capital to one that is truly sustainable is possible only if both coal and nuclear energy continue to be used as energy sources for at least the next 50 years. However, if the carbon dioxide/greenhouse effect requires the reduction of carbon dioxide output, then the transition may call for a period of material penury, even in the developed world, before the transition can be effective.

AB  - This paper comprises an extensive examination of the relationship between commonly utilized policy indicators of national technological capability and observed trade success in technology-intensive manufactures, across 52 countries, in the 1980s. A central focus is the relative performance of policy indicators which directly measure innovative activity (such as patent output and expenditure and employed scientists and engineers in R&D) versus those measuring general efforts at increasing national levels of human capital. The study design is guided by the inter-country, intrasectoral approach outlined by Dosi et al. [19] - it emphasizes differences in trade performance based on the notion of international competitiveness (but also compares results for conventional revealed comparative advantage indices). The large number of countries included, and the nature of the policy objectives adopted, have necessitated a highly aggregated approach using nation-wide attributes and trade in one broad technology-intensive sector as the measure of demonstrated international competitiveness. Simple correlation and multiple regression techniques are used to assess the association of four main sets of national attributes (indicators of direct innovative activity, general human capital development, physical capital formation and natural resource endowment) with technology-intensive trade performance.
   The empirical findings provide further support for the importance of national differences in technological capability as a determinant of structural, and international, competitiveness within the technology-intensive sector of production. They suggest that policy indicators measuring actual innovative activity and physical capital formation have a much closer link to technology-intensive trade than the general educational effort or output indicators. ''Demand-side'' measures - which proxy the actual employment and application of resources for R&D purposes - demonstrate the strength of association required for reliable policy evaluation of real national differences in technological capability. The poor performance of the general human capital supply variables highlights the need for a careful consideration of the optimality of the allocation of substantial levels of scarce national resources to broad-based educational output. A number of other significant results concerning the link between technology indicators, technology-intensive trade and economic performance are discussed.

   The main objectives of this investigation were to elaborate the concept of associative skills, and to design and apply a methodology to calculate their level of capacity.
   Design
   The construction of a concept of associative capacities and the design of a methodology to calculate the levels of these capacities have been the main reason for this study, which took the Tsachila ethnic group as the unit of analysis. This indigenous group is based in the canton of Santo Domingo in Ecuador, and has economic, organizational, educational and cultural limitations that put at risk their survival as an ethnic group.
   When applying the research on associative capacities to this ethnic group, the attempt was made to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the solidarity in their economic relations, so that members of the group can change their deficit situation towards a scenario of growth and organizational maturity - one which foments their environmental, agricultural, tourist and cultural potential, through associative ventures, so that they can improve their living conditions, elevate their self-esteem and cultural identity, and strengthen their stability within their economy of solidarity.
   The research design was planned by taking into account the three phases that make up the present study. The first phase begins by exploring, describing and comparing the proposals of Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen in their theories about capabilities. The first author describes a person's set of possible functions which he/she can choose for him/herself. An understanding Amartya Sen's Capabilities Approach gives one an underlying theoretical framework to work with that recognizes the importance of the chosen functions, and point to the fact that these come to be regarded as of more worth than others, according to the different contexts in which individuals develop. This phase concludes with the definition of the term associative capacities, which allows an adequate understanding and use of this expression throughout the present study.
   The second phase is also associated with a descriptive and transversal design. In order to construct the methodology for the calculation of Associative Capability Indexes, existing methodologies were taken for reference purposes, validated and used - methodological procedures such as those used by the United Nations for the calculation of the Human Development Index, as well as the Venezuelan methodology established in the Methodological file: Human Development Index. The dimensions and indicators that are established to calculate the index of associative capacities should respond to the reality and needs of the group to be studied.
   The third phase is that of application. It maintains a descriptive trans-sectional character, because it is through the calculation of indexes of associative capacities that strengths and weaknesses are identified, and comparisons of groups, subgroups and individuals are developed, which allows the capacities to be described and measured.
   Methodology
   The construction of a concept of associative capacities and the design of a methodology to calculate the levels of these capacities have been the main reason for this study, which took the Tsachila ethnic group as the unit of analysis. This indigenous group is based in the canton of Santo Domingo in Ecuador, and has economic, organizational, educational and cultural limitations that put at risk their survival as an ethnic group.
   The first phase of the study consisted of structuring the concept of Associative Capabilities. The most relevant aspects of a bibliographic review were analyzed from multiple perspectives, in order to support a concept which, although it is understood and used, does not yet have an official and distinctive definition.
   For the second phase, the design of the methodology for the calculation of the Indexes of Associative Capacities (IAC) followed a process of induction, deduction and analysis - the calculation method of the Human Development Index (HDI) that has been used since 1990 by the United Nations Development Program. This calculation method, which serves for reference purposes, is based on the theory of human capabilities of the economist Amartya Sen. Once the IAC methodology had been designed, its functionality was tested with pilot data to correct imperfections. Finally, a standard procedure was obtained to calculate the indexes of each of the dimensions and their corresponding indicators, whether by groups, subgroups or individually. Each variable gets a certain score - a higher score for a more favorable response.
   For the third phase, the methodology's main input for calculating associative skills lies in the information obtained from each researched participant. This study was based on a survey whose questionnaire in the end was comprised of twenty-five specific questions that inquire about a favorable or unfavorable position. The selected sample reflects a convenience-based sampling, a non-probabilistic survey technique, useful for the advantageous accessibility and proximity of the subjects to the researcher. The convenience-based sampling was combined with discretionary sampling. The latter is useful in that it makes it possible for the researcher, on the basis of his knowledge and professional judgment, to select the units that will be part of the sample.
   Approach
   In order to evaluate the associative capacities, it is first necessary to determine with precision the variables that affect the process. In addition, it is necessary to identify which categories favor the conditions of associativity, such as knowledge, communications, relationship, leadership and management, among others.
   After having applied this methodology in the Tsachilas communes, it is held that the calculation of the indexes of associative capacities makes it possible to determine the consistency of any associative group's social interaction, that the indices obtained make it possible to establish individual and collective strengths or weaknesses, and that based on this it is possible to design plans for improvement that not only guarantee the associative group's permanence, but also boost its development.
   Results
   The definition of the term associative capacities - the capacities or set of skills that every organization requires for its proper functioning - allows an adequate understanding and use of the term throughout the present study.
   Regarding the methodology developed, the calculation formula is as follows:
   Associative Capabilities Index = Real value - Minimum value/Maximum value - Minimum value
   The number of cases of each item is multiplied by its score, generating a result. The sum of the four results of the items represents the Real Value. The maximum value and the minimum value are theoretical values that represent the hypothetical possibility that all the answers are located both in the item with the highest score (4) as well as in the item with the lowest scored (1).
   In the example below (see Table 1) there were 70 surveys, distributed equally among seven communes. The maximum value would be 280, the minimum value would be 70, and the real value is 236.
   [GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT]
   After applying the formula, the result will be a maximum score of one (1) and a minimum of zero (0). The equivalence of the scores obtained is interpreted on the basis of a Likert scale.
   The application of this methodology using the field results of the Tsachila population produced a score of 0,64 (average) as the index of associative capacities of the Tsachila nationality, a result that is consistent with its social, economic and cultural reality. Nevertheless, intervention is necessary so that at the level of communes they can develop enterprises of an economy of solidarity, in which solidarity practices are fomented and their associative capacities are fully developed.
   Limitations of research
   The main limitation of the work carried out with the Tsachila population was that of the four dimensions, only three had four indicators, unlike four others of the seven communes.
   Implications
   The versatility of the method for calculating indexes of associative capacities allows its application in the study of various groups or organizations simultaneously, allowing the disaggregation of results for each of the groups analyzed.
   The standardization in the IAC's calculation procedure facilitates the production of individual indexes (by indicator), as well as group indexes (by dimension) to carry out precise analyses that are adapted to the particular needs of any organization. In addition, its design can be used for various forms of organization, whether or not they belong to an economy of solidarity.
   Practical conclusions and original value
   The present work made it possible to delimit with precision the theoretical framework related to associative capacities, to establish a methodology of calculation, and to apply it in a given population (the Tsachilas).
   The dimensions and indicators that were established to calculate the index of associative capacities, responds to the Tsachila ethnic group's own reality and needs, and were built on the foundation of a diagnosis of its current situation and its historical antecedents. Due to this, dimensions and indicators must be established for each new group, according to their reality.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope Pharmaceutically active substances are a class of emerging contaminants, which has led to increasing concern about potential environmental risks. After excretion, substantial amounts of unchanged pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are discharged into domestic wastewaters. The absence of data on the environmental exposure in Eastern Europe is significant, since use patterns and volumes differ from country to country. In Romania, the majority of wastewater, from highly populated cities and industrial complex zones, is still discharged into surface waters without proper treatment or after inefficient treatment. In respect to this, it is important to determine the environmental occurrence and behavior of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewaters and surface waters. The objective of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of selected PPCPs during the transport in the Somes River by mass flow analysis before and after upgrading a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Cluj-Napoca, which serves 350,000 inhabitants and is the largest plant discharging into the Somes River. The concentrations of PPCPs at Cluj-Napoca can be correlated with the high population and a high number of hospitals located in the catchment area leading to higher mass flows. The results of this study are expected to provide information, with respect to the Romanian conditions, for environmental scientists, WWTP operators, and legal authorities. The data should support the improvement of existing WWTPs and implementation of new ones where necessary and, therefore, minimize the input of contaminants into ambient waters.
   Materials and methods The PPCPs were selected on the basis of consumption at the regional scale, reported aquatic toxicity, and the suitability of the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method for the determination of the compounds at trace levels. The studied PPCPs, caffeine ( stimulant), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), pentoxifylline ( anticoagulant), cyclophosphamide ( cytostatic), ibuprofen ( analgesic), and galaxolide ( musk fragrance), were determined in samples of the Somes River. The analytes were enriched by solid-phase extraction and subsequently determined by GC/MS. Caffeine, pentoxifylline, and galaxolide were determined underivatized, whereas the acidic pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, and ibuprofen were determined after derivatization with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide.
   Results and discussion The concentrations in the Somes River varied from below 10 ng/L up to 10 mu g/L. A substantial decrease of the exposure in the Somes River could be observed due to the upgrade of the municipal WWTP in Cluj-Napoca. The loads in the river stretch between Cluj-Napoca and Dej ( Somes Mic) varied strongly: caffeine (400-2,000 g/day), carbamazepine (78-213 g/day), galaxolide (140-684 g/day), ibuprofen (84-108 g/day). After the upgrade of the WWTP Cluj-Napoca, the concentrations in the Somes of caffeine, pentoxifylline, cyclophosphamide, galaxolide, and tonalide were significantly reduced (over 75%). One might be cautious comparing both studies because the relative efficiency of the WWTP's removal of PPCP was not evaluated. However, the significantly lower concentrations of most compounds after the upgrade of the WWTP Cluj-Napoca allow one to infer that the technical measures at the source substantially reduced inputs of contaminants to the receiving river. Dej loads of the poorly biodegradable substance carbamazepine increased by a factor of 2-3 as a result of wastewater discharges into the river. The disproportionate increase in caffeine loads by a factor of 4 below Cluj-Napoca indicates inputs of untreated wastewater from the Somes Mare due to the discharge of untreated wastewater derived from Bistrita, Nasaud, and Beclean ( 115,000 inhabitants).
   Conclusions The relative contribution of treated and untreated wastewater in surface water might be assessed by measuring chemical markers. Recalcitrant pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine are suitable as chemical markers for estimating the relative contribution of wastewater in surface water. The easily degradable caffeine might be a good indicator for raw sewage and hardly treated wastewaters.
   Recommendations and perspectives Municipal WWTPs have the potential of a significant contribution in reducing the load of contaminants to ambient waters. The efficiency of the wastewater treatment in Cluj-Napoca improved considerably after the upgrade of the WWTP. Therefore, it is crucial that several WWTPs must be implemented or improved in the Somes Valley Watershed in order to reduce the discharge of contaminants in the Somes River from these point sources.

AB  - The research of the effect of cultures on the quality of water and potential improvement of the quality has been conducted at the experimental site Velky Rybnik and in the watershed of Kopaninsky tok (torrential bed) in the Pelhrimov district.  In the experimental watershed of Kopaninsky tok (stream) the quality of water was studied in the following indicators:  NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO4(3-), Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, N(t), Fe, SO4(2-) from seven partial watersheds with various composition of cultures.
   Experimental site of Velky Rybnik has an area of 8.4 ha and is drained by the controlling drainage, that is with the possibility to control the groundwater table (GWT, i.e. HPV, resp.).  The effect of groundwater table control on the quality of flowing out water.
   The pattern of the quality of drainage waters (N-NO3- concentration in the watershed of Kopaninsky tok for four different drainage systems and three headwaters with various composition of cultures present Figs 1, 2. Tab. I gives the significant characteristics of water quality on nitrates.  Characteristic value was calculated as a mean of three most unfavourable values of the quality water indicator.
   Completely lowest values of N-NO3- concentrations were ascertained at the spring in the forest.  Naturally, the characteristic value of concentration did not achieve better grade than III, or limit value 15 mg/l.  The second lowest concentration was taken at the spring flowing out from the region with prevailing composition of cultures grassland-forest.  Nitrate concentration from the headwaters from the site with prevailing arable land in an infiltration region and from the forest in transport region (T1) represents grade IV and is classified in the same way like nitrate concentration from drainage systems P7, P8.  The highest concentrations were recorded in drainage systems with prevalent arable land (grade V).  It can be said that drainage systems exhibit higher concentration of nitrates in the present region than headwaters and certain influence of cultures on the nitrate concentration in water in relation to the distribution of cultures in infiltration and infiltration-transport zones is apparent.  This factor can be explained by much higher aeration of arable land than that of grassland and forest soils, by higher aeration of drainage systems or shorter time of denitrification of nitrogen in soil profile during subsurface drainage.
   Regulating drainage systems were built above all for their irrigating function when the groundwater table (GWT) can be regulated in dependence on weather conditions of the year and developmental stages of plants.  A positive hydrological function of these systems (Kvitek et al., 1990), but also a reduction in nitrates (Kvitek, Klimova, 1999), were manifested in association with it.
   The results of water regulation are positive in all cases and are fully unambiguous to that effect of the reduction in the values of all nitrogen forms, regardless of the time of water retention.  The above indicated phenomena are in Tab. II and Fig. 3.
   A decrease in the concentration of all nitrogen forms in retarded water can be explained by microbial reduction in nitrates and ammonium ions, or by chemical reduction in nitrates when reduction caused by Fe2+ compounds in alkaline medium is taken into account; another probable explanation consists in the fact that soil micromycetes can utilize nitrates as a source of nitrogen for structure of their cells (assimilation), assimilation of nitrates through the soil micromycetes means the incorporation of nitrate nitrogen into the biomass, or bacteria use nitrates only in their respiratory processes as a source of oxygen (dissimilative denitrification); this process is connected with losses of nitrogen in the form of gaseous products; finally, by capillarity of soil solution from the groundwater table and its use by the stand.
   The first above-mentioned conclusions are of general validity, further conclusions are subject to scientific discussion, but it is a fact that nitrates are reduced preferentially earlier than sulfates (Boleslav, Pitter, 1992).  Our results of the period from July 18 to October 9, 1991, when nitrate concentration fell from 35 to 3 mg/l, signify the decrease in sulfates from 80 to 56 mg/l.  Similar results were attained in observations conducted from July 29 to August 13, 1992 and from August 14 to October 13, 1992.  With decline of nitrates, the concentration of sulfates declined as well.  The reduction in sulfates to sulfides occurs after the further decline in the redox potential, i.e. after the depletion of nitrates or nitrites, resp.  This fact has been confirmed by ascertained values for nitrates.
   The possibility to reduce nitrate loading on surface and underground waters by grassing of infiltration zones of drainage systems and water retardation in drainage systems is actual.

AB  - The granite-and-greenstone terrains that dominate upper crust formed from about 3.6 to about 2.6 Ga, and record magmatic and tectonic processes very different from those of a younger time. They indicate heat loss by the Archean Earth primarily by voluminous magmatism from a mantle much hotter than that of the present. Plate-tectonic processes were not then operating. The distinctive array of petrologic, structural and stratigraphic features that characterize Phanerozoic convergent-plate systems-ophiolites, magmatic arcs, accretionary wedges, fore-are basins, etc.-have no viable analogues in Archean terrains. Purported Archean plate-tectonic indicators consist merely of rock types that even superficially resemble actual Phanerozoic indicators only when considered in isolation from their association and structure. Archean ultramafic and mafic volcanic rocks neither resemble ophiolitic rocks in petrology nor occur in ophiolite-type successions, they often depositionally overlie felsic basement rocks and often overlie and are intercalated with sedimentary and felsic-volcanic rocks, and they require a mantle about 200 degrees C hotter than now. Archean graywackes are coherent strata derived from nearby volcanic rocks late in the histories of their regions, and they lack the setting and disruption that characterize modern accretionary wedges.
   The lithologic, structural and stratigraphic assemblages that typify Proterozoic and Phanerozoic rifted and reassembled margins also lack Archean analogues, and no evidence has been found for Archean rifting, rotation, and reassembly of continental plates.
   Conversely, characteristic Archean assemblages lack modern equivalents in any tectonic setting. Ultramafic lavas, erupted at liquidus temperatures, are voluminous. Granite-and-greenstone terrains have no modern analogues. Greenstone belts are typically anastomosing networks of upright synforms formed by crowding aside by, and sinking between, large rising diapiric, elliptical composite batholiths. The batholiths include both the products of new crustal melts and variably remobilized mid-crustal gneisses. The greenstone belts are defined by late deformation of regionally semiconcordant volcanic and sedimentary successions: and are not relies of successively formed volcanic chains. Little deformation generally preceded the diapirism, and metamorphism was primarily of contact type. The regionally uniform areal density and accordant crustal level of the diapiric batholiths, their contacts primarily against the oldest strata of the synforms, their general age 10-20 million years younger than most of the flanking stratiform rocks, and considerations of high Archean radiogenic heat productivity all fit the explanation that the batholiths were mobilized by partial melting of hydrous lower crust by radiogenic heating. Diapirism was accompanied by modest regional orthogonal shortening and extension of the hot upper crust, producing the orientations of the batholiths. Rise of the batholiths greatly increased the petrologic fractionation of the crust and the concentration of radionuclides high in it, resulting in cooling of the deeper crust and subjacent mantle, and thus cratonization. The upper crust, containing the granite-and-greenstone aggregates, was decoupled from the gneissic middle crust, which underwent flattening and extension subparallel to the elongation of the shallow batholiths. This deep deformation may have been driven by flow of dense restites toward delamination loci from which they sank into the mantle.
   The early Earth was probably wholly molten. The surface of the Earth, like that of the Moon, must have been wholly recycled by impacts before 3.9 Ga and heavily modified by them until 3.8 Ga. Zircons as old as 4.2 Ga have been found as elastic grains in much younger Archean quartzites, and polycyclic migmatites, last partly melted and reconstituted under hydrous conditions only after 3.6 Ga,contain relict zircons as old as 4.0 Ga. The lithologies of the early Earth protoliths in which these zircons formed have not been established, but impact melts and breccias must be represented, and magma-ocean fractionates may be. The nature of the transitition in tectonic style into the granite-and-greenstone mode is unknown.
   Plate tectonic rifting and convergence were operating by about 2.0 Ga and were in an essentially modern mode by about 0.8 Ga. The nature of the transition from the granite-and-greenstone mode at about 2.6 Gate plate mode by about 2.0 Ga has yet to be defined. The change may have been facilitated by the increasing content of water and carbon dioxide in the mantle as dense, but hydrated, delaminated Archean crust sank into it. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Regional integration oriented transformations in the Baltic region, as well as the unified social, economic and technological space formation processes are described and analysed. These processes are comprehended as an important factor of further social, economic and technological modernization in the Baltic countries, as a precondition for more intensive and active integration of Baltic economic systems into the European and global economic and technological structures, as well as a knowledge based society and knowledge economy creation factor.
   The arguments determining the idea of the Baltic region community and unity, as well as opposing arguments are evaluated. The main Principles of integration in the Baltic region, as well as the possible integration strategies are analyzed. The unified social, economic and technological space in the Baltic region as a research area is described.
   Formation of the unified social, economic and technological space in the Baltic region could be defined as an important precondition for further modernization and for more intensive and active integration of the national and regional societal and economic systems into the common European and global development processes. Formation of this unified space in the Baltic region could be comprehend as a successful case of the regional integration oriented transformations in the European Union: regional integration oriented transformations could be defined as an important aspect of the social, economic and technological modernization in the European Union in general, and as an important factor of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy creation.
   Regional integration oriented transformations and the unified spaces in the Baltic region formation processes could be defined as an important and a complicated scientific research area.
   The main research priorities in the area of formation of the unified social, economic and technological space in the Baltic region are the following ones:
   - the preparation of the conception of the Baltic region as a whole, including preparation and evaluation of various system indicators of Baltic region,
   - the complex analysis of the expressions of centripetal and centrifugal force forming in the Baltic region as a system,
   - the complex analysis of the arguments
   - determining the idea of the Baltic region community and unity,
   - the complex analysis of the opposing arguments to the idea of the Baltic region being a community,
   - the formation of regulating and self regulating mechanisms for Baltic region's development,
   - the social, economic and technological integration strategies for Baltic region.
   The basis for the formation of a unified social, economic, technological space in the Baltic region is the comprehension of this region as a whole. The comprehension of the Baltic region as a whole is based upon the formation and implementation of political, economic, and social development regulations, and the Baltic region as a unified geopolitical, social and economic system's development strategy preparation and realization should be understood as the principle problem of the Baltic countries' more intensive and active integration into European and world structures. The solution of these problems, requiring a deep and complete set of arguments, could be the essential basis to modernize the Baltic countries, their economic systems and societal structures.
   The comprehension of the Baltic region as a whole includes these important problem areas:
   - the commonality of the Baltic countries and unified activity system and the evaluation of the effects of these actions,
   - the specific distinguishing features of the countries, due to their shared problems and integration difficulties,
   - external and internal effects and environments, determining their integration prospects and limitations,
   - the integration mechanisms and conditions for them to surface and spread,
   - the mechanisms, and their dynamic possibilities, for more intensive and active integration into European and world structures by the Baltic region as a whole.
   The development of the Baltic region as a whole and its effectiveness, is largely based upon how sensible and effective these development regulations are, and also the self-regulation mechanisms. Regulating and self-regulating mechanism targeting allows the programming and planning of development, and foreseeing the forms of rational separate country specializations and their cooperation and ties with other countries. The basis of these mechanisms could be spread even in the inter-regional integration processes of the Baltic countries.
   The systematic studies of the Baltic region as a geopolitical, economic, technological, social and cultural whole are very prospective and actual in various ways toward the direction of practical and scientific activity.

AB  - The relevance. Electrolysis of hydrogen fluoride of potassium difluoride molten KF center dot nHF system is the only industrial method for obtaining fluorine. In this case, medium-temperature (95-105 degrees C) electrolyzers with an electrolyte of KF center dot 2HF composition with a current strength of 5 to 40 kA are mainly used. The electrolyzer is a very complex device, but many problems associated with the corrosivity of fluorine, hydrogen fluoride and other fluoride environments have been already solved. At the same time, there is a technological challenge to increase the service life of anodes made of carbon plates. Carbon has various forms depending on the structure of the material: graphite, soot, coke, diamond and others. The most stable carbon form for electrolysis of medium flowing at 95 +/- 105 degrees C was coke, wherein the carbon has a disordered X-ray-amorphous structure, so these plates called coke. Coke plates are obtained mainly from petroleum pyrolysis low-sulfur coke of a certain fractional composition and coal tar pitch. Recently, coke plates have become of extremely poor quality. Some components of the plates were replaced by cheaper ones, for example, oil pitch was replaced by coal tar. The quality of the coke plates produced by Russian manufacturers must meet the requirements of Technical Specifications (TS) 48-12-34-95 "Coke burned plates". TS establish the following indicators and requirements for them: apparent density - not less than 1,64 kg/dm(3); compressive strength - not less than 58,8 MPa; porosity - no more than 21 %; ash content is not more than 0,6 %; the specific electrical resistance is (25-40). mu Om.m. In the analysis of fluorine production in Russia, it was noted that the life of many coke plates that meet the requirements specifications is not the maximum. This testifies that the indicators set by this specification are not enough to assess the quality of a coke plate. Therefore, research for development of new quality tests of coke plates is relevant. Due to this we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the quality of coke plates produced by foreign companies in order to test the possibility of using them in fluorine production in Russia.
   The main aim is to analyze physical-mechanical, chemical and physicochemical properties of coke plates made by foreign firms and their quality.
   Methods: differential thermal analysis, X-ray structural analysis, atomic emission spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, physical-mechanical and electrical methods of analysis.
   Results. The authors have determined density, porosity, ash content, specific resistance, compressive strength of coke-oven plates of foreign manufacturers, which basically meet the requirements of TS 48-12-34-95. However, they differ. The compressive strength of Chinese plates of the "HS" mark exceeds the requirements of TS by almost 1,8 times. The porosity and ash content of Japanese plates are much lower than the requirements of TS. The elemental analysis of plates by atomic-emission spectroscopy method was carried out and it was established that the chemical compositions of coke plates are close. The total content of impurities in the investigated coke plates does not exceed 0,5-0,6 wt. %, the content of the main harmful sulfur impurity in the samples being not more than 0,1-0,3 %. The size of pores and their distribution in the plates were determined by scanning electron microscopy. In general, French and Chinese samples are characterized by pores with dimension in the range of 2,9-117 mu m. German samples are characterized by pore size which is less than 5,9 mu m. Almost 70 % of pores of Japanese samples correspond to three intervals: 2,9-5,9; 2,0-2,3 and 0,9-2,0 mu m. X-ray diffraction analyses show that materials of all manufacturers have similar diffraction patterns, except for the samples of Japanese "GS-R", which are characterized by the presence of a significant amount of carbon with a graphite structure, determined by the position of the reflexes. This is obviously due to the various conditions of crystal formation in production of these coke plates. According to the results of differential thermal analysis, the authors determined the characteristics of the main processes occurring during heating the coke plates in the air. The coke plates we classified as well according to thermal stability.

AB  - The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Arabian Sea is the thickest of the three oceanic OMZ. It is of global biogeochemical significance because of denitrification in the upper part leading to N-2 and N2O production. The residence time of OMZ water is believed to be less than a decade. The upper few hundred meters of this zone are nearly anoxic but non-sulfidic and still support animal (metazoan) pelagic life, possibly as a result of episodic injections of O-2 by physical processes.
   We report on discrete measurements of dissolved O-2 and NO2-, temperature and salinity made between 1959 and 2004 well below the tops of the sharp pycnocline and oxycline near 150, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m depth. We assemble nearly all O-2 determinations (originally there were 849 values, 695 of which came from the OMZ) by the visual endpoint detection of the iodometric Winkler procedure, which in our data base yields about 0.04 mL L-1 (similar to 2 mu M) O-2 above the endpoint from modern automated titration methods. We acknowledge that much lower (nanomolar) O-2 values have been measured recently with the STOX (Switchable Trace amount OXygen) sensor in the eastern tropical South Pacific, and that similar conditions may also prevail in the Arabian Sea OMZ. In spite of the error in O-2 measurements at vanishingly low levels, we argue that the temporal trends of the historic data should still hold.
   We find 632 values acceptable (480 from 150 stations in the OMZ). The data are grouped in zonally paired boxes of 1 degrees lat. and 2 degrees long. centered at 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, and 21 degrees N along 65 and 67 degrees E. The latitudes of 8-12 degrees N, outside the OMZ, are treated in passing. The principal results are as follows: (1) an O-2 climatology for the upper OMZ reveals a marked seasonality at 200 to 500 m depth with O-2 levels during the northeast monsoon and spring intermonsoon seasons elevated over those during the southwest monsoon season (median difference, 0.08 mL L-1 [similar to 3.5 mu M]). The medians of the slopes of the seasonal regressions of O-2 on year for each of the NE and SW monsoon seasons are -0.0043 and -0.0019 mL L-1 a(-1), respectively (-0.19 and -0.08 mu Ma(-1); n = 10 and 12, differing at p = 0.01); (2) four decades of statistically significant decreases of O-2 between 15 and 20 degrees N but an opposing trend toward an increase near 21 degrees N are observed. The mechanisms of the balance that more or less annually maintain the O-2 levels are still uncertain. At least between 300 and 500 m, the replenishment is inferred to be due to isopycnal re-supply of O-2, while at 200 (or 250?) m it is diapycnal, most likely by eddies. Similarly, recent models show large vertical advection of O-2 well below the pycnoclines and oxyclines.
   The NO2- distribution, taken as an indicator of active NO3- reduction, does not show a trend in the redox environment for a quarter of a century at a GEOSECS station near 20 degrees N. In the entire OMZ, the regression slopes on year within seasons for the rather variable NO2- do not present a clear pattern but by other measures tended to an increase of NO2-.
   Vertical net hauls collect resident animal (metazoan) pelagic life in the NO2- maximum of the OMZ at O-2 levels well below the lower limit of the Winkler titration; the extremely low O-2 content is inferred from the presence of NO2- believed to be produced through microbial NO3- reduction. Instead of the difficult measurement by the STOX sensor, the relation between the very low O-2 inferred from presence of NO2- and mesozooplankton should be studied with 100 to 150 L bottles rather than nets.
   The spatial (within drift stations) and temporal (daily) variability in hydrography and chemistry is large also below the principal pycnocline. The seasonal change of hydrography is considerable even at 500 m depth. Future O-2 or nutrient budgets for the OMZ must not be based on single cruises or sections obtained during one season only. Steady state cannot be assumed any longer for the intermediate layers of the central Arabian Sea.

AB  - The purpose of the research is a complex of theoretical and applied provisions on the formation, evaluation, and improvement of the methodology of evaluation of the investment attractiveness of enterprises. Methodology. In the process of research, the following methods were used: methods of comparison, analysis and synthesis is used in determining the features of conceptual approaches to the concept of investment attractiveness of an enterprise and the formation of the author's definition of this category; method of diagnostic evaluation is used in the evaluation of existing models for analysing the investment attractiveness of enterprises; method of expert evaluation is used for the building of flexible limits of levels of investment attractiveness of the enterprise; methods of system and structural analysis is used for developing the basic elements and the general structure of the model of interpretation of the method of graphical integration; the method of graphic integration is used within the construction of graphs of investment attractiveness of enterprises A and B. The aim of the study is to justify of the approach to create a model that can justify of the feasibility of investing and determine the factors and conditions of investment attractiveness of the enterprise for different participants of the investment process. The findings of the study. The results of the research suggested an improved definition of the concept of investment attractiveness of the enterprise, which took into account the following disadvantages of existing approaches to the present essence of the concept: the investment attractiveness of the enterprise is often associated with the system of financial and economic indicators of the activity of enterprise, while not taking into account also an important social and psychological factor, since the very name of the term "investment attractiveness of the enterprise" includes the social-psychological element in the form of the concept of "attractiveness", which is widely used in economic literature; the subjective view of the potential investor on the fact that the object being considered for investing to satisfy the investor's expectations regarding the economic or social effect is significant. This aspect is key in determining of concept of investment attractiveness of the enterprise, when choosing an investor of an enterprise to invest its capital for the purpose of investing; it is necessary to achieve consistency and symbiosis between the evaluation of financial and economic, socio-psychological, industrial, innovative, environmental and other factors, which in the complex form the investment attractiveness of the enterprise; using the expression "high level of profitability on investment with minimal risks" is partially incorrect in some definitions of the investment attractiveness of the enterprise since obtaining high profits involves a certain level of risk and each investor knows about this; the importance of increasing the investment attractiveness of the enterprise has the level of involvement of innovation in the activities of the enterprise in the frames of use of investment capital; the targeting of almost all definitions only on high financial and economic indicators, which, depending on the situation, are not always correct.
   A complex system of indicators for evaluation of the investment attractiveness of an enterprise is proposed, consisting of six groups of indicators (market position, property complex, profitability, financial stability, risks, innovative potential), each of which includes six coefficients determining the level of investment attractiveness for this group. The features and advantages of this system of indicators are: complexity and complementary to standard methods with indicators of the level of investment risk and innovative potential of enterprises; standardization of indicators; unidirectionality of indicators; Flexibility of the recommended limits for each coefficient. The method of graphical integration of the investment attractiveness of the enterprise, which has several advantages over other methods, proposed in the scientific literature, is offered because: it is a combination that includes the advantages of an integral method, as well as a market, and partially matrix method; it allows quantifying various aspects of economic activity of the enterprise by the elementary calculation of a certain number of coefficients; it does not require significant time to spend on the evaluation; it has a mathematical justification since the final indicators for comparing the investment attractiveness of several enterprises are calculated using the numerical integration method; it has the flexibility of determining the level of investment attractiveness of an enterprise by incorporating into the methodology in accordance with the socio-psychological component of the concept of investment attractiveness and the interests of the investor; gives a visual interpretation of the results of investment attractiveness assessment.

AB  - Adoption or adaptation of new technologies particularly among upland farmers is not an easy task. It is recognized that any successful land use allocation decision, particularly in upland areas, has to consider the environmental, social and economic constraints of a given locale.
   This paper aimed to provide a design of an upland agricultural development plan that integrates the biophysical, social, financial and market factors for sustainable implementation in Casiguran Aurora, Philippines. Market scanning, through the use of a ten-year moving average farm gate price indexes was initially undertaken to determine the market potentials of candidate crops. Market soundness based on farm gate prices reflects not only the supply and demand interactions of the various crops but has likewise reflects the cost of transportation of the buyers from Casiguran, Aurora to their respective locations. The biophysical scanning (e.g. slope, climate, soil fertility, and water availability assessments) based on soil suitability analysis, site visits to determine water resource availability, examination of secondary data on climate conditions and GIS mapping to determine slope and elevation information was likewise undertaken to further scale down the crop mixes. After which, farm level profitability and social scanning were undertaken to complete the process of integration of all relevant factors. Market-farm profitability indexes were used to integrate market and financial soundness for individual crop that compose the crop mixes. A test on the model's financial viability based on incremental costs and benefits of the crop mixes identified and sensitivity analysis to reflect decreasing benefits and increasing cost scenarios were undertaken.
   Results of the scanning process yielded a crop mix that included lettuce, Chinese cabbage, carrots, and sweet pea for vegetable crops; black pepper and ginger for annual/biennial crops; and banana, rambutan, cashew and pommelo for fruits and plantation crops based, on market and profitability criteria. The study has identified the crop mixes in terms of its technical compatibilities with that of soil characteristics, climate, water availability, and topography/slope of the study area. The cation exchange capacity (5.6-6), percentage base saturation (>60), exchangeable calcium (12-15) magnesium (2-6.4) and sodium (1.39) are rated high and are generally sufficient for crops identified. Low available potassium, phosphorous and organic carbon was noted and was likewise considered in determining the crop mix.
   The slope suitability and the current forest cover of Casiguran were considered in estimating the proposed area for cultivation in the site. Based on the slope of proposed site, three (3) zones have been identified as the major basis in designing the land management options to address the sustainability aspects of development of the upland area.
   The list was further modified to include pak-choy, squash, vanilla, purple yam, robusta and Arabica coffee, mangosteen, durian, lanzones, and pili to reflect the preferences of the local farmers. The final composition of the crop mixes was based on the integration of their soil suitabilities, climatic, water, and slope requirements, market potential, farmers' preferences, and farm level profitabilities.
   The estimated Net Present Value (NPV) of PhP 64 million, Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 42%, and a Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of 2.16 suggest that the proposed upland development plan has a very strong financial viability. Sensitivity tests revealed that the NPV is the most sensitive for any given benefit decrease or cost increase with sensitivity indicators (SIs) of 36.67 and 21.68, respectively. The proposed project's BCR is less sensitive to any benefit decrease and cost increase with SI values of only 14.81 and 25.93, correspondingly. The overall financial analysis proved that the investments to be made in developing the upland area shall provide significant amount of benefits to the investors. This study recommends that agricultural development in the Philippine uplands should ensure that an integrated technical, market, financial and social soundness are incorporated in the design. To further ensure sustainability in the proposed area, a land management option by slope category (i. e. terracing and contour hedgegrows) is highly recommended by this study. In particular, the need to consider the bio-physical, market and financial factors must be stressed among the upland farmers not only to protect the upland areas but also to ensure the sustainability of their upland farming operations and their incomes.

AB  - On the background of the theories an inter-national trade and the new growth theories the author of this paper seeks above all the explanation of a ver) frequented term of competitiveness in terms of convergence and divergence in the world economy, its adequate definition and place within the framework of the economic policy mainly in less developed countries. He has chosen the approach, where the development of international trade theory is not judged from the standpoint of traditional explanations of the grounds for trading between countries, but centres his attention at the origins of these grounds. Just this is important from the standpoint of the theoretical explanation of current motive powers in the international trade dynamisation. In conformity with many economists the author comes to the conclusion that classic and neo-classic theory of international trade is indeed rich in theoretical platforms, provides nevertheless little explanation for current growth conditions of the international trade. The author contrariwise ascribes more chances here for alternative (new) theoretical concepts of the trade among countries. Such approaches as for instance the concept of imitation gap, product differentiation, production cycle theory represent currently one of the two methodological support pillars of the competitive economy phenomenon. According to the author the second pillar is the so called endogenous theory of the economic growth. This view is based on the fact, that this theory is founded in principle on the identical factors that present new theories of international trade. Prom the methodological point of view one can characterise current convergence tendencies of the theories of international trade and economic growth as a phase of repeated return towards the integrated research of economic advantage, as was the case in times of A. Smith, when the growth theory was in fact the theory of international trade, and vice versa.
   As a result of cited bases the author postulates both higher adequacy of the term competitive advantage, and the thesis that the problem of competitiveness need not be reduced to the foreign trade sphere, but that one should consider it as a problem of the overall development of the supply side of economy, as a process of competitive advantage generation through cost minimising and real technological increase of productivity level.
   The second part of the paper is dedicated to the policy of competitiveness with a special attention to less developed countries. From the point of view of the relevant relation to this problem the author assesses the concept of import substitution versus the support of exports and comes to the conclusion that even the import substitution in suggested modification can be a part of competitiveness policy. In this part the author criticises the concept of the so called industrial policy oriented at structural changes, which is applied in many countries and suggest to substitute it by a wider concept of competitiveness. The author establishes this concept on the one side by the differentiation of real growth factors of the economy competitiveness, and the tools of policy supporting competitiveness and providing the entrepreneuring environment that belongs to the government sphere. On the other side the author attaches main importance to the exercising of generally functional policies, and relatively lesser, still inevitable importance is attached to the so called specific (intersectional and horizontally acting) policies.
   In the closing part of the paper the themes are raised for the generation of the policy of competitiveness within the framework of the Slovak economy. One suggests that the policy of competitiveness support of the Slovak economy in the conceptual documents of the government should not be understood as some appendix of the macro-economy policy, but to be treated as an interconnected complex of fiscal, monetary and income policy, policy of institutional reforms and of the so called specific policies. The competitiveness policy so far was mistakenly limited just to these specific policies. One therefore suggests that the conceptual documents of the government dealing with the economy development should analyse not only macro-economic quantities but also real factors of the growth of competitiveness and consequently formulate priorities in this sphere. These priorities should include also the problem of price level convergence and indicator ERDI towards developed countries and its adequate reflection in the exchange rate or eventually in the overall monetary policy. Among the so called specific policies dominating role should play their horizontal functioning, above all in the sphere of generation, diffusion and implementation of technologies and innovations, further in the spheres of export support, the inflow of direct foreign investments and the development of line infrastructure. The generation and implementation of such a framework could contribute to the reduction of gaps in competitiveness of the Slovak economy compared to that of developed countries and for the catching-up process within the Slovak integration into the EU.
   Even if the contents of the paper aims predominantly at its exploitation in decision making processes, the evaluation of international trade and economic growth can contribute for further development of the theory of international trade and world economy.

AB  - Simple Summary A newborn's survival depends on the quick adaptation of the organism to new environmental conditions. Newborn calves show high somatic maturity compared to, for example, human newborns, but their body functions with a lower efficiency than that of adult cattle. Adaptation processes concern all organs, including the kidneys, which are not morphologically mature after birth. The ongoing morphological changes imply functional alterations in the kidneys. There is an increase in blood flow through the kidneys and the glomerular filtration rate, as well as an increase in the efficiency of resorption processes of primary urine components into the blood, including proteins. Protein is present in trace amounts in the urine of healthy adults of various species. It can occur in larger amounts in the urine of sick animals, as well as in certain physiological states, e.g., in newborns. The presence of protein in the urine of newborns in the quantity exceeding 300 mg/24 h/m(2) is called neonatal proteinuria. The causes of proteinuria in healthy newborns have not been clearly elucidated. Many studies have focused on proteinuria in newborns and sick children and sick animals, especially dogs and cats. The present study was the first to quantify the hypothesis of the occurrence of proteinuria in healthy calves in the first week of life and to assess its intensity and dynamics, based on the analysis of changes in total protein excretion in the urine and its fractions differing in molecular weight (albumin, low molecular weight proteins (LMW) and high molecular weight proteins (HMW)). It should be noted that the analysis of excreted protein fractions is a sensitive diagnostic indicator of the type of kidney disease, e.g., increased HMW protein excretion may indicate damage to the renal glomeruli, and loss of LMW proteins may indicate renal tubular disease. Urine testing is a convenient, non-invasive method of obtaining information about body functions. Depending on the intended purpose, urine testing may be qualitative and/or quantitative. Urine analysis can also include proteins. There are no data in the literature on the occurrence of proteinuria in healthy neonatal calves. The present study was the first that aimed to quantify the hypothesis of proteinuria occurrence in these animals in the first week of life, to assess its intensity and dynamics and to understand the underlying causes of proteinuria in healthy calves. The research was carried out on 15 healthy calves in the first seven days of life. Calves were catheterized to determine minute diuresis. Total protein concentration was determined in blood plasma and urine. Urine proteins were separated by electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and their concentration and percentage were determined by densitometry using an image archiving and analysis software. The separated proteins were divided into three groups according to molecular weight for albumin, LMW and HMW proteins. The results were standardized per 1 m(2) of body surface area and statistically analyzed. Neonatal proteinuria was demonstrated in healthy calves, mainly resulting from the high concentration of LMW proteins in the urine. Their percentages decreased significantly from 84.46% on the first day of calves' life to 64.02% on day 7. At the same time, a statistically significant increase was observed in the proportion of albumin and high molecular weight proteins in urine total protein. Albumin percentage increased from 9.
   54% (on day 1) to almost 20% (on day 7), while the proportion of HMW proteins increased from 6.68% to 18.
   13%, respectively. The concentration of total protein in the urine of newborn calves amounted to 14.64 g/L and decreased statistically significantly during the first 72 h of postnatal life, stabilizing at the level of 3-4 g/L. The mean value of total protein excretion in the first week of life was 4.81 mg/min/m(2) (i.e., 6.93 g/24 h/m(2)). The analysis of protein concentration in the urine and its excretion, as well as changes in urinary excretion of the tested protein fractions, indicated that neonatal proteinuria in healthy neonatal calves was tubular (i.e., main reason is the reduced absorption of proteins in nephrons). In addition, research showed that there was a rapid improvement in resorptive mechanisms in tubular cells. It should be assumed that the filtration barrier in the kidneys of these animals after birth is morphologically prepared to retain high molecular weight proteins. It seems that the increased permeability of the filtration barrier in the glomeruli does not necessarily indicate the immaturity of the kidneys, but may indicate the kidneys' adaptation to excess protein removal from the body during feeding with high-protein food (colostrum), with an open intestinal barrier enabling protein absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood.

AB  - For the first time in the conditions of commercial poultry production of the Chuvash Republic, a system for realizing the bioresource potential of productive traits of meat and egg-laying chicken of Lohmann Brown variety was introduced, which provides for the activation of nonspecific resistance and specific immunogenesis of the body with the immunotropic drug PV-1, developed by scientists of the Chuvash State Agricultural Academy. It is scientifically grounded and experimentally proved that feeding chickens of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd experimental groups with the drug PV-1 at doses of 0.05 ml/kg, 0.10 ml/kg and 0.15 ml/kg of live weight, respectively, once a day for 10 days with a 10-day break, with the repetition of cycles up to their 111-day age, stimulates the growth and development of young birds. On the 110th day of scientific and economic tests, the young birds of the experimental groups exceeded in the live weight of peers in the control group by 5.4%, 7.1% and 10.1% (P<0.01-0.001), respectively. The dynamics of changes in the absolute and average daily gain in live weight of tested young birds depended on the dose of the drug, and the maximum efficiency was established at a dose of 0.15 ml per 1 kg of live weight. It was found that the use of the PV-1 contributes to an increase in erythropoiesis, leukopoiesis and protein metabolism, as well as immunobiological indicators of the hematological profile of nonspecific resistance of the bird organism from 60 days of age (P<0.01-0.001). An increase in the number of red blood cells and the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood of tested birds on the background of immunocorrection show an improvement in their hematopoiesis, and an increase in the number of leukocytes indicates the activation of cellular protective factors of the body. The total protein content in the experimental groups enhanced due to an increase in the number of albumin and gamma globulins. The activation of nonspecific resistance of the bird organism against the use of the PV-1 immunostimulating drug was established according to the parameters of phagocytic activity of leukocytes, phagocytic index, lysozyme and bactericidal activity of blood serum. Immunization of birds with the use of the immunotropic drug PV-1 is accompanied by immunity stress: at Gumboro disease vaccination of chickens, the titers of specific antibodies increases by 53.3%, at Newcastle disease vaccination - by 50.0%, and at egg drop syndrome (EDS -76) vaccination - by 26.5 % If the egg production of the initial laying hen for 68 weeks of life in the control group was 196, then in the first experimental group it was 9.2% more, in the second experimental group - 9.7% more, in the third experimental group - 17.8% more. Based on the average laying hen, egg production in the experimental groups was higher than in the control: in the 1st experimental - by 4.1%, in the 2nd experimental - by 5.4% and in the 3rd experimental - by 11.8%. Laying hens of the control group reached 50% egg-laying at the age of 158 days, in the 1st and 2nd experimental groups - at 152 days of age, in the 3rd experimental group - at 155 days of age. The climax of the egg-laying capacity of the laying hens of the tested groups was at the 6th month of egg-laying: in the control group at 199 days of age, the 1st experimental group at 192 days of age, in the 2nd experimental group at the age of 200 days, and in the 3rd experimental group at 183 days of age.
   Against the background of the intensification of immunogenesis and nonspecific resistance of the body to the pressure of environmental and technological stress factors of habitat, the safety of the bird increases. The safety for 4 weeks of growth was 98.3% in the control group, 98.3% in the 1st experimental group, and 100% in the 2nd and 3rd experimental groups. A study of the meat productivity of birds raised with the use of the PV-1 revealed an increase in slaughter yield by 1.7 - 5.0%, the yield of edible parts increased by 62 +/- 3.20 - 155 +/- 3.40 g (P<0.001). To actualize productivity, to enhance non-specific resistance and ensure bird safety, we recommend using the PV-1 immunostimulating drug at a dose of 0.15 ml per 1 kg of live weight by feeding with fodder once a day for 10 days with a 10-day break. To increase immunity against Gumboro, Newcastle and SSN-76 diseases, we recommend using the PV-1 at a dose of 0.1-0.15 ml per 1 kg of live weight by feeding with fodder 10-12 days before immunization.

TI  - Slovenian export and the tools supporting it
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - Slovenia continues to achieve considerable results both in an overall economic efficiency, and in export performance as well. The overall economic performance (judged by the indicator of GDP per capita) reaches 73 % of the average EU level; this is the highest performance among all transitional countries. Slovenian export performance (measured by an indicator of export per capita) is more than two times higher than the Slovak level, and compared to Polish export performance Slovenian export performance exceeds the Polish one even more than six times. Even when considering that the small economy (the case of Slovenia) naturally tends to be more open towards the world, Slovenian example demonstrates the fact that export performance depends not only on the support of export directly in the foreign business sphere, yet it depends also (possibly by a greater extent) on the overall economic performance.
   Needless to say, the development and the situation of the Slovenian economy is a result of the influence of the whole number of factors. One can stress two groups of factors that in the Slovenian conditions are most important. These are responsible policy of the Slovenian government and efficient enterprise sphere.
   The responsibility of the Slovenian government (governments) is proved above all by the fact that during many years they contributed considerably towards the stability and balanced economic growth; a question arises, however, whether or not a considerable payment balance deficit since 1999 signals an origin of a more serious unbalance.
   Budgetary and anti-inflationary policy was prudent too. State budget was roughly balanced, deflation was gradual (not by shock).
   Aside from prudent budgetary and anti-inflationary policy one should also point out at the fact that as for the transformation strategy, Slovenian government has not chosen a shock concept, but along with the liberalisation measures it has taken into account also the possibilities of their institutional guarantee. This feature manifested itself expressively in the Slovenian privatisation both in its speed and above all in the effort to protect Slovenian enterprises against such destabilising effects such as "pre-privatisation agony", "tunnelling" etc.
   Besides, towards the efficiency of the Slovenian enterprising sphere contributed also the fact, that already during the times of the Yugoslav autonomous system the enterprises bad to bear to a large extent responsibility for their own destiny; changeover into the market system meant for them therefore smaller shock compared to the enterprises in other transforming countries, where centralist and administrative system was abandoned.
   Especially in the sphere of foreign trade stable and solid enterprises explain that Slovenia on the whole mastered complicated export tasks of strategic reorientation from the East towards the West.
   As for the commodity structure of Slovenian exports, its marked feature represent more sophisticated products (or components for these). These products were, after all, characteristic for the Slovenian product flows to other parts of the former Yugoslavia. After the disintegration of Yugoslavia this fact facilitated reorientation of these product flows into the western markets.
   Neighbouring countries of the EU (plus France and Croatia) play a decisive role in the territorial structure of Slovenian export. Germany has here a special position as Slovenia's trade balance with Germany is highly active (whereas Slovenian balance with other EU countries is passive). Slovenian foreign trade with the V4 countries increases at a considerable rate, its volume, however, remains still small.
   As for direct tools to support exports in the foreign trade sphere, general trend was as in the other transforming countries - decreased importance of the "classic" tools such as custom duties etc. One used in Slovenia new political tools to support exports (for instance devaluation) on a small scale only and their contribution to the export growth is considered to be unimportant.
   Among direct tools supporting export measures that are gaining importance are foreign trade diplomacy, support for the participation at trade fairs, recently also the support of information service (mainly for small and medium enterprises).
   Decisive and ever growing importance among export supporting tools take over the activities of the Slovenian Export Association. Its most important and most extensive activity is the export insurance; in the year 1999 it covered 7 % of the Slovenian export. The Association insures on its own account mainly less risky operations (for instance short-term ones); more risky operations (for instance medium-term operations, political risks) are insured by the Association on the account of the government.
   Export activity financing (basically refunding part of export credits granted directly by commercial banks) belongs to the main activities of the Slovenian Export Association. Exports of large scale complexes of machine equipment are preferred here. Important instrument is also partial interest rate subsidy.
   Slovenian Export Association also provides guarantees. Preferred are the export transactions that are insured against non-commercial risks. The extent of guarantee activities is modest at present - roughly 1 % of the Slovenian exports.

AB  - Background Since 2011, the protracted Syrian war has had tragic consequences on the lives of the Syrian people, threatening their stability, health, and well-being. The most vulnerable are children, who face interruption of schooling and child labor. This study explored the relationship between social capital and the physical health and emotional well-being of Syrian refugee working children in rural areas of Lebanon. Methods and findings In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 4,090 Syrian refugee children working in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon in 2017. Children (8-18 years) gave direct testimony on their living and social environment in face-to-face interviews. Logistic regressions assessed the association of social capital and social cohesion with the health and emotional well-being of Syrian refugee working children; specifically, poor self-rated health, reporting a health problem, engaging in risky health behavior, feeling lonely, feeling optimistic, and being satisfied with life. Of the 4,090 working children in the study, 11% reported poor health, 16% reported having a health problem, and 13% were engaged in risky behaviors. The majority (67.5%) reported feeling lonely, while around 53% were optimistic and 59% were satisfied with life. The study findings suggest that positive social capital constructs were associated with better health. Lower levels of social cohesion (e.g., not spending time with friends) were significantly associated with poor self-rated health, reporting a physical health problem, and feeling more lonely ([adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.4; CI 1.76-3.36,p< 0.001], [AOR, 1.9; CI 1.44-2.55,p< 0.001], and [AOR, 0.5; CI 0.38-0.76,p< 0.001], respectively). Higher levels of social support (e.g., having good social relations), family social capital (e.g., discussing personal issues with parents), and neighborhood attachment (e.g., having a close friend) were all significantly associated with being more optimistic ([AOR, 1.5; CI 1.2-1.75,p< 0.001], [AOR, 1.3; CI 1.11-1.52,p< 0.001], and [AOR, 1.9; CI 1.58-2.29,p< 0.001], respectively) and more satisfied with life ([AOR, 1.3; CI 1.01-1.54,p= 0.04], [AOR, 1.2; CI 1.01-1.4,p= 0.04], and [AOR, 1.3; CI 1.08-1.6,p= 0.006], respectively). The main limitations of this study were its cross-sectional design, as well as other design issues (using self-reported health measures, using a questionnaire that was not subject to a validation study, and giving equal weighting to all the components of the health and emotional well-being indicators). Conclusions This study highlights the association between social capital, social cohesion, and refugee working children's physical and emotional health. In spite of the poor living and working conditions that Syrian refugee children experience, having a close-knit network of family and friends was associated with better health. Interventions that consider social capital dimensions might contribute to improving the health of Syrian refugee children in informal tented settlements (ITSs).
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? The war in Syria has resulted in a large displacement of the population to neighboring Lebanon, where many vulnerable displaced families are living in informal tented settlements (ITSs) with no access to means of livelihood and resources, and child labor among these displaced families is high. This study aimed to investigate the associations between social capital and cohesion and the health and emotional well-being of Syrian refugee children. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,902 households of Syrian displaced families living in ITSs in a rural area in Lebanon and interviewed 4,090 working Syrian refugee children aged between 8 and 18 years. Around 11% of the working children rated their health as poor, 16% reported having a physical health problem, and 13% were engaged in risky health behaviors. Lower social cohesion was significantly associated with reporting poor health, and a lower level of social support was significantly associated with engaging in risky health behaviors. Higher levels of neighborhood attachment, family social capital, and social support were significantly associated with greater optimism and life satisfaction, and higher levels of neighborhood attachment and social cohesion were significantly associated with feeling less lonely. What do these findings mean? Social capital and social cohesion are associated with reporting better health and emotional well-being among Syrian refugee children working and living in Lebanon. Policies aimed at promoting the physical and emotional well-being of Syrian refugee children should consider interventions that aim to maintain social capital among these populations.

AB  - Author summaryWhy was this study done? Protecting the health of the tens of thousands of refugees and other migrants, including Cubans, resettling in the US is key to ensuring successful resettlement. Between 2010 and 2015, Cubans comprised a large portion of migrants resettling in the US arriving by one of two routes: (1) some received either refugee or parole status to enter the US while still in Cuba, and (2) some applied for parole status after arrival in the US. Yet little is known regarding the health status of Cubans entering the US (and, more specifically, whether the health status differed by these two routes of entry), and therefore more information is needed to inform screening procedures and health interventions for this population. What did the researchers do and find? We developed mathematical models using data collected from clinic visits shortly after arrival to the US that describe differences in health patterns between these two routes of entry among Cubans who arrived in the US from 2010 to 2015. Overall, the health patterns between the two routes of entry may differ with respect to certain health outcomes; specifically, those with parole status after arrival were less likely to screen positive for parasitic infections. Additionally, the results indicated that the Cuban migrant health profile is more similar to that of those born in the US compared with other migrant and refugee populations resettling in the US. What do these findings mean? US clinicians can use these findings to understand potential health concerns of the tens of thousands of Cubans living in the US. The findings can also be used to strengthen health screening guidance and can assist in developing health interventions specific to Cubans living in the US.
   Background Protecting the health of refugees and other migrant populations in the United States is key to ensuring successful resettlement. Therefore, to identify and address health concerns early, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a domestic medical examination (screening for infectious and noninfectious diseases/conditions) shortly after arrival in the US. However, because refugee/migrant populations often have differing health patterns from one another and the US population, the collection and analysis of health information is key to developing population-specific clinical guidelines to guide the care of resettled individuals. Yet little is known regarding the health status of Cubans resettling in the US. Among the tens of thousands of Cuban migrants who have resettled in the US, some applied as refugees in Cuba, some applied for parole (a term used to indicate temporary US admission status for urgent humanitarian reasons or reasons of public benefit under US immigration law) in Cuba, and others applied for parole status after crossing the border. These groups were eligible for US government benefits to help them resettle, including a domestic medical examination. We reviewed health differences found in these examinations of those who were determined to be refugees or parolees in Cuba and those who were given parole status after arrival. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the Texas Department of State Health Services database. Cubans who arrived from 2010 to 2015 and received a domestic medical examination in Texas were included. Those granted refugee/parolee status in Cuba were listed in federal databases for US-bound refugees/parolees; those who were paroled after arrival were not listed. Overall, 2,189 (20%) obtained either refugee or parolee status in Cuba, and 8,709 (80%) received parolee status after arrival. Approximately 62% of those who received parolee status after arrival at the border were male, compared with 49% of those who obtained prior refugee/parolee status in Cuba. Approximately one-half (45%) of those paroled after arrival were 19-34 years old (versus 26% among those who obtained refugee/parolee status in Cuba). Separate models were created for each screening indicator as the outcome, with entry route as the main exposure variable. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated using PROC GENMOD procedures in SAS 9.4. Individuals paroled after arrival were less likely to screen positive for parasitic infections (9.6% versus 12.2%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.79, 0.71-0.88) and elevated blood lead levels (children <= 16 years old, 5.2% versus 12.3%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.42, 0.28-0.63). Limitations include potential disease misclassification, missing clinical information, and cross-sectional nature. Conclusions Within-country variations in health status are often not examined in refugee populations, yet they are critical to understand granular health trends. Results suggests that the health profiles of Cuban Americans in Texas differed by entry route. This information could assist in developing targeted screenings and health interventions.

AB  - Purpose Weighting is one of the steps involved in LCIA. This enables us to integrate various environmental impacts and facilitates the interpretation of environmental information. Many different weighting methodologies have already been proposed, and the results of many case studies with a single index have been published. LIME2 (Itsubo et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 17(4):488-498, 2012) developed weighting factors for four different areas of protection that reflect environmental awareness among the Japanese public. This method has already been widely used in Japan, but difficulties exist universally using the Japanese weighting factors around the world. It is presumed that the weighting varies depending on economic, cultural, and social conditions, and there are still few cases in which weighting factors have been specifically invented or studied in consideration of variance in these elements. This study attempted to develop weighting factors applicable to the Group of Twenty (G20) countries with a view toward developing those that could be used in different countries. In the study, a survey was conducted with a uniform questionnaire in G20 countries to compare the weighting factors calculated for different countries, along with an investigation on development and utilization of global weighting factors.
   Methods A conjoint analysis was conducted to give a weighting between the four areas of protection defined by LIME: human health, social assets, biodiversity, and primary production. The analysis is suitable for measuring the value of each of the multiple attributes of the environment. This study conducted a questionnaire in all the G20 member states. The survey puts priority on making the questions understood by the respondents and minimizing bias, adopting interviews, visiting surveys, and surveys in venues in the 11 emerging countries. In the developed countries, Internet surveys were conducted after confirming that their results are statistically significant from the pretest results in these states. In both surveys, random sampling was performed to take 200-250 samples (households) in each of the emerging countries and 500-600 samples in each of the developed countries. The surveys collected a total of 6400 responses. Statistical values based on this model can be considered to reflect the variability between each individual's environmental thoughts. The calculated results can then be used to compare the variety of environmental thoughts in developed and emerging countries.
   Results and discussion The study was able to obtain two different kinds of results: dimensionless weighting factors and economic indicators using the amount of willingness to pay. This paper solely presents the former. The weighting factors in the entire G20 community, in the group of developed countries (G8) and in the group of emerging countries (G20 states excluding the G8) and those in the individual G20 countries, were estimated. The calculated values were significant statistically at the 1% level (all p values for the safeguard subject coefficients were less than 0.0001), with the exception of monetary attributes for several emerging countries. Converted into dimensionless values, so that the total sum for the four subjects equals 1, the weighting factor was the highest for human health in the entire G20 circles, at 0.34, followed by biodiversity at 0.29, and primary production at 0.23. The weighting for social assets was relatively poor, at 0.13. In the G8 developed states, the figures of biodiversity and primary production were relatively higher than those of the same two subjects in the full G20. Biodiversity had the highest value, at 0.34, and was followed by human health at 0.30. On the other hand, in emerging countries, the weighting of health impacts was particularly significant, at 0.44, whereas the three other subjects had almost equivalent weightings-biodiversity at 0.19, social assets at 0.18, and primary product at 0.18. The weighting factors by country and the variance of preference intensities by country showed minor differences among developed countries while they reflected considerable differences among emerging countries.
   Conclusions Accurate weighting factors representing the environmental attitudes of the world and national public are needed in order to conduct general purpose LCA. This study is the world's first to conduct surveys with the use of the same questionnaire not only in developed countries but also in emerging countries, and to compare the findings. A total of 6400 responses were obtained via interviews and Internet surveys. The survey thus gained a statistically significant result on all the environmental attributes including the weighting factors for the G20 circles, G8 states, emerging countries exclusive of the G8 states, and individual countries in which surveys took place. The results have revealed a relatively minor difference in weighting factors and variation coefficients between the areas of protection in the developed countries whereas a considerable difference was observed between those subjects in emerging countries.

AB  - Error disclosure is now an ethical and professional obligation for health professionals and seeks to improve quality and safety in healthcare. Literature has highlighted the numerous benefits of error disclosure and several authors have described the options for handling this situation. However, it is not quite that simple to be honest and open and follow a protocol that instructs professionals to explain, support and apologise in situations where they are subject to criticism. While the many personal, institutional and social factors that hinder open disclosure have been identified, little attention has been paid to the obstacles associated with the psychological impact of disclosure, thereby limiting the debate on how professionals might be supported in their efforts to cope with error disclosure. The psychological impact of error on professionals is a well-established fact. Physicians are "second victims" likely to be emotionally affected by medical error. Emotional distress, anger, isolation, fear, guilt and shame can be intense, suggesting that, far from being an isolated act in professional practice, a medical error is a life event that modifies the psychological balance of a professional. Studies in the humanities have shown how work shapes individuals' identities. The choice to heal and care for is indicative of the ideals related to professionals' life histories, cultdres, family models and representations of health and disease. Work and, more specifically, recognition at work from their peers, patients and relatives enables health professionals to support their ideals and establish a coherent identity, and to belong to a workgroup. The error foreshadows a rupture which plunges the professional and the team in a state of vulnerability that rules out the professional's or the team's possibility to be part of a process of disclosing the error. In these conditions, a policy of security of care also involves a guarantee of the caregiver's and the team's psychological security. The term psychological security was developed by the psychoanalysis who emphasised the individual's need to evolve in a "sufficiently good" protective environment that allows him/her to contain his/her emotions, while giving the individual the possibility to express and discuss them. This space implies a relation of trust between individuals. Trust refers to the idea that the individual can trust someone, it is based on the capacity to create relations. It is only through trust that the professional will be able to open him/herself to others and construct a space where the errors and the doubts that he/she has in the context of work are shared. But if trust is essential, it is also dangerous because it implies accepting the risk of being dependent on those considered as trustworthy and the risk that they will not live up to the professional's expectations. As a consequence, the professional will only have trust when he/she has evaluated the possibility of cooperation and more precisely, as stated by Hardin, a cooperation in which the professional's interests are "encapsulated interests", in other words the interests of others. Therefore, this cooperation depends on each member of the team seeing his/her interests as being partially those of the others. Cooperation within a service reveals the relations of trust between the professionals and shows the relations of dependence that each one maintains with the others for the good administration of care.
   Thus the creation of relations of cooperation between the team members proves to be an important indicator to determine the professional's possibility to adhere to a process of disclosing the error. This approach shows that professionals must address multiple rather than single disclosures: to the self, and to others (colleagues, hierarchy, patients and families) who will mobilise specific knowledge, emotions and psychological defences. To avoid cases where disclosure takes on dimensions as tragic as the actual errors committed, it is important to pay attention to the psychic state of healthcare professionals by offering a space of free expression that enables them to better understand their feelings and gain a sense of support in order to restore their ideals and professional identities. Finally, it's important to emphasize that disclosure also depends on the preservation or restoration of the relations of cooperation within the team. Disclosure cannot be prescribed, it must emerge within a workgroup who allows the error to be thought over, communicated and shared. In this context, disclosure becomes a group rule that is known to all. A health professional who feels sufficiently supported might, in turn, support a patient and/or his/her relatives and engage in meaningful disclosure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Detailed characterization of clay minerals has been undertaken in four drill holes of the geothermal field oi Chipilapa (El Salvador) in order to improve the knowledge of clay formation and the processes of the conversion of mixed layers I-S and C-S during the geothermal activity. The high enthalpy geothermal field of Chipilapa is very recent; it is located within volcanic and volcanoclastic formations dated from Pliocene to Holocene age with a composition ranging from dacite to andesite. At the present time, the major hydrothermal activity is restricted to two highly permeable zones near a vertical fault network: a shallow vapour-dominated reservoir (500-600 m); a deeper liquid-dominated reservoir (1 100-1 400 m). The coupling of petrography with the microthermometry of fluid inclusion shows that three alteration stages successively occured and were superimposed in the geothermal field. All generated assemblages include clay minerals: (1)the first stage corresponding to thermal metamorphism (propylitic alteration), generated a chlorite + epidote + quartz +/- zeolites assemblage; (2) the later stage generated calcite + I-S + C-S + hematite assemblage. It corresponds to the epithermal alteration during which the upper part of the field was fractured, depressurized and infilled by fluids oi a very low salinity which provoked the sealing of the fracture network by carbonate deposits and crystallization of haematite and clays in adjacent wail rocks; (3) the current hydrothermal activity is interpreted as the continuation of the epithermal activity in the zones which are still permeable. The alteration assemblage is smectites + hematite + I-S (rich in smectite).
   The distribution of I-S and C-S mixed layers versus in-hole temperature and depth distinguishes the low permeable parts of the field from zones of current fluid infiltration. In low permeable zones, the general evolution oi I-S and C-S is characterized by a decrease in smectite with increasing depth. This evolution is rapid at a depth ranging from 400 to 600 m, where in-hole temperature increases by 70 degrees C. Over this range oi depth, the transitions I-S RO - I-S R1 (regularly ordered 35-40 %S) and I-S R1 (regularly ordered 35-40 %S)- I-S R1 (S < 15 %) are discontinuous. The transition saponite-corrensite and corrensite-C-S (S < 10 %) is also dicontinuous with persistence of triphased assemblages at depth ranging from 400 to 600 m. Below this depth, the conversion of C-S to chlorite is regular. in the permeable zones (reservoirs), the I-S and C-S distribution does not agree with a general deacrease in the expandable component with increasing depth and/or temperature. Smectites or smectite-rich mixed layers accompany poor expandable mixed layers which are similar to the mixed layers of the surrounding low permeable zones. Such a phenomenon leads to the association of two or three different types of I-S in core samples. in the reservoirs, saponite coexisting with iron-rich beidellite is common at temperatures near 200 degrees C. Near the surface area where there are low permeable rocks and low temperatures (< 130 degrees C), saponite, nontronite and di-smectite with intermediate composition between montmorillonite and beidellite coexist. The current crystallization of smectites in reservoirs is related to the local boiling oi hydrothermal fluids. The significance of these smectites is kinetic rather than thermic. Because of their temporary existance, smectites are an indicator oi the recent evolution of the geothermal activity in the field. Clay formation at high temperature favours the beidellitic composition of di-smectite. The thermal fossil gradient inferred from the distribution of I-S acid C-S in the low permeable parts of the field is not representative of a particular thermal event; it represents the integration of the whole thermal activity subsequent to the occurrence of clays. Such a reconstituted thermal gradient minimizes the effects of brief past thermal events. Transposition of information obtained from mixed layers of geothermal systems in a diagenetic series, or inversely is not correct because mixed layers differ not only by their condition of formation and transformation, but they also differ by the composition of the initial smectitic material : essentially montmorillonite in diagenesis, mainly saponite + beidellite in high enthalpy geothermal fields. These results point out the question of the nature of the smectite layers interstratified with illite within I-S R1 mixed layers which occurred at great burial depth (T > 100 degrees C). is it montmorillonite or beidellite? The answer to this question would bring about a consequent contribution to the understanding of the mechanisms oi I-S conversion.

AB  - Selected materials of hull-less oat (Abel variety, new lines KM 187, KM 191 and KM 195) and spring barley (Tolar and Krona varieties) were grown in field conditions of the Kromeriz Agricultural Research Institute, s.r.o., in 1994-1996; their grain was examined by chemical analyses and tested in the company Biofaktory Praha, s.r.o., in metabolic experiments on laboratory sewer-rats. These parameters were investigated: grain yield (t/ha), grain weight (TGW in g), nutrient content in grain - starch, proteins (P), fat, fatty acids (FA), beta-glucans (BG), lysine - all components in g/kg, and lysine in P (g/16 g N). The following indicators of grain feeding value were determined by metabolic experiments or by calculations: gross energy and digestible energy contents (GE and DE in MJ/kg), coefficients of energy apparent digestibility and nitrogen true digestibility (CED and CTD in %), indicators of protein biological value (PBV) and net protein utilization (NPU), nitrogen balance (NB, mg/day), protein efficiency ratio (PER in %) and content of utilizable protein (UP in g/kg). The variability of protein, starch and fat contents and of most parameters of feeding values of oat and barley grain was low; high variability was determined in lysine content and concentrations in barley (coefficient of variation = 32.3% and 42.4%, respectively) and in fiber content in oats (29.3%). In general, variability of metabolic parameters was lower than that of nutrients and commercial parameters. Barleys outyielded oats in average grain yield (by 29.6%), TGW (by 47%) and fiber content (by 35.3%). The two species did not basically differ id lysine concentrations in proteins (4.18% in oats and 4.02% in barley) and in average starch content (598.4 g/kg in oats, 599 g/kg in barley). Oats had higher contents of fat (by 74.1%), proteins (13.5%), lysine in grain dry matter (18.8%), beta-glucans (BG - 15.6%), and higher values of all evaluated indicators of grain feeding value, namely of utilizable protein (UP 21.1%, Tables I and IV). Statistically significant differences were determined between the hull-less oat types in commercial traits (yield and TGW), protein content, lysine concentration, fat and starch contents and most indicators of grain feeding value. Abel variety had lysine content higher by 9-14% than the new lines of hull-less oats, its fiber content was lower by 41.5-48.9%, while BG content was significantly higher. The characteristics of Abel variety resulted in the statistically significantly higher level of CED (94.22%) in comparison with the lines KM 191 and KM 195. and in the significantly higher content of DE (17.13 MJ/kg) in comparison with the new line KM 195 (Tables II and V). The new line of hull-less oat KM 195 had a statistically significantly different content of palmitic acid from that of KM 191 and of oleic acid from that of Abel variety (Table III). An increase in polyunsaturated FA contents, accompanying growing fat contents, was observed in all hull-less oats (y = -3.71 + 0.488x - Fig. 2).
   Comparison of nutrient and energy production per unit area showed that hull-less oats had statistically significantly higher fat yields than barleys (by 229.6 kg/ha, i.e. on average by about 63%) while no significant differences were confirmed either in lysine production or in UP between the two species. But barleys had statistically significantly higher starch yields (by 36%), and higher fiber content in grain. Tolar variety showed higher production of proteins slid digestible energy while Krona had significantly different parameters only from the KM 195 line of hull-less oats even though absolute values of these parameters were high. Calculations of correlation relations indicated that neither grain yield nor TGW had statistically significant negative effects on the other parameters in oats (Table VII). An insignificant relations was determined between protein content and related balance parameters - CTD and CED. Negative relations of different intensity were observed between protein content and other parameters while the relation between the indicators of grain feeding value and proteins was closest in PBV (r = -0.75**) and NPU (r = -0.67**). A positive effect of increased protein content was determined in the derived indicator UP (r = 0.84**). Similarly like in the case of proteins. increased fiber content had negative effects on all other parameters while the relation with CTD was closest (r = -0.76**). A significant regression relation (y = 96.23 - 0.103x, Fig. 1) confirmed negative effects of higher fiber content on the coefficient of energy digestibility also for small differences in hull-less genotypes. Increased content, and mainly concentration of lysine in proteins statistically significantly increased the level of grain protein quality indicators - NPU (r = 0.83**) and PBV (r = 0.81**), similar effects were also determined in fat content in our experiment (identically r = 0.77**).

AB  - Several methodological shortcomings still hinder the inclusion of transport noise as an established impact category within life cycle assessment (LCA). Earlier attempts to quantify the health damages caused by traffic noise yielded valuable results from an academic point of view, but these were of limited use in the context of everyday LCA practice. An enhanced understanding of traffic noise emission models coupled with a straightforward choice of indicators could lead to faster, more accurate assessments of health impairment due to traffic noise whose results would fittingly serve the purposes of policy makers and the information needs of the general public alike. This article aims to propose the guidelines for such assessments.
   The assessment method presented takes an incremental approach in similar fashion as previous work in the field done by R. Muller-Wenk. An explanation is provided of how the assumption of linearity leads to a substantial overestimation of noise level increments attributable to additional vehicles, and subsequently to a misjudgement of overall health impacts due to traffic noise. Hence, an alternative calculation method allowing for better accuracy in the computation of noise level increments is proposed. This method can be easily applied, needless of a specific traffic noise emission model. A more detailed method, based on the state-of-the-art Improved Methods for the Assessment of the Generic Impact of Noise in the Environment (IMAGINE) traffic noise emission model, is also described. This method is to be applied to large-, medium- and small-scale assessments where variations in traffic flow or composition can be reasonably predicted or measured. In the proposed methodology, health impairment due to traffic noise is not aggregated in DALY (disability-adjusted life years). Rather, the results are given in terms of the 'number of annoyed persons', which is derived from the synthesis curves relating noise exposure to annoyance presented by Miedema and Oudshoorn. The calculation procedure and data needs to do this are explained. Moreover, the validity of taking the number of annoyed persons as a proxy for overall health impairment due to traffic noise-and the main benefits of doing so-are discussed. Performing the attribution of impacts on a per vehicle-kilometre basis can lead to impact misrepresentations whenever an incremental approach is taken. A different attribution scheme, which takes background noise into account, is thus proposed.
   The general framework of a method to assess the impact of traffic noise upon human health within LCA is presented. This method, which finds its basis in the work of Muller-Wenk, can be used to evaluate a large number of variations in traffic other than mere increases in overall traffic flows. An application example evaluating the impact of a generic 1,000-km trip of a heavy-duty vehicle through Spain is provided in Section 2.4.
   The incremental approach seems most adequate for the assessment of the impact of traffic noise upon human health within LCA, albeit the assumption of linearity can significantly distort its results. Likewise, performing the attribution of impacts through generic characterisations of additional vehicle-kilometres may mask the true responsibility of traffic for increasing noise levels, and is therefore advised against. The special characteristics of noise as a pollutant (relevance of spatial data, human perception issues) appear to justify the adoption of a distinct indicator, namely 'number of annoyed persons'.
   Reasonably good estimates of equivalent noise level increases due to proportional increases over pre-existing traffic can be given without using a noise emission model. Yet, the use of state-of-the-art vehicle noise emission models (e.g. IMAGINE) should allow for more accurate assessments, provided sufficient data regarding the spatial distribution of receivers and traffic characteristics (traffic flow, average speed per vehicle type and so forth) are known. Incorporating annoyance as the preferred indicator for the impact of traffic noise upon human health would make assessment results more intelligible and readily applicable to decision making in matters like infrastructure policing and urban planning, whilst placing the focus on damage prevention.
   In this paper, only road traffic noise is dealt with. However, annoyance curves with a comparably solid scientific background also exist for railway and aircraft noise, which would make comparisons between alternative transportation modes feasible. The use of 'number of annoyed persons' instead of DALY units is favoured because it allows for a more straightforward presentation of results, even if it excludes the possibility of aggregation with other health impacts. Nevertheless, the use of DALY is not excluded beforehand, insofar as a scientifically sound relationship between long-term exposure to environmental noise and more severe health conditions is agreed upon by medical experts.

AB  - The Eurasian collared dove Streptopelia decaocto is a Palearctic species that demonstrates an example of intensive and rapid dispersal across Eurasia. At the same time, the expansion of the area is combined with its pulsation, and the reasons for this phenomenon are not completely clear. The Eurasian collared dove shows synanthropic tendencies and prefers to occupy residential habitats and agricultural landscapes when settling. Conservation status of the species according to the IUCN category system is LC: of least concern, but requiring further study and systematic monitoring. All of the abovementioned makes the study of the species very relevant. The aim of our research is to study the current state of the number, distribution and ecology of the Eurasian collared dove in Stavropol region.
   The studies were carried out in Stavropol region in 2008-2019 within geographical coordinates 43 degrees 43'-46 degrees 14'N, 40 degrees 51'-45 degrees 43E in semi-desert, steppe and forest-steppe zones and foothills of the southern areas (See Fig. 1). We used methods of walking (over 500 km) and driving (42 000 km) route counts to estimate the population density, numbers of nesting birds, and their landscape distribution. This review also includes our results obtained during bird counts in Stavropol region in 2015-2018, as part of the program of the Atlas of breeding birds of Europe. In the course of this work, we examined 39 50850 km squares. We studied the nesting biology of the species on the basis on discovering of 1167 breeding pairs, surveys of 490 nests and detailed observations of 58 nests. We conducted mapping of residential nests. Describing nesting structures, we noted the biotope, the species and height of the tree, the height of the nest location, the building material, the content of the nest, the presence and proximity of nests of other bird species, and we performed standard egg measurements. We determined if the breeding was successful by observations of nesting pairs in the period from the beginning of egg laying to the departure of chicks from nests. We studied the daily activity of the birds during the incubation period by visual observations for as long as 35+ hours.
   The Eurasian collared dove Streptopelia decaocto appeared in Stavropol region in 1973-1978 of the last century and has digested the entire area of the region as a result of intensive settlement. In general, we noted an increase in the nesting population of the species by almost one and a half times over a decade (47 thousand pairs in 2006 to 65 thousand pairs in 2019). The highest nesting population density of the Eurasian collared dove was recorded for the North and North-East of Stavropol region where animal husbandry predominates (See Fig. 1 and 2; Table 1). From the landscape point of view, the species clearly prefers the steppe province (0.27 pairs/ha), as well as semi-desertdry-steppe (0.25); the density of its breeding population is lower in the forest-steppe (0.1); the lowest indicators are typical of foothill areas (0.05) (See Fig. 1; Table 1 and 2). As we showed in our research in the species' biotopic distribution, the main types of its habitat are rural settlements, forest belts (protective, roadside) and forest plantations (plantings of nonlinear configuration of different areas) in agricultural landscapes. The Eurasian collared dove prefers eastern spruce (Platycladus orientalis) (21.4%) and common spruce (Picea abies) (9.6%) for nesting; in total, 20 species of tree species were used. At the same time, we observed atypical cases of nest placement (7.7% of all examined nests) on various residential buildings, power poles and other technical structures (See Table 3). We found the earliest clutches in the second decade of March, and the latest ones in late October and early November. The value of clutches amounted to an average of 1.57 eggs. The average size of the egg was 30.5 mm824.6 mm (n=25). When observing the daily activity of the incubating females, we found that they spend 97.4% of the time on the incubation process (See Fig. 3 and 4). The Eurasian collared dove can make three or four clutches per season, while some of them may be repeated in case of poor nesting. Post-embryonic mortality in our studies was averaged 13.5%, often due to nest destruction by predators (mainly cats and grey crows), as well as due to adverse weather conditions. The Eurasian collared dove belongs to sedentary species, but at the same time, we observed mass autumn-winter roamings of the birds with the size of flocks of up to 500 individuals. We found that the limiting factors for the species are loss of clutches and chicks from predators and bad weather, as well as death of adult birds on the roads and as a result of abnormally low temperatures during winter. The results of our study confirmed the steady territorial expansion and growth of the Eurasian collared dove population in Stavropol region, mainly, due to the processes of synanthropization and urbanization and assimilation into agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The Neoproterozoic Cryogenian ('Marinoan') Ghaub Formation of northwestern Namibia represents an important founding pillar of the Snowball Earth hypothesis and its derivative, the Panglacial Earth hypothesis. These hypotheses assume oceans and continents covered by thick ice, even in the tropics, which caused a very distinct drop in eustatic sea-level. Over time, strongly increased CO2 contents of the atmosphere led to sudden ice melting, very substantial sea-level rise, and strong weathering on the continents associated with the deposition of cap carbonates in the newly ice-free oceans. The ongoing controversy about Snowball-type glaciations in Namibia and elsewhere is reviewed, and other hypotheses (Slushball Earth, Waterbelt Earth, Jormungand state of the Earth, Thin Ice state of the Earth, Zipper-Rift Earth, High-Obliquity Earth) are discussed. We prefer the term 'Waterbelt Earth' instead of the originally proposed `Waterbelt state' because of the clearer contrast with 'Snowball Earth'.
   Because a great deal of information related to Cryogenian glaciations comes from the Ghaub Formation of northwestern Namibia, these hypotheses should be tested independently based on a time-equivalent depositional system. This analogue was found in the carbonate-dominated successions of the Otavi Mountainland (OML), northeastern Namibia, and is highly comparable with the successions in the well-investigated northwest of the country. An extreme eustatic sea-level drop caused by a global glaciation of oceans and continents and imposed on a carbonate platform or ramp such as the one in the OML would have led either to glacial cover or widespread subaerial exposure and extensive erosion, including deeply incised valleys. The presence of such features would strongly support the Snowball Earth hypotheses if tectonic effects did not play a major role. During the post glacial transgression, distinct reworking of the carbonate platform/ramp surface would have occurred, leaving behind lag deposits, as well as infills of incised valleys with fluvial, reworked glacial, and marine deposits. The main objective of our research was to weigh and investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed Snowball Earth model of glacially induced large-amplitude sea-level changes during Ghaub time, and to compare different models to obtain a rough estimate of the amount of glaciation.
   The study area in the OML includes two different, age-equivalent facies realms: platform sedimentation in the Southern area without diamictites, and slope deposits, including Ghaub diamictites, in the Northern area. The southern, continuously shallow-marine area shows a shallowing-upward succession from the pre-glacial lower Auros Formation, often varve-like laminated shales formed below wave base, to metre-high columnar stromatolites and microbial mat-related carbonates with intervals of vertical tubes (degassing features) of the upper Auros Formation, overlain by cap carbonates of the Maieberg Formation. The columnar stromatolites and the microbial tubestone lithotypes were clearly deposited in the euphotic zone. Indications for tidal conditions or subaerial exposure were not recorded in this platform succession without unconformities. Neither dropstones, nor incised channels, nor transgressive lag deposits were observed. The facies changes from below storm wave base to the photic zone and finally a shallow subtidal zone is explained by a prolonged, modest sea-level fall, partly counterbalanced by subsidence, followed by a slow transgression.
   In contrast, coarse-grained sedimentary rocks (e.g., oolites, debrites) characterise the time-equivalent successions in the Northern area. Starting with laminated shales at the base, similar to the Southern area, the overlying redeposited oolites and breccias of the Auros Formation show distinct lateral and vertical in homogeneities and thickness changes, which indicate long-lasting synsedimentary tectonism. The same phenomenon is observed in the overlying diamictites of the Ghaub Formation. Their variable clast content indicates erosion of a strongly uplifted local source area formerly covered by a thick carbonate succession, which was downstripped to the crystalline basement. The prograding diamictite succession with repeatedly intercalated silt stringers is interpreted as periglacial debris flows into a marine environment. Sparse striated clasts in the diamictites and very rare dropstones (much less common than in northwestern Namibia) are indicators of glaciations somewhere in the area. However, compared with other glacial sequences, e.g. Quaternary periglacial sediments at the forefront of continental ice, dropstones and striated clasts would be expected to be much more common and more uniformly distributed if the entire area was covered by melting continental ice, as proposed in the Snowball/Panglacial Earth scenario. In the Southern area, dropstones would be expected to occur on the flooded platforms/ramps as well, even when diamictites are absent.
   Both the relatively moderate sea-level change and the less common, irregular distribution of locally concentrated glacial rainouts provide strong evidence against the presence of a thick, laterally continuous ice cover over oceans and continents extending to equatorial areas. The oceans possibly corresponded to the scenario of a Waterbelt Earth or High-Obliquity Earth; evidence of open oceanic water exists, which would have enabled the continued evolution of biota. Glacial ice was present on tropical continents, but its occurrences may have been regional in patches, sourced from mountainous areas, and ice streams would have reached the oceans only locally, unrelated to a thick continental ice cover.

AB  - The article addresses the integration of "innovation" and "active aging" strategies. The goal is to develop a framework that identifies the skills pertaining to mature workers in a context of innovation. It should also provide direction for public policies and corporate practices to take advantage of the innovation potential of this workforce. The "active aging" strategy could have a positive effect on the innovation capacity of industrialized countries. This strategy refers to a process aiming to optimize the conditions to improve the quality of life during old age. Borrowing from the Schumpeterian approach and based on the third edition of the Oslo Manual, the concept of innovation is broadened from the standard definition. Three stages of technological change are identified: invention, innovation, and diffusion. As a result, the innovation process involves more than science and technology activities. It includes peripheral activities, such as commercialization and innovation management. Very little is known about the impact of the aging workforce on innovation. If there is a relationship between age and innovation, it should appear at the macroeconomic level. Countries with a higher dependency ratio should demonstrate a lower technology intensity level. Correlating these indicators (that is, dependency ratio and technological intensity (R&D/GDP)) for some OECD countries, it is found that no relationship holds. Going further and examining countries for which cohorts of 45 years and older are more educated, there is no more significant inclination to innovation either. More emphasis on innovation skills is therefore essential to understand this relationship. Moreover, despite the popular belief that skills of the mature workforce tend to decline over time, research from many disciplines acknowledges that it is not the case. The cognitive atrophy would be more likely related to the exclusion of workers from the labour market than due to the obsolescence of their skills. Two categories of skills-fluid and crystallized-seem to decline at a different pace over time. While the first category is most likely to face an age-related decline, the second is resistant to the aging process. In this paper, we are wondering if the mature workforce owns specific and exclusive innovation skills. We assume that metacognitive abilities (that is, the combination of 'expert thinking' and 'complex communication') are relevant in the case of older workers and that they could play a strategic role in the innovation process. However, innovation skills are not fully understood and much work remains to be done to identify these skills. Too often, innovation skills are confused with foundational skills. The poor state of knowledge of innovation skills makes it difficult to assess the contribution of the aging population. On the basis of the Schumpeterian approach and the novelty concept from the Oslo Manual, we disaggregated innovation activities into three categories and provided a framework enabling the identification of skills related to these activities. It allows us to address the potential contribution of aging workers in very specific contexts. The first scenario refers to the generation of scientific and technological ideas leading to invention. Depending on either the incremental or radical nature of change that induces an invention, older scientists and engineers can play a substantial role in these activities. It refers to the "new-to-the-world" level of novelty concept.
   For example, one can mention applied mathematical reasoning skills to solve a vaiety of problems in the innovation process. The adoption and adaptation of technologies developed outside a firm are core activities of the second scenario, drawing on the "new-to-the-firm" concept of novelty. The adoption of Information and Communication Technologies in a firm is a good example of innovation activities involved in this scenario. Generally, an aging population is accused of being weakly endowed with these skills. Finally, the third scenario looks at management activities, such as human resources management, intellectual property marketing, and so on. An older population may have an advantage over younger people in these activities given the length of their experience. In any event, it appears that government and firms have a crucial role to play to encourage older workers to remain longer in the labour market. Some public policies and corporate initiatives that enable the retention of these workers in the labour market are outlined for each scenario. For example, many OECD countries reformed their pension system, one of the most popular incentives to keep the aging workforce active in the labour market. Lifelong learning strategy is another initiative developed by numerous countries that allows workers to maintain and develop skills during their careers. incentives for employers and employees are also worth considering for encouraging workers to attend training sessions, especially older workers for whom frequent discrimination due to age exists but must be prevented. Another initiative concerns the transfer of skills from one generation to another using mentoring or professional coaching, which consists of providing guidance in solving complex problems and acquiring knowledge and skills. OECD countries do not necessarily apply the same policies and programs. However, only a concerted strategy between workers, employers, and government in a specific country can suppress the barriers and increase incentives to encourage older workers to continue working and contribute to innovation.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to describe the way in which the Alcohol Dependence Syndrome is manifested, according to the criteria and indicators proposed by the DSM-IV, in a female sample that sought help at a treatment center due to alcohol consumption-related problems. A comparison was made with the results obtained in a previous 211-male-sample at the same treatment center.
   Method: This project is a case study in which a sample of 100 females was interviewed at the Clinica para Atencion de Problemas Relacionados con el Alcohol (CAPRA) (Clinic for the Attention of Alcohol Related Problems) at the Hospital General de Mexico (the main general hospital for patients who do not have social security benefits and come from different regions of the country including rural areas).
   The criteria for inclusion were: being aged 18 or over, female, having sought help for the first time (at these centers) due to alcohol problems and being physically and mentally able to answer the questionnaire correctly. Females that had previously been treated were included. However, one of the requisites was that they had to have drunk alcohol during the year before the interview to warrant recent and current consumption, regardless of being exposed to prior treatments, since the questionnaire includes the previous 12 months as a parameter.
   The instrument used to conduct this study was the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM). This instrument has been widely used with excellent results on various population samples in the U.S., as well as on the male population receiving treatment in Mexico. The instrument included the following sections: sociodemographic characteristics, amount and frequency of consumption; physical, psychological and social problems; symptoms of alcohol dependence, and pathways to health services. A few new sections were incorporated with specific characteristics for women, such as the effects of alcohol on women, alcohol consumption during pregnancy and nursing, partner's alcohol consumption and violent behavior in the couple and their associated risks.
   Results: The average age of the women interviewed was 47 years old, ranging from 22 to 91. Thirty-two percent were either married or living with a partner, 20% were divorced, 26% were widows and 22% were single. Seventy-four percent of them had children and they had 4.5 children in average. The average educational level was 4.7 years.
   Fifty-two percent of the respondents reported drinking alcohol every day and 19% almost every day (five or six days a week) with an average of 4.2 drinks per occasion (52% of the women reported having three to four drinks per occasion). The preferred reported beverage was << pulque >> (28%), followed by beer (25%) and distilled beverages (21%). Other traditional drinks and << 96 degrees proof" alcohol also showed a significant percentage (20%).
   As for the Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, 50% of the women met the dependency criteria proposed by the DSM-IV, compared with 82% of the 211 men interviewed in the same center with a statistically significant difference (X-2= 34.22; p = 0.000). Women with alcohol dependence syndrome presented an average of five symptoms.
   A more detailed analysis was carried out based on the severity, of the dependence syndrome, measured by the number of reported symptoms (1-2, 3-4, 5-7). The most frequently reported symptom across all levels of severity was the presence of physical and or psychological problems. In the group of non-dependent women (those who reported less than 3 symptoms), an important difference between men and women was observed. The most frequent symptoms reported by men, after the presence of physical and psychological problems, were withdrawal symptoms (34.2%) and loss of control (15.8%). In the case of the women, unsuccessful efforts to reduce alcohol intake (16%) and withdrawal symptoms' (16%) appeared in the second place.
   The group of women with low dependence (three to four criteria reported) presented similar characteristics to those observed in the group of non-dependent women. In men with low levels of dependence, the most frequent symptom presented were: giving up or reducing activities (social, occupational or) recreational in order to drink and withdrawal symptoms. In the groups with the highest severity level (5-7 symptoms), difference I S between men and women were less evident.
   Conclusions: The most important differences in dependence symptoms between men and women are probably related to gender-specific cultural expectations and social norms regarding alcohol use. This situation is reflected in the type of symptoms presented more frequently in women and men. Women reported more symptoms related to unsuccessful efforts to reduce alcohol intake; whereas men presented symptoms related to the time spent drinking or recovering from the effects of alcohol and giving up or reducing activities (social, occupational 4 recreational) in order to drink.
   The information presented evidences the need to conduct more, specific studies that take in consideration biological and psychological, as well as social conditions underlying female alcohol use in order to provide appropriate and effective treatment to meet their gender needs and expectations.

AB  - Shortly after the crucial political changes connected with the events in November 1989 in Czechoslovakia, some differences in political attitudes and behavior of the Czech and Slovak population appeared. An increasing tension in the Czech - Slovak relations finally led to a peaceful dissociation of the federal Czechoslovakia and to the formation of two sovereign states at the beginning of 1993. It is no wonder that this important change caused a serious discussion of social scientists of the both societies about the societal reasons and consequences of this unexpected and sudden historical and political phenomenon. The author of the present study in agreement with Jiri Musil prefers the comparison of different developments of cultural and social structures in the Czech lands and Slovakia to somewhat superficial historical and politological analyses of the split as a unique event.
   He disposes at some serious and historically relevant sociological evidence concerning the development of Czech-Slovak relationships, namely with the results of some representative Czech and Slovak sociological surveys, particularly from the years 1967, 1984, 1998, April 1993 and October 1993. Except the 1984 survey, he personally participated in all of them.
   In the second half of the 1960s, the Czech lands and Slovakia substantially differed in cultural and social respect. Above all one could observe big differences concerning the degree od urbanization in favour of the Czech lands. Slovakia remained then a country with settlement structure of rural type and with much more traditional way of life.
   A similar lag was characteristic for the structure of economically active population in respect to industrial branches. In the 1960s, the Czech lands belonged, according to their pre-war traditions and in the consequence of the enforced repeated industrialization (for military needs of the Soviet block in the period of the Cold War), to extensively industrialized societies, whereas Slovakia was rather a rural-industrial society where a recently started extensive industrialization went on.
   Towards the end of the 1960s the educational level of the Slovak population was already relatively close to that of the Czech one, although some distinctions still remained.
   At the same time, many important differences lasted in the material level of household equipment which was relatively better in the Czech lands. On the other hand, in consequence of the redistributive economic system, the average earnings were already nearly equal.
   In autumn 1967, on the very eve of the political crisis which signalized the outburst of events known as Prague Spring 1968, a large sociological survey of a representative sample of adult males dealing with social stratification and mobility was carried out by the Czech and Slovak sociologists in cooperation with the State Statistical Office. Its results were published two years later, unfortunately already after the Warsaw Pact Intervention which led to the defeat of the reform attempt connected with the Prague Spring. A special chapter in this book was written by a group of Slovak sociologists headed by R. Rosko. The authors proved that the social status distribution in Slovakia was in the late 1960s significantly lower in the average than the analogical distribution in the Czech lands. It was caused by small differences in the participation of individuals in management, in the level of work complexity typical for the occupational structures in question, and in the distribution of earnings; by more remarkable differences in level of education and material equipment of households; and by large differences concerning average income per capita, standards of consumption and cultural level of the life-style. In general, these findings demonstrated a still lasting deep cultural and social inequality of the Czech and Slovak part of the country. This social unbalance was multiplied by the consequences of the anti-Slovak political repressions in the late 1940s and in the 1950s and of the ''constitutional reform'' from 1960 which brought suppression of the Slovak autonomy in favour of the centralized bureaucratic Prague administration. All these circumstances stimulated a high dissatisfaction of the relatively younger population of Slovakia living in conditions of a rapid demographic development, progress of urbanization and industrialization. It was important for the specific character of the social and political reform movement in 1968 on the Slovak territory which finally caused one of the few real successes of the Prague Spring - the constitutional act declaring federalization of the Czechoslovak Republic.
   In the practical politics of the ''normalization'' regime installed by the Soviet intervention in August 1968, the originally intended federative arrangement was ''via facti'' replaced by a new version of the totalitarian and bureaucratic centralism. However, this time the political regime was in a sense more favourable for Slovakia. The Slovak Communist leaders gained for more better and in some respect even decisive positions in the Prague central administration of the country than any time before. Some changes in this respect occurred only in the late 1980s. In consequence of all this, the process of the secondary redistribution of the GDP in favor of Slovakia not only continued but even intensified in the 1970s and 1980s. Simultaneously, political oppressions concerning hundreds of thousands of participants in the Prague Spring events were in this period sensibly weaker in Slovakia than in the Czech lands. Thus, paradoxically, the ''normalization regime'' brought some advantages for Slovakia as compared with the past.
   Some evidence for this can be find in the data collected by Czech sociologists in the sociological survey on ''class and social structure'' in 1984, i.e. shortly before the beginning of the Soviet ''perestroika''. A recent secondary analysis of this data shows therefore a cultural and social situation typical for the normalization system on the top point of its development. It is not very surprising that thanks to the permanent operation of the redistributive mechanisms during fifteen years after the final defeat of the Prague Spring the cultural and social characteristics of the Czech and Slovak adult populations were mutually much closer in 1984 than in 1967. There remained practically no differences in work complexity and in average earnings. The quality of housing was approximately the same. The households were telephonized in very close percentages. People were equally active in professional studying and in political activities (in official politics, of course). In some respects small differences in favour of the Czech population still existed. This is true as far as the global educational level, the percentage of managers and some items of the households equipment are concerned. In their leisure, Czech population was more frequently engaged in typically urban cultural activities. The Slovak population lived in a substantially higher percentage in their own private houses, in more rooms per family and in better environment than the Czech did. They had in more cases gardens or other land at their disposal and devoted themselves more frequently to domestic agricultural work. They also were more active in social contacts, in visiting relatives, neighbours and friends.
   Still slightly better economic position of the households in the Czech lands - caused partly by lower average number of the more aged Czech families - expressed itself in somewhat higher evaluation of the standard of living from the part of the Czech population.
   In other words, in the midst of the 1980s, the cultural and social characteristics of the Slovak population were already close to the Czech standards but some lag in this respect still existed. Anyway, the Czech lands represented the stagnating part of the federation, while Slovakia was the progressing one.
   The beginning of the Soviet perestroika signalized the Czech population that a new historical crisis of the Soviet-type societies was coming. Feelings of dissatisfaction with the stagnation of the Czech lands combined with political frustration of the citizens of an occupied country gradually grew up, particularly when some difficulties concerning standard of living emerged in the second half of the 1980s. A certain dissappointment caused by the unwillingness of the Gorbatchev's leadership to revise the Soviet official attitude to the events of 1968 also played an important role. The Slovak population living still under the protection of current redistributive processes and under a little better political conditions did not feel these changes as intensively as the Czech did. It is no wonder that these specificities influenced the subjective evaluations of the economic, social, political and cultural situation in the country. In the public opinion polls from the second half of the 1980s, the degree of satisfaction of the Slovak population concerning nearly all questions asked then was significantly higher than that of the Czech citizens. Gradually, as the crisis of 1989 was coming nearer, the evaluations were less and less favourable for the regime in both republics. However, the Czech criticism grew more rapidly than the criticism of the population in Slovakia.
   The ''Velvet Revolution'' of 1989 was initiated mainly by the Czech dissidents and the politically active part of the Czech people. It found an active response also in analogical groups in Slovakia. However, in the course of the year 1990, when the outline of the radical economic reform was prepared by the Federal Government and the first practical steps of it were undertaken, a new shift in the structure of value orientations occurred. Of crucial significance was above all the declaration of President Havel demanding the liquidation of the arms producing industry, strongly developed particularly in Slovakia, and the first measures to its realization.
   The author of the study disposes at representative data from the survey on social transformation (autumn 1991) confronting the objective status positions of the adult population with their subjective attitudes. As far as the objective characteristics are concerned, the results of the survey on social transformation were summoned by the author in 1992 as follows:
   ''We discussed systematically all the relevant partial dimensions of the social position (status)...In all of these dimensions we could record only two significant signals of larger social differences. The first of them is a better standard of housing and a bigger amount of family fortunes in Slovakia (relativized, of course, by higher numerousness of families...). The second is a more often declaration of the subjective feelings of a worse market and especially financial attainability of consumption goods and services in Slovakia as well. In behind of this statement is hidden a more significant factor of a lower income per capita, connected with the already mentioned higher number of family members, and a different perception of the reality, influenced by the difference of social dynamics in the both republics. In no case, however, it is possible to speak about two fundamentally different status hierarchies with an essentially distinct context corresponding to two different phases of the civilization and cultural development.''
   In other words, the cultural and social processes typical of the 1970s and 1980s, namely the stagnation and the beginning of an absolute decline in the Czech Republic and the continuing (although also limited by the character of the totalitarian and anti-meritocratic social system common for both of the two parts of the Federation) relative progress in Slovakia led to a nearly full equalization of the social unbalance which had been observed in 1967.
   On the other hand, the data from 1991 revealed a deep discrepancy between the balanced objective data and large differences of the subjective perception of the social situation. In principle, the evaluation both of the past and of the future transformation processes was much more favourable in the Czech than in the Slovak Republic.
   The most apparent differences in evaluation between the two republics could be found in the fields of standard of living and of social security.
   It was quite clear that such deep differences in attitudes could not be explained by those objective facts that revealed the attained social equalization of the Czech lands and Slovakia but rather in the specificities of the recent development of the two societies after the ''Velvet Revolution''. Anyway, the contradictory shape of the popular attitudes became one of the stimuli that helped the victory of more liberal and pro-federalist rifht-wing political parties in the Czech Republic and rather anti-federalist political parties and movements in Slovakia in the elections of 1992. The election victors decided after relatively short negotiations, without asking people in a referendum, to dissociate the common state of Czechs and Slovaks. It happened at the beginning of 1993 in peaceful way and is acknowledged at present as a matter of fact by majorities of populations in both new states.
   It is highly interesting by now to find out what have been the further destinies of people in both countries as far as the objective positions and the subjective attitudes are concerned. A substantial contribution to this kind of knowledge could bring large representative sociological surveys of about 5000 adult respondents in the Czech and Slovak Republic that took place in April 1993 as a part of broader comparative survey on social stratification and mobility in Eastern Europe. The second important contribution could be drawn from paralel surveys of somewhat smaller representative samples devoted to the study of beliefs and behaviour of Czech and Slovak people carried out in autumn 1993.
   As far as the objective aspect of the problem is concerned, one can state that the economically active population of the Czech and Slovak Republics do not differ in none of the basic social status dimensions characterizing the individuals. Even the indicators of the so called status consistency/inconsistency, namely the rank correlations of education, work complexity and earnings are equal in both republics. Small differences have been revealed only in two newly studied status characteristics. The so-called social capital (the degree of development of purposeful informal social contacts) seems to be somewhat more developed in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic. On the other hand, the Czech lands are a little bit more progressing in the development of the private enterpreneurship. However, the differences are not so deep as to make the social stratification shape of the two societies fundamentally dissimilar. Thus the data concerning the social positions of economically active individuals prove clearly that Slovakia reached approximately the same level od social and cultural development as the Czech Republic.
   There exist, of course, some not negligible differences concerning social and cultural characteristics of the families, including their economically non-active members.
   In Slovakia, significantly more respondents declared that they were living in family houses. The technical equipment of the housing is somewhat better in the Czech lands, the size of the family flats or houses and the number of rooms is larger in Slovakia. The material equipment of the households differs somewhat in some items in favour of the Czech families, in some others in favour of the Slovak. The average amount of their family fortunes expressed in financial values seems to be a little higher in Slovakia. The Czech families are not so numerous as the relatively younger Slovak families and therefore their average income per capita is higher. Among the population that has been questioned in the stratification survey there was substantially less retired persons in the Slovak Republic. The percentage of unemployed among the respondents has been, on the contrary, some times higher in Slovakia. However, the final percentage of economically active was higher in Slovakia.
   All these characteristics are connected with well known differences of the two countries in the settlement structure and in the structure of industries and branches in national economy. In the Slovak Republic, significantly more people are working in agriculture, metallurgy, heavy industry and energetics, yet also in education, culture ans science; in the Czech Republic the same goes for other industry, other services, finance and banking. Also the already mentioned differences in the demographic structures play their role as well as the differences in the ethnical structures (large Hungarian and Gipsy minority in Slovakia) and in confessional structures (substantially more believers, particularly Roman Catholics but also Evangelics in Slovakia).
   If we take into account all the mentioned social and cultural differences, some of them favourable for the Czech, some for the Slovak Republic, we cannot notice, of course, that they are in a part derived from the more rural and traditional past of Slovakia as we analyzed it in on the basis of 1967 data. However, in the whole the weight of this kind of differences is not as high that it could change our basic statement about achieved fundamental cultural and social equality of the societies in question, which both now belong to the industrial type and started together a very similar trajectory of the post-communist transformation.
   However, there is one important field where the recently emerged differences seem to be grave. It is the standard of living of the households.
   In every case, we can present interesting data comparing the evaluation of family standards of living in the Czech lands and Slovakia in 1988 and in 1993. In spite of the fact that they are somewhat subjectively coloured, especially as far as the retrospective evaluation is concerned, they clearly show that the obvious decline of the standard of living in both republics must have been much steeper in Slovakia. At the same time, we have here the first evidence proving the big shift of satisfaction/dissatisfaction attitudes in favour of the Czech lands.
   This opens the discussion of the important topic of subjective perception of the post-communist transformation. The evaluation, based on new experience, is in both republics somewhat more sceptical than in 1991. At the same time, a remarkable change in the relation of positive evaluations occurred in favour of the Czech Republic. In this case also the experience of nine months of Slovak sovereignty evidently plays a certain role. In most of similar questions one can identify a constant phenomenon: 20-25% less of positive and more of negative evaluations in Slovakia than in the Czech lands.
   The discrepancy between the relative equality of general cultural and social structures in the analyzed countries, on the one hand, and big differences in the subjective evaluations, on the other, for the first time revealed in the data from 1991, emerged from the data of 1993 with an even greater intensity. There are, in principle, three ways how to interpret this phenomenon.
   The first would be to query the first of the premises of our considerations by arguing that the residues of the traditional rural cultural and social relations in Slovakia are still alive, particularly in times of new crucial changes, and hamper the operating of relatively young and therefore unstable cultural and social relationships. However, the facts witnessing for basic equality of the present cultural and social structures are substantial and concern nearly all aspects of the daily life in both societies, so that it is not so easy to doubt them.
   There is a case for another explanation as well, namely for the assumption that in the stormy atmosphere of radical social changes some deep cultural and socio-psychological specificities of the nations concerned emerge, which are responsible for the different reactions to relatively equal situations. Neither these phenomena and mechanisms, taken alone, can explain the abruptness and intensity of the change in attitudes in the Czech lands and in Slovakia. In addition, the cultural and psychological phenomena are in principle very vague and their empirical fixation is unusually difficult. One could not notice that therefore this kind of argumentation has been recently many times abused by nationalist politicians both in Slovakia and in the Czech lands on the basis of arbitrary assumptions and statements.
   That is why we offer a third hypothesis, interpreting the stated discrepancy from the angle of the specificities of social and historical dynamics. It tries to explain the differences in attitudes as rationally arguable reactions of two neighbouring nations to historically different combinations of long-term and short-term dynamics.
   It is undisputable, that from the fall of the 1930s, Slovakia, a former agrarian and economically underdeveloped region, moved - with short breaks only - steadily in the direction to an industrial and relatively modern society with growing political authority. Although the Slovaks did not like communism (as the results of the elections in 1946 clearly showed) and had to be forced to adapt themselves to the state-socialist system (as the events in 1947 and 1948 prove), paradoxically the peak of the modernization of their society, bringing hitherto the best living conditions for the population, has been achieved during the period of ''normalization'', i.e. on the top of the development of the totalitarian and anti-meritocratic (egalitarian) social system in Czechoslovakia. It is quite clear from this that typical ideologies of the state socialist era: egalitarianism, state paternalism and authoritarianism have far deeper roots in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic.
   The social experience of a long-term trajectory of a gradual rise and emancipation of the Slovak nation clashed at once after 1989 with a contradictory experience of a rapid decline and deteriorization of the economic and social conditions, much more intensive than in the Czech lands. It is no wonder that the Slovak population reacted to the new situation in a greater extent than the Czech with feelings of frustration, resignation or even refusal.
   The social experience of the Czech nation since the end of the 1930s has been substatially different. In the rude trajectory of development until the end of the 1980s, degradation and stagnation of a formerly well developed Central European land prevailed in general. A short contradictory wave of a renewed progress in the 1960s finished by a grave frustration from the defeat of the Prague spring. The Soviet occupation meant a real lost of national sovereignty for the Czech nation that never accepted it. After the lost of illusions about the possibilities of the Soviet ''perestroika'' and after a certain deteriorization of the standard of living in the second half of the 1980s, the Czech nation was mentally prepared for a ''return to Europe''. The subsequent decline in the first phase of the post-communist transformation was the slightest one among the Central and East European countries and the signs of some improvement showed very early. It is no wonder, again, that most people are relatively more satisfied with the development until now and more optimistic about the future than the Slovak population is. It does not mean, of course that there does not exist a danger of a later desillusion of a part of society and of some rise of feelings of frustration and resignation in the future.
   It is easy to see that this kind of interpretation of our data is rational and corresponds the historical facts found out or corroborated in our surveys. It can explain without distortion of the evident historical reality most of the seeming paradoxes of the Czech and Slovak reality and mutual relationships. In a way it gives also some keys to the explanation of the split of Czechoslovakia and of its unexpected abruptness and peaceful forms.

AB  - Ten years of public health interventions on industrial emissions to clean air were monitored for the Mediterranean city of Cartagena. During the 1960s, a number of large chemical and non-ferrous metallurgical factories were established that significantly deteriorated the city's air quality. By the 1970s, the average annual air concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) ranged from 200 to 300 A mu g/m(3) (standard conditions units). In 1979, the Spanish government implemented an industrial intervention plan to improve the performance of factories and industrial air pollution surveillance. Unplanned urban development led to residential housing being located adjacent to three major factories. Factory A produced lead, factory B processed zinc from ore concentrates, and factory C produced sulfuric acid and phosphates. This, in combination with the particular abrupt topography and frequent atmospheric thermal inversions, resulted in the worsening of air quality and heightening concern for public health. In 1990, the City Council authorized the immediate intervention at these factories to reduce or shut down production if ambient levels of SO2 or total suspended particles (TSP) exceeded a time-emission threshold in pre-established meteorological contexts. The aim of this research was to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of the intervention plan implemented from 1992 to 2001 to abate industrial air pollution.
   The maximum daily 1-h ambient air level of SO2, NO2, and TSP pollutants was selected from one of the three urban automatic stations, designed to monitor ambient air quality around industrial emissions sources. The day on which an intervention took place to reduce and/or interrupt industrial production by factory and pollutant was defined as a control day, and the day after an intervention as a post-control day. To assess the short-term intervention effect on air quality, an ecological time series design was applied, using regression analysis in generalized additive models, focusing on day-to-day variations of ambient air pollutants levels. Two indicators were estimated: (a) appropriateness, the ratio between mean levels of the pollutant for control days versus the other days, and (b) effectiveness, the ratio between mean levels of the pollutant for post-control days versus the other days. Ratios in regression analyses were adjusted for trend, seasonality, temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure, calendar day, and special events as well as the other pollutants.
   A total of 702 control days were made on the factories' industrial production during the 10-year period. Fifteen reductions and five shutdown control days took place at factory A for ambient air SO2. At factory B, more controls were carried out for the SO2 pollutant in the years 1992-1993 and 1997. At factory C, the control days for SO2 decreased from 59 reductions and 14 shutdowns to a minimum from 1995 onwards, whereas the controls on TSP were more frequent, reaching a maximum of 99 reductions and 47 shutdowns in the last year. SO2 ambient air mean levels ranged from 456 to 699 A mu g/m(3) among factories on reduction control days and between 624 and 1,010 A mu g/m(3) on shutdown days. The TSP ambient air mean levels were 428 and 506 A mu g/m(3) on reduction and shutdown days, respectively. For all types of control days and factories, a mean ratio of 104% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88 to 121) in SO2 levels was obtained and a mean ratio of 67% (95% CI 59 to 75) in TSP levels. Post-control days at all factories showed a mean ratio of -16% (95% CI -7 to -24) in SO2 levels and a mean ratio of -13% (95% CI -7 to -19) in TSP levels.
   Interventions on industrial production based on the urban SO2 and TSP ambient air levels were justified by the high concentrations detected. The best assessment of the interventions' effectiveness would have been to utilize the ambient air pollutant concentration readings from the entire time of the production shutdowns or reductions; however, the daily hourly maximum turned out to be a useful indicator because of meteorological factors influencing the diurnal concentration profile. A substantial number of interventions were carried out from 1 to 3 am, when vehicular traffic was minimum. On the other hand, atmospheric stability undergoes diurnal cycling in the autumn-winter period due to thermal inversion, which reaches maximum levels around daybreak. Therefore, this increases the ambient air levels and justified the interventions carried out at daybreak in spite of the traffic influence.
   All the interventions for SO2 and TSP were carried out when the measured ambient air levels of pollutants were exceeded, which shows the appropriateness of the intervention program. This excess was greater when intervening on SO2 than on the TSP levels. For both ambient air levels of SO2 and TSP, significant drops in air pollution were achieved from all three factories following activity reductions. The production shutdown controls were very effective, because they returned excess levels, higher than in the reduction controls, to everyday mean values.
   The Cartagena City observational system of intermittent control has proven to effectively reduce industrial emissions' impact on ambient air quality. This experienced model approach could serve well in highly polluted industrial settings. From a public health perspective, studies are needed to assess that the industrial interventions to control air pollution were related to healthier human populations. Legislation was needed to allow the public administration to take direct actions upon the polluting industries.

AB  - The Joint United Nations Program on HIV-1/AIDS (UNAIDS) announced its goal to stop HIV1 transmission by antiviral ( HAART) treatment of patients since at the end of 2003 the number of people living with HIV-1 was 38 million, 25 million in the sub-Saharan region of Africa. The present review deals with a new approach to simultaneously treat HIV-1/AIDS patients in HIV-1 endemic regions with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and people at high risk of infection with a vaccine containing CpG ODNs combined with synthetic HIV-1 peptides by intranasal and intradermal applications.
   During HIV-1 infection a gradual increase in the levels of IL-4 and IgE in the patients' serum, was reported. It was suggested that such an increase of the cytokine IL-4 and the IgE immunoglobulin are interconnected and may serve as indicators for the coming stage of AIDS. It was also suggested that the IL-4 and IgE increase in the serum of HIV-1 infected people resemble the increase of IL-4 and IgE levels in allergic patients that were exposed to endogenous or environmental allergens [ Becker, Virus Genes 28, 5 - 18, 2004]. Indeed, it was reported that the HIV-1 virions' shed gp120 molecules, which contain a superantigen ( superallergen) domain that enables the viral glycoprotein to bind the V(H)3 domain of IgE molecules that are bound to FcepsilonRI(+) hematopoietic cells [ basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs)]. Such interaction was reported to induce the hematopoietic cells to release large amounts of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL- 5, IL- 10 and IL-13. These findings led to the hypothesis [Op. cit.] that the cure of HIV-1/AIDS patients requires the induction of endogenous synthesis of type I interferons (INF alpha and beta) with a bacterial CpG rich DNA that will induce the patients' pDCs to release large amounts of type I IFNs. Under these conditions HIV-1 replication in polarized to Th2 cells is inhibited. Type I IFNs reactivate the patients' inhibited Th1 cells to synthesize IL- 2 and IL- 12 cytokines that activate the maturation of CTL precursors. The unmethylated bacterial DNA activates B synthesis to switch to IgG and IgA synthesis.
   The novel drug CpG ODNs is being tested for the prevention and the treatment of allergic humans and in the experimental system of allergic mice. It was also reported that treatment of mice with CpG ODN prior to or after retrovirus infections protected and cured, respectively, the retrovirus infection. It was also reported that CpG ODNs treatments of mice exposed to allergen protected them against the development of the allergic response. Phase I treatment of healthy people with CpG ODNs provided information on the safety of these compounds. The CpG ODNs A and B bind to Toll like receptors that are present in pDCs and B cells, respectively, CpG ODN - A is the ligand for TLR9(+) pDCs and induce the release of large amounts of IFN-alpha, beta. CpG ODN-B is the ligand for TLR9(+) in B cells and induce the synthesis of IgG and IgA. CpG ODN-C contains motifs from CpG ODNs A and B and is more active.
   The present review is based on findings from studies that reported that CpG ODNs treatment of retrovirus infected mice, monkeys and allergic mice prevented the virus and allergens caused diseases, respectively. Based on these studies, a hypothesis is presented that treatment of HIV-1 infected and AIDS patients with CpG ODN-A and B or CpG ODN-C have the potential to inhibit IL- 4 synthesis and release from FcepsilonRI(+) hematopoietic cells by inducing TLR9(+) pDCs to release large amounts of type I IFNs. TLR9+ B cells are induced by CpG ODN-B to switch from IgE to IgG, IgA synthesis. In addition, type I IFNs (alpha, beta) have the capacity to inhibit HIV-1 replication in polarized Th2 cells. Type I IFNs reactivate the patients' Th1 cells to synthesize IL-2 and IL-12 cytokines, activators of the precursor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), leading to the reactivation of the inhibited adaptive immune response. Antiviral CTLs have the ability to clear the virus infection.
   The present novel approach to the treatment and of HIV-1/AIDS patients with CpG ODNs may prevent HIV-1 transmission and the AIDS pandemic if controlled studies on the treatments with CpG ODNs of HIV-1 infected people will be done by international and private agencies and companies to de. ne the effective treatment regime and the efficacy of the treatments to HIV-1 infected people at different times post-infection. It is also hypothesized that in order to stop HIV-1 transmission in HIV-1 endemic regions the people at high risk of HIV-1 infection should be treated at the same time as HIV-1 infected people with a vaccine containing synthetic CpG-ODNs combined with synthetic HIV-1 peptides, compatible with the major HLA haplotypes of the regional population. The vaccine may be self-applied by people at high risk of infection by the intra-nasal route and by intra-dermal application as a "peplotion vaccine''. The stimulation of the antiviral CTL response by HIV-1 infected people and the active antiviral immune response in the vaccinated population may lead to a decline in HIV-1 transmission and may be a model for control of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic.

AB  - Entrepreneurs enter into cooperative arrangements such as franchise systems (Baucus, Baucus and Human 1993; Norton 1988), network partnerships (Larson 1991, 1992), and constellations of firms (Shepherd 1991) to gain a competitive advantage over rivals (Baird, Lyles and Orris 1992; Larson 1992). They expect to reduce production and inventory costs, speed product development, expand markets, or secure technology, while enjoying congenial business relations with partners (Larson 1992). Entrepreneurs may not reap advantages attributed to cooperative arrangements, however, if dissension arises concerning the means of competition or desired ends.
   Strategic management researchers associate competitive advantage in part with consensus on the means of competition (e.g., Bourgeois 1980; Dess and Davis 1984), whereas entrepreneurship researchers accentuate the importance of common ends (e.g, goals and values) in cooperative arrangements (Ambrose And Koepke 1984; Larson 1991; Mohr and Spekman 1994; Shepherd 1991; Starr and MacMillan 1990). Competitive advantage refers to the superior capabilities of the firm over rivals (Porter 1980) and means of competition involve resource allocations (Dess and Davis 1984; Porter 1980). Desired ends include business goals, as well as standards of fairness and trustworthiness (Larson 1991). Strategy researchers report that consensus among managers on methods of competing relates to higher firm performance (Bourgeois 1980; Dess and Davis 1984), but they have not shown that within-firm results generalize to cooperative relations.
   We believe consensus on means and ends may command a particularly important influence on the competitive advantage of franchises, network partnerships, and constellations of loosely tied entrepreneurs. Franchising pioneers like Bill Rosenberg (Dunkin Donuts) and Frank Carney (Pizza Hut) created a context of trust and respect with franchisees (Tannenbaum 1993a), but the physical separation, disparate challenges, and incongruous goals of franchisors and franchisees (Norton 1988 Phan, Butler, and Lee 1996) now produce widespread dissension. Franchise partners join separate professional associations, such as the international Franchise Association and American Franchisee Association, potentially dividing loyalties. Franchisees initiate class-action lawsuits and conduct grassroots lobbying, whereas franchisors arbitrate disputes through professional associations and advisory boards (Galen and Touby 1993; Tannenbaum 1993a). The litigious nature of the U.S. society may accentuate dissension among franchise partners, bill franchise systems worldwide may soon exhibit similar tendencies.
   Similarly, network partnerships, defined as close collaborative alliances between entrepreneurs and a limited set of resource partners (Larson and Starr 1993), begin as arms-length, adversarial transactions and evolve into relationships based on trust. They require reciprocity, collaboration, complementary interdependence, and mutual understanding of partners' business styles and motives Larson 1992). Constellations refer to clusters of complementary firms organized into coordinated partnerships with lead firms; they require firms to develop precise roles and known rules of operation (Lorenzoni and Ornati 1988). Entrepreneurs reaching consensus with their franchise, network, or constellation partners on means and ends may secure the advantages of cooperation and outperform rivals; those lacking consensus likely face recurring conflicts, disappointing performance, and the eventual dissolution of partnerships.
   Entrepreneurship researchers have not yet examined consensus on means and ends of cooperative arrangements among franchisees, or other entrepreneurs, and they have not tested linkages between consensus and competitive advantage. Prior authors have described competitive advantages of selecting a franchise over an independent business (Ayling 1988; Baron and Schmidt 1991; Knight 1986) and conditions giving vise to franchise arrangements (Norton 1988). They have studied the formation of partnerships (Larson, 1991, 1992), described the normative operations of constellations (Shepherd 1991), and enumerated impressive benefits of such arrangements (Baird et al. 1992; Larson 1991). Yet, normative guidelines for forming partnerships overtook the hazards stemming from dissension in such relationships (Mohr and Spekman 1994).
   We examine perceived consensus on indicators of the means of competition (e.g., priorities in resource allocations), and analyze how consensus on means and ends (e.g., goals and values) relates to competitive advantage and performance in franchise systems, the most pervasive and fastest growing form of cooperative venture among entrepreneurs. Franchises represent an ideal context for our study, because widespread disputes occur among franchisees and franchisors, especially as franchisors modify strategies to offset the effects of rising competition (Barrett 1992). The lack of consensus in franchise relationships has triggered extensive investigations by states, Congress, and the FTC to protect franchisees from misrepresented products or cannibalized retail outlets (Marsh 1992).
   We report statistically significant differences between franchisees' emphasis on competitive methods and those they attribute to their franchisor. These differences occur in franchisee-franchisor relations despite evidence that consensus relates positively with the franchise's competitive advantage, business performance in retail operations, and franchisees' satisfaction. We believe dissension arises as franchisees initially move from a knowledge disadvantage relative to franchisors to a knowledge advantage associated with the accumulation of local experience. Early in the relationship, franchisees need advice and franchisors police franchisees to comply with standards for operations, as accepted theories imply (e.g., Brickley, Dark and Weisbach 1991). Over time, franchisees gain local knowledge about their markets, exercise entrepreneurial initiative, and adopt their own standards for quality and conduct. Dynamic attributes of franchise relationships requires further investigation, but theories promoting monitoring and policing actions by franchisors may better describe relationships with new or renegade franchisees, rather than with franchisees like those in our sample.
   Our study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by integrating cooperative arrangements research with consensus studies in strategic management. We frame franchise relationships as one form of cooperative arrangement among entrepreneurs, and believe our study of franchises should shed light on relationships between consensus and performance in other cooperative arrangements. We operationalize competitive advantage using dimensions critical for competing in the fast food industry, the context of our investigation, demonstrating how entrepreneurship researchers may move beyond loose (unmeasured) treatments of the concept. We begin with explanations of franchise arrangements and dissension in cooperative arrangements, then present our hypotheses. A description of our methods and results follows, along with a discussion of the implications of our study for franchisors, franchisees, and researchers.

AB  - Modern life imposes several different labor demands Modern life imposes several different labor demands on human beings; thus, bringing about stressing situations. All those events perceived as threatening bringing about tension are called stressors.
   A stressing situation comes about when there exists a discrepancy between environment demands and adequate resources to cope with them. All these factors lead to physiological, cognitive and motor responses which enhance perception and create the need of better solutions to allow appropriate adaptation behaviors.
   When stress is present at the workplace in a recurrent fashion, it is known as Labor Stress (LS), an alarming circumstance affecting individuals and organizations. Main causes of LS are: physical conditions, schedule, work position, interpersonal relations and other organizational variables.
   Labor Stress is a public health and a labor health problem, for it,,,is,related to an increase in labor accident, morbidity and absenteeism rates; thus, generating negative attitudes that, yield economic loss to institutions.
   The Burnout Syndrome (BS) is a response to chronically labor stress manifested through emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, as well as hostile and aggressive attitudes toward workmates and service users, resulting in a feeling of poor personal development.
   Objective
   Asseses the effect of a psycho-educative intervention to decrease BS in managing or directive employees from one. sector of CFE Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.
   Materials and methodology
   A quasi-experimental study was carried out; this included measurements prior and after educative intervention carried out on confidence employees from CFE Guadalajara from February through September 2005.
   The study sample was made up of 29 managing or directive employees, conforming four groups; one random-selected group received educative intervention; the other three were control groups; different questionnaires were applied: personal data, psycho-social factors and BS through the Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale (MBI).
   From a participative-educational view point, encouraged by the Pan-American Health Organization (PHO), the educative intervention sought health promotion through the betterment and consistency of mental and physical wellbeing.
   All BS concepts as well as psychological factors were analyzed. Other workshop included the development of preventing, coping and treatment strategies at individual and social levels. Finally, a corrective program directed to decreasing psychological risk factors in the organization was encouraged. Also, a post-intervention assessment was applied.
   Results
   Subjects had an average age of 31.5 +/- 6.8 years; 52% were females; group 1 decreased for all indicators; emotional exhaustion from 71% to 29%; depersonalizotion from 43% to 14%; lack of personal development from 57% to 14%. However, no significant difference was found in both groups by sex.
   Discussion
   In personnel with specific responsibilities, obligations, opportunities, challenges and rewards based on their performance work environment often drives them to frustration and despair. When the employee believes that gives more than he receives, he becomes emotionally exhausted and more even if he do not have the resources to cope with the prospect of work. Also, it is documented that at younger age there is an increased risk of presenting the Burnout.
   This is because interpersonal relationships are more contentious because of the lack of experience in management. In the series reported, on both groups we were not able to document this relationship, but still, there is a lack of an international consensus to recognize this as a risk factor.
   Mingote describes that when the employee has less than five years working, they are often idealistic, utopian dreamers, unlike those with more than ten years in the job and are in risk of experiencing monotony at work, loss of interest and the downgrade.
   Also, this type of workers is subject to overtime. This excess produces physical and mental stress and leads to lower feelings of personal accomplishment. Even though there could be resources for coping with the monotony at work and that provides resources for better interpersonal communication, and support networks of work.
   If the worker feels happy with the work carried out, and feels as an autonomous decision maker able to practice his skills, then he will have the protective factors to cope with the Syndrome of Burnout at work and its is unlikely that he will found in his work a monotonous and a routine activity with little opportunity to practice their skills.
   The emotional exhaustion related to fatigue and tiredness are caused by excessive wear at work and very demanding work environments with little autonomy and control of work situations. Depletion causes difficulties with daily responsilbilties, these factors are related to the work system and the social interactions in the workplace, which after the educative intervention modifies the emotional exhaustion level in the experimental group (29% of group).
   The depersonalization causes people to be treated as objects (coldness and insensitivity) cause people to be treated as objects empathy with the task of work. Although the level of depersonalization was low in the groups, it decreased in the experimental group, which may be caused by the copying mechanicms embedded in the educational intervention.
   The lack of personal accomplishment includes the limitations to understand the feelings and emotions of fellow workers and also have a positive influence for them to create pleasant environments (these completion rates increased in the intervention group) In developing countries, there is now general agreement on the importance of the behaviors and lifestyles in the generation of health problems as well as the importance of early healthy lifestyles. All countries have agreed to launch health and educational programs to prevent the modification of human behavior. This study provides a useful educational methodology that responds to how to bring workers to participate in their care, as well as a significant contribution to addressing a problem of this magnitude and importance to public health and health and health services in Latin America.
   Conclusion
   The psycho-educative program sensitized employees when developing strategies to decrease and control labor stressors that affects them, the same stressors that bring about BS.

AB  - One of the most important sources of global carbon dioxide emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for power generation. Power plants contribute more than 40% of the worldwide anthropogenic CO(2) emissions. Therefore, the increased requirements for climate protection are a great challenge for the power producers. In this context a significant increase in power plant efficiency will contribute to reduce specific CO(2) emissions. Additionally, CO(2) capture and storage (CCS) is receiving considerable attention as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option. CCS allows continued use of fossil fuels with no or little CO(2) emissions given to the atmosphere. This could approve a moderate transition to a low-carbon energy generation over the next decades. Currently, R&D activities in the field of CCS are mainly concentrated on the development of capture techniques, the geological assessment of CO(2) storage reservoirs, and on economic aspects. Although first studies on material and energy flows caused by CCS are available, a broader environmental analysis is necessary to show the overall environmental impacts of CCS. The objectives in this paper are coal-based power plants with and without CO(2) capture via mono-ethanolamine (MEA) and the comparison of their environmental effects based on life cycle assessment methodology (LCA).
   This LCA study examines the environmental and human health effects of power generation of five coal-based steam power plants, which differ in the year of installation (2005, 2010, 2020), the conversion efficiency, and in the ability and efficiency to capture CO(2). For the removal of CO(2) from combustion and gasification processes in power plants, three main technology concepts exist: (1) pre-combustion technology, (2) oxyfuel combustion systems, and (3) post-combustion separation. As post-combustion technology shows the highest level of maturity, this study concentrates on this route, focusing on capture using mono-ethanolamine (MEA). The analysis regards the post-combustion retrofit of coal power plants with MEA to be a general option in 2020.
   Material and energy flows are balanced on the level of single processes as well as for the whole process chains. The life cycle inventory clearly shows decreasing inputs and outputs according to the efficiency increase from 43% to 49% in case of the power plants without CO(2) capture. In case of the MEA plants, all inputs and emissions raise, according to the additional energy consumption, except CO(2) and sulphur dioxide. The strong decrease of SO(2) partly results from the necessary improvement of desulphurisation if MEA wash is used. The influence of up and downstream activities on the results is determined. For the MEA plants, a considerable effect of up and downstream activities on the overall results is observed. Finally, the inventory results are assigned to selected impact categories. Global warming (GWP), human toxicity (HTP), acidification (AP), photo-oxidant formation (POCP), eutrophication (EP), and primary energy demand are adopted as impact categories. The impact assessment indicates decreasing impacts for all categories with increasing combustion efficiency for the coal plants without carbon capture. As expected, the GWP for the MEA plants is much lower than for the power plants without CO(2) capture. In contrast to this, the HTP and the EP are much higher (up to three times) for the MEA plants. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distances have a significant impact on the overall results. Furthermore, it is concluded from the sensitivity analysis that for CCS systems the length of CO(2) pipeline has a negligible effect in comparison with the effect of capture efficiency. The LCA is completed by a normalisation of the environmental impact categories.
   The development of combustion efficiency in case of the power plants without CO(2) capture has the main influence on the decreasing mass flows at the input side. The energy penalty of the MEA plants affects the use of the inputs into the opposite direction. Although the power producer's focus is on the power plant, the sense of a life cycle assessment is an integrated environmental assessment of the full life cycle of a product (here 1 kWh) including up and downstream processes. Therefore, the inventory results are presented without and with up and downstream processes. The inventory analysis clearly shows the significant influence of the up and downstream processes on the overall emissions. This influence is higher for the MEA plants than for the power plants without capture. In case of CO(2) emissions, the significance of up and downstream processes is especially considerable (approx. 30%). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distances have a significant impact on the overall results.
   The results point out that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere is achieved at the expense of increasing other emissions and corresponding environmental impacts. In most cases the influence of up and downstream processes is significant. Therefore, life cycle approaches are necessary to get a holistic evaluation. It also shows that the implementation of new techniques can change the environmental assessment of the process chain and, thus, positive and negative effects have to be compared and weighed up against each other.
   As there exist several possible technical options for CO(2) capture, further studies are necessary to compare the overall environmental effects of competing capture concepts such as pre-combustion and oxyfuel technology. Additionally, gas separating membranes should be part of further studies as they have the potential to contribute to all three main capture technology routes. Further studies with more detail and reliable inventories for CO(2) compression and liquefaction as well as for gas conditioning as an interface between CO(2) capture and transport are needed. Furthermore, the environmental effects including long-term CO(2) emission from the storage sites are recommended.

AB  - Background
   Fetal movement counting is a method by which a woman quantifies the movements she feels to assess the condition of her baby. The purpose is to try to reduce perinatal mortality by alerting caregivers when the baby might be compromised. This method may be used routinely, or only in women who are considered at increased risk of complications affecting the baby. Fetal movement counting may allow the clinician to make appropriate interventions in good time to improve outcomes. On the other hand, fetal movement counting may cause unnecessary anxiety to pregnant women, or elicit unnecessary interventions.
   Objectives
   To assess outcomes of pregnancy where fetal movement counting was done routinely, selectively or was not done at all; and to compare different methods of fetal movement counting.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs where fetal movement counting was assessed as a method of monitoring fetal wellbeing.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors assessed studies for eligibility, assessed the methodological quality of included studies and independently extracted data from studies. Where possible the effects of interventions were compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For some outcomes, the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
   Main results
   Five studies (71,458 women) were included in this review; 68,654 in one cluster-RCT. None of these five trials were assessed as having low risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. All included studies except for one (which included high-risk women as participants) included women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Two studies compared fetal movement counting with standard care, as defined by trial authors. Two included studies compared two types of fetal movement counting; once a day fetal movement counting (Cardiff count-to-10) with more than once a day fetal movement counting methods. One study compared fetal movement counting with hormone assessment.
   (1) Routine fetal movement counting versus mixed or undefined fetal movement counting
   No study reported on the primary outcome 'perinatal death or severe morbidity'. In one large cluster-RCT, there was no difference in mean stillbirth rates per cluster (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 1.07; participants = 52 clusters; studies = one, low quality evidence). The other study reported no fetal deaths. There was no difference in caesarean section rate between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.44; participants = 1076; studies = one, low quality evidence). Maternal anxiety was significantly reduced with routine fetal movement counting (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.10; participants = 1013; studies = one, moderate quality evidence). Maternal-fetal attachment was not significantly different (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.11; participants = 951; studies = one, low quality evidence). In one study antenatal admission after reporting of decreased fetal movements was increased (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.52; participants = 123; studies = one). In another there was a trend to more antenatal admissions per cluster in the counting group than in the control group (SMD 0.38, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.93; participants = 52 clusters; studies = one, low quality evidence). Birthweight less than 10th centile was not significantly different between groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.44; participants = 1073; studies = one, low quality evidence). The evidence was of low quality due to imprecise results and because of concerns regarding unclear risk of bias.
   (2) Formal fetal movement counting (Modified Cardiff method) versus hormone analysis
   There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of caesarean section (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69; participants = 1191; studies = one). Women in the formal fetal movement counting group had significantly fewer hospital visits than those randomised to hormone analysis (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.35), whereas there were fewer Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes for women randomised to hormone analysis (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.93). No other outcomes reported showed statistically significant differences. 'Perinatal death or severe morbidity' was not reported.
   (3) Formal fetal movement counting once a day (count-to-10) versus formal fetal movement counting method where counting was done more than once a day (after meals)
   The incidence of caesarean section did not differ between the groups under this comparison (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.61 to 8.99; participants = 1400; studies = one). Perinatal death or severe morbidity was not reported. Women were more compliant in using the count-to-10 method than they were with other fetal movement counting methods, citing less interruption with daily activities as one of the reasons (non-compliance RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.32).
   Except for one cluster-RCT, included studies were small and used different comparisons, making it difficult to measure the outcomes using meta-analyses. The nature of the intervention measured also did not allow blinding of participants and clinicians..
   Authors' conclusions
   This review does not provide sufficient evidence to influence practice. In particular, no trials compared fetal movement counting with no fetal movement counting. Only two studies compared routine fetal movements with standard antenatal care, as defined by trial authors. Indirect evidence from a large cluster-RCT suggested that more babies at risk of death were identified in the routine fetal monitoring group, but this did not translate to reduced perinatal mortality. Robust research by means of studies comparing particularly routine fetal movement counting with selective fetal movement counting is needed urgently, as it is a common practice to introduce fetal movement counting only when there is already suspected fetal compromise.

TI  - Assessment of the relationship between chlorophyll content and biogenic elements in large lowland resevoirs
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA
LA  - Russian
AB  - In the second half of the 20th century, with increased rates of eutrophication, universal quantitative relationships between the content of biogenic elements and chlorophyll (Chl) were obtained, which serves as a marker of algae biomass, as well as an indicator of the trophic status of water bodies. Most of these studies were performed on lakes, however, the patterns and ratios found for lakes were not always observed in reservoirs, young ecosystems with high development dynamics. Long-term studies of phytoplankton productivity are carried out in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga. These studies have shown that a direct relationship of Chl with total nitrogen (N-tot) and phosphorus (P-tot) is rarely found and is at low correlation coefficients. A more successful attempt was to indirectly assess this relationship using the ratios of Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot, which was named "phytoplankton response" (Vinberg, 1987) corresponding to the term "efficiency" (Kalf, Knoechel, 1978). Our first data on Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot in the Upper Volga reservoirs refer to 1980-1990 (Mineeva and Razgulin, 1995; Mineeva, 1993; Mineeva, 2004). At present, new data have been obtained, which have made it possible to follow long-term trends in the development of phytoplankton in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga in connection with the availability of biogenic elements under variations in the trophic status of the reservoirs.
   Samples were collected in August 2015-2018 at 26 stations in three large reservoirs of the Upper Volga (56 degrees 51'-58 degrees 22'N, 35 degrees 55'-38 degrees 25'E): Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs. Chlorophyll content was determined by the fluorescence method (Gol'd et al., 1986) in integral water samples taken from the surface to the bottom. Data on biogenic elements obtained at the same time by Dr Irina Stepanova are given in our joint publication (Mineeva et al., 2021). The standard software packages for a personal computer were used for statistical processing (calculation of mean values and standard error of the mean (M +/- m(M)), correlation and variation coefficients, regression equations and graphing).
   In this research, we revealed that nutrient content in the Upper Volga reservoirs varied within similar limits, the average N-tot/P-tot ratio was the same, and the average values of P-tot and N-tot decreased in Rybinsk reservoir. Chl content was typical of the summer phytoplankton maximum in the Upper Volga reservoirs (See Table 1). P-tot content did not change much in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but in Rybinsk reservoir it increased in 2015 and decreased in 2016. The more stable content of N-tot decreased a little in the cool 2017. Chl concentrations of 20-30 mu g/L obtained in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2018, in Uglich reservoir in 2017 and in Ivankovo reservoir in 2015 correspond to the eutrophic category; concentrations of 35-52 mu g/L (Rybinsk reservoir in 2016, Uglich reservoir in 2015, 2016 and 2018, Ivankovo reservoir in 2016-2018) - to hypertrophic category, and only in 2017 in Rybinsk reservoir did they decrease to a moderately eutrophic level of 13 mu g/L (See Fig. 1). It was found out that under these conditions Chl content per unit of biogenic elements varied in a wide range: Chl/P-tot from 0,03 to 2,13, Chl/N-tot from 2,55 to 123, with maximum values in the highly eutrophic Shosha reach in Ivankovo reservoir (August 2018). Chl/N-tot slightly differed in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but increased in Rybinsk reservoir; Chl/P-tot decreased in the range of Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs (See Table 1). Most of both ratios belong to narrower limits: 0.10-0.50 for Chl/P-tot (67% of all values) and 10-40 for Chl/N-tot (51%) (See Table 2). The average Chl/P-tot ratio for the entire data set is 0.43 +/- 0.03, and Chl/N-tot is 29.8 +/- 1.9 with variation coefficients of 77.0 and 63.9%. The interannual changes (See Fig. 1) show that all the maximum ratios were obtained in 2016, while the minimum in Ivankovo reservoir was in 2015, in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2017 and in Uglich reservoir in 2017 and 2018. Our results demonstrate that both ratios correlate with each other (See Fig. 2), as well as with the Chl content (See Fig. 3). The correlation of both ratios with Chl weakens in Ivankovo reservoir, probably due to the abundant development of macrophytes. We can observe the same in all reservoirs in the cool 2017 with a decrease in Chl(Cya)n (the abundance of cyanoprokaryotes) and an increase in the proportion of Chl(Bac) (the abundance of diatoms). Both ratios are insignificantly dependent on hydrological factors as well as on P-tot and N-tot content, but the situation can change in individual reservoirs and in different years of observation (See Table 3). As it was demonstrated, both ratios increase with the growth of trophy estimated by Chl. They do not significantly differ in mesotrophic and moderately eutrophic waters, but become much higher in eutrophic and highly eutrophic waters, indicating a more efficient consumption of nutrients in the latter. At the same time, P-tot and N-tot change little along the Chl gradient (See Table 4).
   Chl/P-tot decreases with the increase in P-tot and grows slightly with the increase in N-tot; Chl/N-tot does not change over the entire range of P-tot and N-tot; but both ratios vary along the gradient of N-tot/P-tot (See Table 5) that serves as an indicator of the biogenic limitation of phytoplankton and a factor regulating the development of algae. A retrospective analysis shows significant interannual fluctuations of both ratios in Rybinsk reservoir and a tendency to increase them in Uglich and Ivankovo reservoirs (See Fig. 1).
   Thus, Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot ratios are useful for analyzing the relationship between the development of phytoplankton and nutrient supply that is necessary in order to assess the efficiency of their use and their availability to algae cells. The results obtained allow us to conclude that phytoplankton in the Upper Volga reservoirs is less sensitive to the presence of nitrogen and more dependent on phosphorus.

AB  - In Siberia, the honeybee was introduced about 230 years ago. It was the dark-colored forest bee Apis mellifera mellifera L., that was cultivated in Siberia as the most adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. At the end of the last century, bees of the southern breeds, mainly Apis mellifera carpathica subspecies (a derivative of A. m. carnica subspecies), were actively imported to Siberia. Introgressive bee hybridization leads to the reduction of the range of native subspecies and the formation of hybrids, modifies the genetic pool of local honeybee populations leading to the loss of their genetic identity. Russia, including Siberia, still has unique abilities to preserve the aboriginal populations of the honeybee. For Siberia, such a unique subspecies is the dark-colored forest bee A. m. mellifera, which is considered endangered in Europe. At present, the knowledge of honeybee subspecies living in Siberia, including Tomsk region, is insufficient; data on the genetic diversity of honeybees are fragmentary. In this regard, the aim of this work was to identify the biological diversity of the A. mellifera honeybee living in Tomsk region using morphometric and molecular genetic markers.
   A total of 337 bee colonies obtained from 65 apiaries of Tomsk region were investigated using mtDNA analysis (variability of the COI-COII locus) and morphometric method (analysis of wing parameters: cubital and hantel indexes, discoidal shift) (See Fig. 1). The genetic diversity of honeybees was studied using 9 microsatellite loci (A008, AC117, A043, A113, A024, Ap243, Ap049, H110, SV185), a total of 106 bee colonies and 893 individuals were investigated.
   According to the analysis of variability of the COI-COII mtDNA locus, 62.9% of bee colonies were of A. m. mellifera origin on maternal line, 29.1% of bee colonies were of the origin from the southern subspecies and 8.0% were from mixed colonies. Three variants of the mtDNA COI-COII locus were registered: PQQ, PQQQ (characteristic of A. m. mellifera) and Q (characteristic of subspecies of the southern origin) (See Fig. 2). According to a morphometric study, about 56% of the studied bee colonies conformed to the A. m. mellifera standard according to the majority of morphometric parameters, but for some individual characteristics (mainly the indicator "discoidal shift"), a deviation from the values adopted for this subspecies was recorded. About 24% of the studied bee colonies are more consistent with the A. m. carpathica standard, but also have some signs characteristic of A. m. mellifera (hybrids based on the A. m. carpatica subspecies). Finally, a comparative analysis of the variability of morphometric parameters and variability of the COI-COII mtDNA locus allowed us to identify bee colonies (the so-called "inverted colonies"), which corresponded to the A. m. mellifera standard according to morphometric parameters, but had the Q variant of mtDNA (colony origin from the southern bee subspecies on the maternal line) or, on the contrary, the colonies were the A. m. carpathica subspecies according to morphometric parameters, while mtDNA was specific for A. m. mellifera (See Table 1). Consequently, the study of honeybees in Tomsk region using a comprehensive approach, including morphometric and mtDNA analysis, showed that most bee colonies are represented by hybrid forms both on the basis of A. m. mellifera subspecies and on the basis of A. m. carpathica, hybrids based on A. m. mellifera prevail (See Fig. 3). No large areas were found with a genetically homogeneous array of bees, originating from A. m. mellifera subspecies. At the same time, the apiaries, where A. m. mellifera bees are preserved and bred, were identified in some districts of Tomsk region (Molchanovsky, Chainsky, Zyryansky, Teguldetsky, Tomsky) (See Fig. 3). In order to characterize the genetic diversity of honeybees in Tomsk region, as well as to assess the process of bee hybridization, we analyzed the variability of nine microsatellite loci in honeybees (See Table 2). A comparative analysis of the variability of the studied microsatellite loci in purebred bees (A. m. mellifera and A. m. carpathica) showed differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of alleles between subspecies for most loci. In addition, for some loci (A008, A043, A113, A024, and Ap049), the predominant alleles were recorded (the frequency of their registration was more than 0.40), and the spectrum of these alleles differed in bees of different evolutionary lineages (M and C) (See Table 2). Evaluation of genetic diversity on heterozygosity of most of the studied loci revealed similar results for two bee subspecies, namely lower values of the observed heterozygosity compared with the expected heterozygosity (See Table 2). The revealed differences between honeybees of A. m. mellifera and A. m. carpathica subspecies on the variability of the studied loci were used to assess the genetic diversity of hybrid bees obtained from apiaries of Tomsk region.
   We have established that both in hybrids based on A. m. mellifera subspecies (variants PQQ and PQQQ of the COI-COII mtDNA locus) and in hybrids based on subspecies of the southern origin (variant Q of the COI-COII locus) the nuclear genome is more consistent with the A. m. mellifera genome in the spectrum and/or frequency of alleles of the studied DNA markers. Using the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) method (See Fig. 4 and 5), we showed that the genetic diversity of honeybees living in apiaries of Tomsk region is not determined by a single indicator (geographical localization and isolation of apiaries, the bee breed (origin), the level of gene introgression), but by the complex effect of the above factors, whose importance to a certain extent depends on human activity.
   Thus, the study of genetic diversity, which is determined by numerous factors, as well as evaluation of the level of introgression between aboriginal and adventive subspecies of honey bees are important to establish the effects of hybridization and to preserve the gene pool of local bee subspecies. To preserve and restore the unique gene pool of A. m. mellifera, a Coordinating Council on the problems of selection, rational use and protection of A. m. mellifera gene pool was created in 2019 in Russia. Two researchers from "Apis" Scientific and Production Center, Tomsk State University are its members. The success of measures to preserve aboriginal bee ecotypes will primarily depend on detecting and restoring the unique surviving populations, creating bee nurseries and reserves, as well as on studying the current state of various honeybee populations to understand genetic processess going on in them.

AB  - Background Multisystemic Therapy (R) (MST (R)) is an intensive, home-based intervention for families of youth with social, emotional, and behavioural problems. MST therapists engage family members in identifying and changing individual, family, and environmental factors thought to contribute to problem behaviour. Intervention may include efforts to improve communication, parenting skills, peer relations, school performance, and social networks. MST is widely considered to be a well-established, evidence-based programme. Objectives We assessed (1) impacts of MST on out-of-home placements, crime and delinquency, and other behavioural and psychosocial outcomes for youth and families; (2) consistency of effects across studies; and (3) potential moderators of effects including study location, evaluator independence, and risks of bias. Search Methods Searches were performed in 2003, 2010, and March to April 2020. We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, ERIC, NCJRS Abstracts, ProQuest and WorldCAT dissertations and theses, and 10 other databases, along with government and professional websites. Reference lists of included articles and research reviews were examined. Between April and August 2020 we contacted 22 experts in search of missing data on 16 MST trials. Selection Criteria Eligible studies included youth (ages 10 to 17) with social, emotional, and/or behavioural problems who were randomly assigned to licensed MST programmes or other conditions. There were no restrictions on publication status, language, or geographic location. Data Collection and Analysis Two reviewers independently screened 1802 titles and abstracts, read all available study reports, assessed study eligibility, and extracted data onto structured electronic forms. We assessed risks of bias (ROB) using modified versions of the Cochrane ROB tool and What Works Clearinghouse standards. Where possible, we used random effects models with inverse variance weights to pool results across studies. We used odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes. We used Hedges g to adjust for small sample sizes. We assessed the heterogeneity of effects with chi(2) and I (2). Pairwise meta-analyses are displayed in forest plots, with studies arranged in subgroups by location (USA or other country) and investigator independence. We provide separate forest plots for conceptually distinct outcomes and endpoints. We assessed differences between subgroups of studies with chi (2) tests. We generated robust variance estimates, using correlated effects (CE) models with small sample corrections to synthesise all available outcome measures within each of nine outcome domains. Exploratory CE analyses assessed potential moderators of effects within these domains. We used GRADE guidelines to assess the certainty of evidence on seven primary outcomes at one year after referral. Main Results Twenty-three studies met our eligibility criteria; these studies included a total of 3987 participating families. Between 1983 and 2020, 13 trials were conducted in the USA by MST program developers and 10 studies were conducted by independent teams (three in the USA, three in the UK, and one each in Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden). These studies examined outcomes of MST for juvenile offenders, sex offenders, offenders with substance abuse problems, youth with conduct or behaviour problems, those with serious mental health problems, autism spectrum disorder, and cases of child maltreatment.
   We synthesised data from all eligible trials to test the claim that MST is effective across clinical problems and populations. Most trials compared MST to treatment as usual (TAU). In the USA, TAU consisted of relatively little contact and few services for youth and families, compared with more robust public health and social services available to youth in other high-income countries. One USA study provided "enhanced TAU" to families in the control group, and two USA studies compared MST to individual therapy for youth. The quality of available evidence for MST is mixed. We identified high risks of bias due to: inadequate randomisation procedures (in 9% of studies); lack of comparability between groups at baseline (65%); systematic omission of cases (43%); attrition (39%); confounding factors (e.g., between-group differences in race, gender, and attention; 43%); selective reporting of outcomes (52%); and conflicts of interest (61%). Most trials (96%) have high risks of bias on at least one indicator. GRADE ratings of the quality of evidence are low or moderate for seven primary outcomes, with high-quality evidence from non-USA studies on out-of-home placement. Effects of MST are not consistent across studies, outcomes, or endpoints. At one year post randomisation, available evidence shows that MST reduced out-of-home placements in the USA (OR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.84; P < .01), but not in other countries (OR 1.14, CI 0.84 to 1.55; P = .40). There is no overall evidence of effects on other primary outcomes at one year. When we included all available outcomes in CE models, we found that MST reduced placements and arrests in the USA, but not in other countries. At 2.5 years, MST increased arrest rates in non-USA countries (OR 1.27, CI 1.01 to 1.60; P = .04) and increased substance use by youth in the UK and Sweden (SMD 0.13, CI -0.00 to 0.27; P = .05). CE models show that MST reducesd self-reported delinquency and improved parent and family outcomes, but there is no overall evidence of effects on youth symptoms, substance abuse, peer relations, or school outcomes. Prediction intervals indicate that future studies are likely to find positive or negative effects of MST on all outcomes. Potential moderators are confounded: USA studies led by MST developers had higher risks of bias, and USA control groups received fewer services and had worse outcomes than those in independent trials conducted in other high-income countries. The USA/non-USA contrast appears to be more closely related to effect sizes than than investigator independence or risks of bias. Authors' Conclusions The quality of evidence for MST is mixed and effects are inconsistent across studies. Reductions in out-of-home placements and arrest/conviction were observed in the USA, but not in other high-income countries. Studies that compared MST to more active treatments showed fewer benefits, and there is evidence that MST may have had some negative effects on youth outside of the USA. Based on moderate to low quality evidence, MST may reduce self-reported delinquency and improve parent and family outcomes, but there is no overall evidence of effects on youth symptoms, substance abuse, peer relations, or school outcomes.

AB  - Background
   Couple therapy for depression has the twofold aim of modifying negative interaction patterns and increasing mutually supportive aspects of intimate relationships, changing the interpersonal context of depression. Couple therapy is included in several guidelines among the suggested treatments for depression.
   Objectives
   1. The main objective was to examine the effects of couple therapy compared to individual psychotherapy for depression.
   2. Secondary objectives were to examine the effects of couple therapy compared to drug therapy and no/minimal treatment for depression.
   Search methods
   The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and PsycINFO (Ovid) were searched to 19 February 2018. Relevant journals and reference lists were checked.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised and quasi- randomised controlled trials examining the effects of couple therapy versus individual psychotherapy, drug therapy, or no treatment/minimal treatment for depression were included in the review.
   Data collection and analysis
   We considered as primary outcomes the depressive symptom level, the depression persistence, and the dropouts; the relationship distress level was a secondary outcome. We extracted data using a standardised spreadsheet. Where data were not included in published papers, we tried to obtain the data from the authors. We synthesised data using Review Manager software version 5.3. We pooled dichotomous data using the relative risk (RR), and continuous data calculating the standardised mean difference (SMD), together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We employed the random- effects model for all comparisons and also calculated a formal test for heterogeneity, the natural approximate Chi2 test.
   Main results
   We included fourteen studies from Europe, North America, and Israel, with 651 participants. Eighty per cent of participants were Caucasian. Therefore, the findings cannot be considered as applicable to non-Western countries or to other ethnic groups in Western countries. On average, participants had moderate depression, preventing the extension of results to severely depressed patients. Almost all participants were aged between 36 and 47 years.
   There was no evidence of difference in effect at the end of treatment between couple therapy and individual psychotherapy, either for the continuous outcome of depressive symptoms, based on nine studies with 304 participants (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.10, low-quality evidence), or the proportion of participants remaining depressed, based on six studies with 237 participants (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22, low-quality evidence). Findings from studies with 6-month or longer follow-up confirmed the lack of difference between the two conditions.
   No trial gave information on harmful effects. However, we considered rates of treatment discontinuation for any reason as a proxy indicator of adverse outcomes. There was no evidence of difference for dropout rates between couple therapy and individual psychotherapy, based on eight studies with 316 participants (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.41, low-quality evidence).
   Few data were available for the comparison with drug therapy. Data from a small study with 12 participants showed no difference for the continuous outcome of depressive symptoms at end of treatment (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -1.69 to 0.66, very low-quality evidence) and at 6-month follow-up (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -2.45 to 0.31, very low-quality evidence). Data on dropouts from two studies with 95 participants showed a clear advantage for couple therapy (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61, very low-quality evidence). However, this finding was heavily influenced by a single study, probably affected by a selection bias favouring couple therapy.
   The comparison between couple therapy plus drug therapy and drug therapy alone showed no difference in depressive symptom level, based on two studies with 34 participants (SMD -1.04, 95% CI -3.97 to 1.89, very low-quality evidence) and on dropouts, based on two studies with 45 participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.52, very low-quality evidence).
   The comparison with no/minimal treatment showed a large significant effect favouring couple therapy both for depressive symptom level, based on three studies with 90 participants: (SMD -0.95, 95% CI -1.59 to -0.32, very low-quality evidence) and persistence of depression, based on two studies with 65 participants (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for dropouts for this comparison.
   Concerning relationship distress, the comparison with individual psychotherapy showed that couple therapy appeared more effective in reducing distress level at the end of treatment, based on six studies with 187 participants (SMD -0.50, CI -0.97 to -0.02, very low-quality evidence) and the persistence of distress, based on two studies with 81 participants (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98, very low-quality evidence). The quality of evidence was heavily affected by substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 59%). In the analysis restricted to studies including only distressed couples, no heterogeneity was found and the effect in distress level at the end of treatment was larger (SMD -1.10, 95% CI -1.59 to -0.61). Very few data on this outcome were available for other comparisons.
   We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system. The results were weakened by the low quality of evidence related to the effects on depressive symptoms, in comparison with individual psychotherapy, and by very low quality evidence for all other comparisons and for the effects on relationship distress. Most studies were affected by problems such as the small number of cases, performance bias, assessment bias due to the non-blinding outcome assessment, incomplete outcome reporting and the allegiance bias of investigators. Heterogeneity was, in particular, a problem for data about relationship distress.
   Authors' conclusions
   Although there is suggestion that couple therapy is as effective as individual psychotherapy in improving depressive symptoms and more effective in improving relations in distressed couples, the low or very low quality of the evidence seriously limits the possibility of drawing firm conclusions. Very few data were available for comparisons with no/minimal treatment and drug therapy. Future trials of high quality should test in large samples with a long follow-up of the effects of couple therapy in comparison to other interventions in discordant couples with a depressed partner, considering the role of relationship quality as a potential effectmediator in the improvement of depression.

AB  - The crown damage of a tree has a very prominent place among the broad spectrum of factors defining the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L) decline and dieback, largely due to the fact that it represents the first visible symptom of the decline in tree's vitality. Besides, crown damage is a key factor for the selection of trees with high risk of dying during the sanitary and salvage cuttings, in order to salvage high value timber that would be otherwise lost or severely degraded when the tree dies. Aim of this contribution is to investigate dynamics of crown damage of pedunculate oak trees, as well as the effect of the crown damage on tree S. basal area increment during longer time period in two most important types of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia. Research was done on permanent experimental plots situated in the stands of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam (II-G-10) and stands of pedunculate oak and Genista elata (11-G-20). In total, 38 permanent experimental plots were used, out of which 13 were re-measured with intervals of 9 to 17 years (Table 1). In first measurement, all trees on plots were permanently tagged, and map of tree locations and crown projections was made. Trees were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height and height to crown base. Crown length was calculated as the difference between the total tree height and height to crown base, while the crown ratio was calculated as the ratio of crown length and total tree height. From the map of horizontal crown projections the average crown width was calculated as a mean of the maximal and minimal crown diameters. Assessment of the crown damage was done according to the methodology of the ICP Forests Programme, whereby the trees were tal-lied into following five crown damage (CD) classes: 0 (< 10 % CD), 1 (11-25 % CD), 2 (26-60 % CD), 3 (61-99 % CD) and 4 (100 % CD - dead tree). For some analyses trees were further grouped into two classes: healthy trees with crown damage of 25 % and less, and severely damaged trees with crown damage over 25 %. Results from this research are, however not comparable to the damage assessment reports of the ICP Forests because of the different sampling strategies. On 13 plots the second measurement was made in which DBH of all trees still present on the plot was recorded, and the crown damage was assessed according to the same methodology used in the previous measurement, and further-more, by the same observer Average basal area increment per year (cm 2 year-1) per tree was obtained by dividing tree's total basal area increment by the interval (number of vegetation periods) between the two measurements. Total number of oak trees analyzed was 749 and 540 in first and second measurement, respectively.
   Prior to the crown damage analyses, the basic structural features of the stands on re-measured plots, as well as morphological features of pedunculate oak trees in two forest types were analyzed (Table 2 and Figure 1). Stands of the forest type II-G-20 have much larger shares of oak trees in the total number of trees, and total stand basal area compared to the type II-G-10. oak trees in both types exhibit the same relation of tree height (Figure 1A) and crown width (Figure 1D) to DBH, but the crown length (Figure I B) and crown ratio (Figure IC) are higher in the forest type II-G-20. Reason for this lies probably in the effect that common hornbeam trees in the lower canopy layers have on the morphological development of oak trees in the stands of II-G-10 type, while the stands in the II-G-20 have almost no sub-canopy layers.
   Relationship between the share of oak trees with severe crown damage (> 25 %) and stand age was examined for the 33 plots of forest type II-G-10 spanning almost entire rotation length of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia (II. to VII. age class). Linear regression with logarithmic transformation of independent variable (stand age) was used for this analysis. According to the model, significant increase of severely damaged trees occurs after the stand age of 70 years (Figure 2A). The stands in the type II-G-20 departed significantly from the model in the first measurement, with only 26 % of severely damaged trees compared to 76 % in stands of II-G-10. By the second measurement, however these plots also conformed to the behavior predicted by the model (Figure 2B), due to the deterioration of the overall crown condition.
   Distributions of oak trees by the CD classes in two measurements (Figure 3) reveal the direction of the crown damage dynamics, which is in more detail presented in the Figure 4. In both forest types, the change in crown class of the oak trees was predominantly in the direction of the worsening crown health status. Negative trend is more pronounced in the II-G-20 forest type. According to the CD classes recorded in the first measurement (Figure 5), decline intensity was most pronounced in the CD class 3, from which 70 % and 50 % of trees in forest types II-G-10 and II-G-20, respectively, died off by the second measurement. This result provides further foundation for the use of the CD assessments in the day-to-day Presto; as a reliable indicator of the tree's imminent death.
   Effect of crown damage on the basal area increment of oak trees was examined through: (i) the regression analyses of basal area increment per year per tree over DBH (Figure 6) and crown width (Figure 7), comparison of distributions of healthy and severely damaged trees over basal area increment classes (Figure 8), and by comparison of median values of basal area increment of healthy and severely damaged trees by forest types and stand age classes (Figure 9). Crown damage was found to have a significant impact on the basal area increment of pedunculate oak trees, with severely damaged trees having significantly lower basal area increment compared to healthy trees of the similar dimensions. These differences were very similar for both forest types.

AB  - The systematic study of sexuality is relatively recent if we consider the works of Freud and Kinsey and the studies performed during the first half of the XXth century The fact of undertaking the sex problem has allowed an even deeper understanding of this phenomenon, by all means complex Later on, Masters, Johnson and Kolodny created the model of human sexual response and its alterations Kaplan's works as well as Labrador and Ciespo's are directed to conceptualize the etiology of sexual dysfunctions as phenomena evolving from both recent and remote causes, ie, they can be explained as multi-causal events
   At the Department of Psychology of the National Institute of Perinatology (INPerIER), we have detected a high proportion of couples with problems in their sexual lives The prevalence of sexual dysfunction found was 52% in women and 38.8% in men Therefore, we decided to initiate a line of investigation on human sexuality, to which this work belongs The aim was to identify the frequency, difference, relation and combination of three sexual dysfunctions erectile dysfunction, male orgasmic disorder and precocious ejaculation, as well as some intervening factors that were divided in two types a) Personality factors, including gender role prescriptions, norms and expectations according to rules set by the society which are introjected by the individual When the expression of masculinity and femininity polarizes reaching machisms and submissive behavior, this can result in a negative influence for the development of sexuality Another personality factor is the level of self-esteem, which greatly determines the conduct of individuals and is defined as the personal judgment of value towards oneself, it is expressed in the form of attitudes of the individual towards himself b) The existence of some sexual background such as the report of having suffered child traumatic experience of sexual abuse, availability of sex information, presence or absence of sex fears, masturbation during adolescence and absence or presence of conjugal problems
   It must be said that the division of intervening factors into types allowed us to propose profiles for the indicators related with the presence of the aforementioned male sexual dysfunctions These dysfunctions are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)
   MATERIAL AND METHODS
   This was a non-experimental, one-sample, retrospective, transversal, multivariate-correlational field study of independent observations, with samples allocated in two groups
   Samples
   We got non-probabilistic samples from couples of patients recently accepted for service at the institution, according to pre-established quotas Sample size consisted of 200 men, with 100 men showing no sexual dysfunction (group 1) and 100 men with evidence of sexual dysfunction (group 2). Results of erectile dysfunction, male orgasmic disorder and precocious ejaculation are presented here, they were compared with the same number of participants showing no sexual dysfunction Participants were limited to individuals who met the following criteria. age range, 22 to 45 years old, elementary school as the minimum schooling, no history of mental illness or chronic disease that could condition the presence of mole sexual dysfunctions Socio-demographic factors controlled in this study included age, civil status and schooling, the classification variable was set to be the presence of male sexual dysfunctions
   Instruments
   For the classification of groups, in order to detect the type of dysfunction present, and for the sake of capturing sexual background data, we used the male version of the questionnaire of sexuality, based on the codified clinical history for female sexuality For the measurement of gender role, we used the Inventory of Masculinity-Femininity (IMAFE), which measures four orientations male, female, machismo and submission For the measurement of self-esteem we used Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, and the validation technique suggested by Lara, Verduzco, Acevedo and Cortex
   Participants were approached at the external consultation area at the INPerIER Instruments described above were applied as well as clinical histories obtained in one single session, individually, once the participant had signed the informed consent letter required by the Committee of Ethics of the INPerIER.
   RESULTS
   The most frequent dysfunction detected was precocious ejaculation, which was present in 48 participants Thirty four men were reported with erectile dysfunction and 15 men showed male orgasmic disorders In a previous article, we presented the results of hypoactive sexual disorder, the sexual dysfunction more frequently found (55 male participants reported it) In this case we observed that out of 100 participants studied, the overall number of dysfunctions found was 152, including hypoactive sexual disorder, which can be interpreted as one and a half dysfunctions per man
   For the sake of establishing the relationship of each sexual dysfunction with personality factors, we estimated the ETA coefficient In the case of the relation between sexual dysfunctions and sexual background we calculated Cramer's V Once we established the relations between the personality factors and the background that were used to develop profiles, we performed a discriminant analysis, which included all variables we found related and we came out with the following results
   For erectile dysfunction we found a relation with three variables negative relation with femininity and self-esteem, and positive relation with conjugal problems.
   In the case of the male orgasmic disorder, we found a relation with five variables negative relation with femininity and self-esteem, and positive relation with child sexual traumatic experience, masturbation and conjugal problems.
   In the case of precocious ejaculation, we detected a relation with four variables, negative relation with masculinity, femininity and self-esteem, and positive relation with conjugal problems.
   The relations that became evident in every dysfunction showed that in this proportion, the discriminant variables provided us with an approximate explanation
   DISCUSSION
   The frequency of sexual dysfunctions can be described as high [he analysis of the results made evident that two factors are always present in these sexual dysfunctions " a tendency to show low self-esteem and the presence of conjugal problems Alongside the different dimensions of gender roles, there is a decrease of the masculinity features in the case of precocious ejaculation, the reduction of femininity features is found in the three dysfunctions under study There is a tendency to inhibition of both the sexual expressions and the affective expressions (femininity features), which are found combined in the case of precocious ejaculation, combined as well with a decrease of the masculinity features
   When it comes to the sexual background, we observed that the history of child sexual traumatic experience is a risk indicator for the orgasmic disorder, as well as the report of practicing masturbation during adolescence We can infer from this that this can be due to the type of masturbation limited to a biological discharge and not to the exploration addressed to a self-knowledge of the body Another indicator present only in the orgasmic disorder is the fear of sexuality.
   It can be observed that the sexual dysfunction that presents more indicators is the male orgasmic disorder For what we explained here, it becomes relevant to develop integral intervention Plans for the adequate exploration of indicators related to these dysfunctions

AB  - Background
   Understanding geographic inequalities in coverage of drinking-water supply and sanitation (WSS) will help track progress towards universal coverage of water and sanitation by identifying marginalized populations, thus helping to control a large number of infectious diseases. This paper uses household survey data to develop comprehensive maps of WSS coverage at high spatial resolution for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Analysis is extended to investigate geographic heterogeneity and relative geographic inequality within countries.
   Methods and Findings
   Cluster-level data on household reported use of improved drinking-water supply, sanitation, and open defecation were abstracted from 138 national surveys undertaken from 1991-2012 in 41 countries. Spatially explicit logistic regression models were developed and fitted within a Bayesian framework, and used to predict coverage at the second administrative level (admin2, e.g., district) across SSA for 2012. Results reveal substantial geographical inequalities in predicted use of water and sanitation that exceed urban-rural disparities. The average range in coverage seen between admin2 within countries was 55% for improved drinking water, 54% for use of improved sanitation, and 59% for dependence upon open defecation. There was also some evidence that countries with higher levels of inequality relative to coverage in use of an improved drinking-water source also experienced higher levels of inequality in use of improved sanitation (rural populations r = 0.47, p = 0.002; urban populations r = 0.39, p = 0.01). Results are limited by the quantity of WSS data available, which varies considerably by country, and by the reliability and utility of available indicators.
   Conclusions
   This study identifies important geographic inequalities in use of WSS previously hidden within national statistics, confirming the necessity for targeted policies and metrics that reach the most marginalized populations. The presented maps and analysis approach can provide a mechanism for monitoring future reductions in inequality within countries, reflecting priorities of the post-2015 development agenda.

   Editors' Summary
   Background
   Access to a safe drinking-water supply (a water source that is protected from contamination) and to adequate sanitation facilities (toilets, improved latrines, and other facilities that prevent people coming into contact with human urine and feces) is essential for good health. Unimproved drinking-water sources and sanitation are responsible for 85% of deaths from diarrhea and 1% of the global burden of disease. They also increase the transmission of parasitic worms and other neglected tropical diseases. In 2000, world leaders set a target of reducing the proportion of the global population without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation to half of the 1990 level by 2015 as part of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 ("Ensure environmental sustainability"; the MDGs are designed to improve the social, economic, and health conditions in the world's poorest countries). Between 1990 and 2010, more than 2 billion people gained access to improved drinking-water sources and 1.8 billion gained access to improved sanitation.
   In 2011, 89% of the world's population had access to an improved drinking-water supply, 1% above the MDG target, and 64% had access to improved sanitation (the MDG target is 75%).
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Despite these encouraging figures, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) estimates that, globally, 768 million people relied on unimproved drinking-water sources, 2.5 billion people did not use an improved sanitation facility, and more than 1 billion people (15% of the global population) were defecating in the open in 2011. The JMP estimates for 2011 also reveal national and sub-national inequalities in drinking-water supply and sanitation coverage but a better understanding of geographic inequalities is needed to track progress towards universal coverage of access to improved water and sanitation and to identify the populations that need the most help to achieve this goal. Here, the researchers use cross-sectional household survey data and modern statistical approaches to produce a comprehensive map of the coverage of improved drinking-water supply and improved sanitation at high spatial resolution for sub-Saharan Africa and to investigate geographic inequalities in coverage. Cross-sectional household surveys collect health and other information from households at a single time-point, including data on use of safe water and improved sanitation.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers extracted data on reported household use of an improved drinking-water supply (for example, a piped water supply), improved sanitation facilities (for example, a flushing toilet), and open defecation from 138 national household surveys undertaken between 1991 and 2012 in 41 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They developed statistical models to fit these data and used the models to estimate coverage at the district (second administrative) level across sub-Saharan Africa for 2012. For ten countries, the estimated coverage of access to improved drinking water at the district level within individual countries ranged from less than 25% to more than 75%. Within-country ranges of a similar magnitude were estimated for coverage of access to improved sanitation (21 countries) and for open defecation (16 countries). Notably, rural households in the districts with the lowest coverage of access to improved water supply and sanitation within a country were 1.5-8 times less likely to access improved drinking water, 2-18 times less likely to access improved sanitation, and 2-80 times more likely to defecate in the open than rural households in districts with the best coverage. Finally, countries with high levels of inequality in improved drinking-water source coverage also experienced high levels of inequality in improved sanitation coverage.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings identify important geographic inequalities in the coverage of access to improved water sources and sanitation that were previously hidden within national statistics. The accuracy of these findings depends on the accuracy of the data on water supplies and sanitation provided by household surveys, on the researchers' definitions for improved water supplies and sanitation, and on their statistical methods. Nevertheless, these findings confirm that, to achieve universal coverage of access to improved drinking-water sources and sanitation, strategies that target the areas with the lowest coverage are essential.
   Moreover, the maps and the analytical approach presented here provide the means for monitoring future reductions in inequalities in the coverage of access to improved water sources and sanitation and thus reflect a major priority of the post-2015 development agenda.

AB  - Accelerators are still an emerging tool pointed to speed up the birth and growth of innovative start-ups.
   The Seed Accelerator programs (SAPs) usually provide entrepreneurs with accommodation, mentoring and training during a short period of three to six months, and are believed to be useful for a more effective launch of start-ups. Due to their emergent nature, the impact and expectations of Seed Accelerators remains largely unknown. Most of them were established after 2010 and their track record is still insufficient to define trajectories and draw definitive conclusions. Notwithstanding, finding evidence on the accelerators impact and benefits at the economic, social and territorial levels, is a topic of undisputed attention.
   The few studies conducted on the subject so far, suggest a straightforward and positive impact over the hosted firms but only in the elite accelerators.
   The Seed Accelerator (SA) phenomenon is awaking interest amongst a broader number of social entrepreneurs and innovative start-ups developing projects with social impact, which can be hosted in social-driven accelerators, a format rapidly growing in Spain since the emergence in 2011 of SocialNest. The mounting range of innovations with social content is opening up new business opportunities for social technological start-ups, defined as new ventures that develop and deploy technology-driven solutions to address social needs in a financially sustainable manner.
   The main purpose of this study is to approximately assess, for the first time, the Seed Accelerators capacity to make a social contribution in terms of employment generated by the new ventures participating in the acceleration programs. The originality lies in being pioneer in identifying the factors underlying a higher impact of these initiatives in terms of employment and other key performance indicators. This objective will be empirically fulfilled through a sample of Seed Accelerators, assembled from an online Global Seed Accelerator survey with data on SAs and the accelerated companies that have participated in Accelerator Programs. Three samples are finally built: the global sample with 116 SAs, a second sample including only the 63 SAs with at least one round of investment over 1milion $, and a third sample comprising only the 33 SAs having managed to "exit" one company for at least 1milion $.
   The model of analysis is based on the Business Incubators literature due to the newness of the SAPs with practically no previous studies having assessed these initiatives yet. The dependent variable is the Average number of employees per company. The model contains 12 independent variables, most of them indicators of performance of the Seed Accelerator programs, leading to four hypotheses to be tested.
   - Hypothesis 1 expects the SAs located in the USA to excel in the main performance indicators.
   - Hypothesis 2 expects better prospects on the SAs hosting start-ups in a more advanced development stage and accounting for a larger number of employees per company.
   - Hypothesis 3 expects the SAs with at least one company receiving investment above 1milion $ to be able to create more employment and reach better performance indicators.
   - The bivariate statistical analysis is the method selected to test these three hypotheses.
   - Hypothesis 4 will unveil the variables more significant for the creation of employment in the start-ups participating in SAs programs.
   A GLM Gamma model has been built in order to test this last hypothesis, giving rise to two significant variables: the rounds of investment and the amount of investment per company. Consequently, and in accordance to our results, the SAs better positioned in these two investment-led variables, are the ones displaying a larger capacity to generate employment and attaining a broader social impact.
   The study uncovers the key factors underlying the generation of employment by the start-ups hosted in SA programs, hence becoming helpful to those institutions and agents, public and private, promoting supportive programs to the emergence of innovative new ventures. As anticipated by Hypothesis 1, the SAs located in the USA effectively outperform the others in most indicators and their participated start-ups tend to create more employment. Moving to Hypothesis 2, the leading SAs in terms of employment per company are the ones hosting a larger number of companies and enjoying better performance ratios. However, the generation of employment in the SAs with at least one company receiving investment above 1milion $ is not bigger than in the rest, a finding leading to reject Hypothesis 3.
   These findings raise several conclusions and implications for management. First, investors effectively play an outstanding role in the success of both the SAs programs and the accelerated start-ups. Therefore, in order to increase the impact of SAs in terms of generation of employment, the SAs promoters should be especially proactive in the attraction of investors, mainly Venture capitalists and invite them to close investment rounds in the hosted start-ups. Our study reveals the SAs with the highest social impact, measured in terms of new employment, are those having succeeded in closing rounds of investment and consequently, reaching a higher amount of investment per company.
   As expected, the SAs located in the USA and those hosting a larger number of start-ups, also outperform the others in terms of employment. This advantageous position exhibited by the USA Accelerators most likely obeys to their longer experience and the broader support received from investors. In order to become attractive to entrepreneurs and increase their social impact, the promoters of Seed Accelerators in Spain should weave stronger ties with agents endowed with investment capacity, including family offices, ventures capitalists, large corporations or successful entrepreneurs. Otherwise, the advantages a SA can offer to the tenant firms and their potential impact over the territory get diluted.
   The findings also open the door to new proposals for the policy makers.
   - First, an effective selection system of projects and entrepreneurs is a first condition worth bearing in mind, not always met by the existing SAs in Spain.
   - Second, it seems beneficial at the social level to promote SAs specialized in specific sectors and industries, sponsored and supported by large corporations from the region. This would result in new start-ups created more attached to the territory and ready to attain higher levels of employment generation and social impact.
   - Third, in order to attract more start-ups and upgrade their chances to survive and grow, the high education offer should be flexible and rapidly adapt to the changing needs in skills and abilities by the top technological sectors.
   - Finally, the ability to attract and retain in the territory a sufficient number of investors, mainly Business Angels and Venture capitalists, is essential to the emergence of new SAs and to maintain the existing ones.
   Insofar limitations of the study, the relatively small size of the sample has prevented the application of more advanced statistical techniques.
   Finally, a methodological limitation, difficult to overcome, lies in how to gauge the actual role played by the Accelerators in the success of participating firms. This role at the early stages is clearly crucial but the question of whether these start-ups would have been equally successful without SA intervention remains unresolved. Undoubtedly, further research is needed to address the following question: What proportion of start-ups might not have prospered without the aid of an accelerator?
   For future research, we plan to build a broad sample of start-ups in Spain, making the distinction between those participating in SAs programs and the rest. The purpose would lie in finding out the specific advantages of SAs and their effectiveness in generating start-ups able to create new and highly qualified employment.

AB  - In relation to individual differences in the habitual duration of sleep, a distinction can be established between subjects having a short sleep pattern (6 hours or less of sleep per night), subjects with an intermediate sleep pattern (between 7 and 8 hours of sleep), and subjects with a long sleep pattern (more than 9 hours of sleep). The reason for these individual differences in sleep duration is unknown.
   Diverse studies have been carried out in an attempt to understand if psychological or physiological differences exist in people with distinct sleep patterns. Recently, it has been demonstrated that sleeping less and, paradoxically, sleeping more than the sleep quantity associated with the intermediate sleep pattern (7-8 hours) has a negative impact on physical health.
   On the contrary, studies about possible psychological differences between different sleep patterns are almost nonexistent. Some studies that analyze variables regarding vigilance suggest that subjects with a long sleep pattern have a poorer performance in tests of vigilance than subjects who have a short sleep pattern. In turn, subjects with short sleep pattern appear to have more academic efficiency problems and appear to show a more depressed mood state than the subjects belonging to the other sleep pattern groups.
   One aspect that has been scarcely analyzed, with the exception of the classic works by Hartmann and Hicks in the 1970's, is if sleep patterns differ according to personality characteristics. The dimensions of personality which have received more attention have been extraversion and neuroticism, and none of the majority of studies has observed any significative differences in function of sleep patterns. Nevertheless, in the case of neuroticism, results are contradictory and there exist also reports that observe differences in sleep pattern function. It is important to emphasize that in these studies the quantity of sleep was not considered along with other essential aspects of sleep such as quality. Perhaps this aspect could explain a part of the inconsistent findings in the literature.
   On the other hand, psychoticism, which along with extraversion and neuroticism constitutes the third big dimension of the known tripartite model of personality, has been the least investigated personality dimension. Again, no work exists which analyzes the relations between the pattern of sleep and the dimension of personality of cognitive limits more recently proposed by Hartmann.
   The present study is a part of a wider investigation, the objective of which is to analyze the relations between the subjective quantity and quality of sleep and psychological variables in healthy individuals. This paper is centered on the influence of the pattern of sleep (short, intermediate, and long), the subjective quality of sleep (high, medium, or low) and the possible interaction between both factors in the personality dimensions of neuroticism, psychoticism, and cognitive limits.
   The sample was composed of 125 healthy students (110 women and 15 males) with ages ranging from 18 to 26 years old. The participants were selected according to their responses to a sleep questionnaire created for this purpose, which explored the habits of sleep, the state of medical health, past and present psychological condition, and possible use of medication. All the subjects selected showed good medical and psychological health, they did not use any type of meditation, nor did they belong to an), extreme morning or evening type of circadian rhythm. Each subject had a regular bedtime hour between 11:30 p.m. and 2:30 a.m. and waking hour between 7:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.
   The subjects selected were divided into three groups in accordance with the number of hours they habitually slept in order to feel good during the day: 1. subjects with short sleep pattern (n=20), 2. subjects with intermediate sleep pattern (n=82) and finally, 3. subjects with long sleep pattern (n=23).
   Additionally, other three groups were established within each of the sleep patterns considering if the quality of sleep was high, medium, or low. In short sleep pattern group the quality of sleep reported as high, medium, and low was 25%, 40%, and 35%, respectively. These percentages were 42.68%, 43.9%, and 13.41% in the group with an intermediate sleep pattern; and 30.43%, 52.17%, and 17.39% in the group with a long sleep pattern.
   The personality dimensions of neuroticism and psychoticism were evaluated with The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-A). The cognitive boundaries were evaluated with The Boundary Questionnaire (BQ). In addition, subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (which have not been taken into consideration here). The criteria of exclusion were a score higher than 18 on the BDI or the BAI and a score higher than 70 on the dimensions of neuroticism and psychoticism. These last exclusions were established to make assure the subjects were free of psychological dysfunction.
   Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to assess the effects of the quantity of sleep (short, intermediate, or long sleep pattern), and the subjective quality of sleep (high, medium, or low) and the possible interaction between both factors in the case of each variable. The Levene test was used to examine variance homogeneity. Likewise, the Scheffe Test (for equal variances) and the Tamhane Test (for unequal variances) were used as post hoc contrast statistics.
   The results showed the dimension of neuroticism was influenced by subjective sleep quality, but not by habitual sleep duration. Subjects with a poor subjective sleep quality scored higher on neuroticism (15.14) than those who had a medium (13.23) or good (9,96) sleep quality. Contrarily, the personality dimension of psychoticism was influenced by sleep quantity, but not quality. Subjects with a low sleep pattern scored slightly higher in psychoticism (2.57) than those with intermediate (1.52) or short (1.25) sleep patterns. The dimension. of cognitive boundaries was not related with any of these aspects. There was not any significant interaction between sleep quantity and sleep quality for the analyzed variables. This result highlights the need to evaluate sleep quantity as well as sleep quality, treating them as two relatively independent measures that provide complementary information.
   The highest scores of neuroticism of the group with the worse quality of sleep are consistent with recent reports showing that being worried or anxious disturbs the normal appearance of slow wave sleep (phases 3 and 4). The expression of this sleep phase is psychologically linked with sleep quality. On the other hand, it may be the case that the highest scores in psychoticism obtained by the subjects with long sleep pattern relate with the extra quantity of REM they obtain by sleeping a greater number of hours. This-phase of sleep has been associated with mood regulation and psychological balance. In polysomnographic studies, subjects with long sleep pattern are characterized as having a greater quantity of phase 1, 2, and REM sleep and less quantities of slow wave sleep than the other sleep patterns.
   However, the present data are correlational and not casual. Thus, the mechanisms which could be influencing in the observed relationships are unknown. Similarly, it is unclear how sleep pattern differences might translate into psychological or biological changes which may affect personality, mood, or health. Future longitudinal research, including objective sleep measurements in healthy subjects, as well as in subjects with sleep disorders of different degrees, may contribute to the clarification of these mechanisms. In any case, sleep seems to be an excellent indicator of several psychological characteristics and so the consequences associated with models which deviate from the intermediate sleep pattern deserve to be taken seriously. It is also important to develop preventive and educational initiatives to optimize our sleeping habits.

TI  - BASIC TRAITS OF CLINICAL HUMAN STRUCTURAL PSYCHOTHERAPY
T2  - DYNAMISCHE PSYCHIATRIE
LA  - German
AB  - In the introduction to the present paper the authors describe the development of the Berlin School of Dynamic Psychiatry, also defined as Human Structurology, in the last 25 years following Ammon's classical psychiatric and psychoanalytic training in Germany and the USA. This development was prompted by the insufficiency of traditional therapeutic thinking and practice, when confronted with severe borderline, psychotic, psychosomatic and obsessive-compulsive illness.
   The treatment of such patients calls for a deep change of approach, whose various facets can be summed up as a change of paradigm. It involves a new approach to science, to man and to illness, implicitly also to oneself and to society; further, a new conception of health and disease, of body, mind and spirit. Science is subordinated, in this conception, to the human being in all his dimensions, rendering dynamic psychiatry a true science of man.
   In its understanding of severe psychiatric disorders, as for example the psychoses, dynamic psychiatry follows a path opposed to the dogmatic belief defining them as unintelligible and untreatable. In this context, the therapeutic significance of the new paradigm is a consequence of Ammon's therapeutic optimism. >>Only he can heal, who believes in healing..<< The fundamental principle of human structural science is its own image of man. Man is, in this concept, a multidimensional being with healthy as well as pathological aspects, whereas the healthy elements are relevant for therapeutic work. Man is a being living in groups, whose dynamics condition the development of his personality. At the same time, he is, in Ammon's words, >>an individual being striving for identity, self realization and a sense of his existence.<< Accordingly, illness is defined as a loss of the homeostasis of body, mind and spirit, a restriction of multidimensionality and a development arrest.
   In the concept of dynamic psychiatry, identity is a group-related process dependent on social energy and involving continuous development during the whole life. Social energy replaces the Freudian libido concept. It is the energy inherent in human contacts and relationships. Social energetic exchange plays the main role in building up and structuring personality. Thus, personality structure can be visualized as manifested social energy.
   The human structural model described by the authors is based on their conception of identity and the image of man. Human structure contains the areas of primary (meaning organic), central (meaning mainly unconscious) and secondary human functions (meaning functions of behaviour). These three areas are synergistically and dynamically interconnected and related to surrounding groups, whose internalized dynamics in early childhood make up the major part of the unconscious. The spectrum of interaction of single human functions ranges from regulated and integrated to poorly regulated and desintegrated functions. According to Ammon's spectral theory, not only the three human structural areas, but also their constructive, destructive and deficient aspects are understood as lying on a continuum.
   A large part of the paper is consecrated to the conceptualization of illness within the framework of Human Structurology. Illness is structurally understood as a temporary loss of homeostasis and desintegration of personality functions, but at the same time it makes demands on the whole personality which cannot cope with its deficiently developed parts (>>holes in the Ego<<, in Ammon's words). Consequently, symptoms have the meaning of filling such deficits, in order to avoid a breakdown of the whole personality. Thus, the aim of treatment consists not in symptom alleviation, but rather in enabling the patient to develop his human structure by transforming destructive and deficient into constructive aspects. This therapeutic process must take place primarily in the nonconscious core of the personality. Clinical experience shows that symptom reduction occurs as a consequence of structural development. The ultimate goal of treatment is directed toward identity development, improving the contact ability of the patient. >>Identity therapy must reach man's inner core.<< This is achieved by constructive social energetic exchange processes within the groups, and this fact entails a definite therapeutic conception. Dynamic psychiatric therapy offers the patient, with his desintegrated personality, the possibility of taking up contact to his own non-conscious needs, to other people and to his surroundings.
   In the dynamic psychiatric hospital Menterschwaige, this therapeutic conception is realized by the multidimensional verbal and non-verbal methods integrated into a milieu therapeutic and social energetic field involving the whole hospital. The therapeutic program is individually planned for each patient and involves individual and group therapy, milieu therapeutic work on various projects, as well as dance therapy, music therapy, theatre and art therapy, riding and sport therapy. The single therapy forms are integrated on the level of control groups of the therapeutic team and of the plenary group of the whole hospital.
   In a short historical review, the authors show that psychotherapeutic treatment of severe ego disturbances, like the psychoses, cannot be achieved by individual therapy alone. Rather, it makes basic therapy in groups necessary, using the tod of group dynamics. In the therapeutic of the hospital, each patient has several therapists and is part of several groups. . The authors describe in detail the analytical group therapy and the milieu groups in their theoretical and practical aspects as a temporary therapeutic life community. The specific caracteristics of the non-verbal therapy forms are also described by the authors, for instance the enacting of the patient's own pathology in the theatre therapy, the importance of body language in dance therapy and the group dynamic polyphonic work in music therapy. However, non-verbal therapy is always connected with, and must lead towards, verbal expression of the patient; the integrating function of verbalisation is thereby emphasized.
   Fundamental for the whole therapy is the work with the healthy parts of the personality, while working through deficient and destructive human functions. Dynamic psychiatric treatment is centered around working through of the destructive aggression. Further therapeutic instruments are the systematic use of the mirror function within the groups and the social work with the family of the patient during the whole time of therapy. Exemplarily, the problem of paranoic patients is discussed, stressing the importance of the resistance triangle of aggression, paranoia and pathological narcissism, as described by Ammon in earlier works. Above all, therapy is understood as a process involving the whole person, based on the implicit image of man in his inherent capacity of further development. In this context, the authors emphasize that the therapist must be experienced by the patient in his true human wholeness as a partner in his relationship to the patient.
   The following chapter of the paper deals with the human structural diagnosing process, also based on holistic understanding. It involves not only psychiatric, but also psychogenetic, group dynamic and human strucutral assessment of the personality, completed by a number of standardized psychological tests, among which Ammon's Ego Structure Test (ISTA) is described in detail. Further diagnostic means include the Autokinetic Light Test (AKL), as well as sociometric and group-diagnostical investigations and electroencephalographic sleep registrations. The complexity of diagnostic results is integrated in the case conferences which allow a global understanding of the specific personality structure of the patient, his development and the planning of adequate therapy. Diagnostic work runs parallel to the therapeutic process and implies a continuous feedback of information, serving as an indicator of the treatment efficiency.
   The authors present the human structural model of personality assessment, as a hypothetical construction allowing an insight in the non conscious human structure by means of behavioural and experiencial secondary functions. This theoretical model constitutes the basis of efficiency investigations in the dynamic psychiatric hospital. The authors describe a shortcut of the results obtained in the course of efficiency investigations. These show a significant increase of healthy personality functions, expressed on the behavioral level, an increase in the capacity of tying relationships, in working and learning ability,and an improved contact to oneself and the environment. At the same time a decrease of deficient and destructive personality functions becomes evident. The paramount therapeutic importance of the work on destructive aggression is again emphasized.
   An extension of the efficiency research is provided by the catamnestic investigations of the Munich Catamnestic Project, whose first results are presented by the authors. The results confirm the importance of outpatient treatment after leaving the hospital.

AB  - The site of Aiguebelette-le-Lac / Beau-Phare is one of two final Neolithic settlement sites on Lake Aiguebelette. It is located in the southern part of the lake, on an extension of the shore platform, which forms a small peninsula to the north of Lepin Castel. Situated in shallow water (between 0.5 and 2 m in depth), the site was first identified in 1863 and was a focus for artefact collecting until the beginning of the 20th century. Following the inclusion of the site on the Unesco list of World Heritage Sites in 2011, Y. Billaud undertook the direction of a monitoring project, which included a condition assessment and bibliographic survey of the site conducted in 2016. A review of data produced by R. Laurent (1971) and A. Marguet (1983 and 1998), coupled with a short fieldwork campaign, significantly advanced our knowledge of the site. The extent of the site was established and an entrance path, which traversed three palisades, was identified and mapped. An area of 100 m(2) at the centre of the site was surveyed, bringing the total area recorded to 230 m(2).
   As part of the continuing exploration of the site, an underwater survey was carried out in 2018. The aim of this campaign was to plot the surviving timber piles in order to obtain an overview of the layout of the village. Prior to the recording of the piles, a 3600 m(2) grid was laid out. Depending on the area of the site and the density of piles, each 10x10 m square was subdivided into four intermediate units, each measuring 25 m(2). Some 1401 piles were plotted within an area 2600 m(2), which brings the number of recorded piles to 1670 out of a total of about 3000 for the entire site. The survey report throws considerable new light on the layout of the site. The gently curving access trackway crosses the village and extends as far as the northern extremity of the peninsula. It is formed by two parallel rows of piles, positioned some 1.6 to 2 m apart. The line of the path has been traced over a distance of about 90 m. Located to the east of the central axis of the peninsula, the trackway slopes gently upwards (0.7%) as far as the inner palisade before rising more steeply at the entrance to the village. It is formed of almost 290 piles, which are predominantly small in diameter and protrude only slightly above the sediments. The most evident entrance to the village is located on the axis of this trackway. It is formed of two rows of contiguous piles, which form a narrow bottleneck measuring less than 1 m in width. Some dendrochronological dates suggest it was built with trees felled in -2672.
   At least three palisades have been identified, representing several phases of building and re-building. The outer palisade forms the first enclosing element, which would have been encountered by approaching the site from the south. On the western side of the trackway, a single line of posts can be observed while to the east three roughly parallel lines are visible. The middle palisade features a marked dissymmetry between the sections to the east and west of the trackway. On the western side, it is composed of 24 piles spread out over a length of about 25 m. To the east of the trackway, its morphology is similar over a length of about 7 m: it is composed of densely spaced piles, which are medium size and very eroded. The line of the inner palisade is difficult to discern apart from an initial section at the east and a second section corresponding to the topographical "centre" the 1998 survey. Four piles belong to trees felled in -2684. The two segments of this palisade are typologically similar to the middle palisade: they are composed of piles of various dimensions, but always quite small, which are positioned very close together (less than about 0,5 m apart). The easternmost section is interesting because it does not form a straight line but instead but appears to form a dog-leg to the south-west where we observe five aligned piles. At this point, the gap in the palisade resembles an entrance and is precisely located in the continuity of a south-west/north-east orientated circulation area.
   The layout of the village is very regular with most buildings orientated perpendicularly to the axis of the pathway, particularly in the eastern sector. To the west of the access path, we can distinguish four buildings. The westernmost of these is perhaps the most easily identifiable; the small building, measuring 4 m by 6 m and orientated east/west, is composed of relatively large piles. The roof and foundation piles, intended to support the roof ridge and sill beams, are generally over 12 cm in diameter and, based on field observations and the heights of the surviving cones, appear to be of hard wood. Located a short distance to the north-east, we observe a second similar building. Also orientated east/west, this small building (4 x 7 m) is formed of three rows of posts; it too is supported on relatively large piles.
   An enigmatic building lies in the southern part of the village, between the inner and middle palisades. Measuring about 5 by 8 m, it is directly adjacent to the pathway and the three rows of posts that delimit it are orientated north/south. The posts located at the extremities of the three rows are paired and have a diameter of more than 14 cm. The small number of piles to support the sill beams, and the absence of posts to support the cross-pieces, suggest that this building lacked a raised floor, or indeed any type of floor, and may have been open-sided. Its dimensions, its location adjacent to the pathway and its architecture do not suggest a domestic structure. While its exact function remains unknown, we could hypothesise that it acted as an area for the storage and drying of timber, or perhaps as a workshop or warehouse. The largest building in the western sector is located at the centre of the site, facing the entrance within a space marked by a very high concentration of piles. Measuring about 5 by 10 m, this building is formed of three north-south orientated rows of piles. The eastern and western rows are formed of six groups of posts that delimit five bays. The posts are generally quite substantial (between 17 and 20 cm) and are of hardwood with very well-preserved erosion cones. At the centre of the structure, the row of posts intended to support the roof ridge is clearly identifiable, particularly in the southern part of the building where they are arranged in pairs.
   In contrast to the central building, the roof ridges of the other buildings in the sector are orientated perpendicular to the axis of the pathway. The buildings are thus arranged adjacent to each other with their long sides orientated east-west thereby reducing their exposure to the prevailing wind which blows down the Epine Mountain. Nine rows of piles, positioned 1.5 to 2.5 m apart, are visible and their high density probably reflects the permanence of occupation at this spot, with considerable evidence for repairs and extensions. The architectural reconstruction of these buildings is somewhat trickier. The traditional widespread model of buildings composed of three rows of weight-bearing posts would allow us to envisage three buildings measuring about 4 by 12 m.
   For the first time in Savoie and Haute Savoie, we have been able to obtain the partial plan of a lakeside village dating to the third millennium BCE. The extensive topographical survey covering an area of 2500 m(2) has yielded concrete evidence regarding the organization of the village and the structuring of its principal constituent planimetric elements. The unique and rich nature of the site stems from its probable short duration, which allows us to identify the general layout of the habitation areas and storage areas.

AB  - In this article, the discovery in terms of sexual maturity (bulugh), which is considered necessary for liability in Islamic law, and the concept of majority (rushd), which are mostly in the field of financial law, are examined and considerations regarding the relationship between them are included. As a result of the doctrine review regarding these two concepts and related provisions, it is seen that the views on the subject are not closed to interpretation and are suitable for re-evaluation with current data. Human behavior has spread over a wide field. As it will not be possible to address all of these behaviors in one article, our study is limited to criminal law. In the article, after surveying the classical opinions about criminal capacity and the data revealed by positive sciences such as the endocrinology, development psychology, clinical psychology, juristic psychology the idea of sexual maturity and contentment in criminal law was questioned; it is presented that it is possible to produce a concept in the form of criminal majority and an on the content. In the study, both the legal approach of determining the age for criminal capacity and preventing criminal investigation to the individual before this age and the approach to leave the determination of criminal responsibility to the judge were used. In studies on the development stages and characteristics that we use, the development of sexual average is identified as about 14 for particular of Turkey. It starts to become stable after completed the age of 14 with spiritual disorder. Skills such as managing behavior and acting independently are observed in later stages of development due to the latest maturation of the frontal lobe, which is the executive center of the brain. In our paper, in the light of these information the issues of criminal capacity and remission were handled.
   This paper comprises an assesment of relationship between the terms bulugh (puberty), demanded for religious and legal responsibility in Islamic law and rushd, mostly appearing in financial law by examining each term and highlighting their meanings. As a result of the doctrine review regarding these two concepts and related provisions it is concluded that judgemenets in relation to the terms are open to interpretation and re-evaluation in consideration of current data. Yet, different perspectives from fiqh and kalama re available. Within the framework of fiqh bulugh means sexual maturity and qualifies a person for responsibility. Whereas form a kelamic point of view an intellectual maturity is accredited. Given an example, Sharif Jurjani asserted that the contracting level of an individual would change in accord with each single subject of mind. This approach could provide a basis for the idea of assigning particular responsibility/liability criteria for particular human action. Narratives on Surah Nisa's sixth verse and its revelation were effective in restricting the meaning of the term rushd to "being able to master property" whereas its semantic fieald is wide enough to encompass the meaning "the ability of conducting properly in every situation or life aspect". Scholars of the classical era were adopting the idea that bulugh and rushd would occur concurrently. The codification movement getting under way in the nineteenth century points to an alteration in the notion and to a general acceptance of revoking sexual maturity as essential for rushd. Ahwal ash-Shahsjja and Duraru'l Hukkam shows some examples of this alteration. An approach to rushd like the fuqhaha's, expecting it after a physical substructure is felicitous, but confining the term to a fiscal space imlies 'not to accept a person as an adult' which in our opinion does not corralate with reality. Yet, indicators of bulugh accepted by scholars like the first menstruation, wet dream, pubic hair are affected by many factors such as genetic or environmental factors, nutritional habits, drugs, visiual and audical stimulants etc. Moreover, they indicate signs for the onset of an intellectual development rather then an intellectual developmental completion. Thus, presenting such symptoms as an unvarying over time criteria and as standing for everyone in all religious-legal responsibility areas does not seem convincing.
   Over the course of transition to a modern society, fundemantal changes taking place in our individual and social lives have altered the intellectual framework of some notions in our minds. The perception of childhood and minor- adult discrimination have taken their share as well. Since notions have been experiencing such a significant transition, it is crucial to reevaluate issues related to them. Grounding responsibility on sexual responsibility in all extensions may not bring problems in societies where sexual maturation promotes intellectual-behavioral maturity, and are not open to undergo any chang. But it is a fact that due to various reasons such as the extention of compulsory education to eighteen, parenting styles, social security and inernational protocols etc. Individuls exhibit a delayed maturation in our current world. Thus, it is inevitable to consider an intellectual and psycho-social maturity accompanied by sexual maturity for responsibility. We suggest here to set out some criteria, taken into consideration concurrently with sexual maturity, for liability in marriage, commercial and penal law etc. This study just examines criminal capacity because an addressing of all criteria related to these areas would go beyond the limits of this paper.
   The mental maturation present in the person is also reflected in person's actions. In that case, we need to do in the first step is to examine whether individuals who are called teenager who have reached carnal maturity behave with "full knowledge and willpower". The average age of puberty in Turkey's conditions are identified as 14. Respectively, the incidence in other ages is 15, 13, 16 and 12 years. Since the occurrence of puberty at an earlier or later age is quite low / exceptional, we have analysed the behavior of individuals between the ages of 12-16 and the factors affecting will in these behaviors. These effects may be based on such as cognitive, hormonal, neural and cerebral elements or environmental and socializing situations. In our opinion, it is preferable to set a final age limit for criminal liability to be investigated and to present some indications that indicate responsibility for individuals before this age and leave discretion to the judge. Accordingly, it is possible to determine the final age in which the criminal responsibility will be investigated as 14 age. Because in those who complete this age, cognitive development almost reaches the level of an adult, emotional distress begins to stagnate, the person accepts the physical and spiritual change and goes into adaptation. For individuals who have completed the age of 14 will not be obliged to carry out additional research for the determination of criminal liability-unless there are strong symptoms for the contrary situation. However, if it is determined that the management center of the brain has not reached sufficient maturity in terms of control and since it is the last maturing department, it can be considered as a reason for the alleviation of punishment if it is determined that these characteristics of individuals after 14 years of age have a direct effect in the crime committed. The two most important issues that will guide us for the existence of a criminal capasity in those who have not completed the age of 14 are "to gain the ability of abstract thinking" and "to fully understand that their action is a crime and not accepted by the society".
   It will be suitable to give compensation penalties instead of the punishments applied on the body such as hadd and qisas, If the penal majority is fixed without realizing puberty. Because physical strength is also taken into consideration in Islamic law. There is no obstacle for these people to receive the necessary punishment for crimes requiring financial penalties. Because financial punishment is based on the financial asset (zimmah) of the person and not the realization of the puberty. If puberty exists, but criminal majority does not exist, this situation should be considered as suspicion and punishments applied on the body should be turned into compensation. However, this does not prevent the judge from applying measures (ta'zir).

AB  - Cities are social and economic drivers of the regions in which they are located. They are also dynamic and complex realities facing the need to successfully address and manage the main challenges that condition their competitiveness. Therefore, cities need to adopt a long-term management perspective and establish the premises on which to base their future. They must seize the opportunities and neutralize the threats to be found locally. In this regard, they have to use their resources to develop a value offer that is attractive in the long term and which provides their target audiences with added benefits over other cities.
   In this context, Strategic Management of cities has emerged in recent literature as one of the key aspects that determines which urban centres are more competitive. Furthermore, the relevance of the role of local governments as the ones primarily responsible for that management and the background that may foster the development of urban Strategic Management is being analysed in increasingly greater detail. As regards the background, there are several authors who point to TQM as one of the key aspects to be taken into account.
   TQM is a global management system whose adoption steers organisations towards a quality awareness and culture among all the people involved and in all the processes and it seeks the efficient long-term satisfaction of the different stakeholders. Therefore, customer orientation, continuous improvement and team work become its core principles. It is necessary to build on the strengths and opportunities in the long term, along with remedying weaknesses and threats in order to adopt and develop those principles. Thus, organisations can bring to the customer value on an ongoing basis and improve their competitive position. Therefore, TQM requires both internal and external significant information to be gathered and analysed.
   Urban Strategic Management, in turn, involves the formulation and implementation of strategies or actions that allow the city to reach its long-term goals by providing added value to its relevant stakeholders. Moreover, modern Strategic Management has to adopt an integrative approach that combines rationality and emergency. That is, some degree of systematization and formalization to achieve adequate levels of efficiency (rationality) and adaptability and flexibility to cope with changes in the environment (emergency). This process requires gathering and analysing relevant information for decision-making to match the internal resources and capacities of the organisations with the opportunities and risks created by its external environment, so that they lead to a better organizational performance.
   In that light, we should consider the existence of affinity or complementarity between TQM and Strategic Management. In this regard, the Strategic Management that organisations implement at each moment may be reinforced by the adoption of TQM and, in turn, impetus to the development of Strategic Management may be given in organisations that achieve a significant implementation level in TQM. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the adoption of TQM in urban management has been the precursor of the development of Strategic Management.
   Additionally, the categorization and operationalization of the constitutive elements of TQM in the academic literature have been developed mainly through excellence models. Due to its acceptance as a good indicator of the application of TQM, its business and social appreciation and its development and use in our context, we have opted on focus on the EFQM Excellence Model, on its application to local government and on its contribution to the development of the integrative approach of urban Strategic Management.

   Therefore, by seeking to extract useful conclusions for the management of cities, this paper aims (1) to analyse the relation between the core principles of TQM and the integrative approach of Strategic Management in local governments and (2) to explore the application of TQM in a local government by means of the EFQM Excellence Model, and its task as the precursor of urban Strategic Management.
   Methodology
   Case study has been the research methodology used. This article considers the holistic research of a single case. Furthermore, due to the complexity, multidimensionality and quantity and diversity of stakeholders that cities face, we have narrowed down our analysis unit to the management authority of urban tourism in the city of San Sebastian (Spain).
   Tourism has a great cross-cutting economic impact on the development of other aspects of the urban economy. Tourism management authorities likewise operate with a municipal budget and have people answering to the local government as managers. Therefore, we consider that the management of the tourism management authority is an analysis unit that adequately reflects the management of the city overall.
   The suitability of San Sebastian stems from applying several theoretical sampling criteria and systems: a city with its own tourism management authority, which is small in size, which cannot offer a main tourism of sun and beach and whose management seems to be noted for its success. Furthermore, it is an extreme case and rich in information.
   Different methods were used for the information gathering process with a focus on triangulating data and their validity and reliability: 1) in-depth interviews with experts in the sphere of urban management, tourism and TQM in the public administration and local governments, along with the people in charge of managing tourism in different cities along the Bay of Biscay coast; 2) documentary evidence and 3) direct observation.
   Results and Conclusions
   The analysis allows us to conclude that customer orientation, teamwork and continuous improvement, being the three principles that lead to the successful adoption of TQM, can be adopted by local governments. However, it has to be taking into account the specific characteristics of this type of organisms.
   Additionally, these three principles are fully consistent with the development of urban Strategic Management from a modern and integrative perspective, encompassing aspects related to both formulation and implementation, and to the adoption of rational and emerging approaches in the process.
   Besides, the results of our empirical research lead us to conclude that the San Sebastian tourism management authority has introduced and established different mechanisms that facilitate the management of the five facilitators of the EFQM Excellence model: (1) leadership; (2) strategy; (3) people; (4) alliances & resources, and (5) processes, products & services. Thus, the selected case shows the viability of the adoption of TQM by means of the EFQM Excellence model in local government.
   However, it should be noted that two main problems inherent to the public character of the body selected were observed in the adoption and development of the EFQM Excellence model. On one hand, the mainstreaming of the "person" dimension due to the very characteristics of the public collective and, on the other hand, the fact that the majority of the main managerial posts of local authorities are eminently political. Political uncertainty hinders the long-term commitment needed for TQM to be adopted correctly. However, once known, both difficulties can be managed and overcome. Thus, in the case in question, as regards the "person" dimension, despite the difficulty of rewarding and modifying posts underscored by the authority, there are mechanisms to develop training, participation and internal communication, and great progress has been made in this respect. As far as the managers are concerned, we find that in the San Sebastian tourist sector (1) the tourism management authority has more than one leader and, therefore, not only political leaders and (2) tourism is not directly managed from the Mayor's Office, but rather there is a specific authority. Both aspects professionalise management by reducing the impact of political uncertainty and by fostering the adoption of TQM.
   As regards the modern Strategic Management, it is possible to say that its adoption in the tourist area of the analyzed city is a fact. The Strategic Management developed in San Sebastian Turismo-Donostia Turismoa covers aspects related to the formulation (mission, vision & values, objectives, strategic analysis and strategic plan) and the implementation (implementation and control), from both approaches: rational and emergent.
   Moreover, this study allows us to establish that there is a relationship between the urban Strategic Management from an integrative approach and the EFQM Excellence model in the local government analysed. Regarding the direction of this relationship, it is worth mentioning that it has been the adoption of the EFQM Excellence model the one that has generated mechanisms, knowledge and sufficient experience to have helped in the development of the modern Strategic Management both in its formulation and implementation phases and in its rational and emerging approaches. So the EFQM Excellence model could be considered as the precursor and facilitator of the development of the urban Strategic Management in San Sebastian.
   It can therefore be concluded that urban managers, concerned about the recognitions of their measures, often prioritise the development of TQM by means of excellence models and that these practices spur on modern urban Strategic Management and, therefore, contribute to making the city more competitive.

AB  - Introduction
   Since the 1990s, interest in housing policy and social environments has grown considerably in Europe, as reflected in the 2014 Green Book on Housing and numerous EU directives (Eurofound, 2014). This has led to the proliferation in Spanish cities of social housing projects aimed at families with low economic resources and special difficulties in accessing accommodation. Since the onset of the economic crisis in 2008, the suspension of new social housing construction and the halt in the growth of cities has given rise to a social and political debate on the design of this type of estate and its role in the social integration and quality of life of its residents (authors, 2016).
   In this context, the characteristics of neighborhoods have been shown to be important predictors of the physical and mental health of their tenants and other residents (Gapen et al., 2011). Furthermore, the design of social housing estates is key to residents' social integration and quality of life (Barnes et al., 2006). Well-designed and maintained (i.e., clean and well-lit) areas boost social inclusion, good citizenship and social cohesion, whereas poor-quality areas (noisy, dirty, with the presence of drugs) increase the likelihood of antisocial behavior (Vargas & Merino, 2012).
   One ofthe most widely used indicators of residential quality isattraction-to-neighborhood, which is considered one of the dimensions of social cohesion (Buckner, 1988). Attraction toward the neighborhood is related to people's enjoyment of the area in which they live, their intention to remain there and their attachment to it (Bonaiuto & Alves, 2012) and is strongly influenced by residents'perceptions of the area's possible social risks (Vargas & Merino, 2012) and their residential satisfaction (Bonaiuto et al., 1999; Bonaiuto et al., 2003; Debek & Janda-Debek, 2015; Feldman & Steptoe, 2004; Hofelmannet et al., 2013). Given the importance of investigating these relationships in the context of social housing, the objective of this study is to verify a structural equation model (path analysis) in which the perception of social risk (drugs, the environment and prostitution) and residential satisfaction (housing, the environment and green areas) predict attractionto-neighborhood among a sample of social housing tenants in the south of Spain.
   Research design and methods
   An ex post facto study was conducted on a single group using multiple measures (Montero& Leon, 2007). The study population was the total group of social housing tenants in the Spanish region of Andalusia. The final sample was composed of 404 participants (confidence level 95.5%, error margin 4.47%), distributed proportionately across the social dwellings in the estates registered in the Andalusian Housing and Rehabilitation Agency database. Of the total sample, 55.64% were women, and the average age of the participants was 46.47 years (SD = 15.36). Of the total, 92.31% of participants were married, and 46.40% were unemployed (without work and seeking for a job).
   Findings
   Preliminary analyses
   Since the data obtained from the study werebased on self-reported questionnaires gathered over the same period of time, the CMV associated with the method could have either over- or underestimated relationships between variables (Podsakoff et al., 2003; Podsakoff et al., 2012). Therefore, Harman's single-factor test was conducted to test the possible effects of the CMV in this study (Podsakoff et al., 2003). All items of residential satisfaction, perception of social risk, and attraction-to-neighbourhood were subjected to exploratory factor analysis using the method of principal components with varimax rotation and forcing the extraction of a single factor. If there had been a problem with the variance associated with the method, the factor extracted would have explained more than 50% of the variance of the factor. The results of the exploratory factor analysis yielded one factor that explained 22.76% of the total variance. Therefore, although the effects of common variance cannot be completely ruled out, it does not appear to significantly affect the relationship between variables.
   Descriptives and correlations
   Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) and the correlations of the variables studied as well as the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients of the scales. The correlation analyses revealed that all the dimensions of residential satisfaction except satisfaction with services were positively and significantly related (p < 0.01) with attraction-to-neighborhood: r = 0.31 with satisfaction with housing, r = 0.37 with satisfaction with appearance, and r = 0.15 with satisfaction with green areas. Further, perception of social risk had a significant negative correlation (p < 0.01) with attraction-to-neighborhood, with Pearson r values of -0.31 for drugs, -0.27 for environment, and -0.25 for prostitution.
   Analysis of the model
   To obtain an overall representation of the relationships amongperception of social risk, residential satisfaction, and attraction-to-neighborhood, we devised a model of relationships in whichdrugs, the environment and prostitution as social risks were exogenous predictor variables. Residential satisfaction (with housing, services, appearance, and green areas) was the endogenous and mediator variable, and attraction-to-neighborhood was the endogenous and result variable (Acock, 2013). Applying Hayes's (2013) recommendations to the study, it was found that three conditions needed to be met to verify the mediating role of residential satisfaction: (1) the significant relationship of perception of social risk to residential satisfaction must be demonstrated; (2) the relationship of residential satisfaction to attraction-to-neighborhood must be demonstrated; and (3) the significant relationship between perception of social risk and attraction-to-neighborhood must be reduced if the influence of residential satisfaction was limited. This model was validated empirically with a structural equation analysis using the path analysis method. Following Acock's (2013) recommendations, the analysis was undertaken in two phases: (1) the design of an over-identified model and (2) the redesign of the model based on the significant coefficients found in the previous step.
   Figure 3 shows the standardized coefficients, the levels of significance obtained from the structural equation model using the maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters, and the values of the explained variance (R2) of the variables relating to residential satisfaction and attraction-to-neighborhood. The path analysis showed that the adjustment of the final model was appropriate in terms of the reference values indicated by Hu and Bentler (1999). The chi-square value was not significant, X2(4) = 478, p = 0.31, and the CFI (Comparative Fit Index) and TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index) were above 0.95 (both at 0.99). The SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Square) value was 0.02 and the RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) coefficient was 0.02 [90% IC = 0.00 - 0.08], both below the recommended level of 0.08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
   In addition to drugs as a social risk variable, the environment and prostitution were significant (p < 0.01) and negative predictors of satisfaction with housing (beta= -0.26 and beta= -0.12, respectively) and satisfaction with appearance (beta= -0.26 and ss= -0.14, respectively). These two dimensions of the perception of social risk explained 10.12% of the variance in satisfaction with housing and 10.76% of the variance in satisfaction with the appearance of the area. Regarding attraction-to-neighborhood, drugs as a social risk, satisfaction with housing and satisfaction with the appearance of the area were found to be significant predictors (p < 0.01), with beta values of -0.28, 0.14 and 0.25, respectively. The final explained variance for attraction-to-neighborhood was 21.65%. Regarding the mediating role of residential satisfaction (Table 2), the influence of the environment and prostitution as a social risk on attraction-to-neighborhood was mediated by satisfaction with housing and satisfaction with appearance, with beta values of -0.10 (p < 0.01) for the environment as a risk (z = -4.74, p < 0.01) and -0.05 (p < 0.01) for prostitution as a risk (z = -2.86, p < 0.01). Finally, the perception of drugs as a social risk had a direct effect on attraction-to-neighborhood (beta= -.25, p < 0.01).
   Conclusions
   Emerging social and urban ordinance problems, segregated neighborhoods and urban conflict have made the study of social housing a growing concern among the member states of the European Union (Eurofound, 2014). The provision of housing to a group with socioeconomic problems is not enough to improve that group's social integration and participation. It is necessary to further study community, social, and urban development processes to make the most of social housing schemes as an opportunity for community integration and cohesion. In this context, residents' experiences and perceptions of their housing project environments seem to be important predictors not only of residential satisfaction but also of attraction-to-neighborhood. Consequently, the design of public areas and other urban development initiatives should encompass not only objective factors (e.g., population or traffic density, surface area of gardens) but also residents' perceptions toward their environment. The appearance of the neighborhood (e.g., maintenance, cleanness, lighting, quality of buildings) determines, to a great extent, the degree of attractiveness of the area. Another area of intervention in social housing estates is related to the perception of drugs (consumption and sale) as a social risk given their impact on attraction-to-neighborhood. This factor should be approached from a multidisciplinary perspective that ranges from socio-educative initiatives to prevent drug consumption among the most vulnerable residents (i.e., children and adolescents) to police action to prevent drug dealing.

AB  - Background Trachoma is the world's leading cause of infectious blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed the SAFE strategy in order to eliminate blindness due to trachoma by 2020 through surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement. While the S and A components have been widely implemented, evidence and specific targets are lacking for the F and E components, of which water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are critical elements. Data on the impact of WASH on trachoma are needed to support policy and program recommendations. Our objective was to systematically review the literature and conduct meta-analyses where possible to report the effects of WASH conditions on trachoma and identify research gaps.
   Methods and Findings We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, MedCarib, Lilacs, REPIDISCA, DESASTRES, and African Index Medicus databases through October 27, 2013 with no restrictions on language or year of publication. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported a measure of the effect of WASH on trachoma, either active disease indicated by observed signs of trachomatous inflammation or Chlamydia trachomatis infection diagnosed using PCR. We identified 86 studies that reported a measure of the effect of WASH on trachoma. To evaluate study quality, we developed a set of criteria derived from the GRADE methodology. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. If three or more studies reported measures of effect for a comparable WASH exposure and trachoma outcome, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. We conducted 15 meta-analyses for specific exposure-outcome pairs. Access to sanitation was associated with lower trachoma as measured by the presence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular or trachomatous inflammation-intense (TF/TI) (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.95) and C. trachomatis infection (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.78). Having a clean face was significantly associated with reduced odds of TF/TI (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.52), as were facial cleanliness indicators lack of ocular discharge (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.61) and lack of nasal discharge (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.72). Facial cleanliness indicators were also associated with reduced odds of C. trachomatis infection: lack of ocular discharge (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31-0.49) and lack of nasal discharge (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.76). Other hygiene factors found to be significantly associated with reduced TF/TI included face washing at least once daily (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57-0.96), face washing at least twice daily (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90), soap use (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.93), towel use (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.78), and daily bathing practices (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53-0.99). Living within 1 km of a water source was not found to be significantly associated with TF/TI or C. trachomatis infection, and the use of sanitation facilities was not found to be significantly associated with TF/TI.
   Conclusions We found strong evidence to support F and E components of the SAFE strategy. Though limitations included moderate to high heterogenity, low study quality, and the lack of standard definitions, these findings support the importance of WASH in trachoma elimination strategies and the need for the development of standardized approaches to measuring WASH in trachoma control programs.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary Editors' Summary Background Trachoma is a bacterial eye infection, which if left untreated may lead to irreversible blindness. Repeated infections over many years cause scarring on the eyelid, making the eyelashes turn inward. This causes pain and damage to the cornea at the front of the eye, which eventually leads to loss of vision. The disease is most common in rural areas in low-income countries, specifically sub-Saharan Africa. It spreads easily through contact with the discharge from an infected eye or nose, by hands, or by flies landing on the face. Women and children are more often affected than men. Trachoma is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness. A global alliance, led by The World Health Organization, is aiming to eliminate trachoma by 2020 by adopting the SAFE strategy. There are four components of this strategy. Two relate to treating the diseasesurgery and antibiotics. The other two components relate to long-term prevention by promoting facial cleanliness and environmental changes (for example improving access to water and sanitation or reducing the breeding grounds for flies).
   Why Was This Study Done? The SAFE approach has been very successful in reducing the number of people with trachoma from 84 million in 2003 to 21.4 million in 2012. However, it is widely recognized that efforts need to be scaled up to reach the 2020 goal. Furthermore, if current improvements are to be sustained, then more attention needs to be given to the F and E elements and effective prevention. This study aimed to identify the most effective ways to improve hygiene, sanitation, and access to water for better trachoma control, and to find better ways of monitoring progress. The overall goal was to summarize the evidence in order to devise strategic and cost-effective approaches to trachoma prevention.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers conducted a systematic review, which involved first identifying and then assessing the quality of all of the research published on this topic. They then carried out a statistical analysis of the combined data from these studies, with the aim of drawing more robust conclusions (a meta-analysis). The analysis involved 15 different water, sanitation, and hygiene exposures (either hardware or practices, as determined by what was available in the literature) to determine which had the biggest impact on reducing the levels of trachoma. Most of the data came from studies carried out in Africa. The findings suggested that 11 of these exposures made a significant difference to the risk of infection or clinical symptoms of the disease. Improving personal hygiene had the greatest impact. Effective measures included face washing once or twice a day, using soap, using a towel, and daily bathing. Similarly, access to a sanitation facility, rather than open ground, also had a positive impact. The researchers also analyzed the data relating to water access. However, the studies so far have not yet measured this in a way that addresses the issues relevant to trachoma infection. Most studies have looked at whether the distance from a water source has an impact (and it seems it does not), whereas it may be more important to assess whether people have access to clean water or to enough water to wash. Many of these analyses require additional research to further clarify the impact of individual water, sanitation, and hygiene exposure on disease.
   What Do These Findings Mean? Overall, the results support that notion that water, sanitation, and hygiene are important components of an integrated strategy to control trachoma. Based on the research available to date, the two most effective ways are face washing and having access to a household-level sanitation facility, typically a simple pit latrine. The findings also point to ways in which current policy could be improved. Firstly, public health guidance should be placing greater emphasis on keeping the face clean. Current advice tends to focus on washing with clean water, but use of soap appears more effective. There are also opportunities for organizations to collaborate in this area. For example, organizations focusing on the prevention of diarrhea in children, which promote handwashing, could at the same time campaign for face washing to reduce transmission of trachoma. The second policy area to target is access to good quality sanitation. Such policy initiatives need to be better resourced in countries where trachoma is a problem. For example, although sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest burden of trachoma, more than 50% of households there still do not have access to any sanitation facility. There were a number of limitations to this study, which may affect the strength of the conclusions. The researchers found that many studies on this topic were observational, meaning that they did not assess an intervention and employ a control group, thus they are of limited rigor for assessing the impact of a water, sanitation, and hygiene intervention on trachoma. There was also a lot of variation in the way that different studies had defined and measured improvements to water, sanitation, and hygiene access. This made it difficult to make comparisons. Standard methods and indicators need to be developed for this purpose. The study also highlighted gaps in the research. More work is required to determine precisely what is needed in terms of access to water to reduce the incidence of trachoma. Similarly, in terms of improving sanitation, it is still unclear whether ensuring every household has a simple, onsite facility would be more effective than providing clean communal facilities. The potential role of schools in promoting relevant public health measures also needs investigation.

AB  - Objectives. - In two recent articles, we defined the notion of post-traumatic psycholinguistic syndrome from the standardized study of the speech of psychically wounded patients. This semiological novelty, based on the contributions of linguistics to psychiatry, fosters the ambition to overcome the diagnostic and therapeutic dead ends that too many psychotraumatized people still face. Either because this post-traumatic suffering is silenced, by the very fact of its clinical characteristics - a consequence of the structural indisputability of the psychological trauma - or because the healthcare system or certain networks of practitioners come up against impassable conceptions. Classical psychopathology, cognitive science, and neuroscience improve theories, but we also require knowledge useful for field practice. In order to go beyond the previous concepts, it is time to propose a new model in order to better : (i) identify people suffering from post-traumatic mental disorder, (ii) organize and evaluate their psychotherapeutic care, (iii) bring together practitioners around these first two objectives. The development of ideas is reaching a turning point where it becomes possible to unite around an original model embracing the precedents, a model based on linguistic and psycholinguistic references which are, on the whole, unknown to psychologists and psychiatrists alike. Admittedly, many psycholinguistic notions appear esoteric and therefore unapproachable. However, the analysis and production of language bind caregivers and people in mental distress. This appears all the more paradigmatic for the space of trauma, marked by unspeakability, which must be overcome by psychotherapy. In two coordinated voices, psycholinguistic and psychiatric, we present in this work the results of our final reflections on the syndrome recently called "Traumatic PsychoLinguistic Syndrome" (SPLIT for 'Syndrome PsychoLinguistique Traumatique' in French). Moreover, as it sheds light on psychotraumatic symptoms, the model that we propose might help to popularize different components of linguistics : lexicology, syntax, and pragmatics.
   Methods. - We carried out a qualitative exploratory study of the speech of French soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The investigator followed a semi-structured interview framework based on open questions with encouragement to relaunch the expression, a focused framework for the approach of different themes : the "recognition" of the disorder in its multiple aspects (medical, institutional, symbolic, etc.), its "reparation" (according to the legal terminology of compensation for bodily and psychological damage), and the "information" provided by society on the disorder. All solicited veterans agreed to participate in the study; data saturation was obtained by carrying out fifteen interviews transcribed manually in word processing software (corpus of 76,762 words for 351,453 characters, spaces not included).
   Centered on the societal notions of "recognition" and "reparation," a first analysis was the subject of publications according to quantitative and then qualitative phenomenological interpretations. But above all, an unexpected result has emerged: the speech of psychically wounded people is intrinsic evidence, both in substance and in form, of the traumatic repetition syndrome. We then described the "post-Traumatic PsychoLinguistic Syndrome" characterized by three axioms: traumatic anomia, linguistic repetitions, and discursive disorganization. In order to limit the approximations inherent in the software approach, we performed an exhaustive manual analysis of the above-mentioned corpus, word by word, phrase by phrase, proposition by proposition, then sentence by sentence. In what follows, we present our first representations of the symptomatic manifestations of trauma in speech.
   Results.-The results are presented using a heuristic model following the components of language construction from "bricks," building "columns," to the "unfinished temple:" the word opens up to lexical analysis, the sentence invites to the syntactic approach, and the discourse interests pragmatic considerations. For each of these three dimensions we present: (i) a brief definition of the related scientific concepts, (ii) their disturbances in psychically injured subjects, (iii) clinical examples, (iv) a brief discussion. Lexical marks of trauma: anomia, dysfluencies, emotional theme. Traumatic anomia manifests itself at the lexical level by the inability to express the trauma in words that could evoke it. Verbosity, that is to say the number of words and clauses, appears inferior to common language, as is evidenced by a lower lexical density, e.g. a drop in the ratio of the number of lexical words over that of grammatical words. Modifiers such as epithet adjectives and noun complements are rare. Circumlocutions, periphrases, comparisons, and antiphrases are over-represented. Lexical dysfluencies are expressed by silent and filled pauses, vocalic lengthenings, repetitions of determinants in front of a noun, of pronouns in front of a verb, and of adverbs in front of an adjective. This dimension can take on the caricatured aspect of producing snippets of words or phrases, or even of an obstinate stopping on grammatical words, which indicates a disruption of lexical access. Thematically, sensory and emotional expression appears to be much more developed than the verbalization of cognitions. Syntactic marks of trauma: repetition, fragmentation, passive form. The phrase and sentence analysis highlights linguistic repetitions on several levels. The historical present is used to the detriment of other verbal tenses. The repetition of utterances, especially syntagmatic, is an indicator of perseveration. Thus, dysfluencies characterized by silent or filled pauses located at non-natural syntactic boundaries result in fragmented speech. Even though incomplete utterances (also called false starts) persist, some primers can be completed or repaired, but the continuous flow of speech is disturbed by snatches and accidents. In addition, passive forms and the use of gerund and infinitive participial clauses are used, which are structures eclipsing the expression of the agent (who performs the action expressed by the verb). Pragmatic marks of trauma: disorganization and depersonalization. The disorganization of discourse is reflected by a decrease in discursive cohesion as evidenced by the processing of anaphors by distancing the anaphoric pronoun from its antecedent, and the presence of numerous ambiguous anaphoric references. Note also the decrease in the efficiency of the use of temporal and logical connectors. There are also many digressions, disrupting the chronological progression of the events described. Depersonalization is characterized by an underuse of first-person pronouns (I, one) compared to generic-valued impersonal pronouns (one, you). The frequency of use of third person singular pronouns as well as semantically empty words (he, she, that, thing, something, someone, etc.) is increased.
   Discussion. - Traumatic psycholinguistic syndrome turns out to be the verbal counterpart to the cardinal semiological symptoms of trauma. The anomia reflects the unspeakable contemporary moment of fear, and persistent linguistic repetitions refer to flashbacks, while discursive disturbances correspond to the dissociation of language. The capacities of verbal expression are constrained by the avoidance; the psychic interference creates ecmnesias. The preeminence of indefinite and impersonal forms points to depersonalization and even to desubjectivation. We can also note the overrepresentation of negative, infinitive forms and of passive constructions reflecting the subject constrained by the experience of trauma, as if he remained the object of traumatic flashbacks, without the possibility of action. The present tense is overused, as a symptom of derealization, related to the recurrent memories of the traumatic event, always repeating identically.... to the detriment of the future. If SPLIT expresses the classic understanding of trauma, this section cannot be strictly superimposed on the American nosography. Our identification of the psycho linguistic footprints of trauma referenced in SPLIT enriches the existing clinical descriptions in order to help with diagnostic identification. However, would these signs alone make it possible to differentiate the psychotraumatic consequences from other anatomoclinical profiles? So far, in the field of psychological disorders, only schizophrenia has a linguistic diagnostic criterion in the DSM, a specificity that is probably historical since language disorders were considered fundamental in the original semiological descriptions of diseases in the schizophrenia group. The language disorders identified in subjects suffering from traumatic repetition syndrome or schizophrenia are quite different even if they present similar dimensions - at least in appearance. This corroborates the etiopathogenic divergences of these two pathogenic frameworks: primary neurobiological impairment for schizophrenia, more reactive disorder for traumatic repetition syndrome. It also accounts for the usual dead ends of psychiatric semiology and perhaps, even more difficult to overcome, for the transcription of human perception considering various objects (things of the world, medical signs, attitude and the words of others, etc.). Rumke and Minkowski (1942, 1949) were the first to recognize the establishment of a psychiatric diagnosis as a rapid intuition, which immediately embraces the overall clinical context of the patient, an impression that is very difficult to translate into semiological terms. As the first phenomenological clinicians had foreseen before several scientific studies validated this intuition, the almost instantaneous precocity of certain psychiatric diagnoses leads to the qualification of concordant symptoms. What is called clinical diagnosis in psychiatry is often only a tautology in the sense that this diagnosis refers to nothing but itself, and not to a meaning that would provide an etiopathogenic value. Whatever their etiopathogenic origins and their semiological characteristics, certain psycholinguistic markers seem to be found in various pathological expressions such as mood disorders, non-fluent aphasias (of the Broca type), or even dementia (especially Alzheimer's disease).
   More judicious than the categorical approach, the transnosographic dimensional analysis, of the normal or the pathological, could be favored in order to cross the borders of semiology towards the analysis of cognitive processes responsible for language disturbances. Conclusions. - Psycholinguistic analysis opens up a considerable field of investigation in the realm of psychotraumatology. If we postulate the linguistic phenomenon as a surface phenomenon accounting for prior cognitive processes, the expression of language abnormalities would allow us to go back to normal or pathological neurocognitive mechanisms. We have described SPLIT based on the identification of new clinical signs, aimed at better identifying post-traumatic mental disorders and also at proposing linguo-markers allowing the effects of recommended psychotherapies to be evaluated in real conditions. But, as already mentioned for previous theories, care should be taken to ensure that innovative modeling does not constitute an expression of the symptom, of dissociation. Indeed, the traumatic nucleus appears to protect itself, insinuating itself even into methods and systems that have the ambition to explore it, to circumscribe it. The new clinical entity called SPLIT represents a paradigmatic change in our conception of psychic trauma, called by semantics. This is another story we will tell soon.
