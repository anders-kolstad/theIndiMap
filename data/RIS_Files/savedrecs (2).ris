AB  - In order to evaluate the ecological health condition of Zhanghe River Watershed, an adapted Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) was developed. Macro-invertebrates were sampled at 12 monitoring stations which were grouped into two condition categories (reference and impaired stations) according to the level of degradation. A total of 47 benthic macroinvertebrates taxa were identified, in which aquatic insects 33 taxa, Mollusca 8, Annalida 3 and Crustacea 3 taxa. Based on macro-invertebrate assemblages characters of this area, 18 candidate biological metrics in four categories, including taxonomic richness, community composition, pollution tolerance, trophic guild, and value distribution, were chosen. In which, four metrics were excluded because of low values or narrow distribution range. Discriminatory power between reference and impaired stations was analysed using box-plots, and six metrics were excluded because the medians of the box-plot inside the inter quartile range. Of all the rest eight metrics, four were not suitable for B-IBI index system because of their high Pearson correlation (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.75). Finally, total taxa, percentage of Crustacea and Mollusca, percentage of tolerant taxa and percentage of predators were screened out to form a B-IBI index system. Ratio scoring method for B-IBI index was used to get a uniform score. Evaluation criterion was established based on the 25 percentiles value of reference stations. Assessment results using B-IBI showed 5 of sampling stations were in 'healthy' and 'sub-healthy' state, 3 were in 'fair' state, and 4 were in 'poor' or 'very poor' state of the whole watershed.

AB  - The most informative characteristics of the zooplankton-community response to the effect of industrial wastewater from mines have been determined using water bodies of the Kola Peninsula as an example. It has been demonstrated that qualitative and quantitative characteristics of zooplankton depend on the degree of industrial pollution of a water body and adequately reflect differences in the conditions of zooplankton growth between the whole water bodies and their individual parts. The role of zooplankton as an indicator has been assessed and the possibility of including it in the system of monitoring of water objects has been substantiated.

AB  - The problem of the ecological and economic organization of the territory of the Republic of Moldova and its regions is considered. The assessment of the intensity of the ecological and economic state of the country's territory was carried out and the possibility of optimizing the structure of land use on the basis of improving the balance of various types of land use was shown. It is established that a characteristic feature of the land use structure in Moldova is the dominance of lands with a high anthropogenic load, which occupy 64 % of the country's territory. The indicators of the ecological and economic state of the territory of the country and its regions for the current land use structure and for the proposed variant of its optimization are calculated. The relationship between the relative coefficient of tension of the ecological and economic state and the coefficient of natural protection of the territory is revealed. It is shown that the land use structure developed in Moldova caused a high degree of tension in the ecological and economic state of its territory, which can be reduced by 1.3-2.7 times when implementing the proposed measures.

AB  - The submarine hydrothermal systems are extreme environments where active cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may occur. However, little is known about the optical properties and bioavailability of hydrothermal DOM, which could provide valuable insights into its transformation processes and biogeochemical reactivity. The quantity, quality, and bioavailability of DOM were investigated for four very different hydrothermal vents east of Taiwan, using dissolved organic carbon (DOC), absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). The DOC and absorption coefficient C1280 were both lower in the two hydrothermal vents off the Orchid Island and on the Green Island than in the surrounding seawater and the two vents off the Kueishantao Island, indicating effective removals of DOM in the former two hydrothermal systems owing to possible adsorption/co-precipitation and thermal degradation respectively. The four hydrothermal DOM showed notable differences in the absorption spectral slope S275-295, humification index HIX, biological index BIX, EEM spectra, and the relative distributions of seven PARAFAC components. The results demonstrated a high diversity of chemical composition and transformation history of DOM under contrasting hydro thermal conditions. The little change in the hydrothermal DOC after 28-day microbial incubations indicated a low bioavailability of the bulk DOM, and different PARAFAC components showed contrasting bioavailability. The results have profound implications for understanding the biogeochemical cycling and environmental effects of hydrothermal DOM in the marine environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The common octopus Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797 is the most fished cephalopod species along the Spanish coasts. Its catches fluctuate greatly due to the short life cycle of the species and to the annual variability of the recruitment pattern, strongly dependent on the environmental conditions affecting the eggs and paralarvae. This study examines the common octopus fishery, the catch composition, and the main features of the reproductive biology of this species in the Gulf of Alicante (Spanish Eastern coast, Western Mediterranean FAO division 3711). The common octopus fishery was studied analysing the monthly landing and effort data by fishing gear from 1994 to 2005. Monthly samplings of the commercial O. vulgaris landings from trawlers and clay pots from January 2004 to December 2005 resulted in the measuring of 1833 specimens to enable analysis of the catch composition, and allowed the biological sampling of 1.176 individuals to provide the reproductive parameters of the species in the study area. The length-weight relationship calculated for the species was BW = 0.51 * DML2.87. The yearly sex ratios (males: females) were 1:1 (trawl, 2004), 1:0.74 (trawl, 2005), and 1:0.88 (clay pots, 2005). The size (dorsal mantle length, DML) at maturity of the species in the study area was 9.67 cm for males and 14.38 cm for females. The gonadosomatic index reached a peak between April and July for males and in July for females. The Fulton condition index was lower in both sexes between June and September, and for males in November-December, whereas for both sexes the values of the digestive gland index were at their maximum between June and December. The energy allocation between somatic and reproductive growth was investigated and the results suggested that the energy spent on reproduction mainly came from feeding, and not from energy stored in the mantle tissues or in the digestive gland.

AB  - A multimetric fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was composed to assess the biotic integrity of Flandrian water bodies. As fish communities differ substantially between standing waters, running waters of the bream zone and running waters of the barbel zone, eight candidate metrics for each of these water types or zones were identified, representing three major classes of biological attributes. These are species richness and composition, fish condition and abundance, trophic composition. The metrics were tested and modified where needed. The IBI was applied throughout Flanders on 104 locations in standing waters, 500 locations in waters of the bream zone and 257 locations in waters of the barbel zone. Standing waters scored substantially different from running waters. Standing waters rarely contained no fish at all, but their fish communities were very often poor to very poor. Waters of the bream and barbel zone were often fishless (respectively 40% and 35% of all locations contain no fish), but the locations with fish usually scored reasonable to poor. Only 18.5% of all locations were classified as reasonable to excellent (IBI classes 4 or lower on a scale from 1 to 9) and were considered to satisfy the basic ecological quality demands. The Leie-, Dijle-, Dender- and Schelde-basins had a very poor quality (more than 50% of the locations contained no fish). The Maas-, Grote and Kleine Nete-basins scored rather well, with respectively, 44%, 48% and 68% of the locations achieving an IBI of 4 or lower. The IBI is a valuable and complementary tool to assess the ecological quality of water bodies as suggested in the proposal for a Water Framework Directive by the European Commission.

AB  - [1] MODIS-based leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used to examine detailed information regarding actual growing season and total annual production for various regions. Overall, MODIS LAI has larger variability and demonstrates more information regarding the evolution and structure of the seasonal vegetation characteristics. In contrast, the NDVI saturates around 0.7 and tends to overestimate the growing season in regions where it is already long. Next, a climatic impact index (CII) is derived to provide additional information regarding the potential sensitivity of vegetation to changes in climatic variables by accounting for the length of growing season. By normalizing the growth rate to the biome-average growth rate, this index can identify fractional loss of annual production, as opposed to the absolute loss which may be strongly weighted by the overall growth rate for different ecosystems. Our index provides a quantitative framework for assessing the importance of the length of the growing season in determining climatic vulnerability. In the last part of the paper, we use the long time series AVHRR products as a substitute for the MODIS products and test the temporal characteristics of the CII. Major drought events are well-captured by the CII, suggesting potential use as a monitoring and evaluation tool. Furthermore, the strong positive correlation between the CII and the vegetation condition index (VCI) suggests that the CII can quantitatively identify the effects of climatic variability upon vegetation activity.

AB  - Dreissenid mussels are ecosystem engineers in the Great Lakes, affecting benthic and water column communities and production. We surveyed mussel populations at four Canadian and three U.S. locations in summer 2008 to update population status and examine correlations with water column data. We measured mussel length, density, shell-free dry mass (SFDM), condition index, and phosphorus content of both shells and mussel tissue. The water column variables of chlorophyll a, turbidity, and total phosphorus (TP) were correlated with each other lake-wide, but exhibited only a few correlations with mussel metrics within seasons or shorelines. Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) represented similar to 99% of the mussel community in nearshore collections. Mussel length declined in a west-to-east direction and increased with depth in both U.S. and Canadian nearshore waters. Mussel density declined west-to-east in U.S. water, but exhibited no difference among sites in Canadian waters. Mussel condition index and phosphorus concentrations were correlated and increased west-to-east within the U.S. nearshore. There were significant declines in both tissue and shell P content with season in U.S. mussels, but no clear patterns in Canadian mussels. We estimated there were 9.7 x 10(12) mussels (mean = 3402.9/m(2)) in the Lake Ontario nearshore totalling 1.2 x 10(5) mT of mussel tissue which could filter the entire Lake Ontario nearshore volume (0-20 m depth = 30.9 km(3)) in roughly 1 to 7 days. It appears that mussel density has declined since the last large surveys of 5 or 10 years ago (Canadian nearshore or U.S. nearshore, respectively), however the data were either only slightly supportive of, or showed no support for, food limitation or goby predation as the most parsimonious explanation for the decline in mussel abundance.

AB  - We determined the statistical properties of the index of biotic integrity (IBI) from electrofishing samples collected from Ohio streams. Although IBI is widely used to evaluate the condition of water resources by biologists and resource managers, expanding its role as a regulatory tool depends on statistical validation of its precision and power. We addressed these issues by constructing an additive variance model for IBI and testing the assumptions of that model directly with a bootstrap resampling algorithm and simulations using field data. Statistical properties of IBI supported the use of standard analysis techniques such as ANOVA for hypothesis testing. We determined with power analysis that IBI can distinguish between five and six nonoverlapping categories of biotic integrity based on a model that includes the effects of measurement error, variability of fish assemblages through time, and statistical interaction of location and time. We conclude that IBI is an effective monitoring tool that can be used to communicate qualitative assessments to the public and policy makers or to provide quantitative assessments for a legal or regulatory context based on confidence intervals or hypothesis testing procedures.

AB  - Water of sufficient quality and quantity is critical to all life.  Increasing human population and growth of technology require human society to devote more and more attention to protection of adequate supplies of water. Although perception of biological degradation stimulated current state and federal legislation on the quality of water resources, that biological focus was lost in the search for easily measured physical and chemical surrogates.  The "fishable and swimmable" goal of the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (PL 92-500) and its charge to "restore and maintain" biotic integrity illustrate that law's biological underpinning.  Further, the need for operational definitions of terms like "biological integrity" and "unreasonable degradation" and for ecologically sound tools to measure divergence from societal goals have increased interest in biological monitoring.  Assessment of water resource quality by sampling biological communities in the field (ambient biological monitoring) is a promising approach that requires expanded use of ecological expertise.  One such approach, the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), provides a broadly based, multiparameter tool for the assessment of biotic integrity in running waters.  IBI based on fish community attributes has now been applied widely in North America.  The success of IBI has stimulated the development of similar approaches using other aquatic taxa.  Expanded use of ecological expertise in ambient biological monitoring is essential to the protection of water resources.  Ecologists have the expertise to contribute significantly to those programs.

AB  - We initiated a multifaceted, integrated investigation of the general health of the aquatic environment near a bleached kraft pulp and paper mill. This southcentral U.S. mill discharges about 125,000 cubic meters of treated effluent per day into an adjacent river. The sampling sites for this study were 1.8 km upstream from the mill's discharge, 0.25 km below the mill's outlet, and 5 km downstream from the discharge area. No toxicity was observed using Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas in aqueous phase tests or with Hyalella azteca and Chironomus tentans in sediment phase tests. Field examinations of two small fish species and sediment macroinvertebrate communities from each sampling site revealed no significant adverse effects. Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were exposed for 35 days to site sediments and were evaluated for ethoxyresorufin O-dethylase (EROD) activity, cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) content, DNA strand breaks, condition index, organ indices, gross pathology, and immune responses. No significant adverse effects were observed in sediments immediately below the mill's effluent outlet, though detoxification enzyme activity was elevated in liver tissue of bluegill sunfish exposed to site 3 sediment. Embryos of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were evaluated for developmental and reproductive abnormalities following a static laboratory exposure of gravid females to sediments from the three study sites for 56 clays. The embryos showed no significant effects on a suite of reproductive parameters among the three sites. We concluded that there was no significant evidence of adverse impacts on the receiving river or its biota attributable to treated bleached kraft mill effluent based on a comprehensive suite of bioindicators of exposure and effects.

AB  - Social entrepreneurship development in Ukraine is a priority guideline based on the creation and improvement of government policy on ecosystem orientation and inclusion, which provides public access to tourism and natural resources. The main component of inclusive development of social entrepreneurship emphasizes the basic principles of its existence, such as the ability to achieve one's own goals, despite the economic effect of one's activities. In the quantitative comparative analysis and need to reach economic indicators, the main factors are determined by the idea of inclusive development in nature management, as a field of activity in which not only the state but also multidisciplinary international organizations invest. The aim of the article is to identify opportunities for inclusive nature management development in social entrepreneurship in Ukraine by summarizing the existing practice of using indices and identifying indicators that will correspond to inclusive nature management parameters. Determining the position and directions of social entrepreneurship development in Ukraine was determined using an index approach, which, in contrast to others, allows one to identify indicators that characterize the sphere of development on economic and environmental influence of the country on the basis of inclusivity. The analysis of international rating assessments and Ukraine's place in them requires a rethinking of existing approaches to the search for economically feasible ways to improve socio-economic and environmental indicators and their rating positions. The method of multi-indicator immersion is used in the article to identify the main indicators of economic, inclusive growth and social components, which are due to the experience in nature management and characterize the development of social entrepreneurship. The calculations of the Inclusive Development Index of Social Entrepreneurship in Ukraine as a consolidated index according to the geometric formula, which comprised synthetic indicators of the human capital index to outline the inclusive range of components, brand index and index of environmental indicators, proved that today the ecological state of environment and health of the population have a significant negative impact on economic growth and welfare of the population.

AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae were reared under various feeding environments to assess their lipid class composition and survival during development. Lipids were assessed in individual larvae. Triacylglycerol (TAG), phospholipids (PL), and defatted dry weight (DDW) all fell during yolk absorption. TAG increased after initiation of exogenous feeding in different feeding treatments but did not increase in starved larvae. The percentage of individuals greater than 8 d old with high TAG or PL increased with increasing prey concentration. Survivorship was low in all feeding trials, but groups with a larger percentage of individuals in poor condition tended to exhibit a higher risk of death. We suggest a condition index based on a discriminant function using TAG, FL, and DDW. We assessed the condition of field-collected larvae based on this index.

AB  - The use of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) for biomonitoring environmental stress is limited by the lack of work on how FA in particular traits responds to specific stresses. Here, by manipulating the number of individuals in an enclosed fallow deer (Dama dama) population, we describe, for the first time, clear density dependence in the FA of juvenile jaw morphology. The impact of high population density on FA was strong for both sexes, supporting the use of FA for indexing environmental stress. In addition, there was some indication that the change in FA was greater in males (43.6%) than females (28.5%). Finally, the ability to buffer density-dependent stress was independent of body condition. We suggest that, under highly limiting conditions, whole cohorts may be unable to buffer against developmental error, irrespective of individual quality.

AB  - In the last decades, the need to develop biotic metrics that best represent the ecological quality and biotic integrity of a given environment has been discussed. Functional, ecological group and multimetric indices based on organisms such as fishes have been developed and analyzed, mostly in temperate regions. In this context, this study performed the first systematic review concerning the use of fish-based indices in assessing ecological quality and biotic integrity of transitional waters (i.e. estuaries, bays, coastal lagoons). The main driving questions approached the using status of fish-based indices in aquatic ecosystems, as well as their application in estuaries and the existent knowledge gaps (especially in tropical environments). A systematic review was performed on the Web of Science, Scopus, and SciELO research platforms (1945-2018). After screening all listed publications applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 324 publications were included in the analysis. Most studies assessed rivers and streams from temperate zones, by studying fishes using the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and its many regional adaptations. Few studies (13%) were performed in transitional aquatic ecosystems. For estuaries, the index Estuarine Fish Assessment Index (EFAI) was the most validated index based on its efficacy (10 publications). Only five studies were performed outside the temperate region, revealing an evident knowledge gap for tropical estuaries in this issue. Seven priority knowledge gaps concerning the further development of fish-based indices are listed as concluding remarks.

AB  - Estuaries are important areas highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pollutions. Therefore, the assessment of estuarine water quality is a major ecological issue. In this study, we sampled juveniles of the European flounder in the "pristine" Canche estuary, and caged them in Canche and in two polluted sites of the Seine estuary, Rouen and Fosse Nord. After one month, the metal and organic pollutants in these sites were assessed, and we evaluated several phenotypic indicators (condition index, RNA,,DNA ratios and genotoxicity), and extracted the proteins in fish livers for analysis using a shotgun proteomics approach.
   The results showed strong modifications in the fish caged in both sites of the Seine estuary, as compared to those caged in Canche. In particular, many proteins involved in phase I and phase II detoxification reactions were accumulated in the liver of fish caged in the site showing the highest pollution, Rouen. In addition, we observed a general disruption of metabolism, in particular an increase in lipid synthesis and carbohydrate degradation in Rouen, and a decrease in the abundance of proteins associated to translational activity in Fosse Nord. At both sites, several stress proteins were decreased.
   The proteomic impact of the encagement by itself was also evaluated, by comparing the liver proteome of fish caged in Canche to that of fish stayed in Malta during the same time. The results showed proteomic signatures of exposure to stressful conditions (particularly heat stress), most probably related to the micro-habitat in which the cages were placed. In conclusion, the caging technique is of great interest for ecotoxicological assessment of estuarine waters, but should consider that the results are representative of the micro-habitat around the cages, which does not necessarily represent the overall heterogeneity of the estuarine environment.

AB  - Drylands worldwide are experiencing ecosystem state transitions: the expansion of some ecosystem types at the expense of others. Bees in drylands are particularly abundant and diverse, with potential for large compositional differences and seasonal turnover across ecotones. To better understand how future ecosystem state transitions may influence bees, we compared bee assemblages and their seasonality among sites at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NM, USA) that represent three dryland ecosystem types (and two ecotones) of the southwestern U.S. (Plains grassland, Chihuahuan Desert grassland, and Chihuahuan Desert shrubland). Using passive traps, we caught bees during two-week intervals from March-October, 2002-2014. The resulting dataset included 302 bee species and 56 genera. Bee abundance, composition, and diversity differed among ecosystems, indicating that future state transitions could alter bee assemblage composition in our system. We found strong seasonal bee species turnover, suggesting that bee phenological shifts may accompany state transitions. Common species drove the observed trends, and both specialist and generalist bee species were indicators of ecosystem types or months; these species could be sentinels of community-wide responses to future shifts. Our work suggests that predicting the consequences of global change for bee assemblages requires accounting for both within-year and among-ecosystem variation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and biometric variables on circulating levels of steroid hormones (androgens, estrogens and progestagens) in male polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway (n = 23). Levels of pregnenolone (PRE), progesterone (PRO), androstenedione (AN), clehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (TS), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estrone (El), 17 alpha-estradiol (alpha E2) and 17 beta-estradiol (beta E2) were quantified in polar bear serum by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), while POPs were measured in plasma. Subsequently, associations between hormone concentrations (9 steroids), POPs (21 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 8 OH-PCBs, 8 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and OCP metabolites, and 2 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)) and biological variables (age, head length, body mass, girth, body condition index), capture date, location (latitude and longitude), lipid content and cholesterol levels were examined using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) modelling. Average concentrations of androgens, estrogens and progestagens were in the range of 0.57-83.7 (0.57-12.4 for subadults, 1.02-83.7 for adults), 0.09-2.69 and 0.57-2.44 nmol/L, respectively. The steroid profiles suggest that sex steroids were mainly synthesized through the Delta-4 pathway in male polar bears. The ratio between androgens and estrogens significantly depended on sexual maturity with androgen/estrogen ratios being approximately 60 times higher in adult males than in subadult males. PCA plots and OPLS models indicated that TS was positively related to biometrics, such as body condition index in male polar bears. A negative relationship was also observed between POPs and DHT. Consequently, POPs and body condition may potentially affect the endocrinological function of steroids, including development of reproductive tissues and sex organs and the general condition of male polar bears.

AB  - Stormwater brings freshwater and terrestrially derived contaminants into coastal systems and is predicted to increase with climate change. This study aimed to characterise variation in rocky shore assemblages in relation to stormwater pollution. Intertidal assemblages were sampled in similar habitats at a range of distances (0 m, 10 m, 20 m, 60 m, and 100 m) from stormwater outfalls on three rocky shores north of Dublin. In general, taxon richness and algal cover increased after 20 m from a stormwater outfall. Limpet population structure and condition index showed no consistent patterns among shores. Assemblage structure at or near stormwater sites differed from that at sites 100 m away. These findings, ideally supplemented by experimental research, may be used to inform stormwater management and remediation approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluated the link between watershed activities and salt marsh structure, function, and condition using spatial emergy flow density (areal empower density) in the watershed and field data from 10 tidal salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, RI, USA. The field-collected data were obtained during several years of vegetation, invertebrate, soil, and water quality sampling. The use of emergy as an accounting mechanism allowed disparate factors (e.g., the amount of building construction and the consumption of electricity) to be combined into a single landscape index while retaining a uniform quantitative definition of the intensity of landscape development. It expanded upon typical land use percentage studies by weighting each category for the intensity of development. At the RI salt marsh sites, an impact index (watershed emergy flow normalized for marsh area) showed significant correlations with mudflat infauna species richness, mussel density, plant species richness, the extent and density of dominant plant species, and denitrification potential within the high salt marsh. Over the 4-year period examined, a loading index (watershed emergy flow normalized for watershed area) showed significant correlations with nitrite and nitrate concentrations, as well as with the nitrogen to phosphorus ratios in stream discharge into the marshes. Both the emergy impact and loading indices were significantly correlated with a salt marsh condition index derived from intensive field-based assessments. Comparison of the emergy indices to calculated nitrogen loading estimates for each watershed also produced significant positive correlations. These results suggest that watershed emergy flow is a robust index of human disturbance and a potential tool for rapid assessment of coastal wetland condition.

AB  - The leopard grouper Mycteroperca rosacea is endemic to northwestern Mexico. It has been classified as vulnerable by the IUCN since 2008. M. rosacea has high commercial value and is caught year-round in Baja California Sur (BCS). Biological information on this species, especially in its natural environment, is scarce, and the objective of this study was to analyze its reproductive biology in Santa Rosalia, BCS. A total of 345 specimens were collected from March 2014 to May 2015. The sex ratio was 2.0: 1.0 (females: males, P < 0.05). Population size at first maturity (L-50) was estimated at 40.77 cm TL; 37.31 cm TL for males and 42.44 cm TL for females. Gonadic development was synchronous by group, with a reproductive period occurring from March to May in 2014 and 2015 (at 20-23 degrees C). The gonadosomatic index achieved maximum values in May 2014 and March 2015, as did the highest frequencies of mature and spawning individuals, indicating that there was a clear seasonal pattern of reproduction, and a negative correlation with temperature for both sexes. The hepatosomatic index and the condition index indicated that M. rosacea is not a species that requires storing of energy for reproductive events, as it seems to have food available year-round.

AB  - Nansi Lake which consists of four sublakes from north to south: Nanyang, Dushan, Zhaoyang and Weishan sublake is situated at the southwest of Shandong, China. It has been seriously affected by long-term intensive anthropogenic activities in recent years. An extensive survey was conducted in the surface sediments of Nansi Lake to investigate the spatial distribution, source identification as well as pollution assessment of metal contents. Results showed that the enrichment degree of studied metals decreased in the order of Hg > Cd > As > Pb > Cr > Ni > Cu > Zn, and the average contents of Hg, Cd, As and Pb were 2.87-, 2.73-, 1.95- and 1.89-fold higher than their background values respectively. The obtained geo-accumulation index (I-geo) indicated absent to moderate pollution by As and Pb. Cd followed closely, and Hg was in moderate pollution, while the other metals scarcely showed any pollution. Based on geostatistical analyses, small patches of Nanyang sublake and most parts of Dushan sublake and Weishan sublake suffered heavier pollution, and the whole Nansi Lake was almost in a moderate ecological risk state according to potential ecological risk index (RI). Multivariate statistical analyses combined with spatial-vertical distribution of elements contents in sampled core revealed that Fe2O3, Ni, Cr, Be, Li, V, Ti, Al2O3 and partially Zn, Pb and Cu mostly originated from natural sources, Hg and partially Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu mainly came from metals mining and smelting, industry and traffic sources, while As and partially Cd, Zn and Pb represented agricultural activities like fertilizing and pesticide consumption.

AB  - Determining success of stream restoration projects is challenging, due to the disconnection between required monitoring periods and the actual time necessary to achieve ecological success. Performance curves could help address this challenge by illustrating likely developmental trajectories of restored streams. We applied the California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM), an integrative index of stream condition, in a 10 year chronosequence to create performance curves that project the development of functional streams for 30 years following restoration. CRAM scores for high functioning sites between zero and 10 years were plotted against time since restoration. Best-fit curves were derived using either power functions or polynomial functions, depending on the CRAM metric. We tested the curves' ability to predict conditions for other projects across a range of ages, flow conditions (ephemeral to perennial), and physiographic settings. The curves are able to predict the time required for projects to achieve reference-level scores for the CRAM index and Hydrology and Biotic Structure attributes, but underestimate the time required for projects to achieve reference-level scores for the Physical Structure attribute. Our research demonstrates the potential to use modeled restoration performance curves based on CRAM scores to guide expectations for restoration project performance.

AB  - Studies were were undertaken to evaluate the direction of changes in the ecological state and trophy of Row Wyskoc on the basis of biological indices and selected indices describing the water quality parameters. The field study needed for determination of the macrophyte indices were carried out in June and July 2017. The indices used in paper were the Macrophyte River Index (MIR) used in Poland for evaluation of ecological status and Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) used in Great Britain and other countries (Poland, Ireland) for evaluation of trophy of flowing waters. In the field studies carried out along the section of 100 m at each study site, the coverage with particular taxa of vascular plants, ferns and macroscopic algae. Only the plants that have contact with water for over 90% of their vegetation period were taken into account. Each species was assigned with a specific degree of coverage.
   In the sites covered with compact patches of water vegetation of areas greater than 10 m(2), the phytosociological releves were taken and the macrophyte associations were identified. The sites of studies were three control sites in villages Racot (1), Wyskoc (2) and Rogaczewo (3). The trophy of flowing water was evaluated on the basis of concentrations of total phosphorus, dissolved phosphates and nitrate nitrogen, using the Chemical Index of Trophy (CIT)
   The catchment area of the Row Wyskoc watercourse was determined on the basis of the Raster Map of Hydrographic Divisions in Poland (the abbreviation in Polish MPHP) in the scale 1:50000 (2010) supplied by the National Water Management Authority (KZGW). The physiographic characterization of the catchment was made on the basis of topographic maps in the scale of 1:10000 and the Digital Model of the Land (NMT) offered by Main Centre of Geodetic and Cartographic Documentation (CODGiK) The structure of the catchment area use was described on the basis of the Corine Land Cover Project realized by the General Inspectorate of Environmental Protection (GIOS).
   The physicochemical state of water was characterized on the basis of a set of data comprising 8 parameters describing water quality: dissolved oxygen (O-2), BOD5, conductivity at 20 degrees C (mu S . cm(-1)), pH, ammonium nitrogen (N-NH4), nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3), nitrite nitrogen (N-NO2) and phosphates (PO4). The classes of surface water quality were assumed according to the Act of Law in the Journal of Laws of August 5th 2016 on the classification of the state of uniform areas of surface waters and environmental norms of quality for priority substances.
   On the basis of values of macrophyte indices it can be concluded that the ecological state of water at the sites in Wyskoc and Rogaczewo was good, while the water at the site Racot was of moderate ecological state.
   Analysis of macrophyte indices determined at selected sites of study indicated similarity of the ecological state and level of trophy in the water of Row Wyskoc. Analysis of physicochemical data characterizing the Row Wyskoc water in the vegetation season of 2017 showed that the water quality was below the good state.

AB  - Thousands of hectares of wetlands that are being destroyed by the oil sands mining process in Alberta, Canada must be compensated for. The reclamation requirements demand that compensatory wetlands meet a minimum level of ecological health, and be certified as successfully reclaimed. To assist the government in compliance monitoring we developed a vegetation-based Index of Biotic Integrity (vIBI), an ecological assessment tool that has been used in many jurisdictions to assess the ecological health of natural, degraded, or reclaimed wetlands. Our 45 study sites represented a gradient of physical and chemical stress, with 25 natural reference wetlands to represent the optimal outcome of reclamation, and 20 oil sands reclaimed wetlands. We assessed vegetation community attributes (metrics) for correlation with a physicochemical stress gradient, and incorporated the metrics with the highest correlations into two vIBI tools, an advanced vIBI (AvIBI) and a basic vIBI (BvIBI). A small fraction of all possible metrics had acceptable correlations (R(2) > 0.25) with the stress gradient. Six metrics were incorporated into the AvIBI, and three metrics into the BvIBI. Both indexes were highly and significantly correlated with the stress gradient. The AvIBI requires in-depth vegetation assessment at each site and can be used to certify sites that display ecological health within the range of natural wetlands. The BvIBI requires little botanical expertise to implement, and can be used to chart reclamation progress. Both the AvIBI and BvIBI evaluated 14 of the 20011 sands reclaimed wetlands as having low ecological health. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An index of biotic integrity (IBI) based on an Ontario provincial standard nearshore community index netting (NSCIN) protocol was developed to assess nearshore fish communities and ecosystem health in the Lake Ontario/St. Lawrence River ecoregion. The IBI was based on 11 individual metrics representing aspects of fish assemblage integrity: taxonomic richness, habitat guilds, trophic guilds, and overall abundance and biomass. Thirteen geographic areas were sampled and grouped into three habitat types: sheltered embayments, exposed embayments, and riverine. IBI values were higher for sheltered embayments (mean IBI = 71, excluding Hamilton Harbour) than for exposed embayments (62, excluding Toronto Harbour) and riverine areas (64). The IBI accurately reflected anticipated contemporary differences in ecosystem health among geographic areas as well as historical changes within the Bay of Quinte. Two designated areas of concern (AOCs) where remedial action plans (RAP) are ongoing, Hamilton Harbour, a sheltered embayment, and Toronto Harbour, a more exposed area, had lowest IBI values (45 and 47, respectively). IBI values on Bay of Quinte and Lake St. Francis AOCs, where RAPs are nearing completion, were very similar to IBI values from less affected embayments and nearshore areas within their respective habitat types. Upper and middle Bay of Quinte IBIs increased from 47.3 and 45.9, respectively, to 71.8 and 69.2 over a 45 -year time period (1969-2013) consistent with previously documented major ecosystem change.

AB  - The effluents from sewage treatment plants strongly influence the water quality and flow of Mediterranean streams. These effluents play a crucial role in maintaining the aquatic communities of these ecosystems, particularly in the absence of natural flow resulting from climate constraints or intensive water use. To detect the ecological effects of these effluents, we used non-lethal biomarkers in Barbus meridionalis and traditional assessment protocols in the Ripoll River (NE of Spain). Our results demonstrate the utility of haematological parameters. In comparison with fish at reference sites, we detected a decrease in haematocrit and haemoglobin, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, monocytosis, a rise in the nucleo-cytoplasmatic ratio of erythrocytes and an increase in the frequency of abnormal, immature and senescent erythrocytes. Many haematological parameters correlated significantly with the environmental parameters measured. In addition to these haematological alterations, histopathological examination also revealed damage in fish livers but no impact was detected by the regional index of biotic integrity using fish as bioindicators. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report this battery of haematological parameters as biomarkers on a freshwater fish in a Mediterranean stream. In a region in which more than 50% of native fish species are classified as endangered or vulnerable, there is an urgent need to find biomarkers that do not harm the animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Males with enhanced traits relative to conspecifics often show increased mating and reproductive success and thus have a fitness advantage. The opportunity or potential for sexual selection is predicted to occur under these conditions. Here, we investigated proximate determinants of mating success in male copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix), a medium-sized pitviper of North America. Specifically, we investigated the relationships of body size (snout-vent length, body mass), body condition index, spatial metrics (total distance moved, home range size), and plasma testosterone concentration on mating success in males. The single mating season lasts from August through September. We compared a set of candidate linear mixed models and selected the best-fitting one using the adjusted Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). The AICc-selected model (model 2), with testosterone, body condition index, and home range size as predictor variables, showed that male mating success was positively correlated with testosterone. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the relationship of testosterone and individual mating success in any snake species. A parallel study conducted on male fitness in A.contortrix of the same population used microsatellite markers to assign parentage of fathers (known mothers). Unlike our study, they found that snout-vent length was positively correlated with reproductive success and that males were experiencing greater sexual selection. This relationship has been detected under natural conditions in other species of snakes. Although behavioural data are important in any mating system analysis, they should not stand alone to infer parentage, relationships or selection metrics (e.g. Bateman gradients). Long-term sperm storage by females, female cryptic choice, and other factors contribute to the complexity of mating success of males. Accordingly, we thus conclude that estimates of reproductive success and fitness in cryptic species, such as copperheads and other snakes, require robust molecular methods to draw accurate conclusions regarding proximate and evolutionary responses.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 185-194.

AB  - The Clean Water Act mandates that the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of our nation's waters be maintained and restored. Physical integrity has often been defined as physical habitat integrity, and as such, data collected during biological monitoring programs focus primarily on habitat quality. However, we argue that channel stability is a more appropriate measure of physical integrity and that channel stability is a foundational element of physical habitat integrity in low-gradient alluvial streams. We highlight assessment tools that could supplement stream assessments and the Total Maximum Daily Load stressor identification process: field surveys of bankfull cross-sections; longitudinal thalweg profiles; particle size distribution; and regionally calibrated, visual, stream stability assessments. Benefits of measuring channel stability include a more informed selection of reference or best attainable stream condition for an Index of Biotic Integrity, establishment of a baseline for monitoring changes in present and future condition, and indication of channel stability for investigations of chemical and biological impairments associated with sediment discontinuity and loss of habitat quality.

AB  - A multibiomarker approach was used to assess effects of different environmental conditions in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Bivalves were monthly collected from March 2009 to February 2010 in two sites of the Lagoon of Venice differently influenced by both anthropogenic impact and natural conditions: a seaward site (Punta Sabbioni, PS), close to the Lagoon inlet of Lido, characterised by high hydrodynamism and influenced by intense passage Of ships, and a landward site (Canale Dese, CD) characterised by low hydrodynamism and influenced by both riverine inputs and agricultural waste waters. Various biomarkers were measured at cellular, tissue and organism level: total haemocyte count, pinocytotic and haemolymph lysozyme activities, gill acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in both gills and digestive gland, condition index and survival-in-air. Water temperature, pH and salinity values and total chlorophyll concentrations were measured. In addition, grain size, organic matter content, and concentrations of p,p'-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and its 5 homologues, 4 HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes). 13 PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers). 13 PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and 18 PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) were seasonally measured in surface sediments of the two sampling sites. Immunomarkers, as well as AChE activity, highlighted an overall better condition for clams from PS, whereas a different response was provided by the biomarkers measured at organism level, condition index increasing and survival-in-air decreasing in PS clams. No marked differences in sediment contamination levels (except for PAHs) were observed between CD and PS. Overall, results obtained demonstrated that biomarkers measured allowed to discriminate the two sampling sites. Considering that the contamination levels of sediments were similar between the two sampling sites, influence of abiotic factors cannot be excluded in influencing biological responses measured in clams.

AB  - This study examined the southern or Patagonian (41 degrees-55 degrees S) stock of Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi, the more abundant of the two stocks on the Argentinean continental shelf. Pre-recruits (age 0+ year individuals) of this stock settle and grow in the San Jorge Gulf (45 degrees-47 degrees S, 65 degrees 30 ' W), a complex habitat with large spatial variability in environmental features. Relative condition factor, hepatosomatic index, lipid content and fatty-acid composition of muscle and liver, and diet information were combined with physical and biological data to evaluate: how nutritional status of age 0+ year hake varies spatially within the nursery ground; whether changes in condition are related to environmental factors and feeding; whether the indices are interchangeable metrics of condition. Both morphometric and biochemical indices showed dissimilar spatial trends; enhanced liver-based condition coincided with low salinity nutrient rich waters, higher chlorophyll-a values and abundances of Euphausia spp., the preferred prey at most stations, suggesting a bottom-up effect on age 0+ year hake condition. Diminished condition at stations where Thermisto gaudichaudii was the main prey could derive from lower prey quality in terms of energy density and essential fatty acids content. Coastal waters of the gulf would be essential habitats for M. hubbsi pre-recruits. Future monitoring of condition with liver-based indices is encouraged in the gulf, where interannual increasing trends of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a values have been observed, which could have implications for recruitment of the species.

AB  - Our object of study is a multiclass queueing network (MQNET) which consists of a collection of (connected) single-server stations. Exogenous arrivals into the system form independent Poisson streams, service times are exponential and we have Markovian routing of customers between stations. Recent results concerning linear programming (LP) based approaches enable us to establish a simple and intuitive stability condition. This is of interest in its own right, but also enables us to progress with a study of optimal scheduling and performance analysis. Our methodology here is also based on LP. A primal-dual approach exploits the fact that the system satisfies (approximate) conservation laws to yield perform-ance guarantees for a natural index-based scheduling heuristic. We are also able to analyse the performance of an arbitrary priority policy.

AB  - This work addresses multiple human stressors and their impacts on fish assemblages of the Drava and Mura rivers in southern Austria. The impacts of single and multiple human stressors on riverine fish assemblages in these basins were disentangled, based on an extensive dataset. Stressor configuration, i.e. various metrics of multiple stressors belonging to stressor groups hydrology, morphology, connectivity and water quality were investigated for the first time at river basin scale in Austria. As biological response variables, the Fish Index Austria (FIA) and its related single as well as the WFD biological-and total state were investigated. Stressor-response analysis shows divergent results, but a general trend of decreasing ecological integrity with increasing number of stressors and maximum stressor is observed. Fish metrics based on age structure, fish region index and biological status responded best to single stressors and/or their combinations. The knowledge gained in this work provides a basis for advanced investigations in Alpine river basins and beyond, supports WFD implementation and helps prioritizing further actions towards multi-stressor restoration-and management.

AB  - Gonad histopathology data are increasingly being used as indicators of reproductive disorders since they provide a definite biological end-point of historical exposure to endocrine disruptors. Here, a comparative study of some reproduction biological aspects, such as gonad histology, gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI) and condition index (CI) of mature Grass Goby (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus), was carried out in Bizerta lagoon where chemical contamination is proven and in a reference station free of this type of contamination. For this purpose, female and male gobies were collected during the breeding season (April 2006) in three stations in Bizerta lagoon (Menzel-Abderrahemen, Menzel-Bourguiba and Menzel-Jemil), differently impacted by contaminants, including PAHs, PCBs, DDT, organotins and heavy metals, and in the seaward entrance of Ghar el Melh lagoon (reference station). In both sexes, we detected the presence of an overall weaker GSI in Bizerta lagoon than in control fish. These GSI alterations were accompanied by most pathological changes. In females, a higher incidence of oocyte lesions (atretic oocytes and cytoplasmic retraction) was found in stations located near agricultural activity zones. Histologic observation of the testes revealed, as well, abnormalities in Bizerta lagoon fish such as germ cells syncytia, vacuolated germ cells and increase of gaps in the interstitium between lobules. These abnormalities were detected with a high prevalence in stations influenced by industrial and/or urban activities. This study provides insights on the effects of various environmental stressors on Z. ophiocephalus reproductive health. Nevertheless, much research is needed to understand the cause of observed changes and their long-term effect on fish reproductive health, on population fitness and on this species survival in Bizerta lagoon.

AB  - In the present global situation, when everywhere ecology is degraded due to the extreme exhaustion of natural resources. Therefore spatiotemporal ecological vulnerability analysis is necessary for the current situation for sustainable development with protection of fragile eco-environment. Remote sensing is a unique tool to provide complete and continuous land surface information at different scales, which can use for eco-environment analysis. A methodology constructed on the principal component analysis (PCA) to identify satellite remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) for ecological vulnerability analysis and distribution based on four land surface parameters (dryness, greenness, temperature and moisture) by using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS data in the Samara region Russia. The results were verified by the following four methods: location-based, categorization based, correlation-based and city center to outwards distance-based comparisons. Results indicate that ecological condition was improved from 2010 to 2015 as RSEI increased from 0.79 to 0.98 and from 2015 to 2020 the ecological condition was degraded as RSEI decreased from 0.98 to 0.82 but overall it was improved in this decade. RSEI distribution curve shows moderate to good and excellent ecological conditions and degraded ecological condition was basically characterized by high human interference and socioeconomic activities in the study area. Such a technique is a baseline for highly accurate ecological conditions mapping, monitoring and can use for decision making, management and sustainable development.

AB  - Questions The ecological condition of riparian habitats has been negatively altered by human activities and land-use changes. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (a) how adjacent land use affects the ecological condition of riparian habitats; and (b) whether the ecological condition relates to riparian vegetation properties (i.e., structure, diversity, and species composition). Location Watershed of the Duero River, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Methods Sampling sites were established along the Duero River riverbank by considering three different land uses (i.e., native forest, agriculture, and urban). At each site, we assessed the ecological condition of riparian habitats with a riparian condition index (RCI) composed of six subindices, with 17 indicators. Using a survey of woody plants (DBH >= 2.5 cm) in 12 different 0.1-ha sites, we assessed vegetation properties. Results According to the RCI, 76% of the studied riparian habitats had a very poor ecological condition, and only one site scored an excellent condition. The values of all subindices as well as the RCI were significantly greater in the forest than in the agricultural or urban land uses. The significant relationships between the RCI and its components (subindices) with vegetation properties were all positive and explained between 22% and 73% of the variation in structural and diversity attributes, and between 48% and 66% in floristic composition. Conclusions This study shows how human land-use activities affect the ecological condition of riparian habitats and hence riparian forests. Overall, the RCI had a high predictive power for the vegetation properties of riparian forests. This information is critical for programs involved in the management, conservation, and ecological restoration of riparian habitats. Low-cost and time-efficient indices, such as the RCI, facilitate ecological condition assessments of riparian habitats not only by scientists but also by previously trained land managers and the general public.

AB  - In the present study, we analyzed spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics to identify and delineate the vegetation stress zones in tropical arid ecosystem of Anantapuramu district, Andhra Pradesh, India, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Vegetation Anomaly Index (VAI) derived from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day products (MOD13Q1) at 250 m spatial resolution for the growing season (June to September) of 19 years during 2000 to 2018. The 1-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was computed for 30 years (1989 to 2018) to quantify the precipitation deficit/surplus regions and assess its influence on vegetation dynamics. The growing season mean NDVI and VCI were correlated with growing season mean 1-month SPI of dry (2003) and wet (2007) years to analyze the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics. The correlation analysis between SPI and NDVI for dry year (2003) showed strong positive correlation (r= 0.89). Analysis of VAI for dry year (2003) indicates that the central, western, and south-western parts of the district reported high vegetation stress with VAI of less than - 2.0. This might be due to the fact that central and south-western parts of the district are more prone to droughts than the other parts of the district. The correlation analysis of SPI, NDVI, and VCI distinctly shows the impact of rainfall on vegetation dynamics. The study clearly demonstrates the robustness of NDVI, VCI, and VAI derived from time-series MODIS data in monitoring the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and delineate vegetation stress zones in tropical arid ecosystem of India.

AB  - Good preservation and storage of birch pollen (Betula verrucosa Ehrh.) is desirable for two reasons; for one it enables a deeper knowledge of the biological state of the pollen and for the other, since birch pollen is a bio-indicator of air quality, its study under optimal conditions (preservation and biological state) at the biological, structural, ionic and immunological level is essential for analysing the effect of atmospheric pollution on the pollen. For this reason this study has involved both pollen collected under natural conditions and pollen from urban sites (in situ). For a period of two and half years we have studied different methods of preservation and different storage temperatures by in vitro germination tests on a 10% sucrose Heslop-Harrison medium using rehydrated pollen. The best preservation is obtained with freeze-drying for half an hour and subsequent storage at 80 degrees C. The in vitro germination test on in situ pollen shows that the germination percentage is a reliable parameter for estimating the impact of atmospheric pollution on pollen because it varies in accordance with the degree of pollution at the urban sites.

AB  - The aims of the present study were to compare the health status of yellow eels (Anguilla anguilla) developing in three estuaries of the NW Portuguese coast with different levels of pollution and their physiological responses to combined effects of environmental variation and pollution. For this, a field study was performed using a multi-parameter approach, including eels condition indexes and biomarkers, water quality variables and other environmental factors. Sixteen biological parameters were assessed, namely: hepatosomatic index (LSI), Fulton's condition index (K), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total glutathione (TG), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidised glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG, and the activity of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium-potassium ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase), ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR). Ten environmental factors were also measured in water: temperature, salinity, pH, phosphates, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, silica, phenol and hardness. Globally, the biomarkers indicate exposure and toxic effects of pollutants on eels living in contaminated estuaries. The relationships between biological and environmental variables were assessed through redundancy analysis. K and LSI indexes, AChE and Na+/K+-ATPase, total glutathione levels and the antioxidant enzymes CAT, GR, and SOD where the factors most discriminating reference (Minho River estuary) from contaminated estuaries (Lima and Douro Rivers estuaries). Moreover, the most striking outcomes of pollutants exposure on biological responses were observed during winter, probably due to a joint effect of cold weather and pollution stress. Altogether, the results indicate that the development of eels in the polluted estuaries of Lima and Douro rivers is interfering with physiological functions determinant for their survival and performance. This may increase the mortality rates during the continental life-phase of the species and decrease the percentage of animals able to successfully complete their oceanic migration and, thus, reduce the contribution of each generation to the next one.

AB  - Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi is one of the most important fishery resources in the Argentinean Continental Shelf (ACS; SW Atlantic Ocean). In the last decades, the Northern stock (34 degrees 30 '-41 degrees S) has supported a drastic biomass decreasing due to overexploitation. Since the strength of a year class is highly influenced by the survival of age-0+ individuals, studies on their nutritional condition are essential. Age-0+ northern hake nurse in a highly complex oceanographic and ecological system, where environmentally-driven changes upon their physiological status are expected. Hence, several condition (relative condition factor, hepatosomatic index, liver lipid content) and feeding (prey intake) indices were combined with physical (temperature, salinity) and biological (chlorophyll-a concentration, prey abundance) variables to determine spatial variations in age-0+ hake nutritional status. Better conditioned individuals inhabited areas of the study region where chlorophyll-a concentration and zooplanktonic prey abundance exhibited their maximum. A bottom-up control of age-0+ hake physiological status is suggested, mediated by the consumption of the herbivorous euphausiid Euphausia lucens, which was the preferred prey. These lipid-rich prey would be beneficial with respect to other available options in the environment, such as hyperid amphipods. Results complement previous observations upon individuals of the Patagonian stock, and provide a thorough insight into age-0+ Northern hake nutritional status, significantly contributing to M. hubbsi recruitment studies and management in the ACS.

AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are a major functional vegetation unit, covering extensive parts of drylands worldwide. Therefore, several multispectral indices have been proposed to map the spatial distribution and coverage of BSCs. BSCs are composed of poikilohydric organisms, the activity of which is sensitive to water availability. However, studies on dry and wet BSCs have seldom considered the mixed coverage gradient that is representative of actual field conditions. In this study, in situ spectral data and photographs of 136 pairs of dry and wet plots were collected to determine the influence of moisture conditions on BSC coverage detection. Then, BSC spectral reflectance and continuum removal (CR) reflectance responses to wetting were analyzed. Finally, the responses of four commonly used indices (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); crust index (CI); biological soil crust index (BSCI); and band depth of absorption feature after CR in the red band, (BD_red)), calculated from in situ hyperspectral data resampled to two multispectral data channels (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), were compared in dry and wet conditions. The results indicate that: (i) on average, the estimated BSC coverage using red-green-blue (RGB) images is 14.98% higher in wet than in dry conditions (P < 0.001); (ii) CR reflectance features of wet BSCs are more obvious than those of dry BSCs in both red and red-edge bands; and (iii) NDVI, CI, and BSCI for BSC coverage of 0%-60% under dry and wet conditions are close to those of dry and wet bare sand, respectively. NDVI and BD_red cannot separate dead wood and BSC with low coverage. This study demonstrates that low-coverage moss-dominated BSC is not easily detected by the four indices. In the future, remote-sensing data obtained during the rainy season with red and red-edge bands should be considered to detect BSCs.

AB  - Application of sewage sludge into soil causes changes not only in its physical and chemical properties but also in its microbiological properties. One of the tests used to estimate the microbiological soil quality is based on the fertility coefficients of the enzymatic activity. The usefulness of the biochemical index of soil fertility (BISF) for evaluating the condition of microorganisms and its dependence on the contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were evaluated in this research. Sewage sludge was introduced into soil at the following doses: 30, 75, 150, 300 and 600 t/ha. The content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and the dependence between the PAH and the biological index of the soil fertility based on the enzymatic activity of dehydrogenases, phosphatases, ureases, and the total content of organic carbon were determined.

AB  - Regional eco-environmental quality is the foundation of economic sustainable development and rational utilization of resources. It is necessary to understand and evaluate the regional eco-environmental quality correctly. Based on national remote sensing land use data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and some other statistical data, this paper established an eco-environmental quality index (EQI) model to evaluate the ecological status of Jinan from 2000 to 2011. The results of eco-environmental quality showed little variation, with EQI values ranged from 62.00 to 69.01. EQI of each region in Jinan firstly decreased sharply and then increased slowly with the development of local economy. Besides the spatial and temporal variations analysis, affecting factors of eco-environmental quality was also discussed in this article. According to the results of correlation and regression analysis, meteorological conditions (rainfall and sunshine duration) and industrial structure (the proportion of primary industry) had relatively high correlations with eco-environmental quality. To summarize, a better eco-environmental status is associated with increasing rainfall, shorter sunshine duration, and lower proportion of primary industry. This article aims to giving supporting data and decision-making bases to restore the ecological environment and promote the sustainable development of Jinan.

AB  - Monitoring changes in population levels of a wide range of species in biodiversity research and conservation requires practical, easy-to-use and efficient assessment and monitoring methods. Dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata) are a valuable tool for assessing aquatic systems and have been used as indicators of ecological health, ecological integrity, and environmental change, including climatic change, as well as indicators of habitat recovery. We field-tested a freshwater ecological integrity index, the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI), based on dragonfly assemblages at the local scale, and compared the DBI to a biodiversity index (average taxonomic distinctness. AvTD) as well as to a standard freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate-based freshwater health index (South African Scoring System, using Average Score Per Taxon, ASPT). We sampled 20 river sites, selected a priori. Adult dragonflies and benthic macroinvertebrates were collected using standardized methods. Environmental variables were collected in situ, and water samples taken. Temperature and pH were the most important physical environmental variables in explaining the assemblage structure, and we found significant abiotic-biotic relationships, as well as biotic-biotic relationships. Overall, dragonflies were more sensitive to changes in river condition than were macroinvertebrates, in part because they were responding at the species rather than higher taxonomic level. AvTD scores did not show any significant relationship with changes in river condition. Furthermore, sites with low biotic scores (indicating disturbance) had high AvTD values. In contrast, DBI site value and ASPT scores were highly significantly correlated. We conclude that dragonfly assemblages in the form of a DBI are an excellent tool for environmental assessment and monitoring freshwater biodiversity, with the potential to replace labour-intensive benthic macroinvertebrate-based freshwater quality assessments, such as SASS.

AB  - Biomass dynamics variability (BDV) of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos has been studied in 134 continental water bodies located on various continents and at different latitudes. BDV was estimated as the ratio of minimum to maximum biomass value observed during the year. BDV is shown to increase in parallel to the volume of water body and variability of the temperature. BDV is connected also with the primary production of water basins. The lowest BDV values are observed at latitudes about 10 degrees and 60 degrees, while the highest ones - close to 30 degrees. BDV values reflect the degree of complexity of communities or ecosystems. Index of endurance is suggested which prove to be low in water basins with stable conditions. It is shown that the productivity of water basins can increase only in parallel to the increase in the environmental variability, e.g. temperature conditions.

AB  - Regarding the consequential role of large benthic foraminifera associations in detecting undersea conditions, we have attempt to study these faunas in the 27 samples derived from Paleocene-Eocene sediments with a thickness of nearly 110 meters belonging to the Naghusan section located in the west Tafresh. The studied interval lithologically made up of sandy-marly limestone and tuff with a low percentage of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone. In this study, 17 species belonging to 9 genera of benthic foraminifera were identified and based on environmental index fossils, as various species of Assilina, Discocyclina and Nummulites genera, a carbonate semi-deep open marine environment has been suggested for these sediments. Indeed, an oligotrophic condition with relatively high lightening and normal salinity in a limy-sandy floor has been reported for the studied succession.

AB  - ioassessment is used worldwide to monitor aquatic health but is infrequently used with risk-assessment objectives, such as supporting the development of defensible, numerical water-quality criteria, To this end, we present a generalized approach for detecting potential ecological thresholds using assemblage-level attributes and a multimetric index (Index of Biological Integrity-IBI) as endpoints in response to numerical changes in water quality. To illustrate the approach, we used existing macroinvertebrate and surface-water total phosphorus (TP) datasets from an observed P gradient and a P-dosing experiment in wetlands of the south Florida coastal plain nutrient ecoregion. Ten assemblage attributes were identified as potential metrics using the observational data, and five were validated in the experiment. These five core metrics were subjected individually and as an aggregated Nutrient-IBI to nonparametric changepoint analysis (nCPA) to estimate cumulative probabilities of a threshold response to TP. Threshold responses were evident for all metrics and the IBI, and were repeatable through time. Results from the observed gradient indicated that a threshold was greater than or equal to50% probable between 12.6 and 19.4 mug/L TP for individual metrics and 14.8 mug/L TP for the IBI. Results from the P-dosing experiment revealed greater than or equal to50% probability of a response between 11.2 and 13.0 mug/L TP for the metrics and 12.3 mug/L TIP for the IBI. Uncertainty analysis indicated a low (typically greater than or equal to5%) probability that an IBI threshold occurred at less than or equal to 10 mug/L TP, while there was greater than or equal to95% certainty that the threshold was less than or equal to 17 mug/L TP. The weight-of-evidence produced from these analyses implies that a TP concentration > 12-15 mug/L is likely to cause degradation of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and function, a reflection of biological integrity, in the study area. This finding may assist in the development of a numerical water-quality criterion for TP in this ecoregion, and illustrates the utility of bioassessment to environmental decision-making.

AB  - The variability is under consideration of the hydrological and ecological state of the water environment of the Kolyma River mouth area. Its hydrological regime and variability of the component composition of the water environment are described. The anthropogenic load is estimated of the inflow of dissolved chemical substances to the Kolyma River mouth area. The hydrobiocenosis structure is studied from qualitative and quantitative indicators of the level of the phyto- and zooplankton development in the mouth area. The hydrobiocenosis state and structure indicate that the ecosystem of the Kolyma River mouth area is functioning under conditions of moderate pollution of the water environment and the depression effect of the biocenosis development is periodically pronounced.

AB  - A fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was adapted for use in a stream of the heavily impacted Piracicaba River basin in southeastern Brazil. The influences of land use (mainly sugar-cane crops) and an urban area on the fish community were investigated at ten sites along a 17 km-long stream during the dry and rainy season. The IBI varied with the season and location along the stream, reflecting differences between the agricultural and urban sites, which were more pronounced during the dry season. The final index was positively correlated with a Habitat Quality Index (dry season) but not with a Water Quality Index. The results can be viewed as a tool for assessing and monitoring the ecological health of streams in this watershed.

AB  - Studies that aim to characterise the susceptibility of the ecologically relevant and non-model fish polar cod (Boreogadus saida) to model carcinogens are required. Polar cod were exposed under laboratory conditions for six months to control, 0.03 mu g BaP/g fish/week and 0.3 mu g BaP/g fish/week dietary benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a reference carcinogen. The concentrations of the 3-OH-BaP bile metabolite and transcriptional responses of genes involved in DNA adduct recognition (xpc), helicase activity (xpd), DNA repair (xpf, rad51) and tumour suppression (tp53) were assessed after 0, 1, 3 and 6 months of exposure, alongside body condition indexes (gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index and condition factor). Micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities in blood and spleen, and liver histopathological endpoints were assessed at the end of the experiment. Fish grew steadily over the whole experiment and no mortality was recorded. The concentrations of 3-OH-BaP increased significantly after 1 month of exposure to the highest BaP concentration and after 6 months of exposure to all BaP concentrations showing the biotransformation of the mother compound. Nevertheless, no significant induction of gene transcripts involved in DNA damage repair or tumour suppression were observed at the selected sampling times. These results together with the absence of chromosomal damage in blood and spleen cells, the subtle increase in nuclear abnormalities observed in spleen cells and the low occurrence of foci of cellular alteration suggested that the exposure was below the threshold of observable effects. Taken together, the results showed that polar cod was not susceptible to carcinogenesis using the BaP exposure regime employed herein.

AB  - Mass die-offs of Pacific oysters have become a widespread concern in northwestern Mexico. Cultivation of the species occurs in shallow inland waters (lagoons, estuaries, and reservoirs) at high stocking densities and under elevated seasonal temperatures; all conditions that are potential causes for high die-offs. Cultivation outside inland waters may be an alternative to reduce the impact of possible stressors. This study compares growth, condition, and survival of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) cultivated at different densities within a subtropical lagoon and on the gulf side of Laguna La Cruz in the State of Sonora. Three densities were tested at each site using cultivation trays. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, seston content, and chlorophyll a content were measured at sampling stations inside and outside the lagoon. Results showed that cumulated mortality was significantly lower for oysters cultivated outside the lagoon. Peak mortality occurred in November-December 2006 and March-May 2007, which coincided with mass die-offs in the region and with abrupt changes in temperature. High variations in temperature were related to water masses from the open ocean. Lagoon oysters were influenced by slightly higher mean daily temperatures and showed continuous shell growth and were significantly larger than oysters on the gulf side. However, lagoon oysters showed similar dry weights as gulf side oysters, indicating retarded somatic growth, probably from a relatively low food supply. Gulfside oysters had a higher condition index than oysters in the lagoon throughout the period of study. Results showed that oysters were sensitive to overstocking, since growth at high densities was less than at low densities at both sites. This suggested an advantage for cultivation at intermediate and low densities. Although C. gigas responded in a similar way to overstocking at both sites, they responded differently in relation to culture site. Diminished somatic growth, condition, and survival suggest that oysters in the lagoon experienced more stress than oysters at the gulfside site, probably from differences in water quality. Cultivation of these oysters outside of protected waters is an alternative that producers may try to obtain a better product and reduce mortality. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) has long-term effects on water quality compared to dissolved matter (DM) during downstream transfer after inflows into an aquatic environment. In the present study, the characteristics, behavior, and effects of PM from an urban watershed under photo-irradiation were investigated through sequential resuspensions before being compared. Changes in the organic matter content, heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Zn, Pb), spectroscopic indices (SUVA254, slope ratio (SR), humidification index (HIX), fluorescence index (FI), and biological index (BIX)), excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis components (EEMPARAFAC), and disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP) were analyzed. According to our results, light enhanced the release of organic matter from PM but reduced dissolved heavy metals. The PMU affected by urban-derived pollutants (i.e., rainfall particles, road-deposited sediment, sewer-pipeline-deposited sediment) exhibited higher quantities of terrestrial humic-like organic matter than PMR, which contains base particles from riverines (i.e., soil, sediments). For the PMU, the humic-like fluorescent components (C1 and C2) enhanced under light conditions with every resuspension, whereas the components decreased in the PMR. Consistent with the PARAFAC results, the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of the PMU was enhanced by approximately 2.8 times more than that of the PMR, and exhibited a high correlation with the fluorescent components (C1, r = 0.81, p < 0.001). The principal component analysis results also confirmed that the characteristics of dynamic exchanges between PM and DM were distinguished by PM sources and light, and the photo-released DM and their spectral characteristics displayed opposite behaviors depending on the PM sources during the sequential resuspensions.

AB  - Some pea crabs are parasite of bivalves and may cause a significant effect on the host's condition. In this study, the prevalence of the pea crab Afropinnotheres monodi and its effect on host condition are assessed for two commercially important bivalves (the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the cockle Cerastoderma edule) from three natural beds of the Gulf of Cadiz (SW of Iberian Peninsula). The average prevalence of A. monodi ranged from 4.0% (Bay of Cadiz) to 51.4% (Carreras River) for cockles and from 30.5% (Bay of Cadiz) to 45.4% (Carreras River) for mussels. For both hosts, most bivalves were infested by a single pea crab (96.0% of cockles and 92.4% of mussels); among multiple infestations, one male and one female was the dominant combination (72.7% of cockles and 77.8% of mussels). Infested mussels showed a significantly decreased condition index (14.7%, on average), whereas crab infestation did not significantly affect the condition index of cockles (2.2%, on average). When the wet weight of the pea crab represented> 5% of the wet weight of the host, an average condition loss of 12.7% and 15.9% were observed for cockles and mussels, respectively. As the relative condition loss of both mussels and cockles was negatively correlated with the relative size of the pea crab, the mentioned interspecific differences in the pea crab effects may be mainly due to the higher prevalence of soft females (larger size and obligatory parasitism) in mussels (70.6%, on average) and of hard females and males (smaller size and facultative parasitism) in cockles (81.1%, on average). This study highlights the importance of knowing the life cycle and host use of the pea crab A. monodi to ascertain the possible negative effect of this parasite on mussel farms and exploited cockle beds.

AB  - Burned area mapping is an essential step in the forest fire research to investigate the relationship between forest fire and climate change and the effect of forest fire on carbon budgets. This study proposed an algorithm to map forest fire burned area using the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiameter (MODIS) time series data in Heilongjiang Province, China. The algorithm is divided into two steps: Firstly, the 'core' pixels were extracted to represent the most possible burned pixels based on the comparison of the temporal change of Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), Burned Area Index (BAI) and MODIS active fire products between pre- and post-fires. Secondly, a 15-km distance was set to extract the entire burned areas near the 'core' pixels as more relaxed conditions were used to identify the fire pixels for reducing the omission error as much as possible. The algorithm comprehensively considered the thermal characteristics and the spectral change between pre- and post-fires, which are represented by the MODIS fire products and the spectral index, respectively. Tahe, Mohe and Huma counties of Heilongjiang Province, China were chosen as the study area for burned area mapping and a time series of burned maps were produced from 2000 to 2011. The results show that the algorithm can extract burned areas more accurately with the highest accuracy of 96.61%.

AB  - Wetland is a special ecosystem formed by the interaction between water and land, which cannot be separated from the support and protection of water resources. Therefore, it is necessary to study the ecological environment water demand of wetland. This paper takes the sediment-laden river wetland-Sanmenxia Reservoir wetland as an example, constructed the calculation model of 10 indexes of consumable eco-environmental water demand and non-consumable eco-environmental water demand. At the same time, 3S technology was used to extract the area of various types of the Sanmenxia Reservoir wetland, the monthly water demand process and the annual optimal eco-environmental water demand of the Sanmenxia Reservoir wetland were calculated under the conditions of average precipitation for many years. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) On the basis of other scholar's research, increased water requirement indicators such as environmental purification water requirement, leaky water requirement, landscape protected water requirement and recreational water requirement. (2) The total water requirement for the most suitable eco-environmental in the Sanmenxia Reservoir is 16.6918.5 x 10(8) m(3). Meanwhile, considering the particularity of the operation mode of Sanmenxia Reservoir, this study gives the process of the most suitable eco-environmental monthly water demand, which provides a scientific basis for the optimal allocation of wetland water resources in the reservoir. (3) Non-consumable eco-environmental water demand in Sanmenxia Reservoir is the main type of water demand, and among all types of eco-environmental water demand indexes, environmental purification water requirement is the largest. Therefore, controlling pollutant discharge is the primary task for the ecological environment restoration of Sanmenxia Reservoir.

AB  - The effect of a regular rise in fertility and egg weight as body weight increases is shown for 39 species of crustaceans belonging to various orders of the class and living in different ecological conditions. Fertility and egg weight are interrelated by a negative correlation, with fertility rising faster than egg weight with an increase in body size for various species. Reproductive effort is a species-specific index and does not depend on the ability of the females of various species to produce a certain number of ovipositions during their life cycle.

AB  - Altitudinal preferences, somatic and population adaptations in different ecological conditions were analysed in flightless bush-cricket species Polysarcus denticauda (Charpentier, 1825). Altitudinal analysis was performed in GIS software (more than 60 sites in Slovakia, Central Europe). Seasonal occurrence and population density were recorded in selected sites. To compare differences, absolute values of measurements (length of body, hind femur and tibia, cerci and weight) and Body Condition Index were taken from males. Study species prefers mesophilous montane up to alpine meadows in higher elevations (over 600 in a.s.l.). The development started over one month earlier in lowlands and populations reached several fold higher density there. Males from lowlands had body parameters significantly bigger apart from cerci. Cerci were significantly longer in males from mountains. However, males of the same size were significantly heavier in higher attitudes. In conclusion, refuges of montane meadows ecosystem support species survival nowadays.

KW  - FISH
AB  - Day and night electrofishing catches were compared for sampling effectiveness and diel movements of fish to and from near-shore waters of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers. Standardized methods were used to collect same-day paired samples by sampling during the day, displacing the catch, and resampling after twilight. Night catches contained significantly higher numbers of species, individuals (excluding Dorosoma cepedianum), weight, and biological index scores (Modified Index of Well-Being [MIwb] and Index of Biotic Integrity [IBI]). Night versus day paired samples in the Ohio and Muskingum rivers showed, respectively, mean increases of 7.6 and 4.6 species, 229 and 417 fish per km (excluding D. cepedianum), 18.2 and 30.4 kg/km, 2.3 and 1.5 MIwb units, and 10.8 and 8.7 IBI units. Total night catches yielded, respectively, 43% and 15% more taxa, 62% and 160% greater numbers (excluding D. cepedianum), and 50% and 70% more weight than total day catches. Catch differences were primarily attributed to diel movements from off-shore to near-shore waters during the evening-twilight period. Taxa which increased the most at night in the Ohio River were: Alosa chrysochloris, Notropis wickliffi, Ictiobus bubalus, Moxostoma anisurum, M. duquesnei, Ictalurus punctatus, Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops, Ambloplites rupestris, Stizostedion canadense, and Aplodinotus grunniens; and in the Muskingum River. Ictiobus bubalus, Moxostoma anisurum, and Morone chrysops. Standardized night electrofishing is an effective sampling technique for many mainstem species and provides a better, more complete biological assessment than day electrofishing. Therefore, it should be incorporated into long-term monitoring programs for these large, deep rivers. The findings of this study may also be applicable to other large, deep bodies of water elsewhere.

AB  - Bivalve species may be susceptible to environmental estrogenic compounds including estradiol (E-2). However, they are able to biotransform the hormone quite readily and inactivate its estrogenic action. To study the long-term effects of elevated free E-2 tissue levels, we transiently exceeded the biotransformation capacity of the clam Ruditapes decussatus by exposing them with high E-2 concentrations (400 ng/L) and subsequently study the consequences on gametogenesis during the following reproductive cycle. Exposure to 400 ngE(2)/L led to a significant increase in tissue free E-2 levels, which reached 10-50 ng E(2)Eq/gww. No deleterious effect on gonado-somatic index (GSI), condition index (CI), or ability to respond to the stress on stress test could be detected after a month of exposure, suggesting the absence of negative effects on the clam's health. However, a marked increase in gametogenesis could be observed in both sexes during the exposure. Subsequent transplantation of the clams in the field allowed the normal development of the male clams and maturation of the gonads without any detrimental effect observed after 4 months. In contrast, in early July, all female clams formerly exposed to E-2 showed lower health status, and only ovaries with atretic oocytes while all control and indigenous females were normal and mature. These results show a sex-specific effect of high E-2 exposure and suggest either a direct or indirect role for E-2 in R. decussatus' reproduction.

A detailed electromagnetic transient model was developed for the ST embedded in the network, and a comprehensive control technique was proposed for the operation of the ST. To implement the models in real time, a state-of-the-art high performance PC-cluster-based real-time simulator was used. The ST model and the controller are implemented using a custom C program in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The execution time of the entire system is only 75 mu s on a simulation time-step of 100 mu s. Real-time oscilloscope results are provided to show the validity of the model under steady-state and transient conditions.

AB  - Web-building spiders are an important model system to address questions in a variety of biological fields. They are attractive because of their intriguing biology and because they can be fairly easily collected and maintained in the laboratory. However, the only published instructions for working with web-building spiders are somewhat Outdated and not easily accessible. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date guide on how to best collect, keep and study web-building spiders. In particular, it describes how to obtain spiders by capturing them or by raising them from cocoons, how to keep and feed spiders in the laboratory and how to encourage them to build webs. Finally it describes how to document and analyze web building and web structure.

AB  - A site-specific approach is presented to characterize terrain and target visibility and terrain clutter as seen by a shipboard radar in a coastal environment. The method takes into account the location of the ship, the particular terrain topography, the radar parameters, and the propagation effect. The method incorporates atmospheric refractive index conditions surrounding the radar, an optical ray-trace model, an electromagnetic parabolic equation model, a database of terrain elevations, and a clutter model. The model can simulate illuminated and shadowed regions of both surface clutter and elevated targets. Simulated clutter results are shown to compare favorably with clutter data measured at S-band, X-band, and Ku-band. This correspondence is evident in gee-graphic patterns and statistical distributions of clutter on directly illuminated terrain surfaces.

AB  - This investigation was aimed at contributing to develop a suitable multi-biomarker approach for pollution monitoring in mangrove-lined Caribbean coastal systems using as sentinel species, the mangrove cupped oyster, Crassostrea rhizophorae. A pilot field study was carried out in 8 localities (3 in Nicaragua; 5 in Colombia), characterized by different environmental conditions and subjected to different levels and types of pollution. Samples were collected in the rainy and dry seasons of 2012-2013. The biological effects at different levels of biological complexity (Stress-on-Stress response, reproduction, condition index, tissue-level biomarkers and histopathology) were determined as indicators of health disturbance, integrated as IBR/n index, and compared with tissue burdens of contaminants in order to achieve an integrative biomonitoring approach. Though modulated by natural variables and confounding factors, different indicators of oyster health, alone and in combination, were related to the presence of different profiles and levels of contaminants present at low-to-moderate levels. Different mixtures of persistent (As, Cd, PAHs) and emerging chemical pollutants (musk fragrances), in combination with different levels of organic and particulate matter resulting from seasonal oceanographic variability and sewage discharges, and environmental factors (salinity, temperature) elicited a different degree of disturbance in ecosystem health condition, as reflected in sentinel C. rhizophorae. As a result, IBR/nwas correlated with pollution indices, even though the levels of biological indicators of health disturbance and pollutants were low-to-moderate, and seasonality and the incidence of confounding factors were remarkable. Our study supports the use of simple methodological approaches to diagnose anomalies in the health status of oysters from different localities and to identify potential causing agents and reflect disturbances in ecosystem health. Consequently, the easy methodological approach used herein is useful for the assessment of health disturbance in a variety of mangrove-lined Caribbean coastal systems using mangrove cupped oysters as sentinel species.

AB  - Measurements ill paired stream reaches with and without livestock access ill Southwestern Virginia suggest that livestock exclusion practices installed oil short, isolated stream reaches result ill improved geomorphic and riparian vegetation conditions, but do not significantly improve benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Numerous state and federal programs encourage agricultural producers to protect environmentally sensitive lauds (Such as streams, and wetlands) through the elimination of livestock access. to these sensitive areas. Ill addition to achieving soil conservation goals, it is widely believed that livestock exclusion from streams will result in improvements ill riparian vegetation, channel morphology, as well as instream habitat and aquatic insect assemblages. This research assessed the changes in channel morphology, riparian vegetation, and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages as affected by livestock exclusion over time. Study sites consisted of paired, nearly contiguous stream reaches (five pairs), with and without active livestock access, across a range of time since livestock exclusion was implemented. Four of the livestock exclusion reaches ranged in time since best management practice implementation from I to 14 years. while one site consisted of a grazed reach paired with a reach that has been forested and without cattle access for at least 50 years. Livestock exclusion reaches were significantly deeper, had larger median riffle Substrate, and scored higher oil the Reach Condition Index (a qualitative geomorphic assessment methodology). The livestock exclusion reaches also had significantly higher riparian groundcover vegetation biomass; however, the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were not significantly different. The only parameter that showed correlation with time since livestock exclusion was the Reach Condition Index, which increased indicating improved bank with time since livestock exclusion. Our observations suggest that, While livestock exclusion from streams has positive impacts oil streams, best management practice implementation along short stream stretches does not have the desired instream benefits. In particular, benthic macroinvertebrate response depends more oil upstream watershed-scale conditions and impacts than localized, reach-scale livestock-access issues. Therefore, a more targeted approach addressing entire stream lengths and the associated watersheds may be required to restore the integrity of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Whilst studies of life satisfaction are becoming more common-place, their global coverage is far from complete. This paper develops a new database of life satisfaction scores for 178 countries, bringing together subjective well-being data from four surveys and using stepwise regression to estimate scores for nations where no subjective data are available. In doing so, we explore various factors that predict between-nation variation in subjective life satisfaction, building on Vemuri and Costanza's (Vemuri, A.W., & Costanza, R., 2006. The role of human, social, built, and natural capital in explaining life satisfaction at the country level: toward a National Well-Being Index (NWI). Ecological Economics, 58:119-133.) four capitals model. The main regression model explains 76% of variation in existing subjective scores; importantly, this includes poorer nations that had proven problematic in Vemuri and Costanza's (Vemuri, A.W., & Costanza, R., 2006. The role of human, social, built, and natural capital in explaining life satisfaction at the country level: toward a National Well-Being Index (NWI). Ecological Economics, 58:119-133.) study. Natural, human and sociopolitical capitals are all found to be strong predictors of life satisfaction. Built capital, operationalised as GDP, did not enter our regression model, being overshadowed by the human capital and socio-political capital factors that it inter-correlates with. The final database presents a stop-gap resource that, until robust surveys are carried out worldwide, allows comparisons of subjective life satisfaction between nations to be made with reasonable confidence.

AB  - In this work we compare two Iberian and a pan-European fish-based methods to assess ecological quality in rivers: the Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity for Portuguese Wadeable Streams (F-IBIP), the Mediterranean Index of Biotic Integrity (IBIMED) and the pan-European Fish Index (EFI +). The results presented herein were developed in the context of the 2nd phase of the Intercalibration Exercise (IC), as required by the Water Frame Directive (WFD). The IC is aimed at ensuring comparability of the quality boundaries among the different WFD assessment methods developed by the Member States for each biological quality element. Although the two national assessment methods were developed for very distinct regions of Iberia (Western and Eastern Iberian Peninsula) they share the same methodological background: both are type-specific and guild-based multimetric indices. EFI + is a multimetric guild-based model, but it is site-specific and uses a predictive modelling approach. The three indices were computed for all sites included in the Iberian Intercalibration database to allow the direct comparison, by means of linear regressions, of the resulting three quality values per site. The quality boundary harmonization between the two Iberian methods was only possible through an indirect comparison between the two indices, using EFI+ as a common metric. The three indices were also shown to be responsive to a common set of human induced pressures. This study highlights the need to develop general assessment methods adapted to wide geographical ranges with high species turnover to help intercalibrating assessment methods tailored for geographically more restricted regions.

AB  - An experimental and numerical investigation is presented concerning the transient and steady-state natural convection of water through its density maximum in a rectangular enclosure with the vertical end walls held at different temperatures.  The water in the enclosure is initially at a uniform temperature above the density maximum at 3.98 C, and then the temperature of the cold wall is suddenly reduced to and maintained at 0 C.  Experimental flow patterns are presented for 5 and 8 C initial and hot wall temperatures.  A pH indicator technique is used to visualize the convective flow patterns in the enclosure.  Numerical solutions of the convective flow patterns are presented for transient and steady-state natural convection, and are shown to be in good agreement with experimental flow patterns.  The effect of the density inversion on the transient convective flow patterns was dominant at a 5 C initial and hot wall temperature.  Steady-state results for an 8 C initial and hot wall temperature show an asymmetric convective flow pattern with the dominant flow cell being above the density inversion.

AB  - The waterway from Chongqing to Yibin in the upper Yangtze River provides strong support for the socioeconomic development in Western China, while it also has a negative influence on the river ecosystem, such as river fragmentation, wetland disconnectivity, fish habitat, and biodiversity. Accurately characterizing the exploitation, economic efficiency, and ecological pressure of the waterway from Chongqing to Yibin is of great significance for the further development of the upper Yangtze River. In this study, based on statistical data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the waterway development, economic benefits, and ecological pressure of the waterway from Chongqing to Yibin were evaluated. The sustainability index (SI) was introduced to comprehensively assess the sustainability of waterways using the hierarchical model, which integrates the exploitation ratio (ER), economic efficiency index (EEI), and ecological pressure index (EPI). A relatively low ER (41.04%), a low consistency index (CI, 0.31), a high EEI (9037.18 USA$/gha), and a low EPI (0.33) yielded an SI of 0.70, indicating that the waterway from Chongqing to Yibin in the upper Yangtze River is in a sustainable development stage. Compared with the typical global Golden Inland Waterways, the waterway from Chongqing to Yibin still has great development potential under the prioritizing ecological protection.

AB  - The signal for climate change effects can be abstruse; consequently, interpretations of evidence must avoid verisimilitude, or else misattribution of causality could compromise policy decisions. Examining climatic effects on wild animal population dynamics requires ability to trap, observe or photograph and to recapture study individuals consistently. In this regard, we use 19years of data (1994-2012), detailing the life histories on 1179 individual European badgers over 3288 (re-) trapping events, to test whether trapping efficiency was associated with season, weather variables (both contemporaneous and time lagged), body-condition index (BCI) and trapping efficiency (TE). PCA factor loadings demonstrated that TE was affected significantly by temperature and precipitation, as well as time lags in these variables. From multi-model inference, BCI was the principal driver of TE, where badgers in good condition were less likely to be trapped. Our analyses exposed that this was enacted mechanistically via weather variables driving BCI, affecting TE. Notably, the very conditions that militated for poor trapping success have been associated with actual survival and population abundance benefits in badgers. Using these findings to parameterize simulations, projecting best-/worst-case scenario weather conditions and BCI resulted in 8.6% +/- 4.9 SD difference in seasonal TE, leading to a potential 55.0% population abundance under-estimation under the worst-case scenario; 38.6% over-estimation under the best case. Interestingly, simulations revealed that while any single trapping session might prove misrepresentative of the true population abundance, due to weather effects, prolonging capture-mark-recapture studies under sub-optimal conditions decreased the accuracy of population estimates significantly. We also use these projection scenarios to explore how weather could impact government-led trapping of badgers in the UK, in relation to TB management. We conclude that population monitoring must be calibrated against the likelihood that weather conditions could be altering trap success directly, and therefore biasing model design.

AB  - Estuarine environments are highly heterogeneous habitats where numerous organisms interact with each other. Aquaculture systems encompass such interactions, and the eventual yields depend on how the cultivated species respond to the environmental heterogeneity. Marine mussels are calcifying organisms that rely on calcium carbonate shell and byssus filaments secreted during their lifetime to protect soft vital tissues against aggressive (abiotic and biotic) environments. Nevertheless, these protective structures can be energetically costly, depending on the environment, thus affecting the energy allocation patterns in the organism. Consequently, other important fitness parameters for the aquaculture industry, such as soft tissue condition and market value, may also be affected. Here, we present a spatial and temporal analysis of the protective and soft tissues responses in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the inter-location variability in individual's performance and the corresponding main environmental drivers. Local environment with regard to food availability and hydrodynamics impact very distinctly mussel tenacity and shell thickening, e.g., higher-energy environments at the outer exposed zones caused individuals secreted stronger byssus and thicker shells. By contrast, the state of soft tissues (condition index) was similar between very distinct and distant outer exposed and inner sheltered zones due to differences in both environmental drivers. A novel, intuitive ecological index that measures the impact of both protective and soft tissues was developed and is discussed in relation to cultivation timing. The data presented provides the basis for understanding the natural variability in energetic requirements for different vital tissues in bivalve mollusk that support survival and growth. We report the scientific basis for management actions aimed to shortening the cultivation cycle in the aquaculture sector. These actions are based on the combined use of the PROFIT index and other aquaculture practices (e.g., modifying density). PROFIT helps to identify when the quality of the product, understood as PROtection and FITness strategies, would be best suited for the market.

AB  - Cage fish farming is an important economic activity in Brazil where tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the main cultivated species. To investigate the cage fish farm as a vector for golden mussel invasion, we hypothesised that: (1) Limnoperna fortunei, a freshwater bivalve mollusc, finds greater food availability in the cage fish farm; (2) the cage fish farm favours mollusc colonisation and its nutritional status; and (3) its performance in the reservoir would vary over the year. We obtained data from limnological variables as well as the number of larvae and adult individuals, to evaluate condition index (CI) monthly from February 2015 to January of 2016. We established sampling stations at three points with fish farming and three points without fish farming (controls) in the Canoas II Reservoir, Paranapanema River, Brazil. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify spatial and temporal distribution of samples according to limnological variables. We performed a linear mixed model analysis to test the hypothesis of no difference between areas (fish farm and control) and time (months) for larval density and CI of L. fortunei. The first PCA axis (28.48% of variance) revealed a temporal gradient, showing the separation between cold and hot months. The second PCA axis (19.61% of variance) separated the samples of control and fish farms; fish farms displayed higher concentrations of total phosphorus, nitrite, and chlorophyll a. Larval densities of L. fortunei were higher in fish cage areas with time being responsible for 35% of this variation. Mussel CI was also higher in fish farms and time was responsible for 36% of the variation. We conclude that fish production in cages contributes to the establishment of golden mussels in the reservoir. Our results serve as a warning that other molluscs or invasive species may be favoured by aquaculture activities in aquatic environments. The colonisation of the mussel in the reservoir varies during the year in response to seasonality.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the impact of land use patterns on water quality and benthic diatom community structure and to test the applicability of diatom indices developed in other regions of the world to a small temperate southern African river system. Sampling was conducted at eight study sites along the length of the river on four separate occasions. Multivariate data analyses were performed on the diatom community dataset to specify the main gradients of floristic variation and to detect and visualize similarities in diatom samples in relation to land-use patterns within the catchment. One hundred and twelve (112) diatom species belonging to 36 genera were recorded during the study. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that variations in the benthic diatom community structure were best explained by ammonium, nitrate, conductivity, pH, temperature, resistivity and water flow. OMNIDIA was used for calculation of selected diatom water quality indices. A number of the indices, e.g., the trophic diatom index (TDI), eutrophication/pollution index and biological index of water quality (BIWQ), either under-or over-estimated the water quality of the system. With few exceptions, there were no significant correlations (p>0.05) between the diatom indices' values and the nutrient variables. The absence of any significant correlations between the diatom indices' values and selected physico-chemical variables suggests that indices developed in other regions of the world may not be suitable for temperate southern African rivers.

AB  - Changes in temperature, precipitation, and adverse weather across the U.S. Corn Belt associated with anthropogenic climate change may have an effect on corn (Zea mays L.) condition ratings in one of the leading corn production regions in the world. Using USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service data, this study aims to quantify the correlation of corn condition ratings with climate variables and yield, understand intergrowing season behavior of corn condition ratings, and quantify spatiotemporal trends of ratings across the U.S. Midwest (1986-2020). With an existing statistically significant (95% confidence level) correlation between corn condition ratings, Palmer drought indices, precipitation, temperature, and detrended corn yield, it is validated that qualitive rating data should be further examined. Using the Crop Condition Index (CCI), corn condition ratings supportive of positive yield prospects subtly decrease from June to September on average. The CCI values increased within June (ranging from 0.08 to 0.40 CCI yr(-1)),but subtly decreased within July and onward throughout the Midwest (ranging from -0.02 to -0.62 CCI yr(-1) over the past 35 yr. From an interannual perspective, corn condition ratings supportive of extreme degrees of yield loss have significantly increased in 7 of the 12 Midwest states (ranging from 0.15 to 0.30% yr(-1)). Thus, increasing yields despite decreases in corn condition ratings suggests crop advancements such as hybrids and management have offset environment challenges with corn quality. These advancements need to be a continuing effort under a changing climate given rating trends, and corn condition ratings can provide essential risk assessment information for corn producers and other stakeholders.

AB  - Tourism in marine environments is growing each year, especially in regions with attractive coastlines. One of the main activities practised by tourists is offering food, normally bread, to fish. This activity can result in negative impacts that are still not fully understood. Such impacts were previously detected among omnivores, but fish at other trophic levels also respond to feeding by humans. The effects of supplementary fish feeding by tourists on the diet of a coral reef predatorial haemulid fish, a common reef fish in many tourist destinations, were analysed. Specimens were sampled from one location in which tourists frequently feed the fish and another in which fish maintain their natural diet, both in a marine protected area. The standard length, total weight, hepatosomatic index, condition factor, starch content, and diet composition of fish from the two locations were compared. Specimens fed by tourists were generally larger than those consuming a natural diet, but weight, hepatosomatic index, and condition factor were not statistically different. Diet composition varied between the two areas, with almost half of the stomach contents from specimens collected in the supplementary feeding area composed of starch. Considering the natural diet of this species, carbohydrate ingestion can interfere with energy accumulation. Additionally, natural prey species were being consumed on a smaller scale. These results shed light on the controversial issue of supplementary fish feeding as a tourist attraction and provide information to help shape effective ecotourism management. In this regard, the offered food volume should be banned in more sensitive environments, reduced in remaining areas and food quality should be controlled to make ecotourism a more sustainable activity globally.

AB  - For years we have been observing the exponential trend of the economic growth, energy consumption, mineral resources use and greenhouse gas emissions. The human population is exerting an increasing pressure on the environment, which in the highly industrialised regions has lost its natural ability for bio-capacity. The measurement of the member states' progress in achieving the sustainable development is an integral part of the European Union strategy. The article deals with methods of measuring the level of sustainable development and presents diversification of the EU member states according to the synthetic indicators, such as: domestic material consumption, import dependency, risky external energy supply, diversity index, ecological footprint and total carbon intensity. These determinants affecting potential of the EU states to maintain the achieved level of development in future.

AB  - Developing economies are facing multifaceted problems like dramatic increase in motorized traffic, urban heat island, urban sprawl, and climatic changes. Environmental Performance Index report states that Pakistan is on 169 among 180 countries due to ill-planned development on prime agriculture land, poor air, water quality, and jeopardizing ecosystem of the country. The change of land uses from the natural to the built environment has created problems like loss of vegetation and habitat, enlarged surface flow, and heavy floods. However, this study addresses this core issue by taking responses from the residents of Lahore, Pakistan. Current research focuses on the willingness and perception of residents regarding the adaptation of green roof technology. The resident perceptions are obtained by a structured questionnaire and analyzed by using statistical techniques. The findings of the research highlight that adaptation of green roof is primarily linked with the four factors, i.e., awareness of green roof among all stakeholders, special provision in building regulation concerning green roof, sustainable environmental consciousness, and subsidized cost of green roof materials.

AB  - The Ecological Footprint is a synthetic index useful to assess sustainability of anthropic systems. Its operational use, however, has been hampered by some difficulties, especially at a local scale. Being conceived as a measure of the biologically productive area requested to sustain individual consumptions in a human community, it leaves out the impacts associated to economic activities. Accordingly. the index cannot contribute much to define local policies, whose target are economic activities, and only marginally affect citizens' behaviour. Ecological Footprint calculation scheme can be modified to include the depletion of natural capital due to local activities such as industry, agriculture, tertiary sector, transport, waste and water management. We provide here an approach which takes into account these different aspects. while we discuss its application to a municipal area as a case study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diatoms are siliceous micro-algae and have been used with increasing frequency as bioindicators in aquatic ecosystems. Typically, European diatom indices have been modified and augmented with data on taxa endemic to and commonly found in other parts of the world. In order to further test the application of diatom indices, water quality and diatom sampling were performed in the Bloukrans River system, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Nine sites with contrasting water quality were sampled along the length of the river in February, May and July 2018. Multivariate statistical analysis (Canonical Correspondence Analysis) was employed to elucidate spatiotemporal differences in diatom community structure. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that differences in diatom community assemblages were best explained by dissolved oxygen, temperature, nitrate, conductivity and phosphate. Diatom-based indices incorporated in OMNIDIA software were also applied to assess the integrity of the water quality as indicated by diatom communities. Several foreign indices (e.g. the trophic diatom index (TDI), biological diatom index (BDI)) and the South African Diatom Index (SADI) were used in the study. The SADI demonstrated that the Bloukrans River was impacted and had significant correlations with water quality variables (p < .05). We therefore recommend the wider use of the SADI as an indicator of water quality conditions in South African lotic systems. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A healthy aquatic ecosystem plays an important role in the operation of nature and the survival of human beings. Understanding the mechanism of its interaction with the habitat process is conducive to formulating targeted ecological recovery plans. In this study, fish and macroinvertebrates were collected from 49 investigation sites in the Weihe River basin, China, during periods of the summer and the autumn of 2017. Cluster analysis and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were used to analyze the similarity of community distribution of fish and macroinvertebrates and their response to environmental variables. The biological integrity index of fish (F-IBI) and benthic-macroinvertebrate (B-IBI) was introduced to evaluate the aquatic ecological health. The results showed that fish communities were more coherent than macroinvertebrate communities. The distinguished response to ecological factors was identified for fish and macroinvertebrates. The ecological factors of total nitrogen, conductivity and river width have significant effects on both fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In addition, the fish community was significantly influenced by chlorine, fluorine, pH and flow velocity, while the macroinvertebrate community was significantly influenced by bicarbonate and water depth. The differences in community structure and response to ecological factors between communities were amplified in their environmental quality scores. Although F-IBI and B-IBI tend to be consistent temporally, the correlation is not significant. B-IBI showed decreasing gradient of ecological health status in the downstream area, while F-IBI tended to be different across river systems, which further illustrated the differences in the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to environmental variables.

AB  - Based on the materials of summer phytoplankton studies in 2016-2018, an assessment of the ecological state of the Novosibirsk Reservoir is given. A total of 292 species and intraspecific taxa (SIT) from 8 divisions have been identified; the basis of the species richness is formed by diatoms and green algae. For the first time, 96 SIT have been found in the reservoir. The dominant phytoplankton complex and its changes in the interannual aspect along the longitudinal axis of the reservoir are characterized. The trophic status of the reservoir generally corresponds to the eutrophic category of water. An analysis of the structural indicators of phytoplankton and changes in the dominant complex in comparison with the end of the 20th century shows that the process of anthropogenic eutrophication is accelerating in the reservoir.

AB  - In recent decades the definition of standard test methodologies suitable for use in assessing the biological stability of solid waste has become increasingly imperative. To meet this requirement, the BOD5/COD ratio, measured on waste eluate, has been proposed by Cossu et al. (2012) as a more appropriate parameter than the traditional respirometric indices and biogas production measured directly on solid samples. However, to ensure reproducibility, the parameter should undergo standardization of operational conditions.
   Previous studies have demonstrated that: the testing mode (static or dynamic) does not influence test representativeness; the long testing time (>6 h) does not influence BOD5/COD ratio; COD measured on unfiltered or filtered samples is consistent and significant in both cases.
   The main aim of this study was to further promote the standardization of this parameter. A series of static leaching tests on representative samples of five types of waste was carried out under different operative conditions: contact time, liquid to solid ratio and pretreatment.
   The results obtained demonstrate: the apparent adequacy of a short contact time (2 h), which is highly preferable and would speed up the procedure; a low liquid to solid ratio (5 1/ITTS) which is recommended as a water saving strategy; the applicability of centrifugation of the eluate prior to analysis which is faster that filtration method.

AB  - Considering the need for the Brazilian government to develop tools for environmental monitoring for biodiversity conservancy purposes in the national protected areas system, this paper focuses on determining reference site metrics (or baselines) for adapting the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) based on the fish assemblages in the Pantanal National Park (PNP). The habitats in the PNP were grouped into four categories: main rivers, corixos (channels connecting the floodplain), permanent bays, and temporary bays. Fish samplings were performed at 12 points during the dry season (Oct-Nov 2010 and 2011). 146 fish species were identified from the total 18,954 individuals collected with standardized fishing gear. There was no association between the structure of the fish assemblage and categories, suggesting a theory on homogeneity of habitats. The final IBI PNP consists of nine metrics, most of them were framed in excellent class, some in fair, and none in poor. There was no significant difference in IBI PNP scores between the two sampled years. This approach provides a direct application for wetland management purposes.

AB  - Typical pollutants in sediments from 22 sampling sites of the Yangtze river estuary in 2006 were investigated in the present study. Arsenic, mercury, cadmium, copper, chromium, zinc, lead, and polychlorinated biphenyls of the Yangtze river estuary sediments were found as 6.49-17.6, 0.0164-0.0987, 0.059-0.319, 11.7-46.6, 10.5-113, 44.5-125, 14.8-32.7, and 0.0006-0.0026 mg/kg, respectively. Results indicated the presence of a contamination in the Yangtze river estuary. Through analyzing the contents of typical pollutants in sediments with adopting the index number techniques of Muller geoaccumulation index and Hakanson ecological risk factors and index, the quality status of these sediments were evaluated. Furthermore, the potential ecological risks of the estuary were determined quantitatively. The overall environmental quality of typical pollutants was generally in a good condition in most sites. The results showed that arsenic was the main environmental pollution factor, and cadmium was the main potential ecological factor. The highest potential ecological risk index appeared in the south branch of the Yangtze river, which was mainly due to terrestrial pollution in Shanghai. The results of this study can be used for decision makers to prioritize measures to control the pollution for these typical pollutants.

AB  - Often when various estuarine benthic indices disagree in their assessments of benthic condition, they are reflecting different aspects of benthic condition. We describe a process to screen indices for associations and, after identifying candidate metrics, evaluate metrics individually against the indices. We utilize radar plots as a multi-metric visualization tool, and conditional probability plots and receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate associations seen in the plots, We investigated differences in two indices, the US EPA Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program's benthic index for the Virginian Province and the New York Harbor benthic index of biotic integrity using data collected in New York Harbor and evaluated overall agreement of the indices and associations between each index and measures of habitat and sediment contamination. The indices agreed in approximately 78% of the cases. The New York Harbor benthic index of biotic integrity showed stronger associations with sediment metal contamination and grain size.

In this sense, in the present work we report the microbial activity of three soils selected by age of deforestation as determined by microcalorimetry at 25 degreesC and its correlation with organic matter content and colony formation units in two growth media. Also the effect of a worm-composite, currently used as soil fertiliser, on the poorest soil is evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sustainability of animal production systems is a dynamic and continously process not a state and has variable aspects for different regions and parts of the world.
   To put sustainability of animal production in concrete terms indicator systems are used to describe what is causing changes in environmental conditions (driving force), what are the effects on the environment (state) and what are the actions in the public sector to respond to changes in the state of the environment (response).
   The study present some important indicators to access sustainability in (intensively) animal production systems specially a set of environmental performance indicators (nitrogen surplus, nutrient efficiency, emissions and heavy metalls in manure).

AB  - The development of microbial community-based biological indicators for assessing aquatic ecological status is urgently needed in heavily impaired regions, due to the local extinction of traditional indicator macroorganisms. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a microbial community-based index of biotic integrity (MC-IBI) for the assessment of rivers in the Taihu Basin, China. MC-IBI was developed based on sediment samples collected from 55 sites of 42 rivers, with least disturbed sites as reference sites. High-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR methods were employed to measure the microbial diversity and abundance of the samples. A total of 341 candidate metrics related to microbial diversity, composition, pollution tolerance and function categories were established based on microbial data. Five core metrics, including% FCA (percentage of Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria), log 16S rRNA/ARG (log the ratio of 16S rRNA gene to antibiotic resistance gene), log AOB/AOA (log the ratio of ammonium oxidizing bacteria to ammonium oxidizing archaea), nirK/nirS (ratio of nirK gene to nirS gene) and BFG/A (ratio of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria to Alphaproteobacteria), were identified to develop a MC-IBI. The developed MC-IBI was demonstrated to be robust using a validation dataset. Further, the MC-IBI showed a significantly negative association with the index of water quality. The river ecological conditions of the 55 sampled sites in the Taihu Basin were defined as excellent (9.1%), good (14.5%), moderate (25.5%), poor (23.6%) and bad (27.3%) separately based on the MC-IBI scores. Overall, the MC-IBI provides a novel assessment tool for the ecological health status of freshwater rivers.

AB  - A benthic index of biotic integrity was developed for use in estuaries of the mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Delaware Bay estuary through Albemarle-Pamlico Sound). The index was developed for the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment Program (MAIA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency using procedures similar to those applied previously in Chesapeake Bay and southeastern estuaries, and was based on sampling in July through early October. Data from seven federal and state sampling programs were used to categorize sites as degraded or non-degraded based on dissolved oxygen, sediment contaminant, and sediment toxicity criteria. Various metrics of benthic community structure and function that distinguished between degraded and reference (non-degraded) sites were selected for each of five major habitat types defined by classification analysis of assemblages. Each metric was scored according to thresholds established on the distribution of values at reference sites, so that sites with low scoring metrics would be expected to show signs of degradation. For each habitat, metrics that correctly classified at least 50% of the degraded sites in the calibration data set were selected whenever possible to derive the index. The final index integrated the average score of the combination of metrics that performed best according to several criteria. Selected metrics included measures of productivity (abundance), diversity (number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener diversity, percent dominance), species composition and life history (percent abundance of pollution-indicative taxa, percent abundance of pollution-sensitive taxa, percent abundance of Bivalvia, Tanypodinae-Chironomidae abundance ratio), and trophic composition (percent abundance of deep-deposit feeders). The index correctly classified 82% of all sites in an independent data set-Classification efficiencies of sites were higher in the mesohaline and polyhaline habitats (81-92%) than in the oligohaline (71%) and the tidal freshwater (61%). Although application of the index to low salinity habitats should be done with caution, the MAIA index appeared to be quite reliable with a high likelihood of correctly identifying both degraded and non-degraded conditions. The index is expected to be of great utility in regional assessments as a tool for evaluating the integrity of benthic assemblages and tracking their condition over time.

AB  - Specific structural features of the zooplankton community of Lake Imandra have been analyzed in areas polluted with wastewaters from the copper-nickel industry (Monche Bay) and apatite-nepheline industry (Belaya Bay) or heated waters from the Kola Nuclear Power Plant (Molochnaya Bay) and in a conditionally clean (background) area (the eastern and western parts of Babinskaya Imandra pool). The current ecological state of these communities has been assessed. The results contribute to knowledge about the responses of hydrobionts to pollution with different kinds of industrial wastewaters and the potential of using the zooplankton community as a reliable indicator for evaluating the state of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Regional environmental evaluation often requires a large amount of spatial information. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are capable of managing large amounts of spatially related datum, and providing the ability to integrate multiple layers and to derive additional information. A methodological reference framework, using RS, GIS, and AHP (the analytic hierarchy process), is developed for environmental vulnerability assessment. Using this proposed method, we carried out a case study in the Tibetan Plateau. An environmental vulnerability index (EVI) proposed incorporates 15 factors covering natural conditions, environmental issues, and human activities. According to the EVI values, the vulnerability was classified into five levels: slight (EVI < 2.2), light (2.2 <= EVI < 2.7), moderate (2.7 <= EVI < 3.0), heavy (3.0 <= EVI <= 3.4), and extreme vulnerability (> 3.4). The case study showed that the majority of the area in the Tibetan Plateau is ecologically lightly (light level; 22% of the total area), moderately (moderate level; 27%), and heavily (heavy level: 30%) vulnerable. Except for a clearly horizontal distribution, the environmental vulnerability increased clearly with increasing elevation (vertical distribution). The case study verified the usefulness and feasibility of the methods developed, for the results gained reflect the reality of the Tibetan environment closely. Further use in other regions should pay attention to what factors seem to be important in determining the local environmental vulnerability, and how is the impact of each factor on the complex environment.

AB  - Oil transportation is growing in the Baltic Sea area and especially in the Gulf of Finland where it is reaching approximately 180-200 million tons a year by 2020. Growing oil transportation is considerably contributing to the risk of accidental spill related shoreline oiling. This paper focuses on amending the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) related shoreline classification to local conditions by dynamically changing the categorization of shoreline in terms of its susceptibility to spilled oil caused by extreme meteorological events and taking into consideration a number of natural physical factors. The paper presents the results of two European case studies: the Estonian shoreline of the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea), and the Spanish coast of the Gibraltar Strait. Susceptibility to spilled oil of some categories of the Estonian shoreline (sandy shores, till shores and gravel shores) is occasionally changing over time from low to high sensitivity and back, and that especially conditioned to the influence of heavy storms. The studies carried out in Spain revealed a well recognizable indirect proportionality between foreshore slope and the tidal range. At many locations, the dynamic morphological characteristics of the beach appeared to be largely determined by contouring and specific conditions that are modifying the initial ESI related categorization of the sandy beaches concerned. The novelty of this work is in attempt to move from the standard ESI related and locally adapted static shoreline classification towards more dynamic shoreline monitoring based on characterization of the sensitive to oil pollution shoreline elements.

AB  - Multi-metric indices of biological integrity (IBIs) are most frequently created by examining single biological metrics along gradients of environmental degradation, and then combining multiple metrics using "best professional judgment" to characterize and calibrate stressor-response relationships. We aim to provide an efficient data analysis and visualization tool to assess the simultaneous effects of anthropogenic stressors on the fish population through the fish metrics and the associated Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps (SOM), unsupervised neural networks, are employed to pattern the sampling sites in the state of Ohio based on similar metrics characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) allows us then to draw conclusions about the role of the environmental variables in maintaining the perfect abode for fishes. Different visualizations superimposed with SOM clustering are realized to explore the complex interrelationships in the aquatic system and aid watershed managers to comprehend the effects of the environment on the fish.

AB  - The enrichment of the protected Borovoe Lake with nutrients has taken place within the last 100 years, from the moment the first resort was formed on its shores. The purpose of this study was to assess the current ecological state of Borovoe based on the structure of zooplankton. According to the chemical data, in the summer of 2019, the content of nutrients in the water was, relatively, not high; the content of heavy metals was very low. Twenty-seven species were found in zooplankton. The average abundance of zooplankton was 988.8 thousand ind./m(3)with a biomass of 1.52 g/m(3). Rotifera dominated. Cladocera sub-dominated. The Shannon index values were 2.31 bit/ind. and 2.57 bit/mg; the values of Clarke's W-statistics and Delta-Shannon were negative. The abundance of zooplankton increased more than nine times, but the average individual mass of an organism decreased from 0.0112 to 0.0016 mg over the past decade. Despite the relatively low content of nutrients, the structure of zooplankton demonstrated that the nutritional load on Lake Borovoe is currently close to critical. Statistical mapping of the data and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the primary source of lake pollution is the village of Borovoe and sanatoriums located on the southeast and northwest coasts.

AB  - Introduction. The processes of digitalization of an economy, associated with the deployment of technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, are multifaceted and have a significant impact, including on the environment, which affects the interests of future generations.
   Problem Statement. Acceleration of digitalization is accompanied by contradictory positive and negative effects on the environment. In this regard, the identification of these effects at both the global and national levels is an urgent problem.
   Purpose. The purpose is to identify the relationship between the digital and green economy and to substantiate ways of environmentally safe development of digital technologies in Ukraine.
   Materials and Methods. Clustering of world countries on the basis of economic, industrial, and digital development; econometric analysis of the relationships between the ICT development index and the environmental performance index in the world countries and their groups (clusters) for 2017-2020.
   Results. It has been established that at the global level, the introduction of state-of-the-art digital technologies has a generally positive relationship with the state of environment: the higher the level of digitalization, the more environment friendly national economies, other things being equal. It has been found that the environmental performance of digitalization depends on the level of manufacturing (tangible) technologies and the overall economic development. In the clusters of less developed countries, including Ukraine that has significant problems in industry and innovation, the spread of digital technologies has less positive impact on the environment than in the clusters of more advanced economies. Therefore, the long-term positive effects of digitalization for Ukraine are not obvious, while the negative ones may have serious negative consequences.
   Conclusions. To minimize the environmental risks of digitalization processes in Ukraine, it is necessary to develop a national academic program for comprehensive assessment of effects of various aspects (abiotic, biotic, anthropogenic) of digital technologies on environment, as well as to harmonize economic digitalization programs with the overall strategy for innovation-driven national manufacture.

AB  - Cancer incidence increase has multiple aetiologies. Mutant alleles accumulation in populations may be one of them due to strong heritability of many cancers. The opportunity for the operation of natural selection has decreased in the past similar to 150 years because of reduction in mortality and fertility. Mutation-selection balance may have been disturbed in this process and genes providing background for some cancers may have been accumulating in human gene pools. Worldwide, based on the WHO statistics for 173 countries the index of the opportunity for selection is strongly inversely correlated with cancer incidence in peoples aged 0-49 years and in people of all ages. This relationship remains significant when gross domestic product per capita (GDP), life expectancy of older people (e(50)), obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and urbanization are kept statistically constant for fifteen (15) of twenty-seven (27) individual cancers incidence rates. Twelve (12) cancers which are not correlated with relaxed natural selection after considering the six potential confounders are largely attributable to external causes like viruses and toxins. Ratios of the average cancer incidence rates of the 10 countries with lowest opportunities for selection to the average cancer incidence rates of the 10 countries with highest opportunities for selection are 2.3 (all cancers at all ages), 2.4 (all cancers in 0-49 years age group), 5.7 (average ratios of strongly genetically based cancers) and 2.1 (average ratios of cancers with less genetic background).

AB  - This study evaluates the reproductive potential and condition of the red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) population inhabiting the waters around the Balearic Islands (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea), between 1991 and 2004. Red shrimp is one of the most valuable exploited demersal fishery resources in the western Mediterranean. To assess the condition of this species, we use two indices based on weight and length data, one including the gonad weight and another excluding it. Different biological parameters of the population dynamics and reproductive biology, such as sex-ratio, maturity, gonadosomatic index and presence of the spermatophore in females have also been analysed. A negative relationship was found between the gonadosomatic index and the condition of red shrimp, indicating that energy reserves are transferred from the body to the gonad during the reproductive period. The condition of adults reached minimum values during the maturation and spawning period after mating, when the gonadosomatic index, the spermatophore presence in females and the proportion of females in the population were highest. The relationship between the condition of adults during the months prior to spawning and the number of recruits in the following year was significant and positive. This relationship was stronger when only male condition was considered, suggesting that males have an important role on the reproductive potential of this species. Overall, our results suggest that condition of red shrimp, particularly males, is an important aspect for the reproductive and recruitment success of this species. The observed decreasing trend in male condition over years may raise concern on the future reproductive potential of that population. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term changes of fish biotic integrity in the Sanmenida Wetland, North China, since the 1950s were assessed using the fish index of biological integrity (FIBI). The water and sediment quality was evaluated by the water quality index (WQI) and sediment pollution index (SPI). The results showed that FIBI continuously decreased from 46 to 20 during the past 5 decades, which indicated that the fish community state shifted from fair to very poor conditions, and damming by itself did not affect the fish biotic integrity. At the same time, WQI fell from 83 to 44.1, and SPI increased from 0.99 to 2.14 since the 1960s, resulting from fast regional socio-economic development and insufficient wastewater treatment. Correlation analysis suggested that water quality significantly affected biotic integrity (r = 0.867, p < 0.05) through direct effects on the fish community. As a representative example of many wetlands in North China, our study clearly demonstrated that the biological integrity was degraded, induced both by water quality deterioration and sediment pollution, further driven by the contradiction between rapid development of regional economy and lagging development of sewage treatment facilities, which were thought to be the main factor responsible for the degradation of biological integrity.

AB  - Coral reefs of Lakshadweep perform a range of vital ecosystem functions and sustain the livelihoods of island communities. Coral reefs provide ecosystem services that are vital to human societies and industries through fisheries, coastal protection and tourism. The present study was undertaken during September and October 2015 to assess the status of reef health in 10 inhabited Islands of Lakshadweep following reef classification to imply conservation measures and also for the sustainable management by the dependent communities. Live coral cover, habitat complexity index, coral species richness, reef condition index, mortality index, morphological dominance, morphological diversity and coral conservation class were used to get an aggregate value of 'composite condition' index for determining the overall conservation values of coral reefs in these Islands. Kadmat reef had the highest live coral cover of 64.50% among the 10 inhabited islands. Bitra and Kiltan reef had good live coral cover of 62.75 and 52.25% respectively. The major benthic component in all the studied islands is live coral except in Amini and Andrott Islands. The recovery of corals has increased significantly in the last 5 years in Kadmat, Bitra, Kiltan and Bangarm after the 2010 mass bleaching event. Among the eight attributes, significant positive correlations were found between coral reef condition and live coral cover (r = 0.93, p < 0.05), between coral species richness and coral reef condition (r = 0.69, p < 0.05), between habitat complexity and morphological dominance (r = 0.68, p < 0.05) and between habitat complexity and conservation class (r = 0.72, p < 0.05). Coral morphologies (traits) were considered to determine the structural complexity of reefs. Based on r-K-S ternary diagram, coral morphology classification conservation class 1 (CC1) was assigned to the reef sites in Amini, Bitra and Chetlat which had > 60% of stress tolerators. CC3 was assigned to Bangaram and Kadmat due to the presence of > 75% of ruderals. Mixed coral morphology was recorded in Agatti, Andrott, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, and Kiltan with approximately equal proportions of ruderals, competitors and stress tolerators, and these coral reefs were designated as CC4. Protection and conservation management measures, as well as sustainable resource use, have been suggested based on the live coral cover, conservation class, and coral reef health status.

AB  - Rivers and streams worldwide are highly fragmented by dams and road crossings, and there is a pressing need to retrofit the most problematic structures to ensure aquatic organism passage. At the same time, a majority of the transportation infrastructure within developed nations is beyond its projected lifespan and significant investments will be needed to ensure that this transportation infrastructure remains safe and functional. Historically, these two problems have been addressed separately. Here, we use a rapid survey methodology to identify road-stream crossings that are likely high-priority projects for both conservation and infrastructure agencies. We conducted a field assessment of more than 700 road-stream crossings across Oklahoma to determine if they blocked fish movements and to determine their physical condition. We then developed an index of ecological impact, and an index of infrastructure condition, based on physical variables measured at each crossing. This survey revealed a subset of crossings that are both fragmenting the river network and in poor physical condition. These crossings are high-priority locations where culvert replacement may have both high ecosystem benefit and would eliminate a piece of transportation infrastructure with a high risk of failure. We discuss opportunities for cost-sharing between conservation and transportation agencies.

AB  - As the intensity and speed of environmental change increase at both local and global scales it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of the ecological implications of community shifts. While there has been substantial progress toward understanding the drivers and subsequent responses of community change (e.g. lake trophic state), the ecological impacts of food web changes are far less understood. We analyzed Wabash River fish assemblage data collected from 1974-2008, to evaluate temporal variation in body-size structure and functional group composition. Two parameters derived from annual community size-spectra were our major response variables: (1) the regression slope is an index of ecological efficiency and predator-prey biomass ratios, and (2) spectral elevation (regression midpoint height) is a proxy for food web capacity. We detected a large assemblage shift, over at least a seven year period, defined by dramatic changes in abundance (measured as catchper- unit-effort) of the dominant functional feeding groups among two time periods; from an assemblage dominated by planktivore-omnivores to benthic invertivores. There was a concurrent increase in ecological efficiency (slopes increased over time) following the shift associated with an increase in large-bodied low trophic level fish. Food web capacity remained relatively stable with no clear temporal trends. Thus, increased ecological efficiency occurred simultaneous to a compensatory response that shifted biomass among functional feeding groups.

AB  - In the last century, the exploitation of soil by humans has increased considerably. The need to evaluate several aspects of land degradation has become a priority in the soil management protection. Soil biota plays key roles in several supporting and regulating ecosystem services, being an important component of soil food webs. Among soil biota, soil arthropods are considered useful tool for bioindication. QBS-ar index (acronym of Soil Biological Quality) is an expeditious and inexpensive index that may represent a good first step to evaluate soil condition in degraded and natural landscapes. This paper aims to provide a brief guide for technicians and farmers interested in the QBS-ar application, and it summarizes the results obtained by ten years of QBS-ar application considering three important land uses: agriculture (several crops), alfalfa and wood.

AB  - A primary prerequisite for the preservation of global diversity is often assumed to be a high level of naturalness. This paper reports a synthesis of naturalness definitions, distinctions between the concepts of naturalness and of hemeroby and an analysis of different naturalness assessment approaches. Naturalness may be commonly defined as 'the similarity of a current ecosystem state to its natural state'. Hemeroby, a concept related to human impacts, is often associated with naturalness but, in principle, the two concepts are not inversely related. The hemeroby concept defines narrow assessment classes for greater hemeroby, whereas the naturalness concept defines narrow assessment classes for great naturalness. The rapidly increasing number of forest naturalness papers relies on the following main indicators in decreasing order of use: tree species, forest structure, fauna, ground vegetation and deadwood. A review of the literature on forest naturalness suggests four main reasons for the lack of a widely accepted approach for assessing naturalness: (1) the lack of a commonly accepted reference concept, (2) an incomplete list of essential naturalness traits, (3) unknown linkages between some naturalness traits and biodiversity and (4) the lack of an assessment approach that can be adapted for use at both regional and large scales. Following review of the literature on forest naturalness, a seven-level framework is presented to guide development of naturalness assessment approaches as a component of forest biodiversity monitoring and conservation management.

AB  - Serotonin receptor antagonist drug Ondansetron hydrochloride injectable formulation containing all related substances was identified and quantified by a single, simple, sensitive, eco-friendly, and green high-performance liquid chromatography method. The disseverment of all impurities was achieved with the Discovery Cyano (250 x 4.6) mm, 5 mu m column. The gradient program was composed of pH 5.7 phosphate buffer as mobile phase A and acetonitrile as mobile phase B. The flow rate, column compartment temperature, and detection wavelengths were 0.9 mL/min, 30 degrees C, and 216 nm, respectively. The method was validated as per current regulatory guidelines. The obtained %relative standard deviation for the precision results was between 0.55 and 2.72% for all impurities. The correlation coefficient values from the linearity experiment for impurities and analyte were more than 0.995. The accuracy results were obtained between 88.4 and 113.0% for all impurities. Both sample and standard solutions showed 24 h stability at benchtop and refrigerator conditions. All impurities and analytes met the specificity and mass balance for all forced degradation conditions. Quality-by-design-based design of experiments was utilized to establish the method's robustness. Method greenness was assessed by using the current advanced tool green analytical procedure index, National Environmental Methods Index, and analytical eco-scale.

AB  - Agricultural land use can place heavy demands on regional water resources, strongly influencing the quantity and timing of water flows needed to sustain natural ecosystems. The effects of agricultural practices on streamflow conditions are multifaceted, as they also contribute to the severity of impacts arising from other stressors within the river ecosystem. Thus, river scientists need to determine the quantity of water required to sustain important aquatic ecosystem components and ecological services, to support wise apportionment of water for agricultural use. It is now apparent that arbitrarily defined minimum flows are inadequate for this task because the complex habitat requirements of the biota, which underpin the structure and function of a river ecosystem, are strongly influenced by predictable temporal variations in flow. We present an alternative framework for establishing a first-level, regional ecological instream flow needs standard based on adoption of the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration/Range of Variability Approach as a broadly applicable hydrological assessment tool, coupling this to the Canadian Ecological Flow Index which assesses ecological responses to hydrological alteration. By explicitly incorporating a new field-based ecological assessment tool for small agricultural streams, we provide a necessary verification of altered hydrology that is broadly applicable within Canada and essential to ensure the continuous feedback between the application of flow management criteria and ecological condition.

AB  - Biological control is a means of preserving bidiversity and eradicating vector species of diseases such as Anopheles, which cause Malaria. The freshwater fish Gambusia qffinis has been introduced into rivers around the world to control Culex larvae. This study aims to evaluate the responses of G. affinis from different sites due to their proximity to polluting sources by measuring growth (total height and weight), metric indices:gonadal-somatic index (GSI), hepato-somatic index (HSI) and condition index (K). It, also, investigated the response of two biomarkers: glutathion-S-transferase (GST) in the liver and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the head of adults females and males of G. affinis (Cyprinodontiforme: Poeciliidae).The species was collected during the reproduction period (sexual activity) in three sites different by their level of exposure to pollution sources: Messida River, a reference site located in a protected area, and two other site near to anthropogenic activities, El Kama and Sidi Brahim. The results obtained reveal that the Messida river site shows a better growth with the highest GSI and K compared to the other study sites. The data of the HSI revealed lower values at the same site. Biomarker measurements revealed higher GST induction, AChE inhibition, and a level higher MT at the Sidi Brahim. We conclude that the Sidi Brahim site is the most polluted followed by El Karma and finally the Messida River. The study of the different parameters in the two sexes revealed that the females of G. affinis were more robust than the males.

AB  - This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal patterns in biomarker responses during early spring and late summer in Mytilus galloprovincialis using samples from two Adriatic Sea ecosystems between 2009 and 2012. The condition index was higher in September at all sampling sites and suggests that mussels can store energy during summer for wintertime spawning and survival through the winter. Over the entire study period, higher values of metallothioneins indicated sites with higher levels of heavy metals (Boka Kotorska Bay), while acetylcholine esterase activity was inhibited at the Gulf of Trieste. Genotoxicity was similar among sampling sites. We summarized biomarker responses in a stress index, IBRv2, and found that sampling sites in the Gulf of Trieste had lower stress levels while the highest stress levels were detected in the Boka Kotorska Bay.

AB  - Since hydromorphology in about 80% of German streams and rivers is degraded to a high degree, increased efforts in hydromorphological renaturalization are necessary. A measurement of the success of the first realized projects shows that improvement in stream morphology has a remarkably positive influence on aquatic ecology. An example of a restored stretch of a lowland stream in Saxony-Anhalt is used to describe the possibilities of success measurement programs for improvement of poor renaturalization. Therefore, a combined morphological and hydrobiological approach was developed. An integrated ecological assessment is possible by using the multimetric index EQI(M) (Ecological Quality Index using benthic Macroinvertebrates) and the GFI (German Fauna Index). The latter represents a tolerance measure to evaluate the hydromorphological status of a site by using certain taxa that indicate either positive or negative physical attributes. To consider the special characteristics of the stream in its landscape unit, specific reference conditions ('Leitbild') were defined for macroinvertebrate communities by sampling comparable but undisturbed streams in the same landscape unit. Only the combination of biological indices, hydromorphological mapping and comparison to the reference status allows for an expressive evaluation of renaturalization measures and precise conclusions for their improvement.

AB  - The Arctic marine environment is rapidly changing with rising sea surface temperatures, declining sea ice habitat and projected increases in boreal species invasions. The success of resident Arctic fish will depend on both their thermal tolerance and their ability to cope with changing trophic interactions. Larval fish energetic condition is closely associated with mortality rates and therefore provides an indicator of overall well-being or fitness. In this study, we experimentally determined larval morphometric and lipid-based condition in an Arctic gadid (Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida) and a boreal gadid (walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in response to different temperatures and food rations. Our results suggest that larval condition is highly sensitive to both factors but varies in a species-and ontogenetic-dependent manner. Results indicated that condition metrics based on length-weight relationships were not as sensitive as those based on lipid storage. Further, condition metrics changed with ontogeny and were best used within a developmental stage rather than across developmental stages. As expected, larval condition in first-feeding Arctic cod was higher at colder temperatures (2-5 degrees C) than in the boreal gadid (5-12 degrees C). However, at more developed larval stages the peak condition for Arctic cod was at warmer temperatures (7 degrees C), while walleye pollock had the same thermal optimum as during earlier stages. Arctic cod were more sensitive to food ration at first feeding than walleye pollock, however; at later larval stages both species had a negative condition response to low food ration, especially at elevated temperatures (5 vs. 7 degrees C). The lower thermal tolerance of Arctic cod, coupled with a higher sensitivity to food availability indicates that Arctic cod are particularly vulnerable to on-going environmental change. Arctic cod is a lipid-rich keystone species and therefore a reduction in their energetic condition during summer has the potential to affect the health of higher trophic levels throughout the Alaskan Arctic.

AB  - The recent strong 1997-1998 Nino and the following 1998-1999 La Nina disturbed weather, environment, economy, and human lives worldwide. The total impact of these events (ENSO) on societies is estimated in billions of dollars and consequences include famine, human health problems, loss of life, property damage, and destruction of the environment. Areas sensitive to ENSO have been identified in some world areas from climatic historical records and recently from the normalized difference vegetation index. This paper examines the last 15-year association between monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and vegetation health (condition) index for the entire world. The vegetation health (condition) index, derived from a combination of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based normalized difference vegetation index and 10-mum to 11-mum thermal radiances, was designed for monitoring moisture and thermal impacts on vegetation health (greenness and vigor). Two types of responses were identified. In boreal winter, ecosystems of northern South America, southern Africa, and Southeast Asia experienced severe moisture and thermal stress during El Nino and favorable conditions during La Nina years. In Argentina and southwestern United States/Mexico regions, the response was the opposite. World ecosystems are less sensitive to SSTs during boreal summer, except for the areas in northern Brazil and Southeast Asia, where vegetation conditions deteriorate/improve during the warm/cold water cycle in the tropical Pacific. In some areas, ENSO impacts on ecosystems are clearly identified from satellites and not from in situ data (or vice versa). During the boreal winter, these discrepancies occurred in Central America, northern Brazil, and southeastern United States; during the boreal summer, the discrepancies occurred in the sub-Sahara Africa and in the northern part of South America. In the course of the 1997-1999 ENSOs, world vegetation generally responded in accordance with the vegetation health/SST teleconnection patterns. However, in southern Africa, January-March 1998 vegetation stress was not as severe and widespread as in other El Nino years. Similarly, no stress was recorded in Argentina during the 1998-1999 La Nina. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

   Commercially important components of the ichthyofauna of the Curuca River Estuary were surveyed, according to three independent ecological indexes: Shannon-Wiener (H') for species diversity; Index of Biological Integrity (IBI); and total groups percentage, during rainy and dry seasons, in order to establish comparisons between artisanal fisheries production and seasonality. Total 1196 individuals from 16 fish families were sampled, where the Mugilidae Mugil curema was the most representative taxon in the rainy season (46.17%) and the Haemulidae Genyatremus luteus in the dry season (30.28%). Both composition and proportions of top carnivores were found unvaried for the two seasons sampled, although dry season showed higher levels of species diversity. Total herbivores were more abundant in the rainy season (49%) than in the dry season, yet herbivores composition appears unvaried between seasons. Significant differences were observed in total percentage and composition of omnivorous species between the two seasons, where total omnivores comprised 9.06% during the rainy period and 26.57% during dry season. Comparisons of K values among trophic levels between seasons showed no significant differences, indicating a relatively well-balanced average proportion of fish accordingly to the trophic levels. The dry season was observed as the most productive for artisanal fisheries, with higher levels of H' index and less dissimilarities amongst species occurrence and sampling sites. Due to the study area's environmental and commercial relevance, such findings are of great importance for improving the actual conservational legislation regarding actions by both traditional and industrial fisheries actually taking place in that estuarine complex.

AB  - Modern shelterbelts of Krasnodar Krai do not fully protect arable land and often have different sanitary state. Under these conditions, the preservation of forest shelterbelts and their protective functions in the system of agroforestry and other complex continues to be relevant. The research was carried out in the main and auxiliary forest shelterbelts within the boundaries of the Ust-Labinsk district of Krasnodar Krai. The purpose of the research was to determine the ecological state of the forest shelterbelts by identifying their integrity and implementation of forestry and land reclamation assessment. In order to obtain more complete information on their state, a remote assessment of the tree canopy integrity of the shelterbelts was carried out. It follows from the remote assessment analysis that about 42.5 % of the area surveyed in the key plots of plantations has an average degree of integrity of tree canopy, high - 22.3 %, low and very low - 35.2 %. Lower indicators of the tree canopy integrity are observed in the auxiliary forest shelterbelts. The percentage participation of each group of forest shelterbelts allowed us to rank the ranges of integrity corresponding to a certain forestry and land reclamation assessment (units). The range of the tree canopy integrity from 0 to 25 % corresponds to grade 1, from 25 to 50 % - 2, from 50 to 70 % - 3, from 70 to 100 % - 4. Based on this, the shelterbelts were devided into 4 groups: norm, risk, crisis and disaster. The results of determining the ecological state of the forest shelterbelts by ground and remote methods in the Ust-Labinsk district of Krasnodar Krai showed that a significant part of the surveyed plantations has a dense structure and requires silvicultural care. The group of the forest shelterbelts "disaster" needs reconstruction. This will significantly improve the environmental condition and reclamation efficiency, as well as increase the service life of the systems of forest sheltebelts.

AB  - Baetidae (Insecta, Ephemeroptera) of Cerrado streams in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, under different levels of environmental preservation. The effect of different stream environmental preservation levels, in 1(st) to 4(th) orders, over the richness, abundance, similarity in the composition and the potential of Baetidae (Ephemeroptera) species as bioindicators were investigated in a Cerrado region located in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. A total of twenty species/morphospecies were catalogued from the 1752 samples of nymphs, resulting in a new record for two species in Brazil. Values of Habitat Integrity Index (HII) were categorized among damaged, modified, and preserved environments. Species richness was different between sites, being greater in disturbed habitats. Total abundance was higher among preserved and altered environments, and differed significantly from the degraded areas. The NMDS analysis indicates that, in preserved and modified sites, the similarity in the composition of species differs from degraded areas. Four species showed a positive relationship with increasing values of HII. Baetidae showed environmental indicator species with different levels of preservation, with Zelusia principalis Lugo-Ortiz & McCafferty, 1998 and Baetodes sp. being indicators of preserved environments and Aturbina nigra Salles, Boldrini & Shimano, 2011, Callibaetis sp. 2, Camelobaetidius aff. janae, Paracloeodes binodulus Lugo-Ortiz & McCafferty, 1996 and Waltzoyphius roberti Thomas & Peru, 2002 as indicators of modified environments. The knowledge on the ecology of species advances in terms of providing subsidies for the biomonitoring of basins and the use of indicator species.

AB  - In the Wei River basin, the ecosystem is gradually deteriorating due to the rapid growth of the population and the development of economies. It is thus important to assess the ecosystem health and take measures to restore the damaged ecosystem. In this study, an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for fish was developed to aid the conservation of the ecosystem based on a calibration data set. An index of water and habitat quality (IWHQ) was calculated based on environmental variables and habitat quality (QHEI) to identify the environmental degradation in the studied sites. The least degraded sites (IWHQ a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 2; W1, W5, W10, W12, W13, W14, and W16) were chosen as the reference sites. Six metrics that are sensitive to environmental degradation were utilized to differentiate the reference and the impaired sites using statistical methods. These metrics included the number of species (P1), the total biomass (P2), the number of Cobitidae species (P8), the proportion of species in the middle and low tiers (P10), the proportion of individuals that were classified as sensitive species (P25), and number of individuals in the sample (P39). A continuous scoring method was used to score the six metrics, and four classes were defined to characterize the ecosystem health of the Wei River basin. The fact that the overall IBI scores were negatively correlated with the index of environmental quality (IWHQ) based on the validation data set indicated that the index should be useful for biomonitoring and the conservation of biodiversity. According to the results, more than half of the sites were classified as poor or very poor. The ecosystem health in the Wei River was better than that in the Jing River and the Beiluo River, and this study will be a great reference for water resources management and ecosystem restoration in the Wei River basin.

AB  - To determine if population density in areas closed to fishing in Narragansett Bay is causing differences in the reproductive potential of the organisms, this study used two approaches to determine the reproductive condition of the animals. The first approach consisted in employing a gravimetric condition index (Cl) to evaluate the general condition of quahogs from nine different sites, 3 sites open conditionally for fishing (conditional areas) and 6 sites closed to fishing. The second approach was a determination of index (GI) of a subset of the sample sites, by histological observation of gonadal tissue sections, Initial sampling included determination of Cl only, and lasted from March 25 to Sep.22, 2005. The subset of six of the sites was sampled the next year (2006), every three weeks front April 15 until Sep. 28 to determine Cl and the gonadal index (GI). Results Show that there is a significant difference between the Cl of northern quahogs from conditional areas and quahogs from closed areas (P < 0.001). There is a significant difference in GI between sites at (P < 0.10). The GI in conditional areas was consistently higher than in closed sites indicating that maturation and reproductive stages are more prevalent in conditional areas than in closed sites. When sites were separated into three categories: conditional fishing sites; coves: and Providence River sites. the GI and Cl of the conditional area's were always higher than the Cl and GI of all the other sites, The coves had intermediate indices, and the Providence River sites always had the lowest indices. The results indicate that the populations of quahogs in the closed sites sampled are not completing the gonadal cycle as expected and that the reproductive capability of the quahogs in conditional areas is higher than those in closed areas. Possible explanations to this condition include lower water quality in the closed areas. low dissolved oxygen concentration especially during the summer. poor bottom conditions and high population density. Although. not one single characteristic of the environment is solely responsible for the responsible condition of the quahog population, density appears to have significant effect.

AB  - The health conditions of Liao River were assessed using 25 sampling sites in April 2005, with water quality index, biotic index and physical habitat quality index. Based on the method of cluster analysis (CA) for water quality indices, it revealed that heavily polluted sites of Liao River are located at estuary and mainstream. The aquatic species surveyed were attached algae and benthic invertebrates. The result showed that the diversity and biomass of attached algae and benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) were degrading as the chemical and physical quality of water bodies deteriorating. Physiochemical parameters, BOD5, CODcr, TN, TP, NH3-N, DO, petroleum hydrocarbon and conductivity, were statistically analyzed with principal component analysis and correlation analysis. The statistical results were incorporated into the integrated assessing water quality index, combining fecal coliform count, attached algae diversity, B-IBI and physical habitat quality score. A comprehensive integrated assessing system of river ecological health was established. Based on the systimetic assessment, the assessed sites are categorized into 9 "healthy" and "sub-healthy" sites and 8 "sub-sick" and "sick" sites.

Materials and methods. The method determined correlations between physicochemical and biological variables through a canonical correspondence analysis, the scores obtained were used in a standardized correlation for a weighted averages model that allowed estimating the optimum and the tolerance of each taxon. Results. The classification of the sites located in the section of the River using the ICE explained that the concentrations of dissolved solids, alkalinity and orthophosphates defined the categories of ecological status, it was identified that at higher concentrations of dissolved solids and orthophosphates and at lower concentrations of the alkalinity values of the ICE were lower, that is to say, the ecological quality of the periphytic algae decreases, this situation took place in two seasons characterized by turbid waters and anthropic intervention. In contrast, another group tended to register the contrary tendencies, a greater concentration of alkalinity and high values in the index. Conclusions. The index provided an objective response to evaluate in numerical form a gradient associated with the concentration of solids, nutrients and alkalinity, variables that affect the distribution of optimal values and tolerance of the periphytic algae to the physicochemical conditions evaluated by the ICE in a stretch of the San Juan River, the results suggest a progressive deterioration of the system from the headwaters to the mouth of the Cauca River.

AB  - The seasonal changes in biochemical composition of the edible bivalve Arca noae harvested from a Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Bizerte lagoon, Tunisia) were investigated from October 2013 to September 2014. Potential food sources and nutritional quality indices (NQI) were determined by analyzing the fatty acid profiles of their tissues during an annual reproductive cycle. Results showed that A. noae had moisture (73.8-82%) and protein (24.1-58.6% dry weight) as major components, followed by lipid (10.4-28.8% dry weight) and glycogen (4.05-14.6% dry weight). A. noae accumulated lipid and glycogen for gonadal development during both maturation periods (late autumn/late spring-summer) to be used during spawning periods (winter/late summer-early autumn). However, proteins were mainly used to support reproductive allocation and played an important role on the energetic maintenance. Lipid and glycogen were found to be significantly related to temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a (p<0.05). An increase of condition index (CI) was observed during spring and early summer when both temperature and food supply increased. The total fatty acid (TFA) profile of Ark shells was dominated by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (33.8-49.6%), followed by saturated (SFA) (29.1-43.1%) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (20.77-28.3%). A. noae soft tissues were also rich in macro-minerals (Na, Ca and Mg). The analysis of fatty acid trophic markers revealed that the diet of A. noae during the year of study was based on mixture food mainly on phytoplankton followed by zooplankton and other sources (bacteria, seagrass and macroalgae). Furthermore, the nutritional quality indices have revealed that A. noae is an excellent source of nutrients and a healthy food for human consumption. These data are useful to the conservation of natural stocks of A. noae and the development of sustainable aquaculture production of this shellfish species in the Bizerte lagoon.

AB  - Bivalve Condition Index (CI) is widely employed in environmental monitoring programmes as it integrates physiological responses to stress with changes in somatic growth. Besides indicating, the commercial quality of a bivalve population it may be also be used to compare the relative health of animals in nearby populations. In this study, CI of green mussels, Perna viridis was evaluated as the intrinsic response to the variations in the environment in two potential mussel mariculture sites in the tropical monsoon region with diverse remoteness to riverine outflow. Condition index of mussels from site with relatively higher riverine influence (RI) was compared with mussels from area of reduced riverine (RR) influence along Karnataka coast (Eastern Arabian Sea). The dominant patterns of spatial trends in 12 environmental variables (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, rainfall, chlorophyll-a (chl-a), suspended particulate matter (SPM) particulate organic matter (POM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), POM/SPM, chla/POM and PIM%) of the sites were resolved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The stepwise multiple regression analysis related the spatial variability in CI to variations in water temperature and organic content of the seston (chlorophyll-a and particulate organic matter). The discriminant analysis performed with monthly mean water temperature, chl-a levels and CI ratio [high CI ratio (CI(high)) and low CI ratio (CI(low))] indicated that 83.9% of the CI(high) was associated with high chl-a and high water temperature group whereas, 72.4% of CI(low) were associated with low chl-a and low water temperature regime. The RR site presented less variation in environmental parameters offering a more conducive environment for the growth of mussels, characterised by better CI with low seasonal variations. Whereas, in the site proximate to riverine discharge, reserves were alternatively channelled into energy-consuming processes and hence unfavourable environmental conditions showed poor tissue condition due to utilization of energy reserves which were potentially destined for growth. Thus, average CI, besides its representation of the general health condition of the bivalves can potentially be used in selecting suitable sites for bivalve mariculture in comparable hydrological environment.

AB  - To effectively implement ecosystem-based fisheries management, tools are needed that are capable of exploring the likely consequences of potential management action for the whole ecosystem. Quantitative modelling tools can be used to explore how ecosystems might respond to potential management measures, but no one model can reliably forecast all aspects of future change. To build a robust basis for management advice, a suite of models can be used, but the interpretation of the joint output of multiple models can be difficult. We employ a newly developed ensemble approach to integrate 5 different ecosystem models and estimate changes in ecosystem state within a single probabilistic forecast. We provide evidence on the response of ecosystem state (measured using ecological indicators relating to plankton, fish and top predators) to potential fisheries management scenarios. We demonstrate that if future fishing mortality is consistent with maximum sustainable yield policy, the North Sea fish community will recover in terms of its size structure and species composition. However, there is currently large uncertainty in trends of future fish biomass, plankton and top predators. We conclude that (1) this ensemble approach can be applied directly to policy-relevant questions and add value for decision makers, as multiple aspects of uncertainty are considered; (2) future research should prioritise improvements in model skill via a reduction in uncertainty surrounding biomass estimates; and (3) fisheries management that leads to sustainable fishing levels can be considered appropriate for 2 crucial aspects of fish biodiversity: species composition and size structure.

AB  - Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was reported in the 1960's to affect Meyer lemon trees in Chile, but no field symptoms were observed. This study performed a complete biological, serological and molecular characterization of one hundred CTV isolates obtained from different hosts and geographical origins. Decline symptoms (DI) were not found on trees grafted onto sour orange. In Pica Oasis in northern Chile, stem pitting (SP) was found to affect grapefruit and Mexican lime trees. Most isolates present in the central area were considered mild (MCA-13-negative), while in the northern area aggressive isolates were observed and detected. Some of these isolates were capable of causing SP on grapefruit under field and greenhouse conditions and on sweet orange under greenhouse conditions. Almost all of these isolates were MCA13-positive and had nucleotide sequences associated with the VT genotype.

AB  - PCBs were analyzed in two species of oyster (Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea edulis) cultured in intertidal beds and rafts coming from the Galician Rias during the period 2011-2014. PCBs were also analyzed in mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected in the same Rias during 2011. The main objective of this work is to investigate the distribution of PCBs in Galician oysters and to study their suitability as bioindicator in comparison to mussels. The levels of I PCBs pound (ten congeners) ranged from 5.58 to 179.49 ng g(-1) d.w. The effect of biological parameters (shell length, lipid content and condition index) on bioaccumulation of PCBs was also evaluated. ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between species for higher chlorinated biphenyls (CBs 153 and 138). The spatial patterns were investigated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed differences between geographical areas (Rias Altas, Centrales and Baixas) in the distribution of PCBs.

AB  - Whether metacercariae of the digenean Himasthla elongata (Himasthlidae) are harmful to their secondary intermediate hosts, the blue mussel, Myrrh's edulis, is a disputable question. To shed light on this issue, we performed field monitoring of the heart rate (HR) in mussels infected with H. elongata over a period of 1.5 years. We observed a significant rise in HR in infected mussels, but only 1 year after infection and at temperatures of 15-17 degrees C. HR variance also grew sharply in infected mussels within the same temperature range. We also detected a decreased ability of infected mussels to compensate for the rise in the environment temperature. Finally, growth rate in the infected mussels was slower compared to the control group. We provide evidence for measurable pathogenic effects caused by H. elongata metacercariae in their secondary intermediate mussel hosts.

AB  - The role of the environment is an important issue in the policy-making and hence, the accurate assessment of the environmental conditions is vital. In this paper, an environmental efficiency index is developed for the OECD countries using non-parametric techniques. The approach adopted is based on the assumption that there is just one production process behind the production of both goods and pollution emissions. The index derived in this work measures the extent of the required output sacrifice, due to the transformation of the production process, from one where all outputs are strongly disposable to the one which is characterized by weak disposability of pollutants. Using this index, we first conduct cross-section comparisons on the state of each country's production process in its treatment of pollution emissions. We then trace each country's modification of their production processes overtime. The results indicate that if the disposability for CO2 emissions were strictly restricted as the result of an environmental regulation, the total value of output loss to the OECD countries as a whole would correspond to 3.7, 4.8 and 3.5% of the total OECD GDP for 1980, 1985 and 1990, respectively.

AB  - Fifty-five macroinvertebrate metrics were tested for their response to pond condition in 41 ponds of northwest Spain to develop a preliminary multimetric index for ecological assessment of Mediterranean flatland ponds. Stressor specific response of individual attributes to eutrophication and habitat alteration was also investigated to identify differences in the responses of metrics to single stressors and elucidate how this might affect the performance of the final index. Several combinations were tested using discrimination efficiency (25th percentile of slightly impaired sites for metrics decreasing with perturbation and 75th percentile of slightly impaired sites for metrics increasing with perturbation) and Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni adjustment (P < 0.001). The final index comprised five measures (generic richness of Chironominae, generic richness of Dytiscidae + Odonata + Tanypodinae, relative richness of Chironomidae, % Macropelopini and Shannon index) and discriminated between acceptable (good) and unacceptable (moderate) conditions with more than 86% efficiency. Moreover, all the five measures included in the final index showed unidirectional responses to eutrophication, decreasing as eutrophication increased. In contrast, the effect of habitat alteration was less clear, especially in ponds in best available conditions where a vegetation belt of shrubs and trees prevented growing of macrophitic vegetation on shores and consequently associated fauna. Interestingly, none of the functional groups (e.g. % predators and % collector-gatherers) were sensitive to degradation.

AB  - Introduction. The processes of digitalization of an economy, associated with the deployment of technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, are multifaceted and have a significant impact, including on the environment, which affects the interests of future generations.
   Problem Statement. Acceleration of digitalization is accompanied by contradictory positive and negative effects on the environment. In this regard, the identification of these effects at both the global and national levels is an urgent problem.
   Purpose. The purpose is to identify the relationship between the digital and green economy and to substan tiate ways of environmentally safe development of digital technologies in Ukraine.
   Materials and Methods. Clustering of world countries on the basis of economic, industrial, and digital development; econometric analysis of the relationships between the ICT development index and the environmental performance index in the world countries and their groups (clusters) for 2017-2020.
   Results. It has been established that at the global level, the introduction of state-of-the-art digital technologies has a generally positive relationship with the state of environment: the higher the level of digitalization, the more environment friendly national economies, other things being equal. It has been found that the environmental performance of digitalization depends on the level of manufacturing (tangible) technologies and the overall economic development. In the clusters of less developed coun-tries, including Ukraine that has significant problems in industry and innovation, the spread of digital technologies has less positive impact on the environment than in the clusters of more advanced econ-omies. Therefore, the long-term positive effects of digitalization for Ukraine are not obvious, while the negative ones may have serious negative consequences.
   Conclusions. To minimize the environmental risks of digitalization processes in Ukraine, it is necessary to develop a national academic program for comprehensive assessment of effects of various aspects (abiotic, biotic, anthropogenic) of digital technologies on environment, as well as to harmonize economic digitalization programs with the overall strategy for innovation-driven national manufacture.

AB  - The control of biodegradable substances is the key issue in evaluating the short and long-term emission potential and environmental impact of a landfill.
   Aerobic and anaerobic indices, such as respirometric index (RI) and biomethane Potential production (GB21), can be used in the estimation of the stability of solid waste samples.
   Previous studies showed different degrees of relationship between BOD5/COD ratio compared with RI4.
   Aim of this study is to standardize the parameter BOD5/COD ratio and to test the methodology under different operating conditions (dynamic or static leaching and leaching duration, 6 and 24-h) keeping constant temperature and liquid/solid ratio (L/S = 10 l/kg(TS)), with the introduction of a COD fractioning method. The COD fractioning is based on the differentiation between the soluble fraction (CODsol) and the colloidal fraction (CODcoll) using a flocculation method.
   The BOD5/COD and the BOD5/CODsol indices are both consistent and significant and can be used as stability indices.
   The BOD5/COD ratio does not seem to be influenced, for the same test duration, by the type of test, static or dynamic. In the same way the longer test duration (24-h) does not influence significantly the values of BOD5/COD ratio. As a consequence a leaching test duration of 6-h is preferable to avoid the beginning of the hydrolysis and oxidation processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA  - English
AB  - Accumulation of cadmium, lead, and mercury in the tissues of the mussel Mytilus edulis planulatus L. from the Derwent Estuary, Hobart, Australia was linear over a range of metal concentrations in the ambient water, provided that the condition index of the mussels (meat weight/shell weight) indicated that the organisms were not under environmental stress. Polynomial regression analysis of accumulation rates against ambient concentrations of the respective metals in the water column in the vicinity of the mussels showed that the relationships depended upon the physical speciation of the metals (i.e., filtrable vs particulate metals). The results indicated that it may be feasible to use metal accumulation rates in mussels to provide broad-based estimates of metal concentrations in marine waters, provided that the organisms have been calibrated under conditions similar to those prevailing at the proposed monitoring sites.

AB  - The marine diatom Haslea ostrearia is known for its ability to produce marennine, a blue-green water-soluble pigment, which is responsible for the oyster greening phenomenon in the French Atlantic Coast. Marennine can be considered a bioactive extracellular compound (BEC) as it exhibits activities against detrimental pathogens in bivalve aquaculture. However, marennine could also be toxic to animals. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the effect of marennine produced by H. ostrearia upon three commercially important bivalve species, the American oyster Crassostrea virginica, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the giant scallop Placopecten magellanicus. Effect of this BEC was also assessed on different ontogenic stages of scallops. The animals were exposed to 3 mg L-1 of marennine and physiological response associated with clearance rates (CR), oxygen consumption and condition index (CI) were measured after 16 h of exposure (day 0), and after one subsequent week of recovery (day 7). In the short term, CR and oxygen consumption on mussels and oysters were significantly altered by marennine but not for scallops. CR recovery was observed in oysters after seven days, but no depuration was observed in mussels. Nevertheless, oxygen consumption in both mussels and oysters recovered on day 7. CI in the marennine-exposed group for both adult oysters and scallops was not significantly different, yet CI of mussels was lowered by 18.2 % compared to control. Scallop adults seemed largely resistant to marennine, but juveniles were more susceptible with a reduced CR and oxygen consumption by 71.9 % and 24.5 %, respectively, and no depuration activity observed until day 7. Additionally, CI in marennine-exposed juvenile scallops was 27 % lower than that of control. This study demonstrates speciesand age-specific effect of marennine on bivalves, thus highlighting the importance of further assessment on the utilization of this pigment as a natural product decreasing pathogenicity of bacteria in shellfish aquaculture systems.

AB  - The accumulation of scientific knowledge is far outstripped by the rate of environmental disturbance from human activities in aquatic habitats. This highlights the need to develop effective proxy measures of aquatic biodiversity that can demonstrate changes in communities associated with human activities. We evaluated whether the relative abundance and species richness of Anisoptera and Zygoptera can be used as a tool to measure environmental impacts on Amazonian streams. Adult of Anisoptera and Zygoptera were sampled in 50 Amazonian streams, in the municipality of Paragominas (Para state), Brazil, using an entomological handnet. The physical features of each stream were evaluated using an index of environmental integrity (HII). We collected a total of 1769 Odonata specimens, representing 97 species (56 were Zygoptera and 41 were Anisoptera). Habitat modification resulted in an inversion in the proportional abundance and species richness of Anisoptera and Zygoptera, where Zygoptera diversity decreased with the loss of habitat integrity, whereas Anisoptera diversity increased with habitat disturbance. A decline of 0.1 in the habitat integrity index score resulted in an increase of approximately 13 individuals and 11 species of Anisoptera, with the exact opposite effect observed for the Zygoptera. In summary, the Odonata proved to be a useful model for the assessment of Amazonian streams, with sites where more than 54% of the Odonata species were Zygoptera being classified as preserved, and those dominated by Anisoptera species (>59%) being considered degraded. This approach has clear applications for environmental impact assessments, as it reduces the influence of sampling effort and collector experience on assessment outcomes, and does not rely upon specialist knowledge, given that members of the two suborders are easily distinguished from one and other in the field.

AB  - The present study aimed to develop a multimetric index as a biological indication method of water quality using benthic macroinvertebrates for Turkey. A total of 207 operational taxa units were identified from 26 sampling sites through the employment of the multi-habitat method. Water was simultaneously sampled for both in-situ measurements and laboratory analysis in order to obtain the data on water chemistry. Ineligible metrics were excluded from the calculation process together with box-whisker plots and Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05), considering the degree of overlap in the quartile limits (1 degrees-3 degrees). Among ten candidate metrics, four were considered suitable to form a multimetric index through Spearman correlation analysis. The core metrics were standardized with the 3(rd) quartile to obtain the index value. The index responded to a set of environmental variables, and split the ecological conditions into four categories as high, moderate, poor, and bad for the study area. Our results indicate that the multimetric index of the Sakarya River (MMIS) is an effective biological monitoring tool employing macroinvertebrates for biological monitoring in Turkey.

AB  - Environmental contextMetal contamination in estuarine sediments can affect ecosystem health. Molluscs are commonly used as environmental indicators because they accumulate contaminants that cause adverse health effects. We investigated metal uptake and effects in the Sydney cockle, comparing exposure to contaminated lake sediments in situ and in laboratory aquariums. Although differences were observed between the different exposure types, all approaches were found to be valid for investigating metal health effects in this organism. Abstract Relationships between exposure, tissue dose and biological responses of the benthic marine bivalve Anadara trapezia to an estuarine sediment zinc, copper, lead, cadmium and selenium contamination gradient in Lake Macquarie, NSW, were evaluated using three approaches. Organisms were exposed to sediments in laboratory aquaria, caged in situ in the lake and lake resident organisms collected. Dose included total metal tissue burden and subcellular metal distribution to determine metabolically available metal. Response indices were total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation, lysosomal stability and condition index. Bioaccumulation of total metals was higher in the laboratory and resident organisms than in those transplanted in the field but the contribution of individual metals to the total differed. Laboratory-exposed organisms had increased concentrations of cadmium and lead in their biologically active and detoxified metal fractions but not of the essential elements zinc and copper. Subcellular metal distribution patterns were the same in resident organisms but cadmium and lead burdens were higher in both fractions. Biomarker responses were similar in laboratory, transplanted and resident organisms. Total antioxidant capacity was significantly reduced and lipid peroxidation and lysosomal destabilisation significantly increased in all metal-exposed organisms compared with the reference A. trapezia. Condition index of laboratory-exposed organisms was significantly lower than in situ, resident and reference organisms. Clear metal exposure-dose-response relationships have been demonstrated for A. trapezia in laboratory and in situ experiments. Non-resident organisms, in both exposure scenarios, gave similar responses to resident metal-exposed organisms, showing all approaches are valid when investigating effects in this species.

AB  - Estuarine abiotic characteristics vary with tidal variations and fresh water input, both driven by climatic conditions and often cyclical climatic events. Estuaries are very productive and bivalves often represent a substantial proportion of the biomass with important ecological role. Salinity fluctuation is often a key environmental factor affecting bivalves shell growth and individual condition index (CI), parameters that in turn can be used to show the quality of the environment for one population. The stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius is an euryhaline filter-feeder species that inhabits sandy-silt tidal flats within a wide salinity range. The objective of this study was to evaluate, by survey sampling and in situ transplant experiments among sites with different salinity, whether shell growth and CI of T. plebeius vary with the salinity regime. We hypothesized a higher growth and CI related to the intermediate salinity. Clams and abiotic parameters were sampled in three estuaries of the northern Argentinian coast with different salinity regimes (Bahia Samborombon (36 degrees 19'S), Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37 degrees 32'S) and Bahia Blanca (38 degrees 47'S)) and in three sites along the salinity gradient of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon where the manipulative experiments were also conducted. Shells were more elongated in sites with lower salinity; but the growth rate (k) and the CI were higher in sites with intermediate salinity. Furthermore, clams transplanted from intermediate salinity sites to those with higher or lower salinity showed a disadvantage in shell growth. Considering the scenario of climatic-driven salinity changes in these estuaries and given that T. plebeius is the only native bivalve species in those intertidal zones, having a relevant ecological role and conspicuous fossil presence in Holocene outcrops, our results highlight the relevance of this clam as a valuable target for future studies on conservation biology and paleobiology.

AB  - Assessing the major atmospheric issues - acidic deposition, climate change, ozone depletion, smog, hazardous air pollutants and suspended particulate matter - together rather than individually provides many advantages. But to be successful, this integration requires a common method for relating these issues to one another. This is a scientific question. In order to successfully resolve the atmospheric issues (a policy question) requires communication of the relevant science to nonscientists in plain language. Non-scientists need to be part of the development of the structure of the communications vehicle. The objective for multi-issue assessment, and thus for the development of an index to track the state of the environment in an integrated way, is of course related to the desire to achieve environmentally sustainable development. Sustainability can be represented by a 3-legged stool and is an apt symbol of the struggle of Canadians to balance their ecological, economic and social needs. Although the environment is the basis of all life, humankind has created society and has defined how that society will function (the economy). The three legs of the stool (ecosystem, economy, society) represent the three parts of the 'sustainability' balance. The seat of the stool represents the 'governance process' and the three legs are deeply embedded in this governance process because it is the 'governance' which ensures the stability of the system over time. The challenge then is to measure the stability of the 'stool' in a way which all can understand. This measure of 'sustainability' must respond to individual and collective actions which improve or degrade the environment. This paper presents such a framework for a 'sustainability index' and outlines the next steps that need to be taken. The framework starts from the premise that ecosystem, economy and society are equal parts of 'sustainability'. Ecosystem indices are representative measures of the state of the environment while economic indices are representative measures of the state of the economy. Social indices in some way have to measure the state of society. The trick, for a successful sustainability index, will be to ensure that the important aspects of the ecosystem, the economy and society, are included. The overall index must be relatively stable but must be responsive to changes.

AB  - Cities represent enviroment for most of Europe's human population. Spatial pattern of cities' environmental as well as socioeconomic features affect plant biodiversity. We analysed a floristic mapping dataset of the city of Ljubljana (Slovenia) and asked what affects the spatial differences in the presence of different categories of species: species according to residence time and endangered and thermophilic species. To explain the proportions of these species groups in grid cells, using Generalized Additive Models, we tested the effects of three categories of predictors: i) urban structure, represented by the distance from the city centre, population density, soil sealing, and quality of residential environment index, ii) habitat predictors, represented by habitat diversity and geologic diversity, and iii) environmental conditions, represented by urban heat island (UHI). Species richness decreases with the distance from the city centre and is highest in the cells with intermediate habitat diversity. Number of species is highest within city parts of highest quality of residential environment index and lowest in parts with UHI effect. Proportion of native species is positively related to habitat and geologic diversity. The proportion of archaeophytes is higher where habitats are more diverse and increases with the distance from the city centre. Grid cells with highest proportion of neophytes are located in the most built-up areas and in the city centre, which is positively associated with soil sealing, but negatively with UHI. Thermophilic species are positively associated with soil sealing. Endangered species have uniform distribution pattern and their proportion is negatively associated with distance from the city centre and soil sealing. A grid cell with the highest proportion of endangered species includes two protected areas with wetland habitats. Calculated ecological indicator values show correlation with soil sealing and habitat diversity. Some of the results are in line with well-established patterns from other cities, while others reflect certain specific features of Ljubljana, e.g. forested hills close to the city centre. The identified hotspots of city's plant species richness can serve in the argumentation of future urbanistic planning.

AB  - The UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other regional and national policy commitments have motivated an upsurge of interest in concepts and practical methods for monitoring forest conditions and trends at very wide geographic scales. Two approaches to sustainability assessment at a global level are reviewed here. One consists of monitoring change in forest conditions over time-the so-called Criteria and Indicators (C&I) approach. Another approach compares nations at a given point in time. An example is the Yale Environmental Performance Index (EPI). Both approaches yield insights. It is widely recognized, though, that severe data weaknesses afflict forest information over much of the world. These weaknesses include weak or absent information on wood consumption in many regions, poor area estimates, and weak or absent information on key ecological conditions in forests. The purpose of this essay is to introduce these efforts at global assessment, and to argue that an entirely new discipline is needed to supply the information needed. The focus of this new discipline would be to design an ecologically based set of definitions for forest and related ecosystems, and then to build and implement the optimum combination of satellite measurements, air photo interpretation, and field plot measurements needed to measure world forest resource conditions and trends. Examples of this new approach are already appearing. This argument is addressed to members of the global forest policy community concerned with assessment, and to scientists, technologists, and managers in the many technical fields already engaged on one or another aspect of measuring and monitoring forest conditions at a national and regional scale.

AB  - Seven borer species were identified affecting Ostrea puelchana in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, including the sponges Clionaopsis platei, Pione angelae and Cliona celata (Clionaidae), the borer bivalve Lithophaga patagonica (Mytilidae) and the polychaetes Polydora rickettsi (Spionidae), Dodecaceria cf. choromyticola and Caulleriella cf. bremecae (Cirratulidae). Higher prevalences of borer sponges (55%) occurred in oysters from Puerto Lobos, Golfo San Matias (42A degrees 00'S, 65A degrees 3'W), while higher values of L. patagonica (80%) and borer polychaetes (93%) were recorded in oysters from Fracasso Beach, Golfo San Jos, (42A degrees 25'S, 64A degrees 07'W). Lithophaga patagonica was the most harmful borer organism, lowering the condition index of the oyster. There was a positive association between the presence of L. patagonica and borer polychaetes, suggesting that the borer activity of L. patagonica favored the settlement of polychaetes.

AB  - Potential biomass production and carbon sequestration were studied in relation to different site index conditions, stand densities and silvicultural treatments for the main forest species in northwest Spain. Site quality, stand density and silvicultural treatments affected biomass production and carbon sequestration and, therefore, optimal rotation length. Potential biomass production and carbon sequestration were highest and optimal rotations were shortest for the best site indexes, highest initial stand densities and the silvicultural treatments that involved least disturbance. Fast-growing species can be used as both energy crops (biomass) and carbon sinks, which contribute to mitigating climate change. However, as slow-growing species act as sinks for longer, they are preferable for planting in environments that are less suitable for fast-growing species.

T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA  - English
AB  - United States (U. S.) tornado activity results in substantial loss of life and property damage each year. A simple measure of the U. S. tornado climatology is the average number of tornadoes per year. However, even this statistic is elusive because of nonstationary behavior due in large part to changes in reporting practices. Differencing of the annual report data results in a quantity without mean trends and whose standard deviation we denote as volatility, since it is an indication of the likely year-to-year variation in the number of tornadoes reported. While volatility changes detected prior to 2000 can be associated with known reporting practice changes, an increase in volatility in the 2000s across intensity levels cannot. A volatility increase is also seen in a tornado environment index which measures the favorability of atmospheric conditions to tornado activity, providing evidence that the recent increase in tornado report volatility is related to the physical environment.

AB  - Human activities, such as agriculture or mining, are a continuous source of risk for heavy metal pollution that seriously disturbs the soil environment Massive efforts are being made to identify the tools to determine indicators of soil quality condition. This study characterises and evaluates the heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) contents in the Province of Golestan (northern Iran). Pollution was assessed using the pollution index (PI) and the integrated pollution index (IPI). The potential harmful effects of these heavy metals were evaluated by the Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI) Method. Kernel density estimation (KDE) and Local Moran's I were used for the hotspot analysis of soil pollution from a set of observed hazard occurrences. In all, 346 topsoils were examined, which represent three areas, approximately including the middle-south, west and north-east areas in this region. The heavy metal concentrations in the analysed samples did not generally present high values, despite anthropic heavy metal input However, the potential ecological risk indexes (RI) indicated that approximately 68% and 5% of the study samples had medium and high pollution levels, respectively. Multiple hotspots for the above five heavy metals were located in the middle-south and west study areas. This anthropic heavy metal input is related to mining, agricultural practices and vehicle emissions. It was concluded that a moderate and high potential ecological risk covered about 90% of this province. In contrast, the natural origin input became more marked on a long spatial scale.

AB  - This study describes the reproductive strategy of the stream-dwelling catfish Hatcheria macraei in the Pichileufu River, Argentina. Gonad maturity phases, classified on the basis of histological analysis, stages of gamete development and the frequency distribution of oocyte size, were correlated with macroscopic features of the gonads. Hatcheria macraei has a cystovarian ovary, asynchronous oocyte development and lobular testes. Five oocyte and four spermatogenic stages were identified and related to macroscopic gonad characteristics, making it possible to divide gonad development into five phases for females and males. Mature oocyte diameter ranged from 922 to 1935 mu m. Absolute fecundity in mature females varied from 115 to 480 oocytes. Hatcheria macraei has multiple spawning during a protracted reproductive season that extends from December to April. This, together with its small size, is characteristic of an opportunistic reproductive strategy, commonly found in species that inhabit adverse and unpredictable environments, such as the low-order rivers of Patagonia.

AB  - The ingestion of microplastics and natural fibres (< 5 mm) was assessed for two commercial fish species in the western Mediterranean Sea: Sardine pilchardus and Engraulis encrasicolus. Gastrointestinal tracts from 210 individuals from 14 stations were examined with 14.28-15.24% of the small pelagic fish S. pilchardus and E. encrasicolus having ingested microplastics and natural fibres. A latitudinal increase in condition index (Fulton's K) of S. pilchardus gave an indication that larger individuals with better physical condition are less likely to ingest microplastics and natural fibres. Fibres were the most frequent particle type (83%) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis indicated polyethylene terephthalate was the most common microplastics material (30%). Results from this study show that both microplastics and natural fibres of anthropogenic origin are common throughout the pelagic environment along the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

AB  - The article assesses the impact of wind power plants on the components of the environment, which are compartments of complex landscape systems, taking into account a number of their parameters. A list of impact categories has been made up, which represent the load on the environment; also, for each category, the relative contribution of harmful factors has been identified, taking into account possible scenarios for waste management. For all potential impacts, using the Ecoindicator methodology, ecological profiles have been built, which made it possible to obtain the values of ecological indexes (impacts) and eco-indicators, expressed in eco-points, characterizing the impact of the wind power plant under study.
   Mathematical modeling of the processes of influence of a separate wind power plant on the subsystems and layers of compartments was carried out, according to the results of which a system of differential equations has been obtained, the input data for which are individual indexes and eco-indicators, as well as statistical information on the functioning of the elements of the hierarchical structure of compartments of a complex landscape system. The structure graphs are formalized using the Kolmogorov system of differential equations. It is proposed to study the dynamics of the structure on the basis of solving a system of differential equations using the fourth-order numerical Runge - Kutta method.
   By solving the system of equations, it is possible to study (predict) the developmental stages of a complex landscape system in dynamic and stationary modes during the impact of the life cycle of wind turbines on the subsystems and layers of their compartments, in order to optimize human activities to ensure minimal environmental impact.
   It is proposed to use the presented algorithms as a mathematical support for a cyber-physical system for studying the states of complex landscape systems and assessing the impact of wind turbines on environmental components.

AB  - For a few years, the littoral of the Gulf of Tunis has been subjected to agricultural activities, industrial, urban and tourist development and consequently submitted to the impact of many chemical and physical stressors. Sub-individual responses (biochemical biomarkers) in bivalves can be used as an early warning system for ecotoxicological risk assessment. However, the influence of many confounding factors such as ecological (e.g. temperature and salinity) or physiological (e.g. reproductive and nutritive status) parameters on biomarker responses must be taken carefully into account. The aim of the present study was to integrate into indices (Integrated Biomarker Response: IBR and Health Status Index: HSI) individual responses of biochemical biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels, lactate dehydrogenase and metallothionein-like proteins) and energy reserves (glycogen, lipid levels and total protein concentrations) at sub-individual level, and condition index at individual level in Donax trunculus originating from 4 sites contrasted by their level of contamination in the Gulf of Tunis. Integrated biomarkers indices have been revealed to be efficient and easy tools for environmental managers. Responses of IBR and HSI were compared and their strengths and weaknesses discussed. Results showed that HSI could be an easy tool for risk management whereas IBR results were more informative with regard to the temporal contribution of each biomarker considered in the battery used in the present work In bivalves from the reference Sidi Jehmi site, the contribution of energy reserves and the condition index reflecting a good general health status clearly influenced the temporal variations of IBR whereas in bivalves from the multi-contaminated Rades Meliane site, temporal variations of IBR were induced mainly by the responses of pollution biomarkers. Previous investigations concerning other level of biological organization (population) are in accordance with the present data (Tlili et al., 2010, 2011). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to propose the Compatibility Condition for multiple expressive elements in Korean, which is highly applicable in other languages. Exploring the behavior of ethnic slurs in the presence of other regular expressive elements, I show the systematicity of how various expressive items interact with one another. For this purpose, looking at Korean is advantageous since it extensively makes use of expressives across lexical categories. In doing so, I try to answer two main questions that haven't been taken seriously before. First, the multiple occurrences of identical expressives are known to be possible, but what about co-occurrences of different expressives with varying attitudes, including the conflicting ones? Do they freely occur within one utterance? If not, what constrains their compatibility condition and the degree of the compatibility? To solve this puzzle, I investigate the dynamic paradigm of multiple expressives. I propose the Compatibility Condition Model (CCM) and the Compatibility Condition Index (CCI), showing how a language like Korean constrains the possible co-occurrences of various types of expressives such as slurs, epithets, anti-honorifics, intensifiers, or mitigators. Second, how strict is the Compatibility Condition of expressives, and what happens if the condition is flouted? I show how in practice people intentionally flout the Compatibility Condition to achieve various pragmatic effects, presenting four interesting cases: (i) the juxtaposition of opposite attitudes with stronger pragmatic effects such as sarcasm, irony, or hyperbole; (ii) the well-known flip-flop of bipolar emotional index; (iii) the code-switching at Honorific-dimension as a strategy of modulating social distance; and (iv) the question of whether Emotion- and Honorific-dimensions operate autonomously. The result supports the notion of multidimensionality (Potts, 2005 et seq.) and furthermore the newfound hybrid nature of Conditional Autonomy, i.e., autonomy with intercommunication amongst expressive dimensions.

AB  - Black Scorpion fish (Scorpaena porcus Linnaeus 1758) caught during monthly sampling carried out in 2003 in the Dardanelles, Turkey, were examined for the parasite. Trachelobdella lubrica. Infested fish were caught only during December 2003, and the clinical conditions of the 12 fish naturally infested with T. lubrica included fin rot, swollen foci of skin and haemorrhages of the gill and abdominal skin. The prevalence, intensity and abundance of infestation in December 2003 were 40%, 1.75 and 0.70, respectively. The average hepatosomatic index of the infested fish was lower than that of noninfested fish, while the means of the kidney index, splenosomatic index, condition factor, body weight and length were not significantly different between the infested and noninfested fish groups. Blood analysis was conducted on 12 naturally infested and 12 healthy (noninfested) Black Scorpion fish to determine the possible characteristic changes in blood parameters of the fish in response to natural infestation with T. lubrica. Blood leucocyte counts, haematocrit levels, serum total protein, albumin phosphorus, urea, glucose, globulin, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in naturally infested Black Scorpion fish were significantly less than those of the noninfested fish (p < 0.05). No significant decreases were observed in the serum sodium, iron, calcium, potassium, chlorine, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values of the naturally infested fish. Blood haemoglobin values, erythrocyte counts and serum glutamate aspartate aminotransferase (glutamate oxalacetate transaminase), alanine aminotransferase (glutamate pyruvate transaminase), uric acid and very low-density lipids levels of infested fish were insignificantly greater than those in healthy fish.

AB  - Urbanization directly affects the ecological status of streams and rivers: Their beds and drainage basins are often heavily transformed and their habitat conditions disturbed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the extent of human impact in streams in the city of Lodz, Central Poland (similar to 700,000 inhabitants), by pattern recognition analysis of benthic diatom assemblage samples using a Kohonen artificial neural network, principal component analysis, and indicator species analysis. The study also determined the ecological status of the streams using five diatom indices: Multimetric Diatom Index, Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index, Generic Diatom Index, Biological Diatom Index, and Trophic Diatom Index. The samples demonstrated considerable variation in ecological status. Examples of poor and bad ecological status were observed, clearly resulting from strong human pressure; however, good status and moderate status were also recorded, both at natural sites and, unexpectedly, those which were severely transformed, whose beds were covered with concrete and which were located downstream from combined sewer overflows. Such sites demonstrated high water conductivity of up to 1440 mu S/cm, but this was accompanied by other more favorable conditions: The water flowed from upstream stretches enclosed in downtown underground canals with a fast current, low water temperature, and high average concentration of dissolved oxygen (approximately 10 mg/dm(3)). These conditions had a mitigating effect, shaping the diatom assemblages to a specific form with the highest species richness and the highest number of indicator taxa observed in the study. In summary, the hydromorphological transformation of streambeds may result in seemingly good ecological status at heavily degraded sites. Therefore, conclusions based on diatom-based biomonitoring of urban streams and rivers should be drawn with caution.

AB  - Parasites are typically aggregated within their host populations. The most heavily infected hosts are frequently cited as targets for optimal disease control. Yet a heavily infected individual is not necessarily highly infective and does not automatically contribute a higher proportion of infective parasitic stages than a host with fewer parasites. Here, Pseudamphistomum truncatum (Opisthorchiida) parasitic infection within the definitive otter host (Lutra lutra) is used as a model system. The hypothesis tested is that variation in parasite abundance, aggregation and egg production (fecundity, as a proxy of host infectivity) can be explained by abiotic (season and region) or biotic (host age, sex and body condition) factors. Parasite abundance was affected most strongly by the biotic factors of age and body condition, such that adults and otters with a higher condition index had heavier infections than sub-adults or those with a lower condition index, whilst there were no significant differences in parasite abundance among the seasons, regions (ecological regions defined by river catchment boundaries) or host sexes. Conversely, parasite aggregation was affected most strongly by the abiotic factors of season and region, which were supported by four different measures of parasite aggregation (the corrected moment estimate k, Taylor's Power Law, the Index of Discrepancy D, and Boulinier's J). Pseudamphistomum truncatum was highly aggregated within otters, with aggregation stronger in the Midlands (England) and Wales than in the southwestern region of the United Kingdom. Overall, more parasites were found in fewer hosts during the summer, which coincides with the summer peak in parasite fecundity. Combined, these data suggest that (i) few otters carry the majority of P. truncatum parasites and that there are more infective stages (eggs) produced during summer; and (ii) abiotic factors are most influential when describing parasite aggregation whilst biotic factors have a greater role in defining parasite abundance. Together, parasite abundance, aggregation and fecundity can help predict which hosts make the largest contribution to the spread of infectious diseases. (c) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - We aim at understanding the influence of climate change on the functioning of two freshwater lakes in South Greenland by combining limnological and paleolimnological methods. The results offer a means of testing the potential use of subfossil chironomid for paleoclimate reconstruction. First, the current ecological status of Lake Igaliku and Lake 95 has been assessed by the combined use of a biotic index and delta N-15 analysis of chironomid larvae. The current ecological state of Lake 95, as a remote lake exempt from local human activities, remains pristine. In contrast, Lake Igaliku exhibits a worrying ecological state characterized by the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, a loss of littoral biodiversity, and alterations of its trophic functioning. A paleolimnological approach, combining subfossil chironomid and geochemical analysis, was applied to reconstruct the ecological trajectories of the lakes over the last 150 years. Redundancy analysis performed on chironomid assemblages shows that the two systems are partially driven by climate variability, and underscoring the strong potential of chironomid remains for paleoclimatic reconstruction. However, local farming activities in the catchment area of Lake Igaliku have strongly impacted its ecological state since the late 1980s, masking the actual effects of the current global warming. In conclusions in southern Greenland, lakes in pristine conditions may be excellent candidates for the past climate reconstructions based on subfossil chironomids.

AB  - Efficient sludge conditioning can improve sludge dewatering characteristics and promote the separation of flocs from the liquid phase to achieve a high solid content. To optimize this process, a reliable dewatering index must be established. Although numerous researches investigated sludge conditioning, few are devoted to the correlation between the conditioning index and the dewatering efficiency. In this study, sludges were conditioned with both synthetic and natural polymers, and their dewatering characteristics after three different mechanical dewatering devices, the filter press, belt press, and the centrifuge, were compared. The result shows that the traditionally used dewatering index may not reflect sludge conditioning properly. Correlation between sludge conditioning indices and dewaterability depends upon both the type of sludge and the means of sludge conditioning and dewatering. It is therefore concluded that dewatering index must be properly chosen for optimum sludge conditioning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the pressure-state-response conceptual model, we constructed the urban ecological security evaluation index system for 13 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region from 2003 to 2014, where integrated development has occurred up to the national strategic level. The entropy-weight method was used to calculate the index weights to eliminate subjectivity. After the perfection and detailing of the increased half-ladder membership function and the confirmation of the membership standard of urban ecological security evaluation, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation method was used to calculate, analyze and evaluate the ranks of urban ecological security from 2003 to 2012. The overall regional ecological security of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region increased during those 10 years. However, as expected for the obvious increase in the ecological state security level, neither the ecological pressure security nor the response security level significantly changed. In addition, urban social and economic indicators contributed more to the ecological security assessment than did the natural resource indicators and environmental indicators.

AB  - In order to study the impacts of bioenergy crop expansions on stream health the adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to simulate three macroinvertebrate and one fish stream health measure. Macroinvertebrate measures considered were the Hil-senhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Family Index of Biological Integrity (Family IBI), and Number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT taxa) and the fish measure used was the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI). Water quality and quantity variables obtained from a high-resolution biophysical model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) were considered as inputs to the stream health predictive models. In order to examine the potential impacts of bioenergy crop expansions on stream health measures, 20 different rotations were examined in the Saginaw Bay basin. Overall, for the second-generation of biofuel crops, improvement in water quality was associated with less intensive agricultural activities, while traditional intensive row crops generated more pollution than current landuse conditions. Regarding the impacts of landuse changes on stream health measures, all three macroinvertebrate measures were negatively impacted under intensive row crops scenario while these measures were improved under perennial crops. However, for the fish measures, the expansion of native grass, switchgrass, and miscanthus resulted in negative impacts on IBI compared to first-generation row crops. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - New energy transportation is an important link for the future development of global energy industry, while higher and more precise requirements for the new energy vehicles' air conditioning systems are also needed with its rapid development. Because of the stringent environmental and energy problems, the natural refrigerant CO2 (carbon dioxide) is investigated in this paper as an ideal alternative of the conventional HFC (Hydrofluorocarbon, R407C) used in bus/railway vehicle air conditioning systems. First, after constructing the thermodynamic simulation models and developing the operational strategies under the one-dimensional simulation of thermodynamic cycle, the thermodynamic performances of both CO2 and R407C systems are comprehensively compared under all the annual heating/cooling conditions, which showed that CO2 system performs absolutely better in heating but not good enough in cooling mode. Then, based on the annual climate data of 116 cities/ regions, the daily heating/cooling loads and corresponding power consumptions, COPs of both CO2 and R407C systems are clearly summarized, thereafter the life cycle climate performances (LCCP) and total costs are obtained. As results, the annual comprehensive ratios of CO2 performances over R407C are 0.949, 1.047, 0.915 from energetic, environmental and economic aspects. By drawing the contour maps, an innovative concept of CO2 equators are proposed and described in detail from energetic, environmental and economic perspectives. By formulating the annual operation strategy of the CO2 system on the vehicle, obtaining its annual comprehensive performance, and comprehensively considering the energy consumption index, environmental protection index and economic index of the CO2 system from the global application perspective, this study has filled the research gap mentioned above, which would also be a significant reference for researchers, manufacturers, component suppliers and policy makers.

AB  - Watersheds provide a range of services valued by society, incorporating biotic and abiotic functions within their boundaries. Recently, an operational definition of watershed integrity was applied and indices of watershed integrity (IWI) and catchment integrity (ICI) were developed and mapped for the conterminous United States. However, these indices were originally derived using equally-weighted first-order approximations of relationships between anthropogenic stressors (obtained from the U.S. EPA's StreamCat dataset) and six watershed functions. In addition, the original calculations of the IWI and ICI did not standardize metrics across these differing scales, resulting in IWI and ICI values that are not directly comparable. We provide an example of how to iteratively update the stressor-watershed function relationships using random forest models and a nationwide response metric representative of one of the six watershed functions. Specifically, we focused on the chemical regulation function (CHEM) of IWI and ICI by relating a composite metric of chemical water quality from 1914 samples to land use metrics explicit to CHEM to refine the nature of these relationships (e.g., non-linear versus linear). The rate of nitrogen fertilizer, agricultural land use, and urban land use were found to be the three most important stressors predicting the national water quality response metric. Revision of CHEM values improved the prediction of several regional- to national-scale water quality indicators. In all cases, exponential decay curves replaced the original negative linear relationship for CHEM. Therefore, the original IWI and ICI values are probably over-estimates of the actual integrity of the Nation's watersheds and catchments. With these revisions, we provide updated national maps of IWI and ICI. The methods outlined here can be implemented iteratively as more and better data become available for all six of the watershed functions to elevate the accuracy and applicability of these indices to various land management issues.

AB  - Oil transportation is growing in the Baltic Sea area and especially in the Gulf of Finland where it will reach approximately 180-200 million tons a year by 2020. Growing oil transportation is considerably contributing to the risk of accidental spill-related shoreline oiling. This paper focuses on amending the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) related shoreline classification to local conditions by dynamically changing the categorization of the shoreline in terms of its susceptibility to spilled oil caused by extreme meteorological events. This takes into consideration a number of natural physical factors. The paper presents the results of two European case studies: the Estonian shoreline of the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea), and the Spanish coast of the Gibraltar Strait. Susceptibility to spilled oil of some categories of the Estonian shoreline (sandy shores, till shores and gravel shores) occasionally changes over time from low to high sensitivity and back; especially conditioned to the influence of heavy storms. The studies carried out in Spain revealed a well recognizable indirect proportionality between foreshore slope and the tidal range. At many locations, the dynamic morphological characteristics of the beach appeared to be largely determined by contouring and specific conditions that are modifying the initial ESI related categorization of the sandy beaches concerned. The novelty of this work is in attempt to move from the standard ESI related, and locally adapted, static shoreline classification towards more dynamic shoreline monitoring based on characterization of the elements sensitive to oil pollution on shorelines.

AB  - With the aim of evaluating and comparing the correlation relationship between metal pollution and benthic structural and functional metrics, we carried out samplings of three anthropogenic disturbance levels at eight sites located in the Lake Baiyangdian that are strongly influenced by wastewater discharge (Sites 1 and 2), aquaculture and densely populated villages (Sites 3, 6, and 8), and the least human disturbances (Sites 4, 5, and 7). Benthic communities were studied in eight sample sites, and Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd, and Cr were simultaneously determined. The potential ecological risk index (RI) was calculated by Hakanson's methodology. The results showed that the RI for all three habitats was lower than 94, and they are in decreasing order: Habitat 1, Habitat 2, and Habitat 3. When the three sampling seasons were compared, August appeared to show the highest risk, followed by April and November. For the periphyton metrics, the best correlation was detected between chlorophyll c/chlorophyll a (Chl c/a) ratio and Eri Hg (r = -0.851, p<0.01); for the benthic macroinvertebrate metrics, the best correlation was established between Ed Hg and community similarity index (CSI) (r = -0.983,p<0.01). When periphyton and benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were compared, benthic macroinvertebrate metrics appeared to be more sensitive, especially the metrics of number of diptera taxa (NOT), community loss index (CLI), and CSI. Our results suggest that the benthic community would be used in biomonitoring for heavy metal pollution in the Lake Baiyangdian, China. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Given climate change projections, the ability to identify locations that provide refuge under drought conditions is an urgent conservation priority. Previously, it has been proposed that the ecosystem greenspot index could be used to identify locations that currently function as habitat refuges from drought and fire. If this is true, these locations may have the potential to function as climate-change micro-refuges. In this study we aimed to: (1) test whether ecosystem greenspot indices are related to vegetation specific gradients of habitat resources; and (2) identify environmental correlates of the ecosystem greenspots. Ecosystem greenspot indices were calculated for two vegetation types: a woodland and a grassland, and compared with in situ data on vegetation structure. There were inaccuracies in the identification of the grassland greenspot index due to fine scale spatial heterogeneity and misclassification. However, the woodland greenspot index accurately identified vegetation specific gradients in the biomass of the relevant framework species. The spatial distribution of woodland greenspots was related to interacting rainfall, soil and landscape variables. The ability to provide information about variation in resources, and hence habitat quality, within specific vegetation types has immediate applications for conservation planning. This is the first step toward validating whether the ecosystem greenspot index of Mackey et al. (Ecol Appl 22:1852-1864, 2012) can identify potential drought micro-refuges. More work is needed to (1) address sources of error in identifying specific vegetation types; (2) refine the analysis and field validation methods for grasslands; and (3) to test whether species persistence during drought is supported by identified greenspots.

AB  - The Namibian Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources has the task of collecting and providing relevant oceanographic information for management of their fisheries. However, quality information is difficult to provide because of the complexity of the processes involved in the Namibian marine ecosystem. Nonetheless, there are oceanographic data available that can contribute to fisheries management by improving the general understanding of important oceanographic processes related to fisheries. The focus of this paper is on the development of simple environmental indices that can serve as a measurement or proxy of the state or intensity of certain important oceanographic processes or variables for temporal comparison. These indices relate to oceanographic processes such as up-welling, frontal movements, anoxic bottom conditions and biological indicators, which can be updated on a regular basis to provide a long-term perspective of the particular processes to management and marine scientists.

AB  - The water and habitat quality of many streams in west-central Mexico are influenced by municipal and industrial effluent, as well as water diversion for irrigation, livestock, and deforestation. Restoration efforts have been hampered by a lack of clear standards against which to judge the degree and trend in environmental degradation. We describe the development and characteristics of a macroinvertebrate-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) designed to provide such standards. Eight metrics chosen a priori comprised the IBI: catch per unit effort, generic richness, % Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera genera, % Chironomidae individuals, Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, % depositional individuals, % predator individuals, and % gatherer genera. Each metric distinguished sites with minimum or moderate human influence from sites with severe influence. The IBI was developed with data from 27 sites and validated with 6 others. Values from the development data set correlated well with the measures of human influence based on qualitative assessment of habitat and water quality (Pearson's r = 0.86). IBI values for 7 sites on Rio Ayuquila corresponded with a documented longitudinal pattern of human influence and the existing fish-based IBI (Pearsoris r = 0.87). This macroinvertebrate IBI shows promise for developing biological standards, facilitating long-term monitoring, and improving ecological integrity of streams in west-central Mexico.

AB  - Eutrophication is common in shallow lakes in lowland areas. In their natural state, most shallow lakes would have clear water and a thriving aquatic plant community. However, eutrophication often causes turbid water, high algal productivity, and low species diversity and abundance of submerged macrophytes. A key indicator of the ecological state of lake ecosystems is the maximum growing depth (MGD) of aquatic plants. However, few studies have yet quantified the relationship between changes in external phosphorus (P) input to a lake and associated variation in MGD. This study examines the relationship between these variables in Loch Leven, a shallow, eutrophic loch in Scotland, UK. A baseline MGD value from 1905 and a series of more recent MGD values collected between 1972 and 2006 are compared with estimated P loads over a period of eutrophication and recovery. The results suggest a close relationship between changes in MGD of macrophytes and changes in the external P load to the loch. Variation in MGD reflected the 'light history' that submerged macrophytes had been exposed to over the 5-year period prior to sampling, rather than responding to short term, within year, variations in water clarity. This suggests that changes in macrophyte MGD may be a good indicator of overall, long term, changes in water quality that occur during the eutrophication and restoration of shallow lakes.

AB  - Assessing status of natural resources and ecosystem components is pivotal for management, where indicators or indices often are used as proxies of ecological state. Many indicators, however, lack reference points and are associated with sampling errors and environmental noise, limiting their usefulness in management. Here we present a method for assessing state changes in ecological indicator from time-series: Analyses of Structural Changes in Ecological Time Series (ASCETS). ASCETS enables both quantitative boundary levels for changes in indicator states (e.g. for management targets), and the confidence for a change in state during an assessment period. Thereby it can be used in risk assessments and is suitable for aggregation or integration of different indicator states across sites, or for an ecosystem based approach to management. With extended information about ecological state during a reference period, ASCETS can support reference levels for defining ecological status of an indicator. ASCETS first identifies structural changes in time-series to determine reference periods with coherent indicator dynamics. Next, from the observed indicator values during the reference period, a distribution of resampled median values is used to set boundary levels as a tolerable range of indicator variation reflecting the same state as during the reference period. Finally, a confidence of a change in indicator state is evaluated during an assessment period as the proportion of resampled median values of the assessment period overlapping the boundary levels of the reference period. Simulations indicate ASCETS correctly detects changes in indicator state when changes in indicator values are at least twice as large as the coefficient of variation, with a false rate of changes around 5%. We apply ASCETS to indicators for bird and fish communities used within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to illustrate how indicator boundary levels can be set where reference levels may be ecologically and analytically troublesome. An R-script is provided for further use and modification. We propose ASCETS as a flexible and generic method for assessing changes in ecological states from time-series to support identification of management targets.

AB  - Measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is widely used as a biomarker of exposure to neurotoxic compounds in aquatic environments. In the present study, AChE activity was monitored in the clam Tapes philippinarum in the Lagoon of Venice, with the aim of evaluating the possible exposure of animals to neurotoxic compounds. Two sampling strategies were followed. In the first case, temporal and spatial variations of AChE activity were measured in clams collected seasonally (from October 2003 to June 2004) in 3 sites of the Lagoon: Campalto (site 1), near a sewage treatment plant, Marghera (site 2), a highly polluted area, and Poveglia (site 3), a reference site. The condition index (CI) of clams was also calculated. In the second case, AChE activity was measured in clams collected at the end of seasonal samplings in 12 sites located throughout the Lagoon: areas licensed for clam farming (sites 5 to 11), nearby canals characterised by waste waters from agricultural areas (sites 4, 12, 13, 14), and a reference site outside the Lagoon (site 15). Results revealed a significant reduction in AChE activity in clams from Marghera in October, January and April, indicating their probable exposure to neurotoxic compounds originating in the industrial zone of Porto Marghera. A seasonal trend in AChE activity was also observed, enzyme activity being higher in January and lower in June. Clams from Campalto generally had higher Cl values than those from Marghera and Poveglia. However, no particular correlation between AChE activity and Cl was found. Lastly, marked differences in AChE activity were recorded when comparing enzyme activity of clams from various sites in the Lagoon of Venice with those of clams collected at site 15. Significant reductions in AChE activity were observed in animals collected in both nearby canals and licensed areas, indicating the homogeneous spatial distribution of potentially neurotoxic compounds throughout the Lagoon. It is probable that sediment mobilisation caused by clam harvesting and the passage of shipping plays an important role in resuspension of persistent contaminants having neurotoxic activity.

AB  - Bahia Salado, located in northern Chile (27 degrees 41'S, 70 degrees 59'W), is the southernmost foraging ground for the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). To date, almost no information exists on its current status, nor on its connectivity with nesting rookeries in the EPO. This study aims to inform on the genetic characterization, health and ecology of Bahia Salado's green turtle aggregation in order to provide baseline information for local conservation strategies. We describe population structure and residency times using mark-recapture method. We also examine health parameters (body condition index, blood profile and blood copper-Cu and lead-Pb concentrations) and regional connectivity through genetic analyses. Our results indicate that this aggregation is composed exclusively of juveniles, with residency times varying between five to sixteen months. Turtles exhibited a very good body condition; however they showed the highest blood concentrations of Cu and Pb described for C. mydas and for almost all sea turtle species. Some biochemistry parameters (albumin, calcium, phosphorus, AST, triglycerides and creatinine) are also the highest ever reported for this species in the region. Analysis of the 770 bp (base pairs) control region of the mitochondrial DNA revealed four haplotypes, suggesting a strong genetic connectivity to the Galapagos rookery. Our study indicates that Bahia Salado's aggregation represents a developmental foraging ground, where juvenile green turtles thrive. Although Bahia Salado's ecosystem seems to be a very suitable habitat for the species, the high levels of Cu and Pb, together with elevated AST, demand further research on the negative impacts of heavy metals on this aggregation. Our results highlight the importance to protect this bay from anthropological activities, evaluate pollution sources and other local threats to this particular coastal ecosystem. We recommend year-round monitoring of the green turtle aggregation and other components of this ecosystem, incorporating participation of local seaweed collectors and the fishing community.

AB  - The use of imidacloprid (IMI) and its formulated products in agriculture is a risk to aquatic organisms due to deposition into waterways from runoff and aerial spraying. However, there is limited information on the potential effects of this pesticide on commercially important shellfish, such as oysters. We investigated the impacts of IMI and Spectrum 200SC (IMI formulation) on the activity of the enzymes Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Catalase (CAT) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in different oyster tissues including the gill, adductor muscle and digestive gland. We also investigated the condition index and fatty acid composition of the flesh of oysters after 2 weeks exposure. The concentrations of IMI in the different tissues was assessed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) after QuEChERS extraction. Higher concentrations of IMI residues were detected in the adductor muscle of the oysters, followed by the gills and with the lowest amounts recovered from the digestive gland across all the concentrations tested. IMI and Spectrum 200SC significantly affected the gill AChE activity at 2 mg/L, but digestive gland CAT, and gill and digestive gland GST were impacted at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01 and 0.05 mg/L). In the whole oyster, 2 weeks exposure to IMI ( >= 0.01 mg/L) resulted in a proportional increase in saturated fatty acids (SFA), altered the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to SFA ratio and altered the omega 3 fatty acids (n-3) to omega 6 fatty acids (n-6) ratio, but there were no effects on the condition index of the oyster. Although the oysters responded differently to the formulated product, there was no consistent difference in the sublethal effects of analytical IMI and Spectrum 200SC. This study showed that exposure to IMI and Spectrum 200SC can significantly affect the biochemical processes and metabolites in oysters, with implications for food quality and safety.

AB  - Planktonic organisms are an important food resource of pelagic ecosystems, but they also serve as an integrator of hydroclimatic forcing. Four types of recently developed plankton indicator, based on the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey, are summarized here: indicators based on individual taxa; indicators based on functional attributes of the ecosystem (diversity); species assemblage indicators; and indicators of larval fish survival. All provide information on the state of a pelagic ecosystem, but have different limitations. Therefore, their combined application provides the most accurate diagnosis of ecosystem state. In most of the examples described, statistical analyses help to identify major spatial and temporal patterns, and may allow future ecosystem changes to be anticipated.

AB  - They performed long-term studies of the Lake Beloye, located in the protection zone of the Volga-Kama State Natural Biosphere Reserve. The purpose of the research is to assess the ecological state of the lake and the coastal zone and to develop a landscaping project. Hydrochemical studies revealed supersaturation of the surface layers of water with oxygen and deficiency at the bottom, the increase of nutrient content, a high content of organic substances, and increased pH values of the water. All of the abovementioned indicates an intensively ongoing process of eutrophication. The basis of the community was represented by rotifers. The summer abundance of zooplankton over the years varied from 406.2 thousand un./m3 to 4120.9 thousand un./m3, biomass from 1.6 g/m3 to 12.0 g/m3. By the value of the saprobity index, the reservoir belonged to the beta-mesosaprobic zone in most cases. The values of biotic indices, high quantitative indicators of zooplankton characterize the Lake Beloye as eutrophic. The analysis of the ecological state of the lake and its coastal territory showed that the main problems are the intake of suspended solids, the compounds of nutrients and pollutants with tributary water, as well as an intensive recreational load, leading to land litter, trampling of vegetation, and lake pollution. In accordance with the environmental problems and ecological restrictions of the territories, they developed the recommendations to reduce the anthropogenic load and project proposals, including the creation and arrangement of a recreation area. Prior to the commencement of improvement, it is recommended to carry out restoration measures, such as aeration of the reservoir, mechanical collection and mowing of plants, cleaning of coastal territory and the lake itself, installation of information signs.

AB  - We introduce a groundwater sustainability index offering a novel combination of features. It is holistic in the sense that it incorporates both water quantity and water quality indicators. The former employs the signal-to-noise ratio of long-term trends estimated via robust regression; the latter uses concentration of the primary contaminant of concern. A fuzzy inference system integrates these unlike metrics. The system also explicitly encodes expert knowledge and stakeholder values, and directly acknowledges subjectivity in environmental condition "grading," through the use of linguistic rules and fuzzy sets, respectively. The fuzzy rule base is constructed such that poor environmental conditions captured by one measure are not hidden by good performance in another. A standard Mamdani (max-min) inference engine is used with centroid defuzzification. The outcome is an intuitively accessible index ranging from 0 to 100. The method is demonstrated using examples from the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer, an important and managerially challenging transboundary (Canada-US) water resource.

AB  - This study identified drivers of change in Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor Estuary, NJ, USA over multiple long-term time periods by developing an assessment tool (an "Eutrophication Index") capable of handling data gaps and identifying the condition of and relationships between ecosystem pressures, ecosystem state, and biotic responses. The Eutrophication Index integrates 15 indicators in 3 components: (1) water quality, (2) light availability, and (3) seagrass response. Annual quantitative assessments of condition and its consistency for three geographic segments range from 0 (highly degraded) to 100 (excellent condition). Eutrophication Index values significantly declined (p < 0.05) by 34 and 36 % in central and south segments from 73 and 71 in the early 1990s to 48 and 45 in 2010, respectively. Ongoing declines despite periods of improvement (e. g., 1989-1992, 1996-2002, and 2006-2008) suggest these estuarine segments are currently undergoing eutrophication. The north segment had highest nutrient loading and lowest Eutrophication Index values (2010 Eutrophication Index value=37) but increased over time (from 14 in 1991 to 50 in 2009) in contrast to trends in central and south segments. Rapid initial declines of Eutrophication Index values with increasing loading highlight that the estuary is sensitive to loading. Ecosystem response to total nutrient loading, as described by the Index of Eutrophication, exhibited nonlinearity at loading rates of > 1,200 and < 5,000 kg TN km(-2) year(-1) and > 100 and < 250 kg TP km(-2) year(-1), values similar to responses of seagrass to nutrient loading in many ecosystems. While nutrient loading is initially a critical driver of ecosystem change, other factors, e. g., light availability and drive ecosystem condition, yield nonlinearity. Empirical evidence for switches in the driving factors of ecosystem stress adds complexity to the conceptualization of ecosystem resiliency due to feedback from multiple dynamic, nonlinear stressors.

AB  - Growth of Cerastoderma (= Cardium) edule (L.) and C. lamarcki (Reeve) ''posed to mercury in situ in the western part of the Limfjord, Denmark, was compared with that of non-exposed populations. Physiological condition index values of cockles sampled during growth periods in 1990 and 1991 were not significantly different for exposed and non-exposed populations when species, length, and sampling date were taken into account (stepwise multiple regression analysis, and ANOVA). Mercury exposure in the laboratory confirmed these findings. Biosynthesis of porphyrin precursors, delta-amino levuleic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), detected by ion-exchange chromatography, was clearly perturbed by mercury exposure in the environment as well as in laboratory experiments; thus, the two biochemical components can be considered biomarkers of mercury exposure. For the porphyrins (uro-, proto-, and copro-porphyrins) detected by HPLC, no general effect could be established. The mechanistic basis of disturbance of the essential porphyrin biosynthesis (the prerequisite of cytochrome formation) and a possible alternative porphyrin source are discussed.

AB  - Regions with great natural environmental complexity present a challenge for attaining 2 key properties of an ideal bioassessment index: 1) index scores anchored to a benchmark of biological expectation that is appropriate for the range of natural environmental conditions at each assessment site, and 2) deviation from the reference benchmark measured equivalently in all settings so that a given index score has the same ecological meaning across the entire region of interest. These properties are particularly important for regulatory applications like biological criteria where errors or inconsistency in estimating site-specific reference condition or deviation from it can lead to management actions with significant financial and resource-protection consequences. We developed an index based on benthic macroinvertebrates for California, USA, a region with great environmental heterogeneity. We evaluated index performance (accuracy, precision, responsiveness, and sensitivity) throughout the region to determine if scores provide equivalent ecological meaning in different settings. Consistent performance across environmental settings was improved by 3 key elements of our approach: 1) use of a large reference data set that represents virtually all of the range of natural gradients in the region, 2) development of predictive models that account for the effects of natural gradients on biological assemblages, and 3) combination of 2 indices of biological condition (a ratio of observed-to-expected taxa [0/E] and a predictive multimetric index [pMMI]) into a single index (the California Stream Condition Index [CSCI]). Evaluation of index performance across broad environmental gradients provides essential information when assessing the suitability of the index for regulatory applications in diverse regions.

AB  - The adsorption of alkali and alkaline earth ions onto the exterior surface of inorganic nanocages X12Y12 (X = B, Al, Ga and Y = N, P, As) was investigated by using the density functional theory (DFT). All of the configurations, including the pristine ions or nanocages, as well as the ion adsorbed nanocage systems, were optimized using B3LYP-D3 functional and DEF2-TZVP basis sets. Comparative single point energy calculations were performed using different functionals viz. B3LYP-D3, M06-2X, omega B97XD and CAM-B3LYP, together with DEF2-TZVP and DEF2-QZVP basis sets. The results of natural bond orbital (NBO), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analyses were compatible with the results of electronic properties. Total density of states (TDOSs), the natural charge, Wiberg bond index (WBI), natural electron configuration, donor-acceptor NBO interactions and second-order perturbation energies are obtained. Strong interaction between the ions and the nanocages is observed and the tendency of the ions to adsorb onto the surfaces of the mentioned X12Y12 nanocages is in the order Be++ > Mg++ > Ca++ > Li+ > Na+ > K+. These nanocages may be potential sensors for these alkali and alkaline earth ions.

AB  - Maerl beds are free-living, non-geniculate coralline algae habitats which form biogenic reefs with high micro-scale complexity supporting a diversity and abundance of rare epifauna and epiflora. These habitats are highly mobile in shallow marine environments where substantial maerl beds co-exist with siliciclastic sediment, exemplified by our study site of Galway Bay. Coupled hydrodynamic-wave sediment transport models have been used to explore the transport patterns of maerl-siliciclastic sediment during calm summer conditions and severe winter storms. The sediment distribution is strongly influenced by storm waves even in water depths greater than 100 m. Maerl is present at the periphery of wave-induced residual current gyres during storm conditions. A combined wave-current Sediment Mobility Index during storm conditions shows correlation with multibeam backscatter and surficial sediment distribution. A combined wave-current Mobilization Frequency Index during storm conditions acts as a physical surrogate for the presence of maerl-siliciclastic mixtures in Galway Bay. Both indices can provide useful integrated oceanographic and sediment information to complement coupled numerical hydrodynamic, sediment transport and erosion-deposition models.

AB  - Several studies indicate that there are significant relationships among quality of life, green vegetation, and socioeconomic conditions, particularly in urban environments. The purpose of this research is twofold: (1) to compare two weighting and aggregation techniques, data envelopment analysis (DEA) and principal components analysis (PCA), in the development of a socioeconomic index; and (2) to test for and explore spatial variation in the relationship between socioeconomic index and environmental variables using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The analysis was conducted at the census block group level in Massachusetts. First, DEA and PCA were used to generate two separate socioeconomic indexes. Second, the relationship between these indexes and environmental variables including percentage impervious surface, percentage industrial land use, percentage land used for waste, and traffic density was modeled using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and GWR. The GWR models explained more variance in the relationship than the OLS models and indicated that there is considerable spatial variation in the character and the strength of this relationship. The results of the GWR analyses were similar between the models generated using DEA- and PCA-derived indexes, indicating that the results were corroborative. The study concludes that the environmental variables are generally a strong predictor of the socioeconomic conditions at the scale of census block group; however, there is substantial geographical variation in the strength and the character of this relationship. The results of this study also suggest that various weighting and aggregation methods should be tested in every study that uses or creates composite indicators.

AB  - Indoor environment quality is a relative measure of comfort perception by people exposed to the indoor conditions. It is expected that any assessment of energy performance should also include indoor comfort. This study is to review indoor environmental quality models (with respect to thermal and acoustic comfort, indoor air and lighting quality). A simplified indoor environmental quality model is also developed with consideration of EN 15251 draft Guideline for using indoor environmental input parameters for the design and assessment of energy performance of buildings'. This article analyses what components should be modelled and in particular discusses the effect of different weighting schemes on the overall indoor environmental quality index. The analysis includes thermal comfort models, indoor air quality, acoustic comfort and daylight illumination versus lightning. The proposed indoor environmental quality component sub-models will give the most reliable results when the model indoor environment input data are correctly measured and disturbing influences of indoor environmental quality monitoring process are well defined and properly assessed. The final indoor environmental quality result is based on subjoining the uncertainty values achieved in panel analysis of percentage of persons dissatisfied with indoor environmental quality with corrected measurement uncertainty. All simulations for IEQ(index) sub-components and preliminary metrological analysis of the whole indoor environmental quality model were performed with the NIST program for Monte Carlo tests. The presented indoor environmental quality model proposal is developed to support engineers' practice as the convenient tool for a practical assessment of building's occupational satisfaction.

AB  - Land managers increasingly rely upon landscape assessments to understand the status of natural resources and identify conservation priorities. Many of these landscape planning efforts rely on geospatial models that characterize the ecological integrity of the landscape. These general models utilize measures of habitat disturbance and human activity to map indices of ecological integrity. We built upon these modeling frameworks by developing a Landscape Integrity Index (LII) model using geospatial datasets of the human footprint, as well as incorporation of other indicators of ecological integrity such as biodiversity and vegetation departure. Our LII model serves as a general indicator of ecological integrity in a regional context of human activity, biodiversity, and change in habitat composition. We also discuss the application of the LII framework in two related coarse-filter landscape conservation approaches to expand the size and connectedness of protected areas as regional mitigation for anticipated land-use changes.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are among the highest biological productive ecosystems; they offer a variety of habitats and feeding grounds for several species. These ecosystems are besmirched by human activities which entail the degradation to their environmental aspects. The purpose of this study is the identification of the grain-size characteristics and the unprecedented recognition of the vegetation cover, so as to assess the ecological state and the water body quality of Kalaat Andalous lagoon: a fast changing ecosystem under its dynamic sandy spit and human pressures. The methodology is based on the sedimentological analysis and the microfauna identification. The study of the environmental quality of the lagoon was built on an unprecedented identification of the macrophyte communities and the use of diversity indexes and the EXCLAME indicator; the latter combines the taxonomic composition and the species abundance. The sedimentological investigations showed that the northern and southern areas of the lagoon, as well as its channel area are all dominated by a sandy facies provided by the continental shelf i.e. the nearshore zone. The central area of the lagoon is characterized by the finest grain size facies (<0.063 mm) mostly supplied by the aeolian terrestrial fluxes and the delta flood yields. The harvested pelagic and benthic microfauna indicated that the lagoon is supplied by sediments of mixed continental-fluvial and marine origins. The inventory of macrophytes demonstrates the presence of 19 species, five of which are reference species. The dominant taxa are those of Green algae (53%) with several opportunistic and invasive species with a high outbreak altering the ecosystem's natural balance, then Brown algae (21%), Red algae (16%) and angiosperms (10%). Those results, along with the biodiversity indexes outcomes, revealed the quality loss of the ecosystem and the water eutrophication. The lagoon floristic communities are slightly unbalanced, which might be due to the natural disturbance and the anthropogenic activities. Those results conform to the EXCLAME indicator (EQRMAC = 0.24), illustrating the poor ecological state of the Kalaat Andalous lagoon water body.

AB  - We use data from a survey of several hundred lakes in the northeastern United States by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to illustrate an approach to identifying promising indicators of lake condition. We construct a hypothetical gold standard of water quality from the first principal component of 16 chemical variables measured in the lakes, and examine its associations with 71 candidate indicators based on measurements of human activity, birds, fish and zooplankton in the lakes or their watersheds. Nonparametric summaries of these associations-based on rank correlations and receiver-operating-characteristic curves-suggest that variables summarizing the extent of human disturbance are generally the strongest indicators. To the extent that our water-quality variable is a useful proxy for ecological condition, our results suggest that easily-obtained measures of human activity are at least as predictive as many of the harder-to-measure biological indicators that have been proposed.

AB  - Rapid ecological assessment methods, such as Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA) and Indexes of Biotic Integrity (IBI) are useful tools for the selection of priority areas for biodiversity conservation. However, the majority of rapid assessment methods are based on data from a single taxonomic group; a multi-taxa index should provide a more integrated evaluation of the response of a disturbed system. In this study, we propose a new, easy-to-follow, integrated Index of Biotic Integrity (IBIint) which combines plants and birds to assess ecological integrity of tropical forest fragments. This integrated index combines the information of two previously developed rapid assessment methods: REA for plants and IBI for birds. These two indexes were built based on key vegetation features and on levels of sensitivity to forest fragmentation of bird species. We applied IBI, REA and the new IBIint indexes on the characterization of 10 forest fragments and in a large continuous forest block (reference area). We also tested the correlation of the proposed index (IBIint), REA and IBI with patch size, forest amount and connectivity at four spatial scales (250, 500, 1000, 1500 m). Our hypothesis was that IBIint would be more correlated with landscape metrics than the REA and IBI. As expected, IBIint was the more accurate index once it was explained by all landscape variables: area of forest fragments; forest connectivity; and, percentage of forest cover at four spatial scales. REA and IBI were explained only by one of those parameters. We conclude that IBIint can be an excellent tool to aid conservationists and managers for defining conservation strategies in scenarios with fast habitat loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the adaptability and stability factors of 20 corn genotypes (Zea mays L.) split into four genetical groups (single cross, three way crosses, double crosses and open cultivars) at different fertility levels, sowing dates and sites in the state of Minas Gerais. Among the cultivars evaluated, the three way crosses Hata 3012 presented greatest adaptability. It was found that the average yield of the three way crosses was superior to those of the other groups, being most adapted. Among environmental factors studied, the absence of fertilization and late sowing were the ones which contributed the most to the decrease of environmental index. The methodologies used to estimate the adaptability and stability parameters, despite showing similar results, provided distinctive responses relative to the inclination of the regression straight line of some genotypes. The level of fertilizers and the sowing date were the two factors of greatest influence in determining the quality of environments.

AB  - The relevance of the study is caused by the increased necessity to solve ecological issues in Russian Arctic regions considering their importance for the development of the country. The task complexity lies both in the presence of cumulative environmental damage and the topicality to elaborate sustainable approaches to natural resource development in the near future.
   The main aim is to analyze the condition of the ecosystem and its separate components in the Norilsk industrial area as one of the significant resource territories in the Russian Arctic. Special attention is paid to techniques of monitoring the environment and official documents regulating ecology that require the elimination of acute contradictions and legislative vacuum.
   Methods of the research include analyses of research papers published in Russian and foreign sources in the last decade on environmental challenges in the Russian Arctic and especially in the Norilsk industrial area. Various bibliographic systems including the Russian Science Citation Index, Scopus, and "Environment protection" abstract service by VINITI were used.
   Results. Unique characteristics of Arctic regions were revealed that require both non-traditional technological concepts when conducting an industrial activity, and special approaches when regulating and controlling ecological state. The example of the Norilsk industrial area was used to demonstrate improvements in ecological aspects of industrial activity of mining and smelting enterprise even despite the incident with a fuel spill in 2020. However, the attempted measures are still insufficient to regard the current ecological situation as satisfactory. The problems of neutralization of cumulative environmental damage have awaited solutions. The efficiency of planned measures for improvement of the state of the environment essentially depends on changes in legal acts poorly considering specific features of Arctic territories, as well as on closer collaboration of industrial enterprises both with the scientific community and local residents.

AB  - Marchica Lagoon, a Ramsar site on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, is experiencing the impacts of watershed pollution, which includes pollutants from the domestic, agricultural, industrial, and mining sectors. Restoration actions were undertaken around this lagoon during the last decade in order to protect its ecological value and to develop tourist activity. To conserve the biodiversity in the lagoon, it is important to assess the environmental state of this ecosystem. This study aims to evaluate the ecotoxicological state of sediments through the post restoration characterization of the trace elements Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Co, and Ba, as well as their correlation to the major elements, grain size, and total organic carbon, sampled during two campaigns (the wet and dry seasons of 2018) across a sampling network of thirteen stations. Multivariate analysis and ecotoxicological risk assessment of the trace elements using the sediment quality guidelines and five pollution indices (geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), pollution-load index (PLI), and mean effect range median quotient (m-ERM-Q)) revealed contamination of the lagoon by Pb, Zn, and Cu, and minimal pollution by Cr, Co, and Ba. The distribution of the biological-risk index reveals that four zones of the lagoon may present a high probability of toxicity, thus constituting potential risk areas for aquatic organisms: during the wet season, the area in the northwestern sandbar border, the southwest eutrophication zone, and the mouth of the stream valley conveying industrial discharges; and during dry season, the northwestern eutrophication zone. Despite the restoration actions achieved around the lagoon, the lead, zinc, and copper concentrations increased, and their variation was significant between group stations. The biodiversity conservation of Marchica Lagoon requires continuous monitoring and assessment, as well as the implementation of an integrated management plan with restoration actions, not only around the lagoon, but also at its watershed level.

AB  - Nonsan Stream is a tributary of the Geum River that is strongly affected by urbanization and agricultural activities in the watershed. The present study was performed to diagnose the chemical and biological health of the stream from 2010 to 2016 using the multi-metric water pollution index (WPI) and index of biotic integrity (IBI) models. Monthly and annual variations in stream water chemistry were directly influenced by the monsoon season. Inputs of total phosphorus, suspended solids, and ionic substances, as well as dilution of total nitrogen, occurred during July and August. Chlorophyll increase was largely influenced by total phosphorus (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.01), total nitrogen: total phosphorus ratio (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.01), and electrical conductivity (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.01). Principal component analysis showed that the abundances of omnivorous and tolerant species were higher than those of insectivorous and sensitive species due to nutrient and organic matter pollution in the stream. Fish composition analysis showed that Zacco platypus (pale chub, Cyprinidae) was the most dominant fish species in the stream, while sensitive fish species disappeared over time. Analysis of the Pearson correlation network revealed that water quality parameters were negatively correlated with trophic and tolerance indicators. Average multi-metric values of water pollution index from 2010 to 2016 ranged from 15 to 19 in the stream, indicating fair to poor chemical health. The modeled values of the multi-metric index based on biological integrity matched those of the chemical model. Moreover, the results of trophic and tolerance indicator analyses matched the chemical results. This outcome suggested that biological ecosystem health is directly influenced by chemical pollution.

Suspended solids and turbidity can impact streams in a number of ways from habitat smothering to visual impairments. Comparison of transparency tube data to the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) as measured by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency shows a strong correlation. Additional data must be gathered to determine whether this is a true relationship.

AB  - The ecological state of the environment, including water bodies, is evaluated by different methods, one of which is bioindication. The method of bioindication is based on the study of the state of biota in natural conditions, the monitoring of the composition and the number of indicator species inhabiting the medium under study, the identification of which has been carried out by researchers visually, using microscopy methods. As an alternative, the paper considers a method for identifying hydrobionts in a water sample using the rbcL marker gene of freshwater organisms on the basis of modern sequencing methods. The results of the analysis are presented and the water quality of Nizhniy Kaban lake (Kazan, Russia) is estimated on the basis of DNA-barcoding by a next-generation sequencing method. The sequenced sequences of the fragment of the rbcL hydrobiont gene of fresh-water Lake Nizhniy Kaban in the autumn (2016) and summer (2017) sampling periods in the fastq format are included in the international database on the NCBI's website with unique numbers SRR7470969, SRR7459788 and SRR7463326. A comparative analysis of metagenomic data shows that the majority of the organisms of Lower Kaban Lake are grouped by the rbcL gene near the b-a mesosaprobic zone. Lower Kaban lake can be characterized as contaminated, transitional from b-mesosaprobic to a-mesosaprobic by water quality.

AB  - The number of New Zealand's freshwater fish listed as threatened has increased since 1992 when the first New Zealand threat classification system list was compiled. In this study, temporal and land cover-related trends were analysed for data on freshwater fish distribution, comprising more than 20 000 records for the 47 years from January 1970 to January 2017 from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database. The analysis included individual species abundance and distribution trends, as well as an index of fish community integrity, namely the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Of the 25 fish species that met the requirements for analysis to determine changes in the proportion of sites they occupied over time, 76% had negative trends (indicating declining occurrence). Of the 20 native species analysed for the proportion of sites occupied over time, 75% had negative trends; 65% of these were significant declines and more species were in decline at pasture sites than natural cover sites. The average IBI score also declined over the time period and, when analysed separately, the major land cover types revealed that the IBI declined at pasture catchment sites but not at sites with natural vegetation catchments.

AB  - Reporting progress against targets for international biodiversity agreements is hindered by a shortage of suitable biodiversity data. We describe a cost-effective system involving Reef Life Survey citizen scientists in the systematic collection of quantitative data covering multiple phyla that can underpin numerous marine biodiversity indicators at high spatial and temporal resolution. We then summarize the findings of a continentaland decadal-scale State of the Environment assessment for rocky and coral reefs based on indicators of ecosystem state relating to fishing, ocean warming, and invasive species and describing the distribution of threatened species. Fishing impacts are widespread, whereas substantial warming-related change affected some regions between 2005 and 2015. Invasive species are concentrated near harbors in southeastern Australia, and the threatened-species index is highest for the Great Australian Bight and Tasman Sea. Our approach can be applied globally to improve reporting against biodiversity targets and enhance public and policymakers' understanding of marine biodiversity trends.

AB  - The DSIAR biotic index for freshwater diatoms, regarded as a potential indicator of impact from agricultural and urban land use on rivers in temperate south-eastern Australia, did not correlate significantly with an index of catchment condition in a tropical region of northern Australia. However, the relationships between the index and water chemistry, especially pH, salinity and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, were consistent in both regions. The variable relationship between the index and catchment conditions can be explained by differing effects of catchment land use on stream-water chemistry in northern and southern Australia. In the south, land use has commonly resulted in increases in stream pH, salinity and nutrients, whereas in the north its impact on pH and salinity appears weak. These findings emphasise the need to interpret biological and ecological indices in the context of the varying causal pathways by which human activities affect stream ecosystems in different circumstances.

AB  - The consequences of large-scale disturbances magnified by climate extremes and land-use changes in Norway spruce forests in the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) are assessed in this study. The study area is part of the territory of Tatra National Park (TANAP). The driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework was applied to evaluate how the ecosystem and its services are affected. The state of the ecosystem and its potential for provisioning ecosystem services before and after disturbances is expressed by a set of indicators derived mostly from long-term ecological research conducted in TANAP. The differences are classified by a standardised change index (CI). Ten years after the major windthrow disturbance in 2004, all ecosystem services were still below the pre-disturbance state. The most pronounced declines were found in cultural (average CI = 0.69) and provisioning (average CI = 0.86) ecosystem services. Regulating services are recovering faster (average CI = 0.97), with some indicators exceeding the state before the disturbances. Significant changes took place at the tree line, which is a new phenomenon not known from previous disturbances. Despite a gradual recovery of the ecosystem state and functioning, this analysis confirms that there is a serious risk of decline in forest ecosystem benefits according to regional climate change projections. It also indicates the increasing importance of sustainable forest management for safeguarding ecosystem services under changing conditions.

AB  - In natural wildlife populations, parasite-host interactions are common ecological phenomena that can be important to community structure. We assessed the prevalence of tick infestation on pancake tortoises, Malacochersus tornieri, with respect to location (inside vs. outside Tarangire National Park [TNP]), tortoise age class, sex, season, site of attachment, and body condition index (BCI). Malacochersus tornieri hosted Amblyomma nuttalli, the tick that also parasitizes other sub-Saharan tortoises of the family Testudinidae. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we found tick infestation to be lower inside TNP than sites set outside TNP. Further, tick prevalence was positively correlated with carapace length and negatively so with BCI. Although observation of ticks siphoning M. tornieri from the carapace was infrequent, the observed rate was, nevertheless, higher than reported from other terrestrial tortoises in sub-Saharan Africa. These results are discussed.

AB  - Variation in oxidative stress markers in natural populations may provide a useful background for understanding variation in life history strategies. In this study, we seek to evaluate patterns of variation in levels of reactive oxygen metabolites (markers of oxidative damage), serum antioxidant capacity, and serum concentration of thiols (antioxidants endogenously synthesized) in nestling and breeding blue petrels (Halobaena caerulea) and in breeding Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata). Male and female prions and nestling petrels did not differ in any of the oxidative stress markers. The serum antioxidant capacity positively correlated with the sample time in nestling blue petrels. Breeding petrels with higher body condition index had higher serum antioxidant capacity and circulating thiols. Finally, both seabird species showed lower levels of reactive oxygen metabolites and higher levels of serum antioxidant capacity than previously studied bird species.

AB  - We examined the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) on macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental conditions in streams draining 18 small watersheds in the Southern Outer Piedmont ecoregion in Georgia, USA, over a 24-mo period of record. Specifically, we analyzed relationships among LULC categories (i.e., % impervious surface [IS], pasture, silviculture, and deciduous/evergreen forest) and hydrological, physicochemical, and benthic habitat variables, and macroinvertebrate metrics. Macroinvertebrate metrics were related primarily to % IS and % deciduous forest cover, with lowest biotic integrity (species diversity, taxon richness, biological stream condition index) found in high % IS watersheds. Biotic integrity declined with decreasing % forest cover throughout the seasons, and multiple regression models and partial correlation analysis revealed that physicochemical and benthic habitat variables explained more variation in macroinvertebrate metrics throughout the seasons than did hydrological variables at most sites. Based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling, heavily urbanized sites were strongly separated from all other sites in terms of assemblage structure. Total ordination distance among seasonal samples from the same sites increased as % forest cover increased. This pattern might have arisen because urbanized streams had high abundances of a few tolerant, persistent taxa and lacked many ephemeral taxa found in less disturbed systems. The influence of anthropogenic LULC on macroinvertebrate assemblages appears to be consistent throughout the year and reduces seasonal changes in assemblages. LULC-associated differences among assemblages are strongly associated with changes in physicochemistry and benthic habitat conditions that probably are mediated by hydrological alterations associated with altered LULC in the watersheds of this region.

AB  - The urban wetlands of Bogota are ecosystems of great importance, yet they are deteriorating. The state of deterioration must be evaluated in order to develop new methods of ecosystem monitoring and conservation. Here we describe the development of an index to assess the ecological health of five urban wetlands and one rural wetland from limnological data. The field phase of this study took place in November 2007 (rainy season) and February 2008 (dry season). Physical and chemical variables of the wetland ecosystems (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, hardness, chlorides, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, orthophosphates, and biological oxygen demand) were measured and samples of phytoplankton, periphyton, macroinvertebrates, and aquatic plants (macrophytes) were collected. The indices developed (biotic indices of communities: BI, and limnological conditions index: LICOI) allow classification of wetlands into three categories: those that have "acceptable limnological conditions" (Meridor, Jaboque and Guaimaral), those with "regular limnological conditions" (Santa Maria del Lago, Juan Amarillo) and those with "poor limnological conditions" (Tibanica). None of the environments studied fit a potential fourth category of "best limnological conditions." The LICOI is a management tool that can be used to assess changes in wetlands after positive actions (restoration, cleaning, hydraulic management), or negative impacts (depletion, alien species, pollution). It also could allow regular monitoring of wetland evolution and serve as a basis for the development of indices measuring the ecological status of other aquatic environments in Colombia.

AB  - In general, diadromous land particularly amphidromous and catadromous) freshwater fishes decline in frequency of occurrence, change age/size structure, and probably also decline in abundance with increasing elevation and distance upstream from the sea. In freshwater fish faunas with a high proportion of migratory species, as in New Zealand, these changes in occurrence and abundance result in a breakdown of the relationship between fish abundance and habitat quality, making application of the index of biotic integrity (IBI) as a measure of habitat quality problematical since the index depends on the relationship between population metrics and habitat quality. An alternative approach applicable to assessing temporal changes in habitat quality and that uses a large database on fish distributions, involves analysis of the distribution of species across their natural distributions. In this paper we generate curves of occurrence of species across ranges of altitude and distance inland and show, through comparisons of data subsets, that the curves are consistent estimators of species' occurrence and therefore useful as indicators of habitat quality.

AB  - Considering the uncertainty caused by the random error of the sample measurement, the heterogeneity of spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants, and the traditional method of selecting a single parameter for evaluation, based on fuzzy theory, Hakanson potential ecological risk index (considering heavy metal enrichment, ecotoxicity and bioavailability) and United States Environmental Protection Agency health risk assessment system, the fuzzy ecological risk and health risk assessment methods for of heavy metals in soil were established. In the soil of the Jinling Reservoir area, Cd, which has high bioavailability, had the highest average contribution rate to RI, and thus was, regarded as a priority metal for ecological risk. Sites JL9 and JL11 were the priority areas. The heavy metals did not pose a clear hazard to human health, but children had a higher health risk. Pb and As were regarded as the priority metals for health risk. Fuzzy evaluation provided the risk interval and membership degree, contained more parameter information, quantified and reduced the uncertainty of parameters, provided more comprehensive results, and compensated for the deficiency of deterministic evaluation. As the main source of heavy metals, the intensity of agricultural activities in the study area must be controlled to avoid excessive input and accumulation of heavy metals, which may damage the ecological environment and endanger human health.

AB  - Northern Adriatic (NA) is one of the most productive parts of the Mediterranean Sea due to vast nutrient discharges from the contributing watershed. To understand better the excess of nutrients as stressors to the state of the marine ecosystem, a hybrid modeling approach following the DPSIR framework and terminology was developed, linking: 1) the AVGWLF model for modeling the pressures, i.e. nutrients originating from the watershed caused by two major drivers (urbanization and agriculture), 2) the ML tool MTSMOTI for inducing a model tree connecting the pressures with the marine ecosystem state, and 3) the water quality index, TRIX, equation to evaluate the Lrophic state of the marine ecosystem. Data used for the modeling purpose comprised GIS layers (i.e., digital terrain model, land use; cover data, soil map, locations of hydro-meteorological stations and WWTPs), time series data (i.e., hydro meteorological data and nutrient concentrations), and statistical data (i.e., number of inhabitants, connections to wastewater treatment, livestock statistics, etc) as well as physical, chemical and biological parameters, measured at six marine water monitoring stations, located between the Po River delta (Italy) and the city of Rovinj (west Istrian coast, Croatia). Using the model, seven watershed management scenarios related to wastewater treatment and agricultural activities were evaluated for their influence on the state of the NA marine ecosystem. According to the results, the gradual implementation of the UWWTD in the last 10 years contributed significantly to the preservation and improvement of the NA marine ecosystem state. However, despite the full implementation of the UWWTD, the state of the NA marine ecosystem could deteriorate in case of increased nutrient loads from agriculture. Since the UWWTD is already close to its full implementation, NA watershed management should focus on controlling agricultural activities in order to maintain 'high state of the NA marine ecosystem.

AB  - Diatom indicators of wetland condition were developed and tested by assessing human disturbance, water chemistry, and species composition of benthic, epiphytic, and planktonic diatoms from 20 wetlands sampled for 2 years. One sample from each site was randomly selected to form a development data set, while the rest were used as the test data set. Human disturbance indicated substantial differences among wetlands in hydrologic modification, impervious surface, and potential for non-point source contamination. These landscape alterations were related to increases in pH, non-nutrient ions, and nutrients and decreases in dissolved organic carbon and water color. Pre-existing diatom indicators, calculated with autecological information from lakes and aquatic habitats, correlated highly to relevant water chemistry and human disturbance scores. Weighted average models (WAM) of Cl-, conductivity, pH, and alkalinity derived with the Maine development data set correlated to relevant water chemistry and human disturbance of the test wetlands. Diatom assemblage attributes that correlated with human disturbance were selected to combine into a multimetric index of biotic condition (IBC). IBCs and WAMs from benthic and epiphytic diatoms were usually more precisely related to relevant environmental factors than planktonic diatoms. These results showed that human disturbance alkalized wetlands, enriched them with nutrients, and diatom assemblages responded to these changes. Indicator development protocols for streams can be readily adapted for use in wetlands.

AB  - Restoration of degraded landscapes has become necessary to reverse the pervasive threats from human exploitation. Restoration requires first the monitoring of progress toward any chosen goals to determine their resilience and persistence, and second to conduct in a comparable adjacent area but with less human impact the restoration of trophic structures and ecosystem processes to act as reference systems (controls) with which we compare the viability of the chosen goal. We present here the rationale and a method for predicting the trajectory of restoration and assessing its progress toward a predetermined state, the endpoint, using a restoration index. This assessment of restoration requires that we know when a predetermined endpoint has been achieved and whether the envisioned community of species and their interactions can be restored. The restoration index can use species' presence or density, and the rate of change of ecosystem processes. The index applies to trophic levels, functional groups, successional stages, alternative states, and novel ecosystems. Also, our method allows measurement of the resilience of ecosystems to disturbance, a desired property for conservation and management. We provide global examples to illustrate these points.

AB  - The Trivers-Willard (1973) model suggests maternal control of offspring sex, in utero or by the end of parental investment, may be an adaptive advantage in some species. We tested for differential sex allocation using 11,408 known-sex fetal elk (Cervus elaphus) from biological collections and hunter harvest returns from 2 southwestern Montana, USA, elk populations (1961-2007). We included maternal and environmental condition covariates measured pre- and postconception and throughout pregnancy. Results suggested that adult female elk in southwest Montana did not differentially invest in male offspring when conditions were beneficial. We found evidence that, when the Northern Yellowstone elk herd was at low density, beneficial spring (May-Jun) growing conditions, as indexed by a local precipitation measure and a regional drought indicator, correlated with production of more female fetuses (1 SD increase in precipitation and 1 SD decrease in drought resulted in 6% and 5% more F fetuses, respectively). In the same herd, we found evidence that improved maternal condition, as indexed by kidney fat mass and heart fat mass, also correlated with production of more female fetuses (1 SD increase in kidney fat mass and heart fat mass resulted in 8% more F fetuses). When the same elk herd reached higher densities under different ecological conditions, no covariate was associated with a deviation in the 50: 50 female-to-male sex ratio. Similarly, there was no association between covariates and fetal sex ratios in a nearby elk herd at high population density. In modeling, wildlife managers should consider factors that could alter sex ratios at birth, and also how biased sex ratios postpartum could affect population models.

AB  - Thermal power plants (TPP) belong to the enterprises that accompany the development of any city. These industrial facilities consume and discharge large amounts of water. Therefore, thermal power plants are often located near water bodies that need to assess their ecological state and predict the consequences of the anthropogenic impact. The purpose of the work was to assess the ecological state of the floodplain Lake Ivanovskoye (Russia, Kirov region), which receives the wastewater from a thermal power plant, using a triadic approach and comparing the results of chemical analysis, bioassay and bioindication. It was shown that the main pollutant in the lake and the canal connecting Lake Ivanovskoye with the nearest river Vyatka is ammonium ion (up to 3.2 mg/dm(3)). In addition, the Russian standards for biological oxygen consumption are exceeded (analysis period is 20 days). The tests for the toxicity of wastewater showed inhibition of Paramecium caudatum and Escherichia coli reactions. In contrast, natural surface water from Lake Ivanovskoye stimulated the test functions of Scenedesmus quadricauda, P. caudatum, and E. coli. The death of Daphnia magna in the samples were not recorded. The totality of the facts pointed to the organic nature of pollution, leading to the anthropogenic eutrophication of the lake. The hypothesis was tested by using the bioindication method and by analyzing the totality of species of coastal aquatic plants. It was shown that the reservoir belongs to the mesotrophic type with a moderate degree of pollution, which decreases with distance from the wastewater discharge points. The increase in the trophicity of the reservoir is facilitated by thermal pollution (up to +15 degrees C) and an alkaline pH of wastewater (up to 9.2). Thus, the joint analysis of the results of chemical analysis, bioassay and bioindication made it possible to carry out an objective assessment of the ecological state of the reservoir and identify the reasons for the revealed facts.

AB  - Oak (Quercus spp.) savannas are among the most imperiled ecosystems in the United States. Consequently, associated vegetation and avian communities are also in decline. Furthermore, restoration of savanna communities may be an important strategy for conserving avian species that require early successional habitat, a type underrepresented on regional landscapes. Therefore, we evaluated savanna restoration on twelve sites in the Mid-South USA. Specifically, we examined grass, forb, legume, and woody understory cover, regeneration and sapling density, and breeding bird use of the sites following mechanical overstory thinning and dormant-season fire using a hierarchical linear model. Total grass cover was negatively related to canopy cover (P < 0.01) and total forb cover was negatively related to total basal area (P = 0.04). Oak regeneration density was positively related to canopy cover (P < 0.01), while oak competitor regeneration density was positively related to percent slope (P = 0.01) and sapling density (P = 0.01). Shrub/scrub birds were common within sites undergoing restoration. Only three obligate grassland bird species, eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) and dickcissel (Spiza americana), were detected on one site. Presence of indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) was positively related to groundlayer development. Canopy reduction and burns outside the dormant season may both be critical to restoration of savannas and associated avifauna in the region.

AB  - Drought, one of the most destructive natural disasters is projected by numerous studies to become more severe and widespread under climate change. These water limitations will have profound effects on terrestrial systems across the globe. Yet, most of the existing drought monitoring indices are based on drought stress derived from environmental conditions rather than ecosystem responses. Here, we propose using a new approach, the Normalized Ecosystem Drought Index (NEDI), coupled with modified Variable Interval Time Averaging (VITA) method, to quantify drought severity according to ecosystem transitional patterns with water availability. The method is inspired by Sprengel's and Liebig's Law of the Minimum for plant nutrition. Eddy covariance measurements from 60 AmeriFlux sites that cross 8 International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) vegetation types were used to validate the use of NEDI coupled to VITA. The results show that NEDI can reasonably depict both drought stress posed by the environment and drought responses presented by various ecosystems. Water availability becomes a dominant limiting factor for ecosystem evapotranspiration when NEDI falls below zero, and normalized evapotranspiration strength generally decreases with decreasing NEDI under this regime. The widely used self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) have difficulty capturing ecosystem responses to water availability, although they can reasonably represent drought conditions detected in the environment. The normalization feature employed in NEDI makes it feasible to compare drought severity over different regions, seasons and vegetation types. The new drought index also provides a valuable tool for irrigation and water distribution management practices which may enhance water conservation efforts as drought conditions become more prevalent.

AB  - Using marine bivalve mussels Mytidus edulis and Aequipecten irradians as the biological indicators, the chronic (60 days) bioaccumulation tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of tributyltin (TBT) on bivalve mussels. TBT and its degraded products-Dibutyltin and Monobutyltin-were determined in mussels and seawater. Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) increased exponentially with decreasing concentration of TBT, BCFs were much higher than predicted values by Kow. Some physiological effects of TBT on the shell length, width, whole body weight and Condition Index were measured and used as indicating indices on the contamination of TBT to bivalve mussels. Some pathological effects at cellular level were observed under the electron-microscope, the mitochondria of test M. edulis's liver swelled and disrupted, so the mechanism of toxicity was suggested. Based on the results of the bioaccumulation test the risk evaluation for humans was made. The results of bioaccumulation of TBT by algae revealed that accumulation through the food chain was very important.

AB  - Seasonal variations in metal concentrations in soft tissues of marine mussels can be due, to a great extent, to seasonal changes in flesh weight. Consequently, this event results in an unpredictable overestimation of metal bioavailability when the metal concentration in soft tissues is considered as an index of such metal bioavailability. The Abra estuary (Bizkaia, Bay of Biscay, Spain) was used as a natural experimental basin with well-known differences in the levels of metallic pollutants. The level of metal bioavailability was determined at various sites at different times of the year. For this purpose the conventional approach of recording metal concentrations in soft tissues and the approach based on the calculation of metal/shell-weight indices, first proposed by Fischer (1983), were applied. We concluded that seasonal changes in organism condition (Flesh Condition Index) cause unpredictable oscillations in the metal concentration in soft tissues. For this reason the direct use of metal concentration values is not recommended to assess metal bioavailability. The metal/shell-weight indices, however, were not affected by seasonal changes in the flesh weight of sentinel mussels and thus may provide a more realistic indication of metal bioavailability. In the present study, different metal bioavailabilities, assessed by metal/shell-weight indices, were found at different sampling sites, according to the influence of industrial activities. Seasonal trends in metal/shell-weight indices (attributed to different metal inputs at different times) were also recorded. In conclusion, metal/shell-weight indices, characterized by a high sensitivity and a low noise-to-signal ratio, are a simple and reliable tool for assessing metal bioavailability in 'Mussel Watch' monitoring programmes.

AB  - The 750 page report, The State of Canada's Environment, is the collaborative effort of more than 100 experts from universities, private industry, environmental groups, and government. In 27 chapters the report addresses four fundamental questions about Canada's environment: what are the kev environmental conditions and trends in Canada; what are the links between human activities and environmental changes; what are the environmental, economic, and health implications of these changes; and what are Canadians doing to address the concerns identified? Topics examined include: environmental components (air, fresh and marine water, land, and wildlife), human activities that affect the environment (e.g. forestry, agriculture, fisheries, urbanization), as well as six regional case studies and major environmental issues such as toxic chemicals, ozone depletion and acid rain. The report also indicates areas where Canadians have made progress toward sustainable development and identifies areas where work remains to be done. Actions that are being taken to strengthen state of the environment reporting in Canada, including the development of indicators, are also briefly discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to propose an index [Index of Biotic Integrity for the Rio de la Plata (IBIRP)] formulated from a minimum of information-rich metrics related to biological integrity for evaluation of the coastal freshwater tidal zone of the Rio de la Plata estuary. A total of 23 sites were selected along 170 km of shoreline (34A degrees 27'10aEuro(3) S, 58A degrees 30'21aEuro(3) W and 35A degrees 23'28aEuro(3) S, 57A degrees 08'50aEuro(3) W), being influenced by different land uses. We explored 36 biotic descriptors (designated candidate metrics), each of which is considered as an environmental indicator, and selected four metrics: two related to phytoplankton assemblage (planktonic cyanobacterial density and phytoplanktonic total density) and two linked to benthic assemblages, the diatoms (percent most tolerant taxa), and the invertebrates (percent Tanaidacea). The metrics that were chosen to integrate the IBIRP provide valuable information about the biotic integrity both in terms of time and space. The multimetric index can assume values between 0 (very bad status) and 10 (very good status). The IBIRP correlated significantly with the second (p < 0.001) and fourth (p < 0.01) factors of the factor analysis-those being related to variables indicative of eutrophication and organic pollution. This index constitutes an approach that is capable of reflecting the anthropogenic impacts produced along the coast of the Rio de la Plata, with the inherent flexibility of being subject to modification and ultimate validation for estuaries of similar characteristics.

AB  - Several environmental parameters related to the spawning season of the freshwater fish, Psectrogaster rhomboides were identified. The hypothesis predicts synchrony of the spawning season with the rainy period, presenting a seasonal reproductive strategy. This study investigated the total body length and body mass, sex ratio, body size at first sexual maturity, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, fecundity and reproductive period of P. rhomboides in the natural environment. Twelve monthly samplings (mean n=20) were carried out from March 2009 to February 2010. Fish were captured using 4cm diameter cast nets and environmental parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and electrical conductivity of the water were registered. The sampled population of P. rhomboides (n=444) showed a sex ratio of 1:1. Females attained first sexual maturity at 15cm total length and males at 15.3cm total length. Spawning occurred from March to May, with high gonadosomatic index values during the rainy season. This species is a total spawner, with a mean fecundity of 6188 (+/- 367) mature oocytes. P. rhomboides presents a seasonal reproductive strategy, providing a population increase and exploitation of the environmental resources during the rainy period. Rainfall (196.5 +/- 4.9mm) and the concentration of dissolved oxygen (7.82 +/- 0.7018 mg L-1) were influential factors during the spawning season. Gonadosomatic index and the condition factor were negatively correlated during the gonadal development cycle of this species. The monthly gonadosomatic index values show that spawning begins when the rainy season is at its maximum and ends synchronously (females r=0.9171; males r=0.889) with the end of the rainy season.

AB  - We developed and validated a single multimetric index based on predictive models that could evaluate anthropogenic disturbances in streams of three disparate ecoregions of Bolivia. To do so, we examined 45 candidate metrics reflecting different aspects of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and function gleaned from available literature and for their potential to indicate degradation. More importantly, we integrated functional trait metrics to improve the sensitivity of our index. To quantify possible deviation from reference conditions, we first established and validated statistical models describing metric responses to natural environmental differences in the absence of any significant anthropogenic disturbance. We considered that the residual distributions of these models described the response range of each metric, independently of natural environmental influence. After testing the sensitivity of these residuals to a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance, we retained eight metrics that were used in the final assemblage index, four metrics based on richness and composition and four metrics based on biological traits. Our index performed well in discriminating between reference and disturbed sites, giving a significant negative linear response to a gradient of physical and chemical anthropogenic disturbances. After employing a probability survey design and sampling a relatively small number of sites throughout all major ecoregions of Bolivia, we believe our methodology can be used to develop a monitoring tool to evaluate status and trends in biological condition for streams of the entire country despite its complex and heterogeneous geology and climate.

AB  - The reliability of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indexing methodologies for the detection of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) in almond was assessed under local conditions. Thirteen field-grown almond trees were sampled fortnightly throughout the growing season. Petal and leaf homogenates were used for ELISA and to inoculate herbaceous indicator species, while buds collected from October onwards were budded to woody indicators. ELISA reliably detected PNRSV in petals and young leaves from bud-break until the cessation of stem elongation. While herbaceous indexing was not as reliable as ELISA, woody indicators could differentiate positive from negative samples reliably throughout the testing period. However, for mass screening of foundation plantings, nursery stock and elite germplasm, woody indexing is too costly and slow to give results. The use of ELISA can overcome these limitations but the timing of sample collection is critical. Petal or leaf tissue collected early in the season will yield the most reliable results.

AB  - Drought is a natural disaster that occurs globally and is a main trigger of secondary environmental and socio-economic damages, such as food insecurity, land degradation, and sand-dust storms. As climate change is being accelerated by human activities and environmental changes, both the severity and uncertainties of drought are increasing. In this study, a diagnostic drought prediction model (DDPM) was developed to reduce the uncertainties caused by environmental diversity at the regional level in Kyrgyzstan, by predicting drought with meteorological forecasts and satellite image diagnosis. The DDPM starts with applying a prognostic drought prediction model (PDPM) to 1) estimate future agricultural drought by explaining its relationship with the standardized precipitation index (SPI), an accumulated precipitation anomaly, and 2) compensate for regional variances, which were not reflected sufficiently in the PDPM, by taking advantage of preciseness in the time-series vegetation condition index (VCI), a satellite-based index representing land surface conditions. Comparing the prediction results with the monitored VCI from June to August, it was found that the DDPM outperformed the PDPM, which exploits only meteorological data, in both spatiotemporal and spatial accuracy. In particular, for June to August, respectively, the results of the DDPM (coefficient of determination [R-2] = 0.27, 0.36, and 0.4; root mean squared error [RMSE] = 0.16, 0.13, and 0.13) were more effective in explaining the spatial details of drought severity on a regional scale than those of the PDPM (R-2 = 0.09, 0.10, and 0.11; RMSE = 0.17, 0.15, and 0.16). The DDPM revealed the possibility of advanced drought assessment by integrating the earth observation big data comprising meteorological and satellite data. In particular, the advantage of data fusion is expected to be maximized in areas with high land surface heterogeneity or sparse weather stations by providing observational feedback to the PDPM. This research is anticipated to support policymakers and technical officials in establishing effective policies, action plans, and disaster early warning systems to reduce disaster risk and prevent environmental and socio-economic damage.

AB  - Cross-regional redeployment (or relocation) of government officials has a significant effect on the local economic development and environmental protection. Based on the panel data of 31 provinces (municipalities) in China from 2001 to 2016 and the environmental pollution index obtained by Entropy method, the dynamic panel regression model was applied to verify the relationship between the officials' cross-regional redeployment and environmental pollution. The results show that environmental pollution was positively correlated with officials' relocation and their tenure after the redeployment. As the officials' tenure increases to the critical value, the positive correlation between the official's tenure and environmental pollution would change. By measuring this threshold, we find that the average critical value for China was 5.14 years, which were the same as the average tenure of Chinese officials. Moreover, the result also illustrates the difference between central eastern China and western China, with the average threshold being 4.01 years and 5.89 years, respectively. In addition, the impact of officials' cross-regional redeployment on the environment would also be affected by the initial condition of the region. According to the result, the environmental governance within the central eastern regions was better than that in the western region. In the last part of this paper, we proposed measures and suggestions, such as changing the incentive policies of officials, perfecting the local policies and the cultivate and exchange system of cadres, as well as strengthen the power of social supervision, for the sake of facilitating the healthy and green development of the regional economy.

AB  - The concentration of globally alarming potential toxic elements (PTEs) like Aluminum (Al), chrome (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and uranium (U) were measured in surface sediment of seven major rivers residing in Giresun (one of the most important Hazelnut production areas of Turkey). The mean concentrations of PTEs in all river sediments showed the descending order of Al > Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Ni > Co > As > U > Cd. The level of studied metals in most of the rivers exceeded the threshold effect level (TEL), indicating a potential risk to the environment. Certain indices, including the sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), potential ecological risk index (E-r(i)), geoaccumulation index (I-geo), toxic risk index (TRI), modified hazard quotient (mHQ) and ecological contamination index (ECI) were used to assess the ecological risk posed by PTEs in sediment. Contamination factor (CF) and geoaccumulation index (I-geo) demonstrated that most of the sediment samples were moderately to considerably contaminated by Cu, As, Cd and Pb. In view of the potential ecological risk index, sediments from Pazarsuyu Stream (PS), Batlama Stream (BS) and Gelevera Stream (GLS) showed considerable potential ecological risk. The sources of PTEs and the relations between them were determined by using principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA), Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and Pearson correlation index (PCI). Three factors explaining 83.94% of the total variance was found by PCA/FA. 43.34% of the total variance explained by the first factor (F1) was correlated with Ni, Cr, Pb and Co elements. 28.35% of the total variance explained by the second factor (F2) was correlated with U, Al, the third factor (F3) explains 12.24% of the total variance and correlated with Zn, Cd, Cu and As elements. These factors revealed that the quality of the sediment was mainly influenced by anthropogenic effects. The extent of pollution by heavy metals in the studied streams implies that the condition is much frightening to the biota and inhabitants in the vicinity of these rivers as well.

AB  - This study reports, for the first time, different physico-chemical analyses, of Mediterranean mussels (Mylilus galloprovincialis) from harvesting areas in the Montenegro coast of the Adriatic Sea, in order to evaluate the influence of origin on different parameters and assessed the quality of shellfish grown in this area. The Boka Kotorska Bay is situated in Montenegro, in the south-eastern part of the Adriatic Sea The mussel samples were collected at the same time in the spring of 2019 at six locations in Boka Kotorska Bay, Montenegro: Kotor and Tivat Bays. Biometric parameters, percentage of meat, condition index, proximate composition, sensory evaluation and lipid profiles of mussels were studied. The concentrations of some micro and macro elements and heavy metals in mussels, were also analyzed. Significant differences were found between mussels from different locations. Mean biometric parameters of mussels grown in Sv.Nedjelja, were considerably higher than in mussels grown elsewhere.. Protein, lipid, ash and glycogen content were varied from 7.80 to 10.26%; 1.36 to 2.18%; 1.73 to 3.34% and 12.81 to 15.38%, respectively. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were dominant lipids in mussels (37.56 to 41.08%), followed by monounsaturated (MUFAs) (30.52 to 38.31%) and saturated (SFAs) (21.89 to 29.45%) fatty acids. Fatty acid profiles were investigated and revealed high contents of n-3 PUFAs and high n-3/n-6 ratios in all mussels from Montenegro In the mussel samples high concentrations of K, Mg, Ca, and Na, and much lower concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu were found. Some of toxic elements (As, Pb, Hg and Cd) were determined also.. The qualitative sensory assessment showed that all mussels were acceptable. All mussels in the current study achieved scores of 3 or more out of 5 in the qualitative category. Data on biochemical composition and quality indices of the mussels cultured in the Boka Kotorska Bay demonstrated that these products could be accepted well by consumers and could compete with other currently available mussels from other locations in Adriatic Sea.

AB  - The lakes of central Mexico have great cultural, economic, and biological value, but they are being degraded at an accelerating rate. We employed historical data on fish communities from 19 of these lakes and case studies of community responses to environmental degradation from four of the best-studied, Xochimilco, Cuitzeo, Chapala, and Patzcuaro, to construct a preliminary index of biotic integrity (IBI). This IBI was designed to be an easily applied method for assessing lake ecosystem health and evaluating restoration efforts. The IBI had 10 metrics: number of total native species, number of common native species, number of native Goodeidae species, number of native Chirostoma species, number of native sensitive species, percent of biomass as tolerant species, percent of biomass as exotic species, percent of biomass as native carnivorous species, maximum standard length of native species, and percent of exotic invertebrate parasite species on or in native fishes. Initial applications of the index showed promise, accurately ranking the relative degradation of the four case-study lakes. Further tests of the index are warranted, and more data are needed to standardize sampling procedures, improve species classifications, and refine metric scoring criteria.

AB  - Mosses and vascular plants have been shown to be reliable indicators of wetland habitat delineation and environmental quality. Knowledge of the best ecological predictors of the quality of wetland moss and vascular plant communities may determine if similar management practices would simultaneously enhance both populations. We used Akaike's Information Criterion to identify models predicting a moss quality assessment index (MQAI) and a vascular plant index of biological integrity based on floristic quality (VIBI-FQ) from 27 emergent and 13 forested wetlands in Ohio, USA. The set of predictors included the six metrics from a wetlands disturbance index (ORAM) and two landscape development intensity indices (LDIs). The best single predictor of MQAI and one of the predictors of VIBI-FQ was an ORAM metric that assesses habitat alteration and disturbance within the wetland, such as mowing, grazing, and agricultural practices. However, the best single predictor of VIBI-FQ was an ORAM metric that assessed wetland vascular plant communities, interspersion, and microtopography. LDIs better predicted MQAI than VIBI-FQ suggesting that mosses may either respond more rapidly to, or recover more slowly from, anthropogenic disturbance in the surrounding landscape than vascular plants. These results supported previous predictive studies on amphibian indices and metrics and a separate vegetation index, indicating that similar wetland management practices may result in qualitatively the same ecological response for three vastly different wetland biological communities (amphibians, vascular plants, and mosses).

AB  - Restoring natural fluvial dynamics is fundamental for sustaining biodiversity and functional integrity of river and floodplain ecosystems. In Central Europe, however, pervasive river regulation and bank protection have greatly impaired ecosystem functioning and many water bodies fail to achieve a good ecological status within the European Water Framework Directive. The "Free Moving Rivers" approach seeks to restore the ecological integrity of rivers and floodplains by creating appropriate conditions for natural fluvial dynamics. Principal goals of the approach include removing artificial constraints on river processes and expanding the river corridor to restore natural river habitats and structures. Lacking, however, are complementary tools that evaluate and predict changes to ecosystem services (ESSs) after implementation. Here, we describe a case study of the Ammer river in Bavaria, Germany, to (i) calculate the extent of the "Free Moving Rivers" corridor, and (ii) assess changes to ESSs of a proposed river restoration measure under two alternative land-use scenarios. To do this, we apply the River Ecosystem Service Index (RESI), whereby individual ESSs are assessed in a spatially explicit way. We show how a proposed implementation of the "Free Moving Rivers" approach enhances three investigated ESSs: flood retention, sediment balance and habitat provision. We conclude that RESI is a potentially useful tool with wide applicability for restoration planning that synthesises floodplain complexity in such a way that facilitates decision making.

AB  - The production and use of energy is of great importance to the sustainable development of any society, economy and environment. As a superpower, the total energy consumption of the United States is also among the highest in the world. In 2009, the United States promulgated the clean energy and security act of 2009, aiming to further improve the energy structure and reduce environmental pollution. The policy has had a significant impact on the world energy landscape.
   First of all, this article collects data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and obtains data on energy production and consumption in the four states on the US-Mexico border in 2009. The data was artificially analyzed from two aspects of sector and energy. The energy profile for each state was presented in terms of the proportion of energy usage by sector and the proportion of each energy usage.
   Furthermore, based on the above data analysis, we have established the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model to determine the four indicators of cleaner, renewable energy. The four evaluation indexes are: cleaner, renewable energy consumption rate; cleaner, renewable energy expenditure rate; carbon dioxide emissions ratio in the United States and biological impact index. The optimal scheme and the worst scheme were determined according to the above four indexes, and then to calculate the clean energy use scheme for relative states converting the distances into scores. The states that have the 'best' profile for use of cleaner, renewable energy in 2009 were at last identified.
   Finally, back propagation (BP) neural network model was established, and the total energy consumption data from 2009 was used to train the network, so as to predict the energy use in 2025. By the same token, the use of cleaner, renewable energy resource in 2025 can be predicted.

AB  - In this paper, a lifetime estimation method for underground cable systems is proposed by combining a health index (HI) and conditional factor (CF). The underground cable system consists of underground cable, joint, termination, manhole, and duct bank. The HI is an indicator to indicate the actual condition of underground cable components and systems whereas the CF is used to indicate different operating stresses of the system under different operating conditions such as percentage loading, electrical stresses, laying structure, environment, etc. The actual technical data as well as historical operating and testing records are applied. The weighting and scoring method with the analytical hierarchy process are used to classify an importance of underground cable components, testing methods, and criteria used in the HI and CF calculation. The annual calculated HIs are plotted to investigate the lifetime trending curve by using a polynomial function. The degradation curve based on calculated CF is estimated by using the Weibull distribution function. Finally, the remaining life of the underground cable system is determined by matching the lifetime trending curve with the degradation curve. Ten practical underground cable systems supplying power in a high voltage power delivery system are evaluated with effective results. The lifetime of the underground cable system can be successfully estimated.

KW  - POPULATION
AB  - The commercially important migratory fish Prochilodus brevis is from the Neotropical region, and understanding the reproductive ecology of this potamodromous fish is essential for its conservation and management. This study investigated the length-mass relationship, sex ratio, length at first gonadalmaturity, gonadal development stages, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, and reproductive period of P. brevis. Temporal distribution of rainfall, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and electrical conductivity of the water were related to the reproductive period of this fish. Rainfall seems to be the main environmental factor which modulates changes in limnological parameters and the timing of the spawning period of this fish. P. brevis migrates into lower reaches of the river to feed during the dry season and returns to the upper reaches during the rainy season to spawn. Inadequate facilities for migration create obstacles for spawning success of this ecologically important fish.

AB  - Karr's Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) approach provides a biological measure of ecosystem health using a wide spectrum of metrics which can be extracted from fish catch data obtained using standardized methods. Extensive electrofishing surveys of littoral fish assemblages, conducted in three Great Lakes' Areas of Concern, provided the basis for developing a lacustrine IBI that was 12 metrics of three broad types: (i) species composition, (ii) trophic composition, and (iii) abundance and condition. In contrast with lotic IBls where diversity and abundance metrics have mostly been used, several biomass metrics were adopted to accommodate the large size range of lentic fishes. The variability of repeated measures was low enough to allow valid testing of intertransect differences with three to five samples per transect. Comparisons among survey areas showed significant differences consistent with the varying levels of ecosystem degradation. Analyses of mean IBI values with measures of submerged vegetation density and cover by transect produced significant positive correlations. This IBI developed for the Great Lakes' littoral zone, both by design and by demonstrated correlations, integrates the effects of four main factors influencing fish assemblages and hence revealing ecosystem health: exotic fishes, water quality, physical habitat supply, and piscivore abundance.

This loricariid has a long reproductive period, fractionated spawning and low fecundity (on average, female gonads contained 37 oocytes), a total length (L-T) at first maturity of 47.4 mm for females and 54.1 mm L-T for males. Correlation of the condition factor and gonado-somatic index with environmental variables suggests that turbidity favours P. tankei reproduction in this environment.

AB  - According to the Water Framework Directive, the results of the ecological status assessment should be accompanied with estimates of the level of confidence and precision of the determination. The Polish macrophyte-based method for lake assessment (Ecological State Macrophyte Index, ESMI) was tested for its uncertainty. The data from 12 lakes surveyed using four modifications of the sampling procedure, different numbers of transects and by two or three independent surveyors were analysed and the risk of misclassification was estimated. The choice of the sampling technique had no effect on abundance parameters (C-max and % cover), but it affected significantly the taxonomic composition indices (Hand J'). It did not influence, however, the final assessment result, since in all the methods used, the ESMI values were comparable and showed no significant differences of means. Although the mean ESMI values were statistically indifferent and gave the same assessment result irrespective of the number of transects surveyed, the lower the number of transects, the higher the SD value and the more uncertain the assessment result. The risk of misclassification of the 12 lakes varied from 0.5% to over 40% depending on the sampling standard deviation value and the proximity of the index observed value to the class boundary.

AB  - Frequent droughts can cause severe losses to economy, society, and environment. This study aims to develop a remote sensing-based drought monitoring and information management system (RDMIMS) to help managers to better understand the regional drought situation and define quick and responsive measures. RDMIMS includes four modules for data management, drought monitoring and analysis, business operation, and information inquiry. Furthermore, RDMIMS combines the ground observation data of soil moisture content with the remote sensing inversion parameters to obtain regional drought information with increased accuracy. It provides users with more flexible operation methods that can obtain more accurate monitoring results by changing the weight coefficients of each monitoring model. Additionally, the business operation mode can provide monitoring results by "single click" thus enabling the managers to have more choices under different requirements. The results showed that the system can effectively monitor the drought situation in the study area and can meet the needs and expectations of manager's for information inquiry.

AB  - Rumpwear is a common, but poorly defined and understood disease of brushtail possums (Trichosurus spp.) in Australia and New Zealand, resulting in varying degrees of fur loss. Populations of Trichosurus cunninghami (mountain brushtail possum) and T. vulpecula (common brushtail possum) were studied over two years at Boho South (Victoria), to describe the disease, investigate its prevalence and explore its epidemiology. The main type of lesion observed was coat damage in the lumbo-sacral region, and increased severity of rumpwear was related to decreased coat length and increased hair breakage. Significant skin lesions were rare and hair breakage patterns suggested mechanical damage. Rumpwear was very prevalent in both T. cunninghami and T. vulpecula, but very severe rumpwear was rare. There was no true seasonal pattern to the prevalence of rumpwear in T. cunninghami and sex and habitat did not affect prevalence or severity. Prevalence and severity of rumpwear did, however, increase with age. There were no significant relationships between the number of previous captures or body condition index with rumpwear.

AB  - In this paper we propose that the foraging behavior of benthic fish can be used to assess the current state of shallow lake ecosystems. Shallow lakes may display shifts between clear and turbid states, where sediment resuspension by benthivores foraging on benthic invertebrates contributes to maintaining the turbid state. We suggest that the giving-up density (GUD) of benthic fish foraging in experimental patches may provide useful information for managing shallow lake ecosystems. The rate of sediment resuspension by fish is a function of the abundance of both benthic fish and benthic invertebrates. Based on the empirical relationship between foraging behavior, habitat quality, and long-term growth prospects, and between habitat quality and rate of sediment resuspension, we conclude that systems should be more resistant to switches from a clear to a turbid state when (i) benthos biomass, maximum benthivore size, and giving up density are high, (ii) benthivore biomass is low, (iii) a low fraction of benthivore population is above the maximum benthivore size predicted from giving tip density, and when relative predation cost is high, estimated as the difference in GUD between risky and safe habitats. Although a first step, the methods introduced here should serve to facilitate predicting the probability of switching between ecosystem states, as well as to identify suitable abatement strategies for preventing such shifts.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate fish guild compositions and national river health using a multi-metric model of the Korean index of biological integrity using fishes (K-IBIF) in four major Korean watersheds along with water chemistry and habitat quality. Tolerant and omnivore fish species dominated all the watersheds, and the proportions of tolerance guilds and trophic guilds reflected water chemistry and habitat quality. The number of sensitive species and insectivore species had negative correlations (r < -0.42, P < 0.01) with chemical water quality (biological oxygen demand (BOD)), while tolerant species and omnivore species had positive correlation (r > 0.27, P < 0.05) with BOD values. Physical habit conditions, based on qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI) model, indicated a "good" condition (mean = 68.9; range = 45-105) in three watersheds, except for the Yeongsan River watershed. Values of QHEI were significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.4, P < 0.01) with nitrogen and phosphorus levels in all watersheds, suggesting that habitat degradation is associated with eutrophication. Model values of K-IBIF in the watersheds averaged 18.2, indicating a "fair" condition, and about 37% of all observations in K-IBIF model values were judged as a "poor" health condition, indicating severe health impairment. Overall, our data suggest that degradation of the river health was due to a combined effect of chemical pollution and physical habitat modifications. This research provides valuable information on Korean river conservation and restoration in the future.

AB  - The Mount Elgon ecosystem (MEE), an important hydrological and socio-economic area in East Africa, has exhibited significant landscape changes. These are driven by both natural factors and human activities. Yet, the vulnerability of this ecosystem is poorly understood. This study characterizes ecological and environmental (eco-environmental) vulnerability for the MEE using freely available Earth observation, topographic, and socio-economic data. Spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) was used to compute a new eco-environmental vulnerability index (EEVI) by integrating natural, environmental, and socio-economic conditions. The final EEVI was then categorized into five classes (potential, slight, light, moderate, and severe). Temporal principal component analysis (TPCA) was also conducted to identify persistent changes in multi-year variables spanning the period 2001-2018. Further, the precipitation concentration index (PCI) was assessed to evaluate changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the MEE. The study found that EEVI indicates the most aggregate vulnerability on the Ugandan side, especially in savanna regions. Majority of the MEE was moderately vulnerable, and savannas and grasslands constituted the largest proportion of the severe vulnerability class. There was also a marked increase in vulnerability with decrease in elevation. Eco-environmental vulnerability was strongly associated with multi-year variables based on precipitation, temperature, and population density. The study also found that precipitation concentration is amplifying especially in the wet season, thus threatening agriculture and community livelihoods. Areas in the moderate and severe vulnerability classes were identified for prioritized conservation attention.

AB  - The endangered endemic fish Ameca splendens was surveyed monthly from June 2001 to May 2002 at two sites in the upper Rio Ameca basin. Both populations demonstrated two annual reproduction peaks, with one in the spring season and the other in late fall. The condition and gonadosomatic index were higher in the population from the upstream pristine environment. Those fish in the pollution-stressed downstream region attained greater body length, longevity, and fecundity.

AB  - The Akar double dagger ay is the most important stream in the Afyonkarahisar region in central Turkey. In this study, the relationships between epipelic diatoms, macrophytes, and the water quality of Akar double dagger ay Stream are presented. According to Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), BOD5, COD, TDS, NH4-N, NO2-N, and PO4-P had the most significant effects on the diatom and macrophyte community structures of the stream. According to CCA and Correspondence Analysis (CA), dominant diatom species and macrophytes constituted two groups, eutrophic and polluted. While eutraphentic taxa were abundant among upstream diatoms, hypereutraphentic taxa were found downstream in the Akar double dagger ay. The diatom assemblages in the sites upstream were generally characterized by an abundance of beta-mesosaprobous and alpha-mesosaprobous species, while the diatom assemblages downstream had a very high abundance of polisaprobous species. Eutrophic and hypertrophic macrophyte taxa (such as Lemna trisulca, Potamogeton nodosus, and Ranunculus sp.) covered a high percentage of the stream bottom. Both diatom indices and macrophyte indices with the exception of the Biological Macrophyte Index of Rivers (IBMR) were correlated with BOD5, COD, TDS, NH4-N, NO2-N, PO4-P, and EC. Physicochemical variables, diatom and macrophyte taxa and the results of diatom and macrophyte indices indicated that the Akar double dagger ay stream basin is eutrophic and organically polluted.

AB  - Heavy metals may adversely affect the structure and function of the periphyton community in lake ecosystems. We carried out samplings of three habitats at eight sites located in the Lake Baiyangdian that is strongly influenced by wastewater discharge (Sites 1 and 2), aquaculture and densely populated villages (Sites 3, 6, and 8), and the least disturbed (Sites 4, 5, and 7). Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd, and Cr were determined in these samples, and the periphyton community was simultaneously studied. The contamination factor (C (f) (i) ) was estimated for every metal as the ratio between pre-industrial records from sediments (C (n) (i) ) and present concentration values (C (i) ), and the individual potential risk (E (r) (i) ) was calculated by multiply the toxic response factor (Tr (i) ) and C (f) (i) for a given substance were based on Hakanson's methodology. The RI was obtained for each sampling site by summing the values of E (r) (i) first and the average was calculated across the sampling sites. The results showed that the RI for all three habitats was lower than 94, and they are in decreasing order: wastewater discharge, aquaculture and densely populated villages, and the least anthropogenic impacted. When the three sampling seasons were compared, August appeared to show the highest risk, followed by April and November. The RI values showed negative correlations (r = -0.444 to -0.851, p < 0.05) with the structural and functional metrics. The best correlation was detected between chlorophyll c/chlorophyll a (Chl c/a) ratio and E (r) (i) Hg (r = -0.851, p < 0.01). Our results suggest the periphyton community can be used in bio-monitoring.

AB  - P>The effect of agriculture on fish assemblages was assessed using electric fishing data from 108 sites on 27 medium-sized rivers running through organic soils in central and northern Finland. The intensity of agriculture was quantified as the percentage of the catchment area used for agriculture (range 0-31%). High correlations (r2 = 0.68-0.86) were found between the intensity of agriculture and water quality parameters, especially total phosphorus, suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand. Densities of bullhead, Cottus gobio L., alpine bullhead, Cottus poecilopus Heckel, minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus (L.) and brown trout, Salmo trutta L., declined with increasing intensity of agriculture. Conversely, density of perch, Perca fluviatilis L., and roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), increased with intensity of agriculture. A fish-based index developed for the evaluation of the ecological integrity of rivers correlated negatively with the intensity of agriculture.

AB  - Sanjiang plain, which is an alluvial land situated at the confluence of Songhua, Heilong and Ussuri Rivers in northeast of China, is an important commodity grain base. Within the confluence zone, the contents of five heavy metals (Cd, Hg, As, Pb and Cr) in surface soils were sampled and monitored in 21 villages around Tongjiang, Fujin and Suibin Cities. Spatial distribution analysis and assessment were conducted by using GIS technology, Muller geoaccumulation index and Hakanson potential ecological risk index. Heavy metal contents in the studied area range as follows: Cd, 0.048-0.280 mg/kg; Hg, 0.017-0.079 mg/kg; As, 4.73-18.16 mg/kg; Pb, 15.9-34.8 mg/kg and Cr, 16.8-55.1 mg/kg, indicating that the detection results meet the agricultural industry standard of China, i.e., environmental condition standards for pollution-free food production (NY5332-2006). Statistical analysis showed that there are certain correlations among Cd, As and Pb. In Fujing City, the southwest region of the studied area, Cd, As and Pb levels are elevated. Hg distribution is dispersed and Cr level is elevated in the eastern and southern parts of the studied area. Moreover, the calculations of Muller geoaccumulation index and Hakanson potential ecological risk index indicate that light pollution is caused by Cd and As and that the majority of the studied area is exposed to slight ecological risk.

AB  - The metal binding potential of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is highly related with its inherent properties such as molecular weight (MW). Here sediment DOMs with different origins, i.e., algae-and macrophyte-dominated sediment DOM (named as ASDOM and MSDOM, respectively), were size-fractionated into low MW (LMW-, < 1 kDa) and high MW(HMW-, 1 kDa similar to 0.45 mu m) fractions, with the spectral and metal binding properties in different MW fractions exploring via total organic carbon, absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and Cu(II) titration techniques. The MSDOM contained more organic carbon, lower specific UV absorbance, lower fluorescence index, higher humification index, and lower biological index compared to the ASDOM. As for the MW-fractionated samples, the humic-and fulvic-like fluorophores were mainly distributed in the LMW-DOM, while the protein-like ones were located richly in the HMW-DOM. Thus, obvious MW-and origin-dependent heterogeneities in abundance and spectral properties were observed for sediment DOMs. One humic-like, one fulvic-like, and two protein-like fluorescent components were identified by PARAFAC analysis, with different components exhibiting different variable patterns in response to Cu(II) addition. Irrespective of sample sources, humic-and fulvic-like components had higher condition stability constants (logK(M) > 4.96) than protein-like components (logK(M) < 4.86). As for the MW-fractionated samples, the HMW-DOM, especially the HMW humic-/fulvic-like components, exhibited higher metal binding potential than the bulk and LMW counterparts. This study highlighted the importance of HMW-DOM in manipulating the behavior, fate, and bioavailability of heavy metals in lake sediments. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effects of riparian vegetation removal on body size and wing fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of Argia tinctipennis Selys (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) were studied in the River Suia-Mi double dagger A(0) basin, which is part of the Xingu basin in Brazilian Amazonia. A total of 70 specimens (n = 33 from preserved and n = 37 from degraded areas) was measured. Five wing measures of each wing (totalizing ten measured characters) were taken. Preserved and degraded points presented non-overlapped variations of a Habitat Integrity Index, supporting the environmental differentiation between these two categories. FA increases in degraded areas approximately four times for the width between the nodus and proximal portion of the pterostigma of forewings (FW), two times for the width of the wing in the region of nodus of FW, and approximately 1.7 times for the number of postnodal cells of FW. The increase is almost five times for the width between the nodus and the proximal portion of the pterostigma of hind wings (HW), three times for the number of postnodal cells of HW, and approximately 1.6 times the width between quadrangle and nodus of HW. Individuals of preserved sites were nearly 3.3% larger than for degraded sites, based on mean hind wing length. Our results supports that the development of A. tinctipennis in degraded areas is affected by riparian vegetation removal and may reflect in wing FA variations. Consequently, these FA measures may be a useful tool for bioassessment using Odonata insects as a model.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine cellular-, organ-, and organism-level responses in longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) and fish community structure in a stream in which treated municipal sewage effluent is discharged and in a nearby reference stream with little surrounding land use. A modified version of the U.S.E.P.A. Rapid Bioassessment Protocol V, which combines a habitat assessment with Karr's index of biotic integrity, was used on 400-m reaches of each stream. The study site had a higher proportion of tolerant species and omnivores and a lower proportion of top predators, suggesting alterations in the fish community and a slight level of water quality impairment. Significant increases in condition factor, hepatosomatic index, serum testosterone, and plasma vitellogenin concentrations were observed in male sunfish collected from the study stream in comparison to fish collected from the reference stream. There were no differences between sites in hepatic expression of the 70-kDa stress protein (HSP70). In conclusion, effects were observed at cellular, organ, organism, and community levels of biological organization in fishes exposed to treated municipal sewage effluent.

AB  - In low-productivity, high-altitude habitats food can become a limiting factor for the occurring amphibians. Common frog eggs deposited in ponds and the developing tadpoles represent energy-rich prey for syntopic Alpine newts that should be advantageous for storing sufficient amounts of energy to survive hibernation and breed the following spring. In our study population in the Zillertal Alps, Austria at 2100 m a.s.l., in two consecutive years we found the body mass of Alpine newts to be significantly higher in ponds containing tadpoles of the common frog than in ponds without tadpoles. As the frogs forage mostly on land, we regard their eggs as an allochtonous nutrient subsidy for ultra-oligotrophic high-altitude ponds that may have a profound effect on the fitness and distribution of Alpine newts and common frogs.

AB  - Quantifying sublethal effects of plastics ingestion on marine wildlife is difficult, but key to understanding the ontogeny and population dynamics of affected species. We developed a method that overcomes the difficulties by modelling individual ontogeny under reduced energy intake and expenditure caused by debris ingestion. The predicted ontogeny is combined with a population dynamics model to identify ecological breakpoints: cessation of reproduction or negative population growth. Exemplifying this approach on loggerhead turtles, we find that between 3% and 25% of plastics in digestive contents causes a 2.5-20% reduction in perceived food abundance and total available energy, resulting in a 10-15% lower condition index and 10% to 88% lower total seasonal reproductive output compared to unaffected turtles. The reported plastics ingestion is insufficient to impede sexual maturation, but population declines are possible. The method is readily applicable to other species impacted by debris ingestion.

AB  - In macrotidal coastal ecosystems, spatial heterogeneity of the water column properties is induced by both oceanic and continental influences. Hydrodynamic processes generate a land-sea gradient of environmental conditions, affecting the biological performances of sedentary organisms. The aim of the present study is to establish an extensive spatial assessment in the reproductive investment of the wild Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Arcachon Bay. This is done by looking for a relationship between the Lawrence and Scott condition index (LSCI) and two tidal processes: the immersion level (I-L) and the local oceanic flushing time (LoFt). The LSCI of C gigas was assessed, just before gamete release, at 68 sampling stations in Arcachon Bay. Oyster performance was overall low and spatially variable. Significant differences in the LSCI were detected between the outer and inner bay. Oyster reefs located toward the mouth of the bay exhibited high LSCI(between 9 and 11), while oyster reefs located in inner bay, especially in south-eastern part around the Eyre River, had low LSa (below 6). Linear modelling allowed to highlight significant effects of both tidal processes I-L and LoFt on the obtained LSCI gradient. LoFt explained 33% of the spatial variability observed on LSCI (I-L = 3%; LoFt = 17%; LoFt + I-L: 13%), 6% were attributed to the intra-station variation (ISv). Thus, high IL and rapid LoFt favor a better development of somatic-gonadal volume, probably because of longer feeding time and higher supply of food from the ocean by tide flows. Disentangling the effects of I-L and LoFt on LSCI allowed to describe the spatial pattern in 61% of variability not explained by both tidal factors. A residual gradient directed southeast-northwest highlighted that others factors, independent from I-L and LoFt seems to hamper inner bay oyster reproductive performance. Consequently, investigating on the ecological functioning (Eyre influences), trophic potential and anthropogenic pressures of this zone seem,crucial on the understanding of C gigas reproductive pattern in Arcachon Bay.

AB  - The Amon Wasteway is an engineered drainage waterway for the Kennewick Irrigation District, which receives its water from the lowerYakima River near Prosser, Washington. Reference conditions that were established in a basin-wide macroinvertebrate and physicochemical study of the Yakima River were used to generate a macro invertebrate community condition index and a non-pesticide agricultural intensity index. These indices were utilized to ascertain the ecological integrity of the wasteway. Despite the negative connotation often associated with such bodies of water, the wasteway compared well against both reference condition indices for the lower basin. The overall water quality of Amon Wasteway, as measured by macroinvertebrate and physicochemical analysis, was found to be better than its source, the Yakima River. The species composition of the wasteway most closely resembled the makeup of the Yakima River. This river is many times the size of the wasteway, but the nearest source in an and climate to provide immigrants.

AB  - As part of a wider study examining the impacts of corn pesticides on lacertid lizards in north-western Portugal, we examined various physiological, biochemical, and histological biomarkers of exposure and effect among field populations of Podarcis bocagei. Biomarkers included body condition index, standard metabolic rate, locomotor performance, parasitization, glutathione oxidative pathways and related enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation and liver and testis histology. Few of the various biomarkers investigated provided statistically significant evidence of toxic effect. However, using a weight of evidence approach, we conclude that pesticides are affecting lizards living in the vicinity of pesticide exposed corn agriculture sites. Lizards from these locations present a profile of animals under metabolic stress with reduced condition indices, increased standard metabolic rate, lower incidence of hepatocyte vacuolation, altered iron metabolism, increased activation of GSH oxidation pathways, and even increased prevalence of hemoparasites.

AB  - Economic development puts pressure on environment through air, water and land degradation, which in turn brings real costs to the economy. Actual economy growth should therefore consider the environmental degradation cost resulted from economic activities. Pearl River Delta (PRD) region as a typical delta area with rapid development in China, is with great significance to understand the loses resulted from environmental pollution.
   This study conducts an environmental economic accounting within the PRD region from 2011 to 2015 using the environmental degradation cost accounting approach. We identified and calculated the economic, agricultural, industrial and social losses resulting from air, water and waste pollution with different valuation methods, which includes shadow price, replacement costs, market value method, etc. The results showed the total environmental degradation cost ranged from 18.1 to 19.8 billion US$ and the environmental degradation index declined slightly over the years, with significant differences among cities.
   It implied that the environmental condition of PRD region has been continuously improved over the years, but the capacity of environment control between cities had large differences. Cities in PRD region should therefore take measures tailored to their current situation to optimize their resource endowment and industrial structure, to overcome the conflicts between economic development and environmental protection. For cities with relatively high degradation cost, it is urgent to accelerate the efforts in improving the quality of the environment and ecosystem. For cities with lower degradation cost, it is important to take actions to keep on a sustainable and ecological efficient developing path.
   Main findings: The total environmental degradation cost of the PRD region is firstly calculated with insights on environmental management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In modern conditions of the development of globalization processes, any advantages are important for each company in the competitive struggle for the consumer. One of them is the implementation of corporate social and environmental responsibility measures and taking into account its practices in the formation of the company's competitive strategy. The study considers the issue of mechanisms for implementing corporate social and environmental responsibility in companies. The main purpose of the research is to determine corporate social and environmental responsibility role in ensuring the company's competitiveness and to substantiate the methodology of corporate social and environmental responsibility integrated assessment based on the indicators that allow for the needs of stakeholders to be taken into account. It is confirmed that an effective mechanism for corporate social and environmental responsibility implementation by companies is to take into account its practices in the formation of a competitive strategy. The authors analysed the companies' competitiveness indicators that are determined by corporate social and environmental responsibility. It was suggested to use the 4P-complex of corporate social and environmental responsibility for assessing the competitive advantages of the company. It synthesizes such components as follows: People, Planet, Profits and Partnership. These components are characterized by relevant indicators. To assess the effectiveness of implementing the corporate social and environmental responsibility principles into the company's competitive strategy, the authors suggest using the integral corporate social and environmental responsibility index, which synthesizes the assessment of company's corporate social and environmental responsibility by indicators of four components - 4P-complex. The relationship between the integral corporate social and environmental responsibility index and indicators of individual components is proposed to be determined using the geometric average.

AB  - We developed a methodology to index statistical changes in the variance of ecological measures over time. While ecological indicators are used to assess ecosystem health, vulnerability, risk and damage to ecosystems, their primary focus has been on changes to the mean of the ecological state or process. Little work has been done on incorporating variability into ecological indices. The methodology developed here is based on the Modified Levene's test of variance and a moving block where an initial time period (block) of ecosystem behavior is compared to the moving block. This allows for the detection of not only shifts in variance but also the magnitude of the shift on a continuous basis. Our results compared well with the benchmarked results from the Centered Cumulative Sum of Squares Algorithm (CUSUM) for detection of variance changes in fixed time series. The output from this methodology is a continuous stream of parameters (significant variance shift, magnitude of the shift, and the direction of the variance shift) suitable for indexing variance or integrating into an index measuring ecosystem change. Results suggest that the block interval widths should be at least 50 and that a smoothing factor of five be used to avoid false positives. We used modeled vegetation carbon output to analyze the utility of the methodology, illustrating that different model assumptions and CO2 regimes affect the variability of the ecological response. The degree of risk resource managers may want to explore can be altered by choices in the block length, the length of the string used to smooth variance shifts, the assumption that the initial period has constant variance and the alpha levels used to determine statistical significance.

AB  - This study has used a general-purpose multi-objective programming model to determine the minimum human-ecological water balance and ecosystems to determine at least jericanological or minimal blue-water levels. As the two target functions are, respectively, the blue index for humans and the ecosystem index. A case study on the Sufi Chai River. To determine the environmental water requirement of the Sufi River tea, it has been wetted with a hydrostatic method and hydrologic methods of flow transmission curve continuity and tonnage have been used. In the hydraulic method, the soaked environment was used to determine the breaking point from 4 practices: curve slope, maximum curvature, ideal point with scale factor 1 and ideal point with scale factor 2. The results indicate that the Tenant method has shortcomings in estimating the environmental water requirement. Based on the results, the values obtained from the flow transmission curve method are preferable to ecological management conditions than other methods. (C) 2019 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cryopreservation of embryos can be a powerful biotechnological tool to supply all year-round biological material for sea urchin aquaculture production. This study investigates different methodological and biological factors that may affect the result of the cryopreservation process of sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) embryos. Our data indicate that neither embryo density nor the use of different cryopreservation containers presented effect on the cryopreservation outcome. Contrary to other marine invertebrates, for sea urchin embryo cryopreservation ultrapure water cannot be used as CPA solvent, yielding zero survival. After studying the reproductive parameters along the reproductive season, we found a positive correlation between both male and female Condition Index (C.I.), and between the oocyte weight and C.I. Both the histology study of female gonads and the C.I. variation, suggest that the sea urchin natural spawning period in the Ria de Vigo occurs between June and July. We found no correlation between any of the reproductive parameters monitored and the cryopreservation outcome.

AB  - In the last years, increasing interest has been dedicated to the quality assessment of brackish-water systems. Traditionally, fish community is an important biological element used to assess the quality status of transitional water bodies. In this study, we analysed the effect of anthropogenic pressures on the population of a small teleost, the sand smelt Atherina boyeri, in a Mediterranean lagoon by means of body condition. Fish were sampled once a year during the period 2010-2012, in 32 sampling sites, and for each specimen individual body condition factor was estimated. A negative significant correlation was found between condition factor and pressures related to alteration of the hydrographic regime, while a significant positive correlation was found with trophic status indicators and fishery activities. Therefore, morphological and hydrological alteration of coastal lagoons, modifying the quality and the availability of resources, seems to influence the health of resident populations.

AB  - Land use change and other human disturbances have significant impacts on physicochemical and biological conditions of stream systems. Meanwhile, linking these disturbances with hydrology and water quality conditions is challenged due to the lack of high-resolution datasets and the selection of modeling techniques that can adequately deal with the complex and nonlinear relationships of natural systems. This study addresses the above concerns by employing a watershed model to obtain stream flow and water quality data and fill a critical gap in data collection. The data were then used to estimate fish index of biological integrity (IBI) within the Saginaw Bay basin in Michigan. Three methods were used in connecting hydrology and water quality variables to fish measures including stepwise linear regression, partial least squares regression, and fuzzy logic. The IBI predictive model developed using fuzzy logic showed the best performance with the R (2) = 0.48. The variables that identified as most correlated to IBI were average annual flow, average annual organic phosphorus, average seasonal nitrite, average seasonal nitrate, and stream gradient. Next, the predictions were extended to pre-settlement (mid-1800s) land use and climate conditions. Results showed overall significantly higher IBI scores under the pre-settlement land use scenario for the entire watershed. However, at the fish sampling locations, there was no significant difference in IBI. Results also showed that including historical climate data have strong influences on stream flow and water quality measures that interactively affect stream health; therefore, should be considered in developing baseline ecological conditions.

AB  - Anopheles subpictus Grassi is considered a secondary malaria vector in parts of Asia. The current study determined some ecological and bionomical characteristics of this species in southeastern Iran. The temporal patterns of abundance, resting behavior, blood feeding activity, host selection, adult susceptibility to insecticides and larval habitats were investigated. Most adults were collected by pyrethrum space-spray collection, followed by pit shelters and outlet window traps, respectively. The abdominal condition index of gravid to blood fed females resting outdoors was more than one, thereby showing exophilic resting behavior. Only 25% of engorged females tested positive for human blood, even though most of the samples were collected from houses. The host seeking activity of An. subpictus was bimodal with peaks at 22-2300 h and 03-0400 h. Also, the relative abundance showed peaks in March and December. The results of susceptibility tests showed a resistance of field strains to DDT Future studies are needed to investigate the possible role of this species in malaria transmission in southeastern Iran.

AB  - To identify the affection of shellfish cultivation on sediment conditions in Yinghai shellfish cultivation zone in Jiaozhou Bay, the concentration, sources, and the potential ecological risk of heavy metals was identified. Results show the range of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, As and Mn are 10.15-29.98, 35.95-111.22, 12.44-27.68, 0.08-0.22, 18.03-82.32, 0.04-0.13, 4.02-7.72 and 574.07-839.33 mg.kg(-1). Shellfish cultivation influences heavy metal content to some extent. Principal component analysis suggests the accumulation of Zn, Mn, and Cu mainly results from agricultural and industrial actions, Pb from traffic pollution, and Hg from coal combustion. According to the potential ecological index, there is medium and higher ecological risk of contamination by Hg and Cd, which indicates that the study area suffers from varying degrees of heavy metal pollution.

AB  - Climate oscillations exert direct control over the environment in which they occur and may influence the physical condition of migratory marine species, such as tuna, as reported by several authors. The main aim of this study was to explore the association between the potential effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the fitness condition of bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) migrating to the Spanish Mediterranean Sea. A total of 2357 length-weight pairs of data obtained from individuals collected on the Spanish Mediterranean coast were analysed. A non-parametric Spearman test was used to investigate correlations between the atmospheric oscillation indexes and two physical condition indexes. The results suggest that, in general, positive phases of the NAO index improve the physical condition of fish migrating to spawning grounds in the Mediterranean Sea. These results could be explained by changes in the dominant winds, which could favour pre-spawning migration, and by nutrients availability, which guarantees their recovery after the spawning period.

AB  - A selective method analyzing separately o-, m- and p-methylhippuric acid isomers in workers' urine samples has been developed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation has been optimized to resolve the three isomers at baseline. Combined with this optimal separation, the mass spectrometer allowed rapid switching from MRM scan to full scan and product ion scan within the chromatographic peak. This feature allowed the retention of analyte chemical structure information for the three methylhippuric acid isomers in parallel with the simultaneous acquisition of quantitative data. Such an approach is unequaled for the reliability of the data generated and it can be applied to each isomer separately. The method was adjusted to a dynamic range between 0.2 mM and 8.12 mM for o-methylhippuric acid and p-methylhippuric acid, and between 0.41 mM and 16.23 mM for m-methylhippuric acid in order to cover the biological exposure index. A negligible matrix effect was observed with the conditions used. Also, intra-day and inter-day precisions were both <6% for all the concentration levels tested and the accuracy was evaluated at 97 +/- 4%. The inclusion of simultaneous full scan acquisitions did not prevent the robustness of the quantitative data. The method applied to the determination of inter-laboratory proficient test samples led to results in the tolerated range. Moreover, urine samples from workers were robustly quantified and the MHA levels were all below the biological exposure index reference value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diet and feeding intensity of the portunid crab Polybius henslowii were studied during the spring of 2004 along Galician and Cantabrian continental shelves (NW Iberian Peninsula) between 78 and 287 m. qThe area had been affected by the Prestige oil spill in November 2002, with different sectors at different levels of pollution: highest in between Mino River and Cape Finisterre (MF) and from there to Estaca de Bares Point (FE) and lowest from Estaca to Cape Penas (EP). From 37272 specimens collected in 59 bottom hauls, 342 were analysed for stomach fullness and diet composition. Stomach fullness was lower in FE, but with no significant differences among sectors. Diet was a mixture of pelagic and benthic prey: cephalopods (Ilex coindetti), brachyurans (P. henslowii) and polychaetes (Glycera sp.). Other prey were beloniform eggs and fish remains. Two stress markers were also studied in some specimens: Acetylcholinesterase (a neurotoxicity marker) varied among sampled areas, while lipid peroxidation (an oxidative stress marker) did not. Changes in trophic variables, distribution and density were analysed in relation to depth, surface and bottom T, surface Chl a from satellite imagery and tar aggregate concentration in sediments. Along Galician and Cantabrian coasts prey availability, linked to productivity level, seems to be the main factor affecting P. henslowii diet and distribution. Interannual abundance variability seems to be controlled by large-scale climatic conditions (NAO index). This natural variability masks possible effects induced by the oil spill.

AB  - Otolith microstructure was analyzed to determine the early growth of Neosalanx taihuensis juveniles from Three-Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Tian-e-zhou Oxbow (TEO, below the dam). The early growth of the N. taihuensis juveniles differed significantly between the two populations. Higher relative condition index and wider otolith increments of the fish in the TGR indicated the faster early growth and larger otolith nucleus radius indicated the larger size of larvae at hatch for the TGR population, which may result in higher early survival rate. We suggest that increased primary production and food availability following the impoundment of the TGR contributed importantly to the increased early growth and survival of the N. taihuensis population. Fishery management and conservation in the TGR should consider the potential impacts to other fish species and the ecosystem of the increasing abundance of N. taihuensis.

AB  - Sport fishing is an important recreational and economic activity, especially in Australia, Europe and North America, and the condition of sport fish populations is a key ecological indicator of water body condition for millions of anglers and the public. Despite its importance as an ecological indicator representing the status of sport fish populations, an index for measuring this ecosystem service has not been quantified by analyzing actual fish taxa, size and abundance data across the U.S.A. Therefore, we used game fish data collected from 1,561 stream and river sites located throughout the conterminous U.S.A. combined with specific fish species and size dollar weights to calculate site-specific recreational fishery index (RFI) scores. We then regressed those scores against 38 potential site-specific environmental predictor variables, as well as site-specific fish assemblage condition (multimetric index; MMI) scores based on entire fish assemblages, to determine the factors most associated with the RFI scores. We found weak correlations between RFI and MMI scores and weak to moderate correlations with environmental variables, which varied in importance with each of 9 ecoregions. We conclude that the RFI is a useful indicator of a stream ecosystem service, which should be of greater interest to the U.S.A. public and traditional fishery management agencies than are MMIs, which tend to be more useful for ecologists, environmentalists and environmental quality agencies.

AB  - A method of assessing body condition of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) is presented. The method uses visual assessment to assign numerical scores to six different regions of the body, which are totaled to give a numerical index ranging from 0-11. The relationship between the index and morphometric variables is compared for a sample of 119 juvenile and young adult elephants from southern India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Mean ages of males and females were similar. Mean index of body condition (with standard error [SE]) was 7.3 +/- 0.2 points. No significant correlation was found between index of body condition and age over both sexes (r = 0.01, n = 50). Results were equivalent when sexes were treated separately (females: r = 0.03, n = 24; males: r = 0.01, n = 26). Sexes did not differ in height of the shoulder or body condition in our sample, but there was significant sexual dimorphism in breadth of the zygomatic arch and three measures of subcutaneous fat: girth of neck, thickness of cervical fold, and thickness of anal flap. These three measures were also significantly correlated with each other. Our assessment method should prove a practical tool for ecologic studies, but the relationship of the index to percentage of body fat should be determined using heavy water dilution methodology.

AB  - To predict the comprehensive air quality index, the data of comprehensive air quality index and environmental protection investment are analyzed in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang, respectively. Considering the different growth rates in environmental protection investment, comprehensive air quality index is predicted by grey Verhulst model. The results show that the government's investment can promote the improvement of air quality to a certain extent. According to local conditions, the improvement of air quality not only relies on government investment, but also needs other ways to reduce the comprehensive air quality index.

AB  - We discuss theoretical issues related to sets of sustainability indicators. We propose that sustainable development can only be observed by analyzing the interrelation between socioeconomic and natural systems which have to be conceptualized as autopoietic and interacting systems. In order to be able to observe this interaction process between socioeconomic and natural systems, a set of sustainability indicators must, at least, comprise four different types of indicators: (1) socioeconomic driving forces, (2) pressures on the environment, (3) state of the environment and (4) feedbacks of environmental change on society. Society-nature Interrelations are conceptualized using two basic notions: (1) socioeconomic metabolism and (2) colonization of natural processes.

AB  - In the wake of climate change events, spatio-temporal integrated ecosystem models and indices are useful decision support tools for ecosystem management. We developed a preliminary spatio-temporal macroinvertebrate multi-index of biotic integrity (MMiBI) in a major tropical river basin in Kenya. Separation power of Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) qualified 11 metrics from triplicate macroinvertebrate samples collected seasonally in 33 microhabitats into the scoring system of 1, 3 and 5. Validation and strengthening procedure compared the final MMiBI with selected (p < 0.05) physico-chemical parameters and post-MMiBI fieldwork. Seasonal alternating pattern of MMiBI scores suggested that it was highly likely that temporal scores performance might rank lower as compared to spatial significance on ecosystem health delineation. Although a case study in a single river basin is presented, the indexing holistic approach can be of general use for any other coastal river basin as a low-cost biomonitoring tool as a prerequisite towards ecosystem sustainability of water resources.

AB  - Fish-based index of biotic integrity (F-IBI) is widely used to assess river ecosystems. With survey data from the Yellow River fishery resources in the 1980s and 2008, fish composition and abundance, vertical distribution, trophic structure, reproductive guilds and tolerance in the river's upstream, midstream, downstream, and estuary were examined, and F-IBI systems were established for each reach to assess river ecosystem health. Results showed that compared to the 1980s, the number of fish species in 2008 sharply declined in the midstream and downstream reaches, percentage of benthic fish species decreased in upstream and estuary, the number and percentage of omnivorous species decreased in all reaches, and percentage of tolerant fish species increased 15 times in upstream but decreased in midstream and downstream. The F-IBI scores in the four reaches in the 1980s were all higher than those in 2008 and decreased from upstream to estuary; the healthy conditions indicated by F-IBI scores in the 1980s were "good," "fair," "poor," and "fair" from upstream to estuary and "degraded" to "poor" in all the reaches in 2008. This indicated that the river ecosystem has degraded from the 1980s to 2008. This was also shown by variations in water chemistry.

AB  - Land managers and conservationists face two challenges in protecting land: first balancing human needs against conservation goals, and second demonstrating protected areas are meeting those goals. In this paper, we address the second challenge, using the National Parks of the highly urbanized mid-Atlantic as an example. We detail a comprehensive measure of overall ecosystem integrity, the bird community index, and demonstrate how it relates to the underlying habitat structure. We use community bird data collected from point counts to generate a single, comprehensive metric that we show is significantly correlated to habitat features, making it an effective tool for evaluating ecological integrity. Next, using the metric, we compare bird communities within and outside of protected status, and find that National Parks maintain higher integrity bird communities. This result provides evidence that even smaller parks in highly urbanized areas afford a conservation benefit. More broadly, we find that this rapid and cost effective assessment tool, the bird community index, shows great promise in helping land managers evaluate protected areas.

AB  - 1. The distribution patterns of stygobiotic invertebrates were examined with a stratified sampling design at 197 sites selected among four hydrogeographic basins in the Lessinian Massif (northern Italy). The sites were approximately evenly distributed among four hydrogeological zones: unsaturated and saturated zone of karstic aquifers, and hyporheic and saturated zone of porous aquifers.
   2. Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis which assesses deviation of habitat conditions from reference conditions, was used to evaluate the importance of 14 selected environmental variables in shaping groundwater biodiversity patterns in the region (total of 89 stygobiotic species). The measured variables explained 80% of the variability in the data set.
   3. Sampling sites were distributed along the environmental gradients defined by OMI analysis. Significant differences were detected between karstic and porous site, as well as among sites located in the four hydrogeological zones. Differences among the four hydrogeographic basins were not observed.
   4. Ordination of stygobiotic species along the environmental gradients was best explained by historical variables (mainly Wurmian glaciation and age of the underlying geological formation), while variables related to hydrogeology (mainly pH, calcium concentration and habitat fragmentation) influenced species distributions in the hydrogeological zones. An Environmental Integrity Index and nitrate concentration were significantly correlated with altitude, but appeared not to play a significant role in determining stygobiotic biodiversity patterns at the regional scale.
   5. Results of the OMI analysis were highly significant for all taxa, suggesting that stygobiotic species are sensitive to the environmental factors studied. Thirty-five species showed high habitat specialisation (OMI index > 10). These species were usually rare and endemic to the Lessinian Massif. Most of them were found in a single hydrogeological zone.
   6. Quaternary glaciations appear not to have lowered stygobiotic species richness in the Lessinian Massif. This may be because of the marginal location of the region with respect to the Wurmian glacier limit and because of extensive networks of fractures in the vadose zone of the karst, which may have allowed stygobionts to move deep down in the aquifers to seek refuge during surface freezing and to recolonise ancestral habitats after the glaciers retreated.

AB  - Regional aquatic ecological security is an important indicator that presents the aquatic ecological state and can guide the aquatic environmental management. Here, an index system for the regional aquatic ecological security assessment was established based on the Pressure-State-Response Model and analytical hierarchy process. The system was applied in the city of Jinan in eastern China. The results indicated that the state of the aquatic ecological security is best in Changqing District which has relatively high vegetation coverage, a well-conserved ecological condition and a relatively smaller population density than other districts. Following were Lixia, Shizhong, Huaiyin, and Licheng Districts. The state of the aquatic ecological security is the poorest in Tianqiao District, mainly due to its over-exploitation of groundwater, declining landscape diversity and lower scientific and technical investment. The driving force test also demonstrated that economic development and population size are the dominant impact factors for the variation of aquatic ecological security. Environmental protection investment should be paid more attention as an important measure to improve the aquatic ecological security in Jinan. It was demonstrated that the index system can be effectively applied in an aquatic ecological security assessment to identify the primary impact factors that support decision-making on water resources management.

AB  - Quantification of empirical relationships between ecosystem health and human well-being is uncommon at broad spatial scales. We used public data for Virginia (USA) counties to examine pairwise correlations among two indicators of stream health, thirteen indicators of human well-being, and four demographic metrics. Our indicators of stream health included the Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) and the percentage of stream kilometers with a fish consumption advisory (%FCA); these measures are inversely related. VSCI and %FCA were correlated with some indicators of human health, safety and security, and living standards, as well as with some demographic metrics. VSCI was most strongly correlated (positively) with the percentage of a county's population self-identifying as White; %FCA was most strongly correlated (positively) with overall mortality rate (number of deaths per 100,000 people). This exploratory study highlights the need for future multidisciplinary, multiscale studies to characterize toxicological, epidemiological, socioeconomic, and political linkages including causal mechanisms - between ecosystem health and human well-being.

AB  - There is an increasing demand to better understand the dynamics of the vegetation conditions over time as a result of the improvement of remote sensing techniques. Yhis study aimed to analyse the spatio-temporal behavior of vegetation, stratified by land use in area located in Botucatu-SP. We sused21 Landsat-5 TM images in 25 years (1985 - 2010) of analysis. We applied conversion of the digital numbers to physical values, atmospheric and topographic corrections, which allowed to analyze the vegetation changes by using the VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) calculation. The VCI showed a good performance in analyzing the spatiotemporal vegetation condition at a local level, it is sensitive to local variations of rainfall, it enhances the variability of the intra-class land use for the vigor of vegetation. By applying the VCI we were able to observe the vegetation pattern of the semideciduous forest (land use class = Forest) present in the area, fact that makes this methodology recommended in future researches related to the analysis of the vegetation condition.

AB  - The teratogenic effect of bottom sediments of the Rybinsk Reservoir on the occurrence of pathomorphological changes of the mouthpart structures of Chironomus riparius larvae has been experimentally confirmed. On average, the share of chironomid larvae with pathomorphological deformities in the reaches for the entire observation period was 29.4% (Mologa Reach), 24.6% (Central Reach), 24.0% (Volga Reach), 26.2% (Sheksha Reach), and 6.7% in the control group. Changes were recorded for all mouthpart structures of chironomid larvae. The number of deformities of the mouthparts of chironomid larvae may reflect the potential danger of contaminated sediments and serve as a good biomarker when monitoring the ecological state of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for the Chesapeake Bay was statistically verified using simulations and a suite of multivariate statistical techniques. The B-IBI uses a simple scoring system for benthic community metrics to assess benthic community health and to infer environmental quality of benthic habitats in the Bay. Overall, the B-IBI was verified as being sensitive, stable, robust and statistically sound. Classification effectiveness of the B-IBI increased with salinity, from marginal performance for tidal freshwater ecosystems to excellent results for polyhaline areas. The greater classification uncertainty in low salinity habitats may be due to difficulties in reliably identifying naturally unstressed areas or may be due to regional ecotones created by stress gradients. Pollution-indicative species abundance, pollution-sensitive species abundance, and diversity (Shannon's index) were the most important metrics in discriminating between degraded and non-degraded conditions in the majority of the habitats. Single metrics often performed as well as the multi-metric B-IBI in correctly classifying the relative quality of sites. However, the redundancy in the multi-metric B-IBI provided a stable 'weight of evidence' system which increased confidence in general conclusions. Confidence limits developed for the B-IBI scores were used to distinguish among habitats that were degraded, non-degraded, of intermediate quality, or of indeterminate condition.

AB  - In 2003, we compared two benthic macroinvertebrate sampling methods that are used for rapid biological assessment of wadeable streams. A single habitat method using kick sampling in riffles and runs was compared to a multiple habitat method that sampled all available habitats in proportion of occurrence. Both methods were performed side-by-side at 41 sites in lower gradient streams of the Piedmont and Northern Piedmont ecoregions of the United States, where riffle habitat is less abundant. Differences in sampling methods were examined using similarity indices, two multimetric indices [the family-level Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) and the species-level Macroinvertebrate Biotic Integrity Index (MBII)], their component metrics, and bioassessment endpoints based on each index. Index scores were highly correlated between single and multiple habitat field methods, and sampling method comparability, based on comparison of similarities between and within sampling methods, was particularly high for species level data. The VSCI scores and values of most of its component metrics were not significantly higher for one particular method, but relationships between single and multiple habitat values were highly variable for percent Ephemeroptera, percent chironomids, and percent Plecoptera and Trichoptera (Hydropsychidae excluded). A similar level of variability in the relationship was observed for the MBII and most of its metrics, but Ephemeroptera richness, percent individuals in the dominant five taxa, and Hilsenhoff Biotic Index scores all exhibited differences in values between single and multiple habitat field methods. When applied to multiple habitat samples, the MBII exhibited greater precision, higher index scores, and higher assessment categories than when applied to single habitat samples at the same sites. In streams with limited or no riffle habitats, the multiple habitat method should provide an adequate sample for biological assessment, and at sites with abundant riffle habitat, little difference would be expected between the single and multiple habitat field methods. Thus, in geographic areas with a wide variety of stream types, the multiple habitat method may be more desirable. Even so, the variability in the relationship between single and multiple habitat methods indicates that the data are not interchangeable, and we suggest that any change in sampling method should be accompanied by a recalibration of any existing assessment tool (e. g., multimetric index) with data collected using the new method, regardless of taxonomic level.

AB  - Biodiversity of small mammals has been used as an indicator of disturbance in a natural ecosystem. Small mammal community structure was investigated on eight transects in the Willem Pretorius Nature Reserve. The low species richness and diversity of small mammals, and the high proportion of Mastomys coucha in all habitats, indicate a high level of disturbance in the reserve. Possible reasons for this disturbance are discussed together with methods for monitoring and measuring small mammal diversity in Free State ecosystems. This study was also the first study to quantify habitat-specific patterns in terms of Shannon-diversity in the Free State. Such indices are essential to describe and compare mammalian faunas and are increasingly being used in inter alia impact assessments.

AB  - The genic capture hypothesis offers a resolution to the question of how genetic variation in male sexually selected traits is maintained in the face of strong female preferences. The hypothesis is that male display traits are costly to produce and hence depend upon overall condition, which itself is dependent upon genes at many loci. Few attempts have been made to test the assumptions and predictions of the genic capture hypothesis rigorously and, in particular, little attention has been paid to determining the genetic basis of condition. Such tests are crucial to our understanding of the maintenance of genetic variation and in the evaluation of recent models that propose a role for sexual selection in the maintenance of sex. Here, we review approaches to testing the link between genetically determined condition and levels of sexual trait expression and consider the probable importance of deleterious mutations.

AB  - Hatchery programmes for supplementing depleted populations of fish are undergoing a worldwide expansion and have provoked concern about their ramifications for populations of wild fish. In particular, Pacific salmon are artificially propagated in enormous numbers in order to compensate for numerous human insults to their populations, yet the ecological impacts of this massive hatchery effort are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that massive numbers of hatchery-raised chinook salmon reduce the marine survival of wild Snake River spring chinook, a threatened species in the USA. Based on a unique 25-year time-series, we demonstrated a strong, negative relationship between the survival of chinook salmon and the number of hatchery fish released, particularly during years of poor ocean conditions. Our results suggest that hatchery programmes that produce increasingly higher numbers of fish may hinder the recovery of depleted wild populations.

Based on short-term success indicators for reintroduction studies on reptiles we studied the tortoises' adaptation to the new environment for five months. The tortoises successfully settled in the new environment without showing adverse effects regarding their behaviour, condition index (CI) and physical appearance. The annual survival rate was 76%. Based on individual locations collected, we analysed the tortoises' movement patterns including daily displacement, five-month and seasonal home range sizes using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and fixed kernel density estimators (KDEs).

AB  - Northern pintails (Anas acuta) show fidelity to wintering areas, but little is known about their ecology and survival in Mexico where 12-23% of the North American population winters. We estimated winter (2 Nov-16 Feb) survival of 163 female northern pintails radio-marked in Sinaloa, Mexico, from 1989 to 1992. Survival rates (ages pooled) did not differ among winters (P = 0.52), but survival distributions differed between 1990-91 and 1991-92 (P = 0.03). Survival averaged 0.911 (SE = 0.02) for all 3 winters combined, and hunting composed the highest seasonal mortality rate each year (0.061-0.107); there was only 1 case of natural mortality. Age-specific survival rates were not different among winters (P = 0.79). There was no relationship between condition index measured at time of capture and subsequent survival probability overwinter (P = 0.49). Abundant habitat and low hunting pressure most likely produced high survival rates.

AB  - We examined physical habitat and fish assemblages in rivers of the Aroa Mountains (Venezuela) with different levels of environmental protection due to the creation of Yurubi National Park within the drainage. We developed an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and evaluated it using principal components analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Tributary rivers were divided into classes according to their origin (protected by the park) and physical characteristics of each, including substrate. Fishes were captured using standardized electrofishing. Fish communities showed greater species richness in heterogeneous habitat and protected rivers but overall abundance was higher in unprotected and impacted rivers. The IBI was sensitive to these differences and the scores were higher in protected rivers. The IBI detected degree of disturbance of fish communities without direct consideration of habitat parameters measured. The PCA revealed a gradient in substrate heterogeneity. Similarly, CCA revealed differences in fish assemblage composition along the environmental gradient and that varied with protection status of the river. The relationship between PCA and IBI scores was highly significant (r(2) = 0.61, P < 0.0001). The PCA and CCA analysis moderately validated the structure and predictability of IBI; but it is still necessary to refine the model and to extend its application for more time and over a wider area.

AB  - This study evaluates integrative lotic ecosystem health using neural network modeling and principal component analysis of physical, chemical, and biological parameters in 33 streams and rivers of a large watershed. Water chemistry parameters were measured to detect chemical health, and physical habitat health was determined by a model of qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI). Also, biological health was determined by the multi-metric community fish model of index of biological integrity (IBI) and then analyzed trophic compositions and tolerance guilds. In addition, we analyzed fish tissues of liver, kidney, gill, vertebra, and muscle using a sentinel species of Zacco platypus. Chemical pollutions were closely associated with land-use patterns within the watershed and the locations of major point-sources. Model value of QHEI as a measure of physical habitat health averaged 144, indicating good health, and varied from 96 to 190 depending on the sampling sites. The proportion of sensitive fish species in the tolerance guilds had negative correlation with organic matter pollution (r = -0.716, p<0.001) and had positive a relationship with IBI (r = 0.683, p<0.001) and QHEI (r = 0.573, p = 0.001). The proportion of insectivore species, as a trophic composition indicator, was inversely correlated with BOD (r = -0.463, p = 0.007) and positive with IBI (r = 0.679, p<0.001). The analysis of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) 14-5-1 model, based on the predicted IBI values in the training sites (R-2 = 0.999, MSE = 0.015) and testing sites (R-2 = 0.894, MSE = 27.4) showed high efficiency in the MLP model.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the biological properties of several subtypes of mountain and plain chernozems in the Central Caucasus (within Kabardino-Balkaria) has been performed. Statistically significant differences between the parameters of biological activity in the top horizons (from 0- to 20-cm-thick) of the studied soils have been determined. Mountain chernozems are characterized by increased humus content (by 38%, on average), the activity of dehydrogenase (by 42%) and urease (by 35%), and the values of all microbial parameters (by 12-53%). The invertase activity is higher in plain chernozems (by 47%, on average). The dispersion analysis has shown that the effect of soil-forming conditions (mountain or plain) is a more significant factor for some of the parameters studied as compared to features of the studied soils at the subtype level. The effect of the factor of genetic differences is in the range of 1-5%, while the impact of soil-forming conditions ranges from 15 to 33%. The total biological activity of the top horizons of mountain and plain chernozems has been evaluated by an integral index of the ecological-biological soil status (IIEBSS), which shows a higher biological activity of the top horizons in mountain soils (IIEBSS varies within 5-18%).

AB  - Individual quality has been measured as a variety of different traits and in several different contexts. However, the implications of such measurements in terms of overall fitness are less straightforward than has generally been appreciated. Here we outline some key issues in this regard that have yet to be addressed. Specifically, we consider the importance of both variation in selection on individual and multivariate suites of traits, and of context-specific plasticity in allocation strategies. We argue that an explicit life-history perspective is crucial for understanding variation in quality, as both the strength and direction of selection and an individual's response to it can vary within a breeding season. Hence, 'quality' is not a static characteristic that can be measured by taking longitudinal measures of single traits across a population, but rather a dynamic, multivariate suite of traits that is dependent not only on the selective context, but also on the nature and intensity of selection operating at any given time. We highlight these points by considering recent research on selection and plasticity.

AB  - The global ecosystem has been significantly disrupted on various spatiotemporal scales over the last three decades due to human activities. Geospatial technology can quickly, effectively, and quantitatively to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of eco-environmental quality (EEQ). The present study is focused on novel approach of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index (RSEI), using Landsat Imagery data to assess environmental conditions and changes pattern. Four ecological indicators were prepared in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 of Kolkata urban agglomeration (KUA) to evaluate the ecological environmental condition. The principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial autocorrelation analysis can relate all indicators with each other's and RSEI. Out study indicated, greenness and wetness have a positive effect on EEQ of the province, but both dryness and heat have a negative effect. However, it should be noted that greenness has a greater impact on the eco-environment than the other three indicators. Based on the RSEI values, we have categorized the environmental standards of the study area into four groups-very good (0.81-1.00), good (0.61-0.80), acceptable (0.41-0.60), poor (0.21-0.40), and very poor (0.00-0.20), where high values indicate that environmental quality is stable and healthy for living organisms and low values indicate relatively unstable and threatening conditions of the environment. The status of RSEI showed that 9.02%, 12.29%, 12.79% and 37.23% of an area was under poor to very poor condition in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Good to very good condition of RSEI values was increased from 19.12% to 34.074% during 1990 to 2010, but declined of RSEI value 9.47% during 2010 to 2020 due to urban expansion. Here, Moran's I values fund that 0.265, 0.543, 0.396 and 0.367 in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. The result of Moran's I values indicate that clustering nature. The present study can helpful for the decision making of ecological management guided by planners and policy makers.

AB  - Growth of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using raft culture was investigated for the first cultured generation following the Prestige oil spill off northwestern Spain. Seed from three natural populations along the Galician coastline, Pindo, Miranda, and Redes, was transplanted to a raft culture system in Ria de Ares-Betanzos. The physiological and biochemical status of mussels at the onset of culture and the degree of oil exposure three months after the spill (February 2003) have been described already, but here growth patterns of three populations sampled monthly from seeding to thinning-out (March/August 2003) and from thinning-out to harvest (August 2003/February 2004) were assessed. Mussels from Pindo (the area most affected by the oil spill) showed significantly less growth by weight than the other populations, resulting in a lower yield at harvest. The percentage of mussels classified as "large" in the Pindo population at harvest was also significantly less than that of the other two mussel populations.

AB  - Ascidians (Ciona intestinalis) and mussels (Mytilus edulis) were experimentally deployed at 15, 50 and 100 cm above the bottom in an eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadow in Vellerup Vig, Denmark. Daily water samplings at deployment height showed that concentrations of total suspended material were decreasing and concentrations of chlorophyll a increasing with distance from the bottom. A close correlation between chlorophyll a concentration and growth rates in ascidians and mussels was found, showing highest growth rates above the eelgrass canopy. There was good agreement between growth rates measured in situ and in the laboratory for mussels when compared to previous reports, while ascidians had lower in situ growth rates. The results indicate that dead organic matter is of little nutritional value to C. intestinalis and M. edulis though the mussel, due to its ability to sort particles, is better suited to the turbid environment of an eelgrass meadow.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystem recovery from anthropogenic degradation can be hampered by internal feedbacks that stabilize undesirable states. The challenges of managing and predicting alternative states in lakes are well known, but state shifts in rivers and their attendant effects on ecosystem function remain understudied despite strong recent evidence that such shifts can and do occur. Using three decades of measurements of key state variables such as turbidity, nutrient concentrations, Corbicula fluminea clam densities, and chlorophyll a, including hourly dissolved oxygen, we investigated a sudden shift from phytoplankton to macrophyte dominance in the middle Loire River (France), and its associated effects on the rivers metabolic regime. We show, instead, that despite large and synchronous shifts across all state variables, changes in gross primary production and ecosystem respiration were modest (25% and 14% declines, respectively) and that these shifts lagged the ecosystem state changes by a decade or more. The shift to a macrophyte-dominated state reduced the sensitivity of primary production to abiotic drivers, altered element cycling efficiency, flipped the net carbon balance from positive to negative, and, crucially, weakened the temporal coupling between production and respiration. This weakened coupling, detected using Granger causality, increased the temporal autocorrelation of net ecosystem production, yielding a robust early warning indicator of both state- and metabolic-shifts that may provide valuable guidance for river restoration.

AB  - Due to human activities, predictions for the coming years indicate increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (rainy and drought periods) and pollution levels, leading to salinity shifts and ocean acidification. Therefore, several authors have assessed the effects of seawater salinity shifts and pH decrease on marine bivalves, but most of these studies evaluated the impacts of both factors independently. Since pH and salinity may act together in the environment, and their impacts may differ from their effects when acting alone, there is an urgent need to increase our knowledge when these environmental changes act in combination. Thus, the present study assessed the effects of seawater acidification and salinity changes, both acting alone and in combination, on the physiological (condition index, Na and K concentrations) and biochemical (oxidative stress related biomarkers) performance of Ruditapes philippinarum. For that, specimens of R. philippinarum were exposed for 28 days to the combination of different pH levels (7.8 and 7.3) and salinities (14, 28 and 35). The results obtained showed that under control pH (7.8) and low salinity (14) the physiological status and biochemical performance of clams was negatively affected, revealing oxidative stress. However, under the same pH and at salinities 28 and 35 clams were able to maintain/regulate their physiological status and biochemical performance. Moreover, our findings showed that clams under low pH (7.3) and different salinities were able to maintain their physiological status and biochemical performance, suggesting that the low pH tested may mask the negative effects of salinity. Our results further demonstrated that, in general, at each salinity, similar physiological and biochemical responses were found in clams under both tested pH levels. Also, individuals under low pH (salinities 14, 28 and 25) and exposed to pH 7.8 and salinity 28 (control) tend to present a similar response pattern. These results indicate that pH may have a lower impact on clams than salinity. Thus, our findings point out that the predicted increase of CO2 in seawater and consequent seawater acidification will have fewer impacts on physiological and biochemical performance of R. philippinarum clams than salinity shifts.

AB  - Based upon ecological data provided by a 6-year study of native species assemblage structure and function in near-pristine Limahuli Stream (Kauai), The Hawaii Stream Index of Biological Integrity (HS-IBI) incorporates 11 metrics covering five ecological categories (taxonomic richness, sensitive species, reproductive capacity, trophic-habitat capacity, and tolerance capacity). The HS-IBI was shown to effectively distinguish stream biological condition on a continuum from undisturbed (near-pristine) to severely impaired in sampling of 39 sites (6 estuarine reaches) on 18 Hawaiian streams located on all major islands. A significant relationship was validated between relative levels of human impact occurring within-watersheds (determined through use of a landscape indicator) and IBI ratings with metrics responding predictably to gradients of human influence. For management interpretation of HS-IBI results, a framework comprised of five "integrity classes" (excellent-good-fair-poor-impaired) is provided which can be used to operationalize HS-IBI results obtained through standardized sampling of stream sites that "aEuro broken vertical bar translates into a verbal and visual portrait of biological condition." Through its focus on native species, the HS-IBI incorporates evolutionary and biogeographic variation for the region with biological expectations based upon reference condition benchmarks established in near-pristine stream environments where ecological functioning is naturally self-sustaining and resilient to normal environmental variation. The methods and tools described in this study are appropriate for application in all perennial streams in Hawaii and may be adapted for use in streams on other tropical Pacific islands where native species assemblages persist in near-pristine stream environments.

AB  - Evaluation of ecological health status after an oil spill is crucial for effective restoration measures of the affected aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we applied a multimetric phytoplankton index for biotic integrity (MPI-BI) to assess the ecological health status of the southern coast of Mactan Island, Philippines after 8, 12, 24, and 30 months from the MV Thomas Aquinas spill incident in August 2013. Phytoplankton community analysis revealed (1) no difference in abundance, richness, and diversity between affected and reference sites, (2) increasing trend of diversity over time after the spill, and (3) higher remotely-sensed chlorophyll a level in affected sites. Phytoplankton relative abundance, diversity, and trophic state were used to derive MPI-BI. Based on MPI-BI, the health status of the affected sites was generally in good condition 8 ? 30 months after. A time-series analysis of remotely-sensed and meteorological parameters showed no difference between pre and post spill conditions, except for chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon. Generally, the health status of the coastal water may be affected by the oil spillage as indicated by the increased trophic state after the spill but may be recovering from the oil spill stress.

AB  - Based on the planktonic data monitored in Lake Balihe, an ecosystem health assessment system referring to planktonic index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) was constructed to evaluate the lake health status and study the response mechanism of P-IBI to environmental factors. The results showed that a total of 7 phylum 59 species of phytoplankton and 3 phylum 28 species of zooplankton were identified in the lake, and both the plankton density and biomass varied significantly in time and space scales. The significant variation of Protozoa density should be responsible to the inconsistency between the distributions of zooplankton density and biomass, as well as the lowest value of P-IBI in summer. The P-IBI values and therefore the health levels can be seasonally ranked as winter > autumn > spring > summer and found spatially increased along the flow direction. Based on the relationships between P-IBI and the environmental factors, ammonia nitrogen = 0.46 mg/L and Secchi depth = 63 cm were found as the environmental protection thresholds of planktonic biotic integrity for this freshwater lake ecosystem. The findings of the research may provide some guidance to the ecological monitoring and protection of freshwater lake.

AB  - Native brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and introduced brown trout Salmo trutta support important recreational fisheries in Wisconsin, and coldwater index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores are often used to determine the quality of stream environments for these trout. To successfully manage biotic communities and fish populations, it is important to understand the relationships among metrics of interest. We quantified the relationships among the catch per linear meter (CPE) of brook trout and brown trout. their mean total lengths, and the coldwater fish IBI scores in second-order and third-order streams in Wisconsin. Brook trout CPE increased as coldwater IBI score increased, but there was no significant relationship between brown trout CPE and IBI score. The mean length of brown trout decreased as coldwater IBI score increased; the mean length of brook trout and IBI score were not significantly related. The mean lengths of both brook and brown trout decreased with increasing CPE. Balancing the management of trout density, length, and biotic integrity may be difficult in wadeable streams in Wisconsin. Our findings suggest that the increased abundance of brook trout is compatible with high IBI scores but that the increased abundance of brown trout and greater mean lengths are not.

AB  - This study evaluates for the first time the distribution and accumulation of butyltin compounds (BTs) in different compartments such as seawater, sediments, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and mussels (Brachidontes rodriguezii) in the Bahia Blanca estuary. The samples were collected from six sampling sites with different anthropogenic impacts. A better visualization and interpretation of data was achieved using chemometric tools (Tucker4 model), which made it possible to reveal the main relationships among the variables. This analysis showed the presence of BTs in all the estuarine environmental compartments, even in sites with low human intervention. The relationships found among BTs levels, seasons, and environmental matrices show the importance of biological processes such as phytoplankton blooms and remobilization of sediments (by tidal dynamics and/or periodic dredging) in BTs distribution and degradation. In addition, partition coefficients showed that mussels mainly bioaccumulate tributyltin from sediment, water and, to a lesser extent, SPM.

AB  - Large variations in the summering population size of Red-throated Loons (Gavia stellata) have occurred in recent decades in Alaska. Little information exists about annual or seasonal survival rates of adult Redthroated Loons. This study used tracking data from satellite transmitters implanted into 33 Red-throated Loons captured on breeding areas in Alaska to estimate annual survival with the sampling effort split between two study periods: 2000-2002 and 2008-2010. Mortality was inferred from transmitted sensor data that indicated body temperature of the Red-throated Loon and voltage of the transmitter's battery. Two definitive mortalities occurred, resulting in an annual survival estimate of 0.920 (SE = 0.054). The fates of two additional Red-throated Loons were ambiguous and, when treated as mortalities, the annual survival estimate was 0.838 (SE = 0.074). All four putative mortalities occurred during the non-breeding season in the early study period. Oceanic conditions, indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, appeared to differ between the study periods with higher Pacific Decadal Oscillation values associated with the early study period. Given that high values for Pacific Decadal Oscillation were also associated with the large decline of Red-throated Loons observed in Alaska during 1977-1993, this study suggests that survival of adult Red-throated Loons may vary in relation to the state of the marine ecosystem and thus contribute to long-term variation in population trends.

AB  - The release of hatchery-reared American lobster (Homarus americanus) is used, on some occasions, as a tool to enhance depleted lobster stocks. Current Canadian lobster enhancement programs rely on the release of postlarvae (stages IV and V), which are still vulnerable to high mortality. We hypothesized that larvae enriched in triglycerides (TAG) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during their development from stage I to stage IV have higher survival and growth rates. We assessed the condition, growth and survival of lobster postlarvae (stage IV) fed during their larval stages with live natural zooplankton, to maximise TAG and PUFA enrichment, compared to those fed a standard Artemia diet. Stage I larvae obtained from ovigerous wild females were cultured in the hatchery on either an Artemia or a zooplankton diet until stage IV (7 d old), when they were transferred to the field (i) individually in small boxes for 3 months or (ii) communally in large enclosures for 3-4 months to assess survival and growth in situ. Our results show that a diet of natural zooplankton significantly increases the TAG and PUFA content of larvae compared to a diet of live Artemia. Stage IV lobsters fed natural zooplankton had a better condition index (TAG/ST) and a higher activity of the enzyme regulating osmoregulation than those fed Artemia. Larvae fed zooplankton had a significantly higher growth rate than larvae fed Artemia, (655 vs 507 mu m dry mass d(-1), respectively). Despite these differences, survival was similar for both diets, in the hatchery as well as in situ, in predator-free situations. Nevertheless, a higher growth rate may be a potential survival advantage for newly released lobsters, allowing them to reach a size refuge from predation more rapidly. We conclude that even if live Artemia remains the best and most reliable source of live food for the production of American lobster larvae, it needs to be considerably enriched with PUFA, at levels comparable to that of natural zooplankton, to increase osmoregulation potential and growth.

AB  - Food webs in urban estuaries support valuable ecosystem services that are subject to a wide range of stressors that can degrade the structure of trophic networks. Multiple trophic pathways stabilize food webs by providing complementary diet resources for consumers but the consequences of urbanization on estuarine food webs are relatively unknown. In estuarine creeks across an urban-to-suburban gradient, we demonstrate trophic decoupling of benthic and pelagic pathways, trophic niche contraction, and increasing human health risk arising with the same factors that are associated with ecological degradation. This suggests an urban estuarine paradox-human activities often create larger volumes of deep water habitat, yet human activities also render much of this area unproductive with measurable opportunity costs to food webs. Our findings emphasize the shared consequences of environmental degradation for the ecological integrity of urban estuaries and the health of urban communities that rely on estuaries for sustenance.

AB  - Body condition factors have been used as an indicator of health and well-being of crocodilians. We evaluated body condition of More let's Crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) in northern Belize in relation to biotic (size, sex, and habitat) and abiotic (location, water level, and air temperature) factors. We also tested the hypothesis that high water levels and warm temperatures combine or interact to result in a decrease in body condition. Size class, temperature, and water level explained 20% of the variability in condition of More let's Crocodiles in this study. We found that adult crocodiles had higher condition scores than juveniles/subadults but that sex, habitat, and site had no effect. We confirmed our hypothesis that warm temperatures and high water levels interact to decrease body condition. We related body condition of More let's Crocodiles to natural fluctuations in air temperatures and water levels in northern Belize, providing baseline conditions for population and ecosystem monitoring.

AB  - King'wal wetland, at the upper catchment of Lake Victoria, is undergoing anthropogenic disturbances which degrade its health. In this study, the wetland's health was assessed using water quality parameters and wetland macrophytes, sampled monthly at five stations from November 2010 to February 2011, and the health was evaluated using the Plant Index of Biotic Integrity. Mean dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen demand were significantly different among the stations (F = 10.67, p = 0.000 and F = 10.12, p = 0.000, respectively). Correlation matrix in principle component analysis for stations and the two mean measurements were negative in stations 3, 4 and 5 with component 1 at 62.3% variance and component 2 at 33.9% variance, and positive for mean TN and TP in the same stations indicating a nutrient rich environment. Anthropogenic activities including agriculture, livestock grazing, human settlement and urbanization were the main threats to the health of King'wal wetland. The index scores at the three transect delineated areas with minimum disturbance (ST 3) and those that were highly disturbed (ST 5). However, the entire wetland can be classified as being moderate in health. Wise use and regular monitoring of the wetland is recommended to ensure maintenance of its health.

AB  - Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) produce byssal threads to anchor themselves to the substrate. These threads are always exposed to the surrounding environmental conditions. Understanding how environmental pH affects these threads is crucial in understanding how climate change can affect mussels. This work examines three factors (load at failure, thread extensibility, and total thread counts) that indicate the performance of byssal threads as well as condition index to assess impacts on the physiological condition of mussels held in artificial seawater acidified by the addition of CO2. There was no significant variation between the control (similar to 786 mu atm CO2/similar to 7.98 pH/similar to 2805 mu mol kg(-1) total alkalinity) and acidified (similar to 2555 mu atm CO2/similar to 7.47 pH/similar to 2650 mu mol kg(-1) total alkalinity) treatment groups in any of these factors. The results of this study suggest that ocean acidification by CO2 addition has no significant effect on the quality and performance of threads produced by M. edulis.

AB  - The lack of generic methods to assess the environmental consequences of agricultural practices and the lack of consensus on monitoring and evaluation of environmental, agricultural and socio-economic effects of agri-environment schemes (AES) in EU Member States call for better evaluation methods. The 'Agri-environmental Footprint' project proposed to deal with these problems by establishing a new evaluation method, the Agri-Environmental Footprint Index (AFI). The AFI is an index customised to local stakeholder preferences, using expert knowledge for assessment of impacts and sensitivity, and indicators of the environmental state at farm level. In a Danish test case, agricultural practices at twenty-five farms in two groundwater protection zones were assessed. Data was collected from databases, registers, maps and interviews with farmers. The index was calculated for 1996/7 and 2006/7 to track temporal development and effects of entering an agri-environmental scheme. The Danish case demonstrated that the index can be used to track changes in environmental impacts and that entering agri-environmental scheme had a positive impact on the index value. However, the index should be used with caution. It is important to consider the robustness of each indicator: to assess whether changes will occur over time; whether changes are linked to management practices or external factors; and whether data are available up to date. Indicators dependent upon uptake data from agri-environmental schemes should be used with great caution. Retrospective use of stakeholder preferences is subject to uncertainty because preferences may have changed over time.

AB  - This field study assessed water quality of Salado River basin by using a set of biomarkers in the fish Prochilodus lineatus. Multiple biomarkers were measured, including morphological indexes (condition factor, liver somatic index), hematological (red and white blood cells) and biochemical (glucose, total protein and cholinesterase activity) parameters. Besides, detoxication and oxidative stress markers (antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation) were measured in liver, gills and kidney. Despite water quality assessment did not show marked differences among sites, biomarkers responses indicate that fish are living under stressful environmental conditions. According to multivariate analysis glucose, glutathione S-transferase activity, lipid peroxidation levels and the count of white blood cells are key biomarkers to contribute to discrimination of sites. So, we suggest use those biomarkers in future monitoring of freshwater aquatic systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability of environmental systems to persist while experiencing sharp discontinuities is an issue of great importance to today's environmental managers and planners. This study quantified the relationship between land use and the total nitrogen (TN) load in a catchment using a mass balance model based on multivariate analysis. This model considered the spatial arrangement of observed data and the quantity of different land-use types to examine the relationship between the environmental improvement effects of various policy measures and the TN load in the Gyaku River basin, Japan. The distribution of the land uses was estimated from LANDSAT/TM data using ISODATA clustering. The aim was to develop concrete controls for improving the environment (i.e., an environmental improvement policy). The TN load was governed largely by the distribution of human-related factors such as industrial wastewater discharge, agricultural production, population density, and livestock density. The optimal environmental state was determined by examining various factors influenced by human activities and natural phenomena. The analysis incorporated previously published data from the early stages of stand development. First, the boundaries of the self-governing bodies that would enforce the proposed measures were located on maps of the environment and settlements in the study catchment. A proposed plan was then developed based on concrete procedures. The study catchment contained a predominantly agricultural area and an urban area. Thus the environmental improvement policy had to consider both urban and rural characteristics of the catchment. The qualitative effects of various measures and combinations of measures were simulated, considering inflows and outflows from both the agricultural and urban areas. This study is particularly useful because many visible aspects of Japanese environmental management are not those that rationally based paradigms of decision making would associate with environmental improvement and resilience.

AB  - Starting from the internal and external conditions of promoting community residents' sports participation, this paper analyses the significance of the establishment of community sports living environment index system by using the methods of literature, Delphi and mathematical statistics. From the perspective of using sports to seek community development and construction, this paper systematically constructs the evaluation framework of sports human settlement environment according to the relevant theories of space sociology. The experimental results show that it is an effective way to develop community sports through market mechanism by setting the gymnasium in the central area of the community so as to improve the quality of the community. The concept of sports human settlement environment has extensive extrapolation. The obstacle of its popularisation is not the increase of real estate development cost, but the lack of understanding of this concept and the lack or imperfection of corresponding sports public policies. The results of this study provide a certain reference value for the construction of existing community sports facilities.

AB  - Elevated frequencies of abnormal embryos in female eelpout Zoarces viviparus have been demonstrated in Danish, Swedish and German monitoring programmes at certain geographic locations with high levels of anthropogenic input. Pollutants present in areas with high malformation frequencies were selected and tested in a controlled laboratory experiment for their potential to induce abnormalities among eelpout embryos upon injection into pregnant eelpout. Tributyltin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pyrene, nonylphenol, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromophenylether and heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid were tested, either individually or combined. Generally, the chemicals were transferred to eggs and/or embryos. Some of the exposures increased the proportion of broods with more than 10% abnormal or 5% malformed embryos, although the average percentages of abnormal development were not affected. Spinal, cranial and eye deformities were evident, similarly to what is seen in nature. Some of the exposures resulted in increased percentages of females with as well a low reproductive capacity as embryos with a low condition index. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Information on allometry, condition indices (CIs), and biometric traits (BTs) of marine bivalves are necessary for determining the growth pattern and the size at which harvest can be intensified to maximize production in aquaculture. These parameters of marine bivalves are largely regulated by the complex interactive effects of various ecological and physiological factors. Therefore, the present study aimed to apply an integrated multivariate approach to explore a comprehensive knowledge about how allometry, condition indices (CIs) and BTs are interlinked with various eco-physiological factors of cultured green mussel (Perna viridis), with a particular focus on the effect of seasonality. Six selected length-weight dimensions (shell length, shell width and shell height against total weight and soft tissue weight) were proved to be positively correlated with negative allometric relation (slope 3) by regression analysis in male, female and sexually undifferentiated individuals. Linear discriminant function analysis (LDFA) displayed that CIs and BTs of green mussel were not differentiated by the sex, rather evidenced a pronounced discrimination by the seasonality and reproductive cycle. The correlation analysis demonstrated that different CIs and BTs were significantly correlated with different ecological factors, ingested plankton and gonadosomatic index (GSI) of the green mussel. Taken together all datasets, the principal component analysis (PCA) showed that seasonality and reproductive cycle explained 60 % of the variability. In both cases, PCA analysis further revealed that CIs and BTs increased with the increase of salinity, dissolved oxygen, food availability, plankton ingestion and GSI value, while they decreased with the increase of temperature, current speed and turbidity. Thus, our results clearly demonstrated that CIs and BTs of the green mussel were influenced by seasonality, ecological factors, plankton ingestion and reproductive cycle of the species. The findings of the present study represent a step toward a better comprehension of the CIs and BTs of P. viridis in relation to different eco-physiological factors and would be helpful to determine the ideal period for commercial exploitation, biodiversity conservation and future potential aquaculture of this commercially important species to a greater extent.

AB  - Phytoplankton is an important indicator of water quality assessment. To understand phytoplankton dynamics, many fixed buoys and ferry boxes were implemented, resulting in the generation of substantial data signals. Collected data are used as inputs of an effective monitoring system. The system, based on unsupervised hidden Markov model (HMM), is designed not only to detect phytoplancton blooms but also to understand their dynamics. HMM parameters are usually estimated by an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) approach. We propose to estimate HMM parameters by using spectral clustering algorithm. The monitoring system is assessed based on database signals from MAREL-Carnot station, Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient to detect environmental states such as phytoplankton productive and nonproductive periods without a priori knowledge. Furthermore, discovered states are consistent with biological interpretation.

AB  - To optimize the condition the conditioning procedure to obtain better larvae with lower production osts. Ruditapes decussatus broodstock was conditioned at different periods during the year [October (C1), February (C2), and April (C3)] under two different controlled temperature regimes: a constant temperature (CT, 20 degrees C) and a gradual increase in temperature from ambient to 20 degrees (GT). Samples (30 adult clams) were collected randomly every month from a control group and from each conditioning tank (three tanks for each temperature treatments). A section of the gondad-visceral mass was sampled for gonadal histology and the remaining tissue was used for biochemical analyses. Gonaldal developmental stages were determined based on the classification proposed by Wilson and Seed (1974), and fertilized eggs were reared after the method of Walne (1966). In the three conditioning experiments fewer degree-days were required to successfully spawn clams in tanks with the gradual increase of temperature. clams conditioned in October spawned in February, four months prior to spawning under natural conditions after 1,030 degree-days (D degrees) in CT tanks and 937.D degrees in GT tanks. Clams conditioned in February and April spawned after 410 D degrees and 470 degrees D when held at constant temperature respectively, whereas a gradual increase of temperature shortened this to 383 D degrees and 337.5 D degrees respectively. The most important difference between the two temperature regimes was the higher. Condition index of calms conditioned under the GT regime. The percentage of larvae that Survived metamorphosis, was higher in clams Conditioned Lit GT, maximum survival ranges from 25% in C3 at CT to 40% in C1 at GT, except for CT tanks in C2 where it was less than 10%. Results showed that Ruditapes decussatus conditioned with a gradual increase in temperature, enhanced larval production and also reduced overall hatchery production costs.

AB  - Studies related to heavy metal concentrations in coastal sediments are important to monitor and assess environmental health of estuarine ecosystems. Twenty-eight samples from Parnaiba River Delta, the largest open-ocean delta in the Americas, northeastern of Brazil were tested for heavy metals concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al and Fe), grain-size and easily oxidizable carbon. The relations of the heavy metals with sediment composition were evaluated using a multivariate statistical analysis. Sediment pollution assessment was carried out by enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF) and potential ecological risk index (PERI). The average concentrations were 0.50 +/- 0.09 mg Cd kg(-1), 6.95 +/- 2.13 mg Pb kg(-1), 19.02 +/- 8.75 mg Cu kg(-1), 23.20 +/- 5.04 mg Ni kg(-1), 33.52 +/- 6.82 mg Cr kg(-1), 43.99 +/- 7.47 mg Zn kg(-1), 165.73 +/- 86.71 mg Mn kg(-1), 2.93 +/- 0.89% to Fe and 3.78 +/- 1.17% to Al. The results indicate lower concentrations of heavy metals relative to limit concentrations defined by the Brazilian regulatory framework. The multivariate analysis reflected the binding of heavy metals to clay minerals and organic carbon. The different geochemical indices indicated sediments minimally enriched by metals and a low potential ecological risk level. Our assessment confirms the pristine conditions of Parnaiba Delta protected area to heavy metal contamination, except Igaracu channel near Parnaiba city.

AB  - The aim of the European program Life Integrated Project Environment (IPE) MarHa (2018-2025) is to restore and sustain the favorable conservation status of marine natural habitats in French Natura 2000 sites. In this context, Ecosystem Service Assessments (ESA) are carried out at various French sites including the Bay of Marseille (Provence, France). First, we applied the TRIAGE methodology: a strategic assessment of the issues with experts of the area (local MPA managers and scientists). TRIAGE raises two main concerns: (i) the intensification of recreational uses (by both residents and visitors), and (ii) the conservation of Posidonia oceanica (Linnaeus) Delile, 1813 seagrass meadows. In order to address both issues, we selected two adapted methodologies based on the strategic assessment: (i) a study oriented toward understanding the demand for ecosystem services (focused on recreational activities), and (ii) a study of the capacity of P. oceanica meadows to deliver ecosystem services using state-and-transition modeling. The objective of this work is to present the ESA process, from the strategic assessment to the analysis results. We focus on the study of the capacity of P. oceanica seagrass meadows to provide ecosystem services. State and transition models consist in defining alternative states of the habitat based on ecological indicators, identifying the bundle of services associated with each state and identifying transition vectors capable of explaining the shifts between each state. State-and-transition models can be very powerful frameworks for integrating multiple functions and services delivered by ecosystems while accounting for their temporal dynamics.

AB  - The shallow inshore areas of coastal lagoons function as nursery grounds for the early life stages of marine fish. Multi-species approaches and the assessment of several population variables are of great value in studies focused upon the ecological importance of estuarine systems as fish nursery areas. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse the spatial differences in the abundance, biomass, growth and condition indexes of juveniles from three marine species: Sparus aurata, Liza aurata and Liza ramada, in order to assess the nursery role of the Mar Menor coastal lagoon for these species. Results showed high spatial variability of the studied variables, with higher abundance and biomass values at those sites closest to the inlet connecting the lagoon with the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, there were significant relationships between the growth and condition of the fish with hydrographical circulation patterns within the lagoon, indicating the suitability of the Mar Menor as a nursery area for the three studied fish species.

AB  - Brest harbor (Bay of Brest, Brittany, France) has a severe past of anthropogenic chemical contamination, but inputs tended to decrease, indicating a reassessment of its ecotoxicological status should be carried out. Here, native and caged mussels (Mytilus spp.) were used in combination to evaluate biological effects of chronic chemical contamination in Brest harbor. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination was measured in mussel tissues as a proxy of harbor and urban pollution. Biochemical biomarkers of xenobiotic biotransformation, antioxidant defenses, generation of reducing equivalents, energy metabolism and oxidative damage were studied in both gills and digestive glands of native and caged mussels. In particular, activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP), pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were measured and lipid peroxidation was assessed by malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification. In addition, a condition index was calculated to assess the overall health of the mussels. Moderate PAH contamination was detected in digestive glands of both native and caged individuals from the exposed site. Modulations of biomarkers were detected in digestive glands of native harbor mussels indicating the presence of a chemical pressure. In particular, results suggested increased biotransformation (GST), antioxidant defenses (CAT), NADPH generation (IDP) and gluconeogenesis (PEPCK), which could represent a coordinated response against chemically-induced cellular stress. Lipid peroxidation assessment and condition index indicated an absence of acute stress in the same mussels suggesting metabolic changes could, at least partially, offset the negative effects of contamination. In caged mussels, only GR was found modulated compared to non-exposed mussels but significant differences in oxidative stress and energy-related biomarkers were observed compared to native harbor mussels. Overall, these results suggested mussels chronically exposed to contamination have set up metabolic adaptation, which may contribute to their survival in the moderately contaminated harbor of Brest. Whether these adaptive traits result from phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation needs to be further investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the influence of the reproductive cycle and environmental factors on variations of the condition index (CI), tissue dry mass, shell size, total lipid content, and relative percent of fatty acids in the mussel, Perna perna. Spat or juveniles were reared to commercial size (70 mm) in suspension culture in the Golfo de Cariaco, Venezuela between May and October 2004. The dry mass of soft tissues and shell, a visual assessment of gonadal status and the organism lipid profile were established every fortnight. In parallel, we measured the environmental conditions, following chlorophyll a, salinity, temperature and seston levels. After an initial decrease, the CI rose and remained high until August after which it decreased continuously until October. Total lipid values also decreased initially, after which they showed two periods of rapid recuperation and depletion, the first between May and August and the second between August and October. Similar tendencies were noted in the fatty acids, C18:3n-3, C18:4n-3 and C22:6n-3. Correlation analysis found no significant relationships between environmental parameters and the variations in total lipids. However, significant correlations were noted between fatty acids and specific environmental parameters. In particular, temperature was inversely correlated with C14:0, C16:1n-7, C18:0, C18:1n-9 and 20:5n-3. Chlorophyll a was positively correlated with C14:0, C16:1n-7, C18:1n- 7, C18:4n-3 and 20:4n-6. On the other hand, gametogenesis had an effect on C14:0, C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9 and C18:1n-7, while spawned and gonadal regression states had an effect on fatty acid 20:4n-6. Temperature and chlorophyll a levels strongly influenced the proportion of mussels spawning, suggesting that their influence upon lipid composition may be secondary to their impact upon reproduction. Despite the thermal stability of this tropical system, the lipid composition of mussels changed markedly during the study, reflecting the central role of diet and reproductive investment upon lipid composition.

AB  - From 1993 to 1996, fish assemblage data were collected from 309 wadeable streams in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Highlands region as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program. Stream sites were selected with a probabilistic sampling design that allowed regional estimates of stream condition. We examined responses of 58 fish assemblage metrics to physical, chemical, and landscape indicators of disturbance. Univariate and multivariate analyses of relationships among fish metrics, habitat integrity, and anthropogenic disturbance were used to develop a fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) for assessing stream condition in the entire region. Of 58 candidate metrics 9 were selected and scored continuously from 0 to 10; the resulting IBI was scaled so that it ranged from 0 to 100. Regional estimates of stream conditions showed that 27% of the stream length in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands had fish assemblages in good or excellent ecological condition. Of the total wadeable perennial stream length in the region 38% was fair and 14% was poor. There were insufficient data to calculate IBIs for 21% of the wadeable stream length in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands; all of these streams were small (watershed area less than or equal to2 km(2)) and lacked sufficient sample size (< 10 individuals) to calculate an IBI.

AB  - Along with increasing eutrophication the pike (Esox lucius) hits decreased in numbers in some parts of the Baltic Sea. We undertook a field study to identify the environmental factors affecting condition of pike larvae around the southwestern coast of Finland. We also sampled the natural zooplankton community to reveal food preferences of pike larvae. Our mixed model showed that larval condition decreased with increasing turbidity, whereas temperature, salinity and stomach content were non-significant factors. One third of the variation in larval condition was explained by sampling site, indicating that site characteristics influenced the condition index significantly. The prey selection index showed that pike larvae preferred adult copepods and cladocerans, whereas they ignored rotifers and seemingly copepod nauplii as well. Together, Our data show that food availability and several environmental factors are crucial for the condition of pike larvae, and probably also survival and recruitment.

AB  - This report examines mercury concentrations in the marine environment of the Restigouche River, near a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant operated by Pioneer Chemicals Canada Inc. (PCI) in Dalhousie, New Brunswick. The PCI plant is a known point source of mercury in the area, but the extent of marine contamination in the Baie des Chaleurs as a result of those discharges has not been recently evaluated.
   Marine sediments (five transects), mussel tissue (six locations) and effluent samples (four locations) were obtained in the vicinity of the PCI plant and analyzed for total mercury. Mussel tissues were also analyzed for condition index, metallothioneins and zinc in the digestive gland and gonad as well as gonad vitellin-like proteins and digestive gland lipid peroxidation. Results indicated that the area of the Restigouche River around the PCI plant had elevated concentrations of mercury in sediment and mussel tissue compared with local background concentrations. Mercury concentrations in sediments decreased with distance from the chlor-alkali plant. Concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.03 mg/kg at a distance of 4.6 km to 1.96 mg/kg at a distance of 20 m from the shoreline at the plant. Nine sites had mercury concentrations exceeding the CCME Interim Sediment Quality Guideline (0.13 mg/kg), the furthest of which was 1090 m from PCI. Mercury concentrations in water discharges from four of the five observed outfalls ranged from 0.84 to 4.32 &mu; g/L. Mercury concentrations in mussel tissue ranged from 0.02 mg/kg at a distance 4.6 km from the plant to 1.40 mg/kg directly in front of the plant. Condition index and zinc concentrations in mussels close to the plant were correlated with mercury levels; however, some abnormal biomarker results were found at locations far from the plant as well, indicating other sources of contaminants.
   Further studies are recommended to define the area of contamination near the PCI plant, as well as to determine the potential impact of other sources of mercury in the area. The environmental risk of the mercury contamination should also be more clearly established.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze whether a combination of biomarkers at different levels of biological complexity could be used to assess the health status of a population of Brachidontes rodriguezii associated to a harbor area in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A battery of biomarkers of general stress was measured in mussels collected from impacted and non-impacted areas. This included: condition index; shell analysis; histopathological alterations; atrophy and integrity of the digestive gland tissue; changes in cell type composition of the digestive gland, and glycogen accumulation. The studied biomarkers were integrated into the Integrative Biological Response (IBR/n) index. Overall, the IBR/n indicated a higher level of stress in mussels located in the harbor area. Thus, this biomarker index is a sensitive analytical tool that could be used to classify the ecotox-icological risk in coastal sites.

AB  - The patterns of aquatic insect diversity are influenced by landscape structure and environmental gradients that can be altered significantly through changes in land use. The aim of the present study was to verify if the patterns of diversity of the orders Odonata and Trichoptera vary significantly between preserved and altered sites, along a gradient of environmental impact. Data were collected on the structural and environmental characteristics of the stream, and the assemblages of aquatic insects at seven sampling points in a Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone of northeastern Brazil, in the dry seasons of 2018 and 2019. The results indicated that altered streams had higher electrical conductivity and lowest HII (habitat integrity index) values in comparison with the preserved ones, being determinant in the distribution of genera, and low pH values increased genera richness, informations that can guide management strategies for biodiversity conservation. Which supports the conclusion that the diversity of aquatic insects is determined by the influence of environmental filters in the streams.

AB  - Mussels' health as indicated by the survival time of 50% of sampled animals (LT50) when maintained in air at 15 degreesC was examined at three sites in Halifax Harbour with expected differing levels of contamination. Condition and gonad indices, lipid content and the body burden of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) were compared with this stress response in 60 groups of mussels covering two species. At each sampling time, the bioaccurtiulation of PACs, lipid content and condition indices were higher whithin Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus displaying shorter survival than at the other sites. M. edulis was generally more tolerant than M. trossulus (for n = 11, LT50 of 9.3 and 7.9 days), with indications of shorter and later gonad development in M. trossulus. Minimum and maximum tolerance was apparent in June and October (LT50 spanning 3-14 days), respectively. Our results indicate that the stress on stress response provides a simple and sensitive indicator of environmental health, which could be integrated with mussel watch studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hamilton Harbour is a large (21 km 2) protected harbour located at the western end of Lake Ontario that was designated as an Area of Concern in 1985 by the International Joint Commission. As part of the designation, the fish community was deemed "impaired." One of the long-term goals of the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan is to rehabilitate the fishery to a state, at least in part, to what it was prior to the degrading effects of industrial and municipal pollution, habitat loss, and invasive species. Since the Area of Concern designation, the nearshore fish community has been monitored regularly via a federal boat electrofishing program (1988-2013) and more recently, by a trap net program (2006-2012). During the study period, the harbour underwent significant physical and biological change which was related to both lake-wide (e.g. Dreissenids) and localized harbour events (e.g. habitat restoration). The fish community was assessed temporally using two indices of ecosystem health, the Great Lakes Index of Biotic Integrity and Proportion of Piscivore Biomass, and species-specific catch trends at unaltered sites or sites modified by habitat restoration. Early on, the fish community was dominated by tolerant species characteristic of degraded, eutrophic environments and piscivore abundance was low. The fish community responded positively to ecosystem actions during the first decade that improved water quality, increased physical habitat and reduced invasive species, but further progress was confounded by the interactions with other factors in the last decade that included new invasive species and a decline in water quality. Fish community assessments in the last decade, using both the indices found that the fish community was still impaired and dominated by non-native and pollution tolerant species. The Index of Biotic Integrity was a suitable indicator of ecosystem health strengthened by a consistent assessment with the Proportion of Piscivore Biomass index. A science based refinement of the existing Index in the future would benefit the ability to assess nearshore fish assemblages in the context of conservation goals.

AB  - The aim of the research was to test relative weight (W-r), a condition index which allows evaluation of fish well-being, as a tool to investigate the impact of the presence of non native species (NNS) on the condition of the key native species (NS) of the Tiber River basin (Italy): Barbus tyberinus Bonaparte, Leuciscus cephalus (Linnaeus), Leuciscus lucumonis Bianco, Rutilus rubilio (Bonaparte) and Telestes muticellus (Bonaparte). By means of Canonical Correlation Analysis, data from 130 sampling sites, distributed throughout Tiber River basin, were examined. Wr of NS was related to densities of NNS and to environmental variables. Moreover, the correlation between Wr of NS and density of NNS was investigated through linear regression analysis and covariance analysis. Preliminary results encourage the use of W-r as a tool to assess the relationship between NS and ecological factors (such as the presence of NNS) and to explain the changes that occur along the longitudinal gradient of a river.

AB  - A best management practices (BMPs) effectiveness study was conducted to evaluate Florida's BMPs for protecting aquatic ecosystems during intensive forestry operations. Sites were selected in major ecoregions of the state and each site was associated with a stream adjacent to intensive silviculture treatments. A stream bioassessment was conducted at each site before silviculture treatments, to determine a pre-treatment stream condition index (SCI). Sampling for the bioassessment was conducted at points along each stream, above and below the treatment area, to establish reference and test conditions. Silviculture treatments of clearcut harvesting, intensive mechanical site preparation and machine planting were then completed, during which all applicable BMPs were adhered to. One year after the first bioassessment and following the treatments, the sites were re-sampled at the same points. No significant difference in the SCI was observed between the reference and test portions of the streams that could be attributed to the treatments using BMPs. Hence, the results of the study support the hypothesis that proper application of BMPs provides protection to adjacent stream ecosystems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The three-dimensional almost "spherical" shell shape does not change throughout the life of the species, Foot length, flesh weight, shell and total weight increased at a lower rate than shell size. whereas water content of the soft party decreased with growth. Condition index showed a strong, seasonal variation. Flesh weight and flesh water content were among the body parameters examined that have a large influence on the physiological state of this bivalve. Burrowing ability of the species was examined in relation to type of sediment. Burial little was positively correlated with shell length ill all types of sediment tested. C. glaucum is a substrate-specialist slow-burrowing species and it showed a clear preference for the sediment where it occurs naturally.

AB  - This paper proposes a new ecological index based on phyloplankton (MedPTI) as suggested by the European Directive 2000/60/CE, Water Framework Directive (WFD). The index is a useful tool to verify the impacts of eutrophication in Mediterranean reservoirs belonging to different categories of the WFD. Multiple data sets were employed to develop the MedPTI index. The calibration data set included data collected from 30 Sardinian reservoirs in 1994. A list of 44 selected taxa was obtained and used for index calculation. A second dataset including 48 averaged annual values from 10 reservoirs was used. Results showed good correlation between MedPTI and concentration of total phosphorus, which was the limiting nutrient in these reservoirs. The trophic classifications determined using the index agreed with the results from the OECD probabilistic model on the same series of data. Finally, the index was included in an international exercise to compare the definition of reference conditions and quality class boundaries against indices used in other Mediterranean countries.

AB  - The estrogenic potential of sewage treatment effluents and their receiving waters in the Shannon International River Basin District (SIRBD) of Ireland was investigated. An integrated approach, combining biological and chemical methods, was conducted to assess 11 rivers adjacent to sewage treatment plants (STPs) and their possible interference with the endocrine system of feral brown trout (Salmo trutta). Hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, histological (intersexuality) and endocrine (vitellogenin induction) parameters were assessed in a sample size of 10 at each location. The estrogenic burden was determined using an in vitro recombinant yeast assay containing the human estrogen receptor (YES assay). In addition, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were quantitatively identified through a selection of pre-concentration techniques combined with chromatographic analysis at or near the selected locations.
   Chemical analysis of representative site samples identified phthalates and an alkylphenol in water and sediments in mu g/L and mg/kg concentrations, respectively. There were no significant difference in somatic indices or the condition factor between upstream control and downstream test sites, and there was no evidence of reproductive alterations or the presence of intersex in studied male brown trout. However, raised vitellogenin (vtg) levels were detected in the blood plasma samples of male brown trout at 8 of the 11 sites. Significant levels were reported at 3 of the positive sites (p <= 0.05). In one particular location, vtg induction was observed in 100% of the male brown trout sampled downstream. These findings were supported by the YES assay, where estrogenic activity was detected in the same upstream and downstream sites giving 17 beta-estradiol equivalency factor (EEF) values of up to 2.67 ng/L This study represents an integrated assessment approach, confirming the presence of estrogens in rivers of the SIRBD of Ireland, thus suggesting a cause-effect relationship to prolonged EDC-exposure in fish.

AB  - The distribution, population structure, condition and gonad indices, and the attachment strengths of the invasive Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis are described from the Knysna Estuary, South Africa. Mussels were found in the rocky intertidal at the mouth of the estuary and on all man-made hard substrata as far as 12km from the mouth in 2013. However, mussel beds were found only in the lower reach of the estuary, where mussel densities were as high as 120 per 0.01m(2). When compared to mussels from the embayment regions of the estuary, those at the estuary mouth, where wave action was high, were generally smaller, had significantly lower condition and gonad indices, and greater attachment strength. This suggests that mussels within the sheltered regions of the estuary invest more energy in growth and reproduction, and that this is one reason for their success as an invasive species in the Knysna estuarine embayment.

AB  - Attaining sustainable development and cleaner production is a major challenge both for developed and developing economies; income, institutional regulations, institutional quality and international trade are the key determinants of environmental externalities. The current work attempts to study the role of environmental taxes and regulations on renewable energy generation for developed economies. For that, the authors have used the annual dataset for the period 1994 to 2018. More specifically, the study investigates the impacts of environmental taxes, environment-related technologies and the environmental policy stringency index on renewable electricity generation in 29 developed countries. Given the short available data of these countries, the authors have developed panel cointegration and panel regressions models (fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), quantile regressions). The heterogeneous panel empirics stated that environmental regulations and income level support renewable electricity generation. The conclusions further mention that bureaucratic qualities such as decision making and trade openness tend to reduce renewable energy generation. The empirical findings allowed us to draw new narrative and implications. Overall, the conclusions argue that innovative regulations and policies can be useful for attaining specific sustainable development goals (e.g., SDG-7: cleaner and cheap energy).

AB  - On the basis of our own data and that of the literature, the sanitary-hygienic, bioindicative and medico-demographic approaches to the formation of criteria for the ecological assessment of the state of the territory were investigated. The low effectiveness of the application of the sanitary and hygienic direction of ecological rationing has been demonstrated shown both in the evaluation of past environmental damage and current man-made changes in the components of the environment, and in the assessment of the impact of man-made factors on public health. The health risks and the elemental status of the population were considered as indicators of chemical pollution's impact on citizens. The population health's risk of Saint Petersburg and Rostov-on-Don linked to air pollution was evaluated. The comparative analysis of data on the structure of morbidity and the elemental status of child were given for the two districts of St. Petersburg with different degrees of anthropogenic impact: Kolpin-sky and Petrodvortsovy. As a result, it is concluded that, during the assessment of ecological state of urbanized areas and identification the causes of violations of public health it is necessary to adopt an integrated approach, including a number of additional criteria: the health risk and the elemental status of the population.

AB  - Karr's Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was applied in north central Iowa streams to examine the technique's utility for measuring environmental quality in agriculturally-influenced streams and to develop methodological improvement. During 1988 and 1989, fish were collected in the Boone River and Lizard Creek systems, and physical and chemical measurements of stream environmental conditions were taken. A modified two-step procedure was proposed for establishing the scoring standard of the 12 IBI metrics. First, a simple linear regression relationship of the metric variable on log drainage area was calculated (p = 0.1). If a significant correlation was found, a Maximum-Species-Richness Line (MSRL) was determined by calculating the 95% Y-intercept as its intercept, and then plotted by the original regression slope. If a nonsignificant relationship was obtained, the upper and lower 5% data points were deleted to define the upper and lower boundaries of the remaining points with horizontal lines. Finally, the area below the calculated 95% MSRL and the area between the two horizontal lines were equally trisected into above average (5 point), average (3 point), and below average (1 point) categories. After the scoring criteria were established, the IBI value of each sampling site in Boone River and Lizard Creek systems was calculated.
   The new scoring procedure resolved the problem of the commonly adopted ''eye-fit'' method through generating only a single MSRL for a given data set. In Lizard Creek, IBI results were generally consistent with evaluations of physical and chemical environmental quality. During the drought period, variations of IBI scores reflected the dynamics of environmental conditions in the sampling sites. Additionally, the IBI showed greater temporal consistency than another commonly used analytical tool, the Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index. Thus, the new scoring procedure seems to advance the effectiveness of IBI in assessing the environment quality of lotic waters. Numerical species metrics associated with species diversity were more important than proportional ones in contributing to the IBI. Drought conditions throughout the study period influenced some of the data and analytical results.

AB  - Trends in food security and environmental protection are usually reported separately and at national level, which may be a great limitation to the assessment of regional policies seeking to improve food self-sufficiency, reduce poverty, and at the same time conserve biodiversity. In this study, a spatially explicit, quantitative index relates national and regional trends of food security with trends of land use change in Mexico. Food security was estimated through aspects of food self-sufficiency (production and consumption patterns of basic staple crops and livestock) and food access (based on the marginalization level of households). Land use change was estimated from the official INEGI Land Use and Land Cover cartography. The Food Environmental Efficiency (FEE) Index was calculated for each ecoregion of Mexico over the past 40 years based on an arithmetic count of significant correlations between food security and land use change. Trends at national level suggest a continuous environmental degradation and no improvement in food security except for maize self-sufficiency. At ecoregion level, the FEE index indicates that livestock expansion in the three most affected ecoregions is associated with a decrease in food security and that extensive cropland expansion is associated with an increase in food security in only one of them. The FEE index proved useful for the assessment of land use policies, since it can weigh regional contributions to food security and environmental tendencies.

AB  - Indicator models of sexual selection predict that the expression of sexual ornaments should be condition dependent. This is only partly supported by data, as many studies do not find positive associations between ornaments and condition. The reason for this inconsistency remains poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that environmental context may explain variation in the condition dependence of sexual traits, with stronger relationships between ornaments and condition expected in harsher environments. However, field tests of this idea are scarce. We studied 9 populations of wild red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus over 11 years, and compared the relationship between ornamentation and body mass (an index of body condition) in relation to environmental variability. We used the abundance of a key parasite in this system, Trichostrongylus tenuis, as an index of environmental conditions. We found that both ornament expression and body mass negatively correlated with parasite infection at both population and individual levels. More interestingly, we found that the relationship between ornamentation and body mass was stronger in populations with high parasite infection levels. Our findings support the idea that the condition dependence of secondary sexual ornaments varies in relation to environmental context. In sites and years when parasites are abundant, sexual ornaments provide better signals of condition.

AB  - The health impacts of simultaneous exposure to multiple adverse environmental factors are of concern in the United Kingdom. UK-wide indicators exist, but context-specific finer resolution measures are lacking. An environmental deprivation index was developed for 398 neighborhoods (average population = 760) in a Scottish council area, including measures of air pollution, noise pollution, traffic environment, undesirable land uses, and crime. Adverse environmental conditions were related to ill health in the region and implicated in wider socioeconomic health inequalities. The results suggest an independent role for environmental deprivation in explaining poor health and health inequalities.

AB  - As efforts intensify to address the issues of declining water quality and biodiversity losses in freshwater ecosystems, there have been great demands for effective methods of evaluating aquatic ecosystem health. In this study, benthic algae assemblages and water quality variables were analyzed to develop a benthic diatom-based index of biotic integrity (BD-IBI) for assessment of the aquatic environment in the upper Han River (China). Through the use of multivariate and multimetric approaches, four metrics - % prostrate individuals, % Amphora individuals, %polysaprob species, and diatom-based eutrophication/pollution index (EPI-D) - were identified from 98 candidate metrics to develop a BD-IBI. Application of the index revealed that water quality in 11% of the 31 sampled sites could be described as excellent condition, in 43% of the sites it could be described as good condition, in 25% as moderate condition, and in 21% as poor condition. The assessment further revealed that the main reason for degradation of the Han river ecosystem was nutrient enrichment through agricultural land use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystems can undergo abrupt transitions between alternative stable states when the driver crosses a critical threshold. Dynamical systems theory shows that when ecosystems approach the point of loss of stability associated with these transitions, they take a long time to recover from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. This generic feature of dynamical systems can offer early warning signals of abrupt transitions. However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the thresholds of drivers at which transition may occur. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical thresholds from spatial data. We show that two spatial metrics, spatial variance and autocorrelation of ecosystem state variable, computed along driver gradients can be used to estimate critical thresholds. First, we investigate cellular-automaton models of ecosystem dynamics that show a transition from a high-density state to a bare state. Our models show that critical thresholds can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and spatial autocorrelation of the ecosystem state are maximum. Next, to demonstrate the application of the method, we choose remotely sensed vegetation data (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from regions in central Africa and northeast Australia that exhibit alternative states in woody cover. We draw transects (8 x 90 km) that span alternative stable states along rainfall gradients. Our analyses of spatial variance and autocorrelation of EVI along transects yield estimates of critical thresholds. These estimates match reasonably well with those obtained by an independent method that uses large-scale (250 x 200 km) spatial data sets. Given the generality of the principles that underlie our method, our method can be applied to a variety of ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states.

AB  - Groundwater has become an alternative water supply for various sectors of the population and the economy, and its extraction is increasing worldwide. The water poverty index (WPI) is a holistic tool that enables the establishment of links between poverty, social marginalization, environmental integrity, water availability and health. The index includes five components - water resources, access, capacity, environment and use - which are evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100. The objective of this research is to calculate the WPI by applying remote perception techniques to the environment component. Through multi-temporal analysis, we estimate the variability of soil cover in a semi-arid area of San Luis Potosi in Mexico, where the available surface water and groundwater is mainly for agriculture. The overall result for the studied area was a WPI of 56, which reflects contradictions in the management of the resource that is abundant.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has the most fragile ecosystems in the world. Over the past decades, QTP is suffering from increasing external pressures of climate change, human activities, and natural hazards, thus ecological vulnerability assessment is crucial for its sustainable development. This study proposes an objective and automatic framework to assess the ecological vulnerability in the QTP under the threats of mountain hazards, ecosystem degradation and human economic activities and then analyze its spatio-temporal patterns from 2000 to 2015. An ecological vulnerability index (EVI) is established by integrating natural and anthropic factors based on sub-systems of land resources, hydro-meteorology, topography, and social economics. Seventeen indicators are selected to reflect ecological conditions and their weights are determined by principle component analysis and entropy weighting methods. Then, the EVI values are automatically categorized into five vulnerability levels of potential, light, moderate, heavy, and very heavy to illustrate their spatio-temporal patterns across the QTP. Results indicated that spatial distributions of EVI across the QTP exhibited similar patterns during the study period at an overall heavy level. Among all the indicators, vegetation was the dominant driver for ecological vulnerability. Based on trend analyses during the study period, approximately 10.43% of the QTP, mainly distributed in Tibet Autonomous Region, experienced significant increase in ecological vulnerability, while 7.38%, mainly distributed in Qinghai Province, experienced significant ecological vulnerability declination. However, more detailed analyses showed that after the implementation of several ecological protection programs, the increasing trend of ecological vulnerability was eased and more regions experienced significantly decreasing vulnerability. This indicated the ecological restoration projects conducted by the government were efficient in reducing ecological vulnerability.

AB  - Dryland agro-ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa provide the resource base for some of the fasted growing populations today. However, rainfall variability and poor soils make these systems inherently vulnerable, and land degradation reduces their capacity to cope with disturbances. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for interpreting dynamics and resilience in such systems, where two aggregate variables, the agricultural soil water index and the ecosystem insurance capacity, are particularly important. We apply the framework to the case of the Makanya catchment in Tanzania and conclude that the studied area has moved towards an increasingly degraded state, where ecosystem services other than food have been lost, over the past 50 years. Three main drivers behind this are identified; a) institutional changes affecting strategies for natural resource management, b) increased dry-spell frequency, and c) high population growth. We suggest that the reason for the dramatic effects is that these changes occurred simultaneously, reducing the adaptive capacity of the local population. However, several trends in the area today indicate that there is a window of opportunity for positive change. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The spatial variation in the fish communities of four small Belgian rivers with variable habitat diversity was investigated by electric fishing to define the minimum sampling distance required for optimal fish stock assessment and determination of the Index of Biotic Integrity. This study shows that the standardised sampling distance of 100 m was not always sufficient to collect most species present. The required minimum sampling distance seems to be correlated with habitat diversity. In homogeneous streams, a mean sample distance of 282, 452 and 572 m is necessary to capture 80, 90 and 95% of all species present, respectively. In heterogeneous streams, these sample distances decrease to 217, 380 and 503 m. Hence, at least 300 m should be sampled to catch most species present with a single-pass sampling method. However, our results show that a 100 m sampling distance as presently used in the Flemish monitoring programs is sufficient to accurately describe the ecological quality since differences in IBI evaluation between adjacent stretches could at least for some rivers be explained by differences in habitat heterogeneity.

AB  - Operation of the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in the Hanjiang River, China, has made the environmental health downstream of the Danjiangkou Reservoir an important issue for people living along the river. This study used the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) including phytoplankton and zooplankton to evaluate riverine ecological health in an area with cascade reservoirs. Plankton and water samples from 19 sampling sites were collected along the middle-lower reaches of the Hanjiang River in Nov. 2017 and July 2018. To further verify the reliability of the P-IBI results, they were compared with the Saprobic Index (SI) and Comprehensive Water Quality Identification Index (CWQII). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to evaluate correlations and variability between P-IBI, SI, CWQII, candidate metrics, and primary environmental factors in the dry and wet seasons. The results showed that the ecological health of the aquatic ecosystem was 'fair' in status, oligotrophic, and class II (wet season)-class III (dry season) as evaluated by the IBI, SI, and CWQII, respectively. The ecosystem during the wet season was in better health than that in the dry season: based on CWQII, water quality at 63% of sites was in class III during the dry season, while 79% of sites were in class II in the wet season; and 11% more sites had IBI-A values (the mean values of Phyto-IBI and Z-IBI) less than 3 IBI scores (indicating "fair" status) in the dry season compared to the wet season. Ecological conditions were also poorer in the reservoir backwater area. The main driving forces impacting aquatic ecosystem in the study area were pollutant emissions and dam impacts. This study demonstrated that the P-IBI is a potential tool for evaluating riverine ecological health in areas with cascade reservoirs.

AB  - The article presents the results of the analysis of the connection between the intensive growing conditions and feeding of highly productive commercial pig combinations with the indices of their meat quality in the ecological aspect of the "organism - environment" interaction. It is established that the pork quality is an important complex index that determines the ecological status level of important interrelated processes of pork production, human nutrition and the natural environment functioning. It has been proved that high-producing pigs have a different level of meat quality indices under the same conditions of keeping and feeding, which is important for the improvement of ecological and technological systems of pork production.
   The conclusion is made on the need to control improving of feeding rations for high-producing meat-type pigs grown with intensive technologies, by amino acid and mineral composition. The emphasis is made on improving the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in the plant-based fodder for pigs and reducing the negative impact of residual metabolites on the ecological status of the environment.

AB  - Sustainably managing ecosystems is challenging, especially for complex systems such as coral reefs. This study develops critical reference points for sustainable management by using a large empirical dataset on the coral reefs of the western Indian Ocean to investigate associations between levels of target fish biomass (as an indicator of fishing intensity) and eight metrics of ecosystem state. These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures. Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable yield (B-MMSY). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries, we found that unregulated fisheries often operate belowthe B-MMSY, whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted fisheries were within or above this window. These findings provide tangible management targets for multispecies coral reef fisheries and highlight key tradeoffs required to achieve different fisheries and conservation goals.

AB  - The environmental audit has become a regular part of corporate environmental management in Canada and is also gaining recognition in the public sector. A 1991 survey of 75 private sector companies across Canada revealed that 76% (57/75) had established environmental auditing programs. A similar survey of 19 federal, provincial, and municipal government departments revealed that 11% (2/19) had established such programs. The information gained from environmental audits can be used to facilitate and enhance environmental management from the single facility level to the national and international levels, This paper is divided into two sections: section one examines environmental audits at the facility/company level and discusses environmental audit characteristics, trends, and driving forces not commonly found in the available literature. Important conclusions are: that wherever possible, an action plan to correct the identified problems should be an integral part of an audit, and therefore there should be a close working relationship between auditors, managers, and employees, and that the first audits will generally be more difficult, time consuming, and expensive than subsequent audits. Section two looks at environmental audits in the broader context and discusses the relationship between environmental audits and three other environmental information gathering/analysis tools: environmental impact assessments, state of the environment reports, and new systems of national accounts. The argument is made that the information collected by environmental audits and environmental impact assessments at the facility/company level can be used as the bases for regional and national state of the environment reports and new systems of national accounts.

AB  - The main purpose of spreading the concept of "smart" state regulation to the environment area is natural protection for future generations. A special place in the solution of problems of environmental sustainability, environmental protection and nature management belongs to legal means, and norm-setting in this area should be outstripping in nature.
   Important legal acts have already been adopted to address environmental problems, the central one being the development of the list of "best available technologies", and their implementation will make a significant step in achieving sanitary standards of harmful environmental impact indicators. At the same time, the change of Russia's main environmental indexes show an increase in the negative impact on the environment and this growth will continue in parallel with the development of the economy, which requires the development of new measures of influence based on the ideas of the concept of "smart" state regulation.
   The concept of "smart" state regulation in the sphere of environmental protection and nature management is aimed at the introduction of integrated assessment procedures of decisions and allows purposeful influencing the economic activities of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs, to build as a matter of fact the individual trajectory of legal regulation of their activities in this area. Authors are encouraged to use the Assessment of the Negative Environmental Impact (ANEI) and the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) in preparing regulatory and law enforcement decisions. This allows "flexibly" to influence environmental decisions, more rational use of legal means and synchronize legal regulation with tasks in the field of environmental protection and nature management. It also helps to form an eco-consciousness in the business community.

AB  - This study demonstrates an adiabatic fiber microtaper with incorporated an air-gap microcavity fiber-Fabry-Perot-interferometer to perform superior sensing characteristics. Optical interference fringes with good fringes contrast within bandwidth of 1250-1650 nm are performed experimentally. A highly spectral sensitivity of peak power with +3.65 dB/degrees C (+9759 dB/RIU) is achieved when the device is operated under a fundamental-mode-cutoff (FMC) condition. By measuring peak power of the fringe, one can determine the temperature (T) or refractive index of environment. The proposed hybrid sensor is further applied to measure high T (similar to 1000 degrees C) of surrounding in non-FMC condition that obtains a good linearity of spectral response.

AB  - Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to monitor seasonal cytochrome P4501A monooxygenase (MO) activity (measured as ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity) in gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum). Basal EROD activity declined in midsummer but returned to postspawning spring levels by late summer. Seasonal variation in basal EROD activity corresponded with changes in liver somatic index, condition factor, and percent body lipid, indicating that seasonal variation in basal field EROD activity may result from changing physiological condition. Benzo[a]pyrene induction experiments demonstrated that, although the level of EROD activity changed seasonally, the magnitude of induction relative to corn-oil-injected controls remained the same. Kinetic studies indicated monthly changes in apparent V-max but no change in apparent K-m. Taken together, these results suggest that seasonal changes in EROD activity reflect changes in hepatic P4501A protein concentration. This study has demonstrated that it can be inappropriate to interpret EROD activity from a suspect site without first understanding how seasonal field conditions influence P4501A activity.

AB  - Metazoan parasite communities of Lepomis gibbosus (Centrarchidae), one of the most successfully introduced fish species in Europe, were studied at two isolated ponds (Knielingen, Tropfen) along the Upper Rhine in Germany. Nine parasite taxa were observed, including North American species co-introduced to Europe (ancyrocephalid monogeneans, diplostomid trematodes), circumpolar species infecting L. gibbosus in both their native and non-native ranges (bothriocephalid cestodes) and locally acquired parasitic nematodes. Both parasite communities consisted predominantly of North American species. Acquisition of local parasites was not observed at Tropfen, where the fish community comprised just two species, with L. gibbosus dominant. Low prevalence and abundance of acquired parasites was found at Knielingen, which supported a diverse fish community. At Tropfen, a high abundance of the North American parasite Posthodiplostomum centrarchi probably contributed to the lower condition index, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly observed. Due to low local parasite competency, L. gibbosus appears to have no significant impact on parasite dynamics in affected habitats.

AB  - Tyre artificial reefs were deposited in a marine protected area (Vallauris-Golfe Juan Bay, France) located along the NW Mediterranean coast, during the early 80's The potential toxic effects of the tyre artificial reefs were investigated using transplantation of marine mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis. to stations located above tyre blocks (St1, St2) or reference site (StR). Mussels transplanted to different stations presented the following sequence of mortality St1 > St2 > StR. Principal Component Analysis, taking into account metal accumulation (cadmium, copper and zinc) and biomarker (SOD, CAT, GST and AChE activities, TBARS and MT levels, Condition Index) responses in mussel tissues indicated a clear separation between the three stations St1 organisms were significantly mote affected by tyre reefs than those from other stations. Such an integrated monitoring study represents a key approach to assess in situ the biological impact of >25 year-old tyre artificial reefs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The new biotic index BENFES (Benthic Families Ecological Status Index) for assessing the ecological status of soft-bottom communities based on presence/absence at the taxonomic family level, is described. BENFES was primarily developed for the communities from the Guadalquivir estuary (South-western Spain), but the aim of the present work was to evaluate the reliability and validity of this index for its application in the Water Framework Directive (WFD), especially as a preliminary and rapid assessment method for monitoring the ecological status of transitional and coastal waters. BENFES was compared with five widely used indices (BOPA, BO2A, BENTIX; AMBI and M-AMBI) in several studies from Southwestern Spain. In addition, we have also established comparisons between these indices and the most commonly used Shannon Wiener diversity. M-AMBI and BENFES showed the best agreement in ecological status assignation and were the most useful and discriminant between the studied areas. BENTIX was a good discriminant in coastal areas but was severe with the environmental condition from estuaries; BOPA/BO2A did not show clear trends in most of the zones; and AMBI tended to provide overestimations of the ecological status. In conclusion, BENFES shows several advantages such as lower taxonomic resolution, greater reliability and only requiring presence/absence. All this implies a huge possibility to perform a simplified monitoring routine for the control of the ecological quality of water bodies.

AB  - The use of socioeconomic and cultural parameters in the assessment and biomonitoring of ecological health of aquatic ecosystems is still in its nascent stages. Yet, degradation of aquatic ecosystems has elicited concerns because of its bearing on social and economic development of communities consisting of marginalized and vulnerable groups, as well as the expenses and technical knowhow involved in biomonitoring approaches. In this study we developed a Citizen-based Index of Ecological Integrity (CIEI) for assessing and monitoring the ecological status of vulnerable African riverine ecosystems in Lake Victoria Basin, Kenya. The hypothesis is that the citizen-led socioeconomic and cultural metrics provides a more cost-effective broad view of ecosystems than other biomonitoring methods in the assessment of water resources in the developing countries. Selected rivers in the southern part of Lake Victoria (Rivers Kuja and Sondu-Mirui) recorded the highest CIEI than their northern counterparts (Rivers Yala and Nzoia) that had moderate to poor ecosystem integrities. The study demonstrates the usefulness of this approach to elucidate the source of impairment, the extent of impacts and provide a justifiable rationale to advice policy makers on developing guidelines for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. We recommend for adoption and promotion of the CIEI perspective in areas where such approaches appear defensible for the assessment of catchment-wide practices in areas with robust indigenous knowledge to provide a broad-view of the ecological health of the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - The emission of greenhouse gases continues to amplify the impacts of global climate change. This has led to the increased focus on using renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, due to their lower impact on the environment. However, the production of biofuels can still have negative impacts on water resources. This study introduces a new strategy to optimize bioenergy landscapes while improving stream health for the region. To accomplish this, several hydrological models including the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, Hydrologic Integrity Tool, and Adaptive Neruro Fuzzy Inference System, were linked to develop stream health predictor models. These models are capable of estimating stream health scores based on the Index of Biological Integrity. The coupling of the aforementioned models was used to guide a genetic algorithm to design watershed-scale bioenergy landscapes. Thirteen bioenergy managements were considered based on the high probability of adaptation by farmers in the study area. Results from two thousand runs identified an optimum bioenergy crops placement that maximized the stream health for the Flint River Watershed in Michigan. The final overall stream health score was 50.93, which was improved from the current stream health score of 48.19. This was shown to be a significant improvement at the 1% significant level. For this final bioenergy landscape the most often used management was miscanthus (27.07%), followed by corn-soybean-rye (19.00%), corn stover-soybean (18.09%), and corn soybean (16.43%). The technique introduced in this study can be successfully modified for use in different regions and can be used by stakeholders and decision makers to develop bioenergy landscapes that maximize stream health in the area of interest.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the biological responses of oysters from an urban estuary in Northeast Brazil, through the evaluation of biochemical and physiological biomarkers, and integrate these responses with the investigation of mercury seasonal contamination. Oysters and sediment were collected from three sites in the estuary of the Cear?a River during dry and rainy seasons. Biomarkers (AchE, CaE, GST, CAT, and Condition Index) were analyzed in different tissues. Hg bioaccumulation was higher in animals sampled in the rainy season, with increases varying from 5% to 136%, compared to the dry season. The changes in biomarkers highlight already elevated stresses for the organisms at the inner portion of the estuary, near the confluence with the Maranguapinho River, mainly during the rainy season, corroborating other studies that showed ecotoxicological effects with water and sediment samples. Finally, no correlation between Hg in sediment/oyster and biomarker results was observed.

AB  - The predatory action of the pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis and Farfantepenaeus paulensis) trawling fishery in south-western Brazil affects populations of some benthic species and Hepatus pudibundus is an abundant by-catch in this fishery,. Individual growth and mortality of H. pudibundus were studied by taking monthly samples for a year from the by-catch of the pink shrimp fishery in the Ubatuba region. The von Bertalanffy growth model described growth of H. pudibundus (K=2.73 y(-1), CW infinity =82.97 mm; K=2.62 y(-1), CW infinity =66.72 mm, for males and females respectively). Modal progression of the monthly average sizes was related to increasing values of relative condition index. The instantaneous coefficients of total, natural, and fishing mortality were: males, Z=7.62 y(-1); M =1.80 y(-1); F=5.83 y(-1); females, Z=7.36 y(-1); M=1.80 y(-1); F=5.56 y(-1). Length composition and mortality analysis suggest that H. pudibundus in the Ubatuba region might be overfished.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the urbanized ecological environment quality with land use classification system (artificial ecological subsystem, water ecological subsystem and continental ecological subsystem). Three land use type ecosystem combined with characteristics of urban ecological environment conditions (space pattern, environment characteristics, biological characteristics, ecosystem service) established the urban ecological environment quality synthetic evaluation index system. Based on the database, this study integrated Delphi, AHP and Integrated Eco-environment Assessment Index Method. The results showed that Beijing Chaoyang district comprehensive urban ecological quality was middle level. Water resources shortage, the total population pressure and urban green spaces shrinkage were negative factors possibly attributable to decrease ecological quality status.

AB  - Among the different ways of measuring the biotic integrity of a particular forest area, the Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA) stands out. Based on REA, an index was developed to evaluate the quality of the vegetation called the Biotic Integrity Index (BII). The measurement and accuracy of this index show how integral is the forest ecosystem at moment of analysis. The basis for efficiency in the application of BII is the correct choice of biotic integrity indicators or the variables to be measured. The present study was based from an index previously proposed for a Seasonal Semideciduous Forest (SSF), and aimed to adapt the Bit for use in an area of Dense Ombrophilous Forest (DOF) in the State of sao Paulo as well as to test its efficiency in diagnosing the integrity of fragments of a Tropical Rain Forest (TRF) inserted in a rural matrix. From the eleven indicators present in the original method, some were kept as original or adapted, some removed and some new ones were created. The adapted BII was applied in a TRF area of 70 hectares. To do so, 20 plots of 10x10m were used, within the sampling area. The results showed a variation of IIB from 28 to 47, and 2 plots recorded low integrity, 11 medium integrity and 7 good integrity. The area showed regular integrity as a whole, which was expected due to its size, agricultural surrounding and history of disturbances. The BII showed to be adapted and efficient to analyze the biotic integrity of the DOF, as it was able to show the difference of integrity between different patches of TRF. The least efficient indicators were: "litter cover" and "exotic woody species", and the most efficient were: "Euterpe edulis", "epiphytes", "gaps" and "vines".

AB  - The contents of heavy metals in spent acrylonitrile catalyst were analyzed along with the leaching toxicity characteristics under different landfill conditions. The BCR (European Communities Bureau of Reference) sequential extraction procedure and Hakanson's potential ecological risk index method were used to assess the morphological features of the spent acrylonitrile catalyst and the potential ecological risks of heavy metals, respectively. The spent acrylonitrile catalyst contained the heavy metals Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, As and Hg, and the contents of Ni were more than 7.2%. Using the sulfuric acid and nitric acid leaching method, leaching toxicity analysis showed that the Ni and As concentrations exceeded the leaching toxicity identification standard by more than 10 times and that the Hg concentration exceeded the standard value by 5 times. These results indicate that spent acrylonitrile catalyst should be identified as hazardous waste. The BCR analysis illustrated that the heavy metals in the spent catalyst primarily (more than 85%) existed in oxidizable form or reducible form and that the contents of the acid exchangeable form were commonly higher than those of the residual form. Therefore, we predict that the heavy metals in spent acrylonitrile catalyst have a high probability of leaching and considerable environmental availability. According to the potential ecological risk index values, the order of potential ecological risk for the individual heavy metals was As>Ni>Hg>Cr>Cu>Zn, and the general potential ecological risks were 382.43 and 382.07 in the two samples, which indicates severe potential ecological risk.

AB  - The aims of this paper were to survey the total Hg levels and distribution character in intertidal sediment in continental coast of Shanghai, and identify the environment factors that might influence the sediment Hg concentrations, and to assess the pollution degree and potential ecological risk of Hg in sediment. Eighty-eight surface sediment samples and 18 sediment cores were collected for Hg contamination analysis. Physicochemical properties including Eh, particle size, content of total organic carbon (TOC), and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) were also measured. Index of geo-accumulation (I (geo)) and potential ecological risk index were used respectively to assess the pollution levels and the ecological risk of sediment Hg. The average of total Hg concentrations in surface sediments was 107.4 +/- 90.9 ng/g with the range from 0 to 465.9 ng/g. Higher Hg concentrations were generally found in surface sediments near sewage outfalls and the mouth of rivers. Total Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with TOC (p < 0.05) both in surface (r = 0.24) and core (r = 0.29) sediments, but not with the other environment factors (Eh, AVS, and particle size). Geo-accumulation index indicated that Hg contamination in intertidal sediments was generally at none to moderate degree, while potential ecological risk index demonstrated that the risk caused by Hg were at moderate to considerable level. Intertidal sediment in continental coast of Shanghai has generally been contaminated by Hg, and it might pose moderate to considerable risk to the local ecosystem. The Hg contamination is related more to the coastal pollution sources and complicated hydrodynamic and sedimentary conditions than the other environment factors studied.

AB  - One of the most comprehensive tools to show the changing trend in urban ecosystems is by providing periodic State of Environment Report (SoER) for cities in national programs, wherein it is quite essential to have a truthful and realistic view of the current state of the environment as well as significant human impacts. Developing countries like Iran are faced with incoherent and deficient SoER; due to lack of data, which originates from neglecting environmental issues such as poverty, overpopulation, etc. The present study makes a comparative assessment of Tehran and Sydney's SoER in terms of sustainable urban environment indicators with the purpose of recognizing the weaknesses and strengths as well as finding the most important gaps in Tehran's SoER, which can be a useful resource for decision-makers. Results indicate the necessity of establishing integrated urban environmental management. On the whole, this paper recommends programs of environmental development and implementation as suggested strategies to reduce uncertainty and increase the reliability of SoER in the study area.

AB  - Soil erosion is one of the important causes of land degradation. Many soil and water conservation practices have been implemented in order to decrease soil erosion and prevent land degradation for a long period in Yanhe River Basin which is characteristic of serious soil erosion for concentrated rainfall, erodible soil and hilly and gully terrain. Soil and water conservation practices cannot only reduce soil and water loss but also change the situation of the land surface and influence the structure and functions of the eco-system. This study tried to quantitatively assess influence on ecosystem service caused by soil and water conservation with the index of ecosystem service value. Ecosystem service value was calculated using the data of precipitation, soil, terrain and soil and water conservation practice with the guidance of the theory of soil and water conservation science and science of ecological economics based on GIS. For the study area the ecological service value of eco-system was 13.693 billion and 24.464 billion RMB, respectively, in 1997 and 2006 in the initial state of soil and water conservation and 14.264 and 25.620 billion RMB in the end state. The ecosystem service value could increase by 0.571 and 1.156 billion RMB caused by the accumulated soil and water conservation practices in 1997 and 2006 and soil and water conservation improved the quality of environment.

AB  - We developed and tested a plant-based index of biological integrity (IBI) and used it to evaluate the existing reclamation wetlands in Alberta's oil sands mining region. Reclamation plans call for > 15,000 ha of wetlands to be constructed, but currently, only about 25 wetlands are of suitable age for evaluation. Reclamation wetlands are typically of the shallow open water type and range from fresh to sub-saline. Tailings-contaminated wetlands in particular may have problems with hydrocarbon- and salt-related toxicity. From 60 initial candidate metrics in the submersed aquatic and floating vegetation communities, we selected five to quantify biological integrity. The IBI included two diversity-based metrics: the species richness of floating vegetation and the percent of total richness contributed by Potamogeton spp. It also included three relative abundance-based metrics: that of Ceratophyllum demersum, of floating leafed species and of alkali-tolerant species. We evaluated the contribution of nonlinear metrics to IBI performance but concluded that the correlation between IBI scores and wetland condition was not improved. The method used to score metrics had an influence on the IBI sensitivity. We conclude that continuous scoring relative to the distribution of values found in reference sites was superior. This scoring approach provided good sensitivity and resolution and was grounded in reference condition theory. Based on these IBI scores, both tailings-contaminated and tailings-free reclamation wetlands have significantly lower average biological integrity than reference wetlands (ANOVA: F (2,59) = 34.7, p = 0.000000000107).

AB  - Despite the historical focus on water quality, it is becoming increasingly evident that physical habitat conditions also significantly affect lake biota. We examined associations between fish and bird assemblages and lake physical habitat based on relatively rapid assessments of Northeast US lakes. Richness of intolerant fish species declined, and that of tolerant fish species increased across regional gradients of increasing shoreline human development and decreasing abundance and structural complexity of riparian vegetation and littoral cover. Breeding bird assemblages observed in the nearshore littoral and riparian area of these lakes were similarly affected by disturbance and habitat simplification. The percentage of native neotropical migrant birds declined, and the percent of tolerant bird species increased across the same gradients. We conclude that our relatively rapid physical habitat assessments produce biologically relevant metrics useful for evaluating lake physical habitat condition and potential impacts on lake biota in regional and national lake assessments.

AB  - An objective of the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment Program (MAIA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is to develop an index for assessing benthic community condition in estuaries of the mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Delaware Bay through Pamlico Sound). To develop such an index, natural unimpaired communities must first be identified and variability related to natural factors accounted for. This study focused on these two objectives; Llanso et al. (2002) describe the index. Using existing data sets from multiple years, classification analyses of species abundance and discriminant analysis were employed to identify major habitat types in the MAIA region and evaluate the physical characteristics that structure benthic infaunal assemblages. Sampling was restricted to soft bottoms and to the, index development period, July through early October. The analyses revealed salinity and sediment composition as major factors structuring infaunal assemblages in mid-Atlantic estuaries. Geographical location was a secondary factor. Nine habitat classes were distinguished as a combination of 6 salinity classes, 2 sediment types, and the separation of North Carolina and Delaware-Chesapeake Bay polyhaline sites. The effect of sediment types on faunal assemblages was restricted to polyhaline sites, which were separated into two sediment groups above and below 90% sand content. Assemblages corresponding to each of these 9 habitats were identified in the context of widely recognized patterns of dominant taxa. Differences between North Carolina and Delaware-Chesapeake Bay polyhaline assemblages were attributed to the relative contributions of species and not to differences in species composition. No zoogeographic discontinuities could be identified. Our results reinforce the findings of recent studies which suggest that, with respect to estuarine benthic assemblages, the boundary between the Virginian and the Carolinian Provinces be moved to a new location south of Pamlico Sound.

AB  - Since the introduction of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Mollusca: Bivalvia) to aquaculture clam beds, this species has spread to several sites. As a result, an extensive fishery has developed around this species. Its reproductive cycle and that of a native clam species, Ruditapes decussatus (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from two Brittany sites are examined here and the seasonal variations in the condition index, the scale of maturation stages, the histology and the oocyte size-frequencies of both species are compared. The differences observed between the species and between sites were attributed to environmental conditions. Ruditapes philippinarum showed a more extended breeding period and a greater number of spawning events than R. decussatus. In the Morbihan Gulf, the reproductive activity of R. philippinarum appeared particularly great in terms of number of spawning events, and speed of maturation. For both species, synchronism was more apparent during the first maturation, while spawning, and particularly partial spawning, tended to decrease the level of synchronization.

AB  - We investigated the impacts of warming and elevated pCO(2) on newly settled Amphibalanus improvisus from Kiel Fjord, an estuarine ecosystem characterized by significant natural pCO(2) variability. In two experiments, juvenile barnacles were maintained at two temperature and three pCO(2) levels (20/24 A degrees C, 700-2,140 mu atm) for 8 weeks in a batch culture and at four pCO(2) levels (20 A degrees C, 620-2,870 mu atm) for 12 weeks in a water flow-through system. Warming as well as elevated pCO(2) hardly affected growth or the condition index of barnacles, although some factor combinations led to temporal significances in enhanced or reduced growth with an increase in pCO(2). While warming increased the shell strength of A. improvisus individuals, elevated pCO(2) had only weak effects. We demonstrate a strong tolerance of juvenile A. improvisus to mean acidification levels of about 1,000 mu atm pCO(2) as is already naturally experienced by the investigated barnacle population.

AB  - An important experimental observation in InGaN laser diodes (LDs), which is not yet fully understood, is that the measured mode spacing of the lasing spectra could be one order of magnitude larger than that "calculated'' from the known cavity length. The aim of this letter is to shed light on the nature of the mode spacing "anomaly'' in InGaN LDs. We have derived a formula which accurately determines the mode spacing in InGaN LDs. Our analysis has shown that the discrepancy between the "expected'' and observed mode spacing is due to the effect of carrier-induced reduction of the refractive index under lasing conditions and this discrepancy decreases and naturally disappears as the threshold carrier density required for lasing decreases. Since the carrier-induced reduction of the refractive index is expected only from an electron-hole plasma state, our results naturally imply that electron-hole plasma recombination provides the optical gain in InGaN LDs, like in all other conventional III-V semiconductor lasers. The implications of our results on the design of nitride optoelectronic devices are also discussed. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0003-6951(99)03008-9].

AB  - Cooperatively breeding American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) suffer a severe disease-mediated survival cost from inbreeding, but the proximate mechanisms linking inbreeding to disease are unknown. Here, we examine indices of nestling body condition and innate immunocompetence in relationship to inbreeding and disease mortality. Using an estimate of microsatellite heterozygosity that predicts inbreeding in this population, we show that inbred crows were in relatively poor condition as nestlings, and that body condition index measured in the first 2-33 days after hatching, in addition to inbreeding index, predicted disease probability in the first 34 months of life. Inbred nestlings also mounted a weaker response along one axis of innate immunity: the proportion of bacteria killed in a microbiocidal assay increased as heterozygosity index increased. Relatively poor body condition and low innate immunocompetence are two mechanisms that might predispose inbred crows to ultimate disease mortality. A better understanding of condition-mediated inbreeding depression can guide efforts to minimize disease costs of inbreeding in small populations.

AB  - Shellfish aquaculture represents a worldwide valuable segment of the aquaculture market, spreading along the Mediterranean coasts, and is sensitive to the still unforeseen, poorly-known effects of climate change. Threats due to temperature rise can threaten the deployment and development of this sector, up until now recognised as the best candidate to mitigate the effects of fishery overexploitation. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature increase on the model species, Mytilus galloprovincialis, measuring outcomes from valve fragility (thickness) and condition index. Evidence of a reduction in the thickness of valves and the modulation condition of the mussels along with temperature increase have been gathered from simulations of a natural temperature gradient changing along latitude (the Italian Peninsula) and temperature risen (mesocosm trial). The obtained results offer a baseline to help the next generation of managers and stakeholders when assessing the reliability and feasibility of shellfish culture in a changing sea that can generate undetected and underestimated impacts on the sector.

AB  - In Mongolia, drought is a major natural disaster that can influence and devastate large regions, reduce livestock production, cause economic damage, and accelerate desertification in association with destructive human activities. The objective of this article is to determine the optimal satellite-derived drought indices for accurate and real-time expression of grassland drought in Mongolia. Firstly, an adaptability analysis was performed by comparing nine remote sensing-derived drought indices with reference indicators obtained from field observations using several methods (correlation, consistency percentage (CP), and time-space analysis). The reference information included environmental data, vegetation growth status, and region drought-affected (RDA) information at diverse scales (pixel, county, and region) for three types of land cover (forest steppe, steppe, and desert steppe). Second, a meteorological index (PED), a normalized biomass (NorBio) reference indicator, and the RDA-based drought CP method were adopted for describing Mongolian drought. Our results show that in forest steppe regions the normalized difference water index (NDWI) is most sensitive to NorBio (maximum correlation coefficient (MAX_R): up to 0.92) and RDA (maximum CP is 87%), and is most consistent with RDA spatial distribution. The vegetation health index (VHI) and temperature condition index (TCI) are most correlated with the PED index (MAX_R: 0.75) and soil moisture (MAX_R: 0.58), respectively. In steppe regions, the NDWI is most closely related to soil moisture (MAX_R: 0.69) and the VHI is most related to the PED (MAX_R: 0.76), NorBio (MCC: 0.95), and RDA data (maximum CP is 89%), exhibiting the most consistency with RDA spatial distribution. In desert steppe areas, the vegetation condition index (VCI) correlates best with NorBio (MAX_R: 0.92), soil moisture (MAX_R: 0.61), and RDA spatial distribution, while TCI correlates best with the PED (MAX_R: 0.75) and the RDA data (maximum CP is 79%). The VHI is a combination of constructed VCI and TCI, and can be used instead of them. Finally, the mode method was adopted to identify appropriate drought indices. The best two indices (VHI and NDWI) can be utilized to develop a combination drought model for accurately monitoring and quantifying drought in the future. Additionally, the new framework can be adopted to investigate and analyze the suitability of satellite-derived drought indices and determine the most appropriate index/indices for other countries or areas.

AB  - Ecological monitoring of streams has frequently focused on measures describing the taxonomic, and sometimes functional, alpha diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs) within a single sampled community. However, as many ecological processes effectively link BMI stream communities there is a need to describe groups of communities using measures of regional diversity. Here we demonstrate a role for incorporating both a traditional pairwise measure of community turnover, beta diversity, in assessing community health as well as zeta diversity, a more generalized framework for describing similarity between multiple communities. Using 4,395 samples of BMI stream communities in California, we constructed a model using measures of alpha, beta, and zeta diversity, which accounted for 71.7% of among-watershed variation in the mean health of communities, as described by the California Streams Condition Index (CSCI). We also investigated the use of zeta diversity in assessing models of stochastic vs. niche assembly across communities of BMIs within watersheds, with the niche assembly model found to be the likelier of the two.

AB  - The reproductive cycles of Mytilus chilensis vary latitudinally. This species has reduced genetic and morphological differentiation due to its high potential for dispersal. Broodstocks from Yaldad Bay (Chiloe) and Zenteno Bay (Punta Arenas) were conditioned at 9 +/- 0.5 degrees C and 15 +/- 0.5 degrees C, and were fed a diet (1: 1) of Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros neogracile. We expected to determine whether conditioning at different temperatures produces changes in the reproductive potential of the populations. Gonadal development was lowest in the broodstocks conditioned at 9 degrees C, and highest in those conditioned at 15 degrees C, from Chiloe. Fertility was greater in broodstocks from Yaldad than in those from Zenteno. Oocyte diameter was greater in broodstocks from Zenteno, and both populations showed larger diameters at 9 degrees C. Neither the percentage of fertilized eggs nor the percentage of larvae hatching differed significantly between populations at either conditioning temperature. Therefore, it was not possible to establish differences in the reproductive potential of the populations under the conditions studied herein.

AB  - The Kiteezi landfill is the only landfill in Uganda, and it is currently facing significant environmental and sustainability challenges. The comprehensive quantification of the landfill's impact was needed to guide decision making regarding management and remediation. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the environmental impact of the Kiteezi landfill on the surrounding water bodies, soil, flora, fauna and air and to identify suitable management options. An environmental diagnosis was conducted using the EVIAVE (Evaluaci ' on del Impacto Ambiental en Vertederos) methodology with adaptation to Uganda's socioeconomic conditions and legal requirements. The results showed that the Kiteezi landfill is located in an environmentally sensitive area for surface water, groundwater, atmosphere and soils, making conservation of these elements of most significant concern in this landfill's immediate environment. All values of the Environmental Risk Index due to operation (ERIo) were higher than those due to the landfill siting (ERIs), indicating that the landfill's continued operation will create more environmental problems. The overall probability of contamination for each element was high, apart from human health and soil, which had a very high probability (>0.8). Human health had the highest (4.688) ERIo, followed by the atmosphere with an ERIo of 3.571, while flora had the lowest ERIo of 0.926. The high values of ERIo, coupled with the exceeded landfill capacity, indicate that it is not environmentally friendly to continue operating the landfill. Hence, the most sustainable course of action is its closure.

AB  - We used fish assemblage data collected by daytime electrofishing during 1996-1999 from 155 main-channel-border sites on 30 large warmwater rivers in Wisconsin to construct, test, and apply an index of biotic integrity (IBI). Our goal was to develop an effective and rapid way to use fishes to as,ess the environmental quality of river ecosystems in the state. Fourteen sites were visited more than once for a total of 187 samples, 101 of which (randomly chosen) were used to develop the IBI and the remaining 86 to test it. Prior to sampling, sites were classified as "least impacted" or as affected by impoundments, daily "peaking" flows from hydropower dams, non-point-source pollution from the watershed, point source pollution from industrial and municipal discharges (within the last 35 years), or multiple human impacts. Of the 26 potential IBI metrics considered, 10 were chosen: the total weight of the catch (excluding tolerant species); the number of native, sucker, intolerant, or riverine specialist species. the percentage of the individuals captured that were deformed or diseased, riverine specialists, or simple lithophilous spawners; and the percentage of the total weight of the catch that were insectivores or round-bodied suckers. Six metrics had different scoring criteria for northern and southern Wisconsin. For both the test subset and the entire dataset. the least-impacted sites had significantly higher mean scores and lower temporal variation than the other site classifications, indicating that they had the best ecosystem quality. Multiple-impact and non-point-source sites had the lowest means and most variable scores, signifying degraded ecosystem quality. Impoundment and hydropower peaking sites had slightly but not significantly better scores. Peaking sites on river reaches that are highly fragmented by dams tended to have lower scores than peaking sites on relatively long (> 60 km), contiguous river reaches. Point source sites had significantly better scores than multiple-impact and non-point-source sites, indicating benefits to biotic integrity from recent treatment of municipal and industrial discharges.

AB  - Biological invasions result in negative and unpredictable impacts on oceans worldwide. Non-indigenous macrophytes often synthesize secondary metabolites for defensive purposes and increased competition efficiency: this is the case of Caulerpa cylindracea, which has entered the Mediterranean Sea in 1990 and competed against local flora and fauna since. It was demonstrated that the white seabream Diplodus sargus (i) has included the algae into its diet, (ii) is subject to the peculiar Abnormally Tough Specimen (ATS) condition post-cooking, and (iii) suffers physiological and behavioral disturbances from caulerpin, one of the three major algal secondary metabolites. This paper confirms a feeding relationship between the fish and the algae, quantifies caulerpin accumulation in the liver, suggests a possible mollusk-and echinoderm-driven biomagnification, and highlights the fact that all ATS specimens were males. Multivariate analyses on a multi-biomarker panel reveals differential correlations to key cellular processes such as oxidative stress, metabolism, neurotoxicity, and lipid peroxidation as well as to condition indexes.

AB  - In restoration ecology, the transition from desired to degraded state is based solely on the composition of the aboveground plant community, whereas belowground propagules are often neglected. We developed a conceptual framework integrating seed bank dynamics into alternative stable state theory, highlighting the important relationship between aboveground and belowground composition. This integration emphasizes the role of resilience in systems that appear to have shifted to an "undesirable" state. Belowground propagules, especially soil seed and bud banks, provide buffering capacity and may serve as valuable indicators of potential resistance to state transition based on the degree of similarity between belowground and aboveground vegetation composition. Ecosystem states may have multiple components that differ in their rate of change, as well as in their capacity to promote resilience. We recommend that the application of alternative stable state theory from a management perspective should incorporate components of both above- and belowground vegetation.

AB  - Ecological barriers are the riskiest phases of the annual migrations for migratory birds. Comparatively little field data exists pertaining to the ability of migratory birds to prepare for the challenges of crossing ecological barriers, or their ability to recuperate afterward. Migrating Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) were captured in Eilat, Israel, during their spring and autumn migrations. Data on spring and autumn body masses, their inter-annual variation, and the pattern of body mass increase were analysed. The birds show a significant inter-annual variation in their body mass and body condition index in both seasons, which is consistent with the data from other sites and for other passerine species. During stopovers, mass gain occurred in both seasons. Birds in poor initial condition, and those that stop over for a longer period of time, gained more body mass faster. In spring, but not in autumn, the progress of the season was also an important factor; late-arriving birds gained more fuel faster. The average rate of fuel gain was 0,157g(.)day(-1) +/- 0.018 SE.

AB  - The effect of environmental parameters (temperature, salinity and Chl a) upon the condition, reproductive activity and biochemical composition of Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) in suspended culture in El Grove, Galicia, north-western Spain, was studied over 16 months.  Histological study of the gonad revealed two spawning periods.  The first spawn took place in June-July, coinciding with the predicted time of ripening.  Despite the low water temperature (16-degrees-C), a second spawn occurred in October, coinciding with a major phytoplanktonic bloom.  Seasonal changes in the main biochemical components of an oyster were computed for a standard animal.  Glycogen accumulation was followed by a period of gametogenesis.  Lipid biosynthesis during vitellogenesis was associated with glycogen breakdown.  High variation in carbohydrate levels during storage and gametogenic development suggests that carbohydrates are the main respiratory substrate.  In contrast, proteins and lipids are important for supporting energetic costs during winter when the available food is scarce as indicated by low Chl a levels.

AB  - The distribution characteristics, sources and ecological risk of thallium (T1) in the surface sediments of Yangtze Estuary and its adjacent sea were studied. Tl concentrations ranged from 0.369 to 1.197 mu g g(-1) with an average of 0.674 mu g g(-1), which was slightly higher than the corresponding background values. Ti concentrations were relatively high in sediments of the south bank of Chongming Island and the Hangzhou Bay mouth, and gradually decreased from inner shelf to outer seas. The variation trend of Tl concentrations was controlled by sediment characteristics, hydrodynamic conditions and sources together. The sediment flux of Ti in the study area was 428.6 t/yr. The Yangtze River, the Yellow River and atmospheric inputs of Tl accounted for 52.7%, 10.5%, and 0.15% of the total sediment flux, respectively. The result of potential ecological index indicated that T1 in surface sediments of the study area had no threat to the ecological environment.

AB  - It has been documented that in Mexico 80% of aquatic ecosystems, including water bodies such as rivers, arc under some degree of contamination. It has been detected that the main pollutants are organic matter, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) and microorganisms (faecal coliforms). Addressing this problem is of vital importance for the conservation of aquatic ecosystems and for improving the quality of life of the inhabitants of the surroundings. In this sense the lack information on the quality status of aquatic ecosystems in the Tuxcacuesco river basin in the satate of Jalisco, is very scarce and non-existent for its tributary basins. Therefore, in the present study the objective was to infer the quality of the aquatic ecosystems of two tributary basins (Tonaya and Apulco) of the Tuxcacuesco river, in Jalisco, Mexico, by using two indices. The first an index of biotic integrity based on the presence or absence of families of aquatic macroinvertebrates, and the second an index to assess the ecological status and quality of riverbanks, the riverbank quality index (RQI). Two samplings were carried out at four sites, in the month of October 2015 (end of the rainy season) and February of the year 2016 (beginning of the dry season), in which aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected and the RQI index was applied. In addition, physical and chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity and flow rate) were evaluated and the total nitrogen content was determinated in each site. By means of a canonical correspondence analysis, it was evidenced that the flow and the electrical conductivity are the environmental variables that have the greater relation with the order of the families of macroinvertebrates found. In general, the ecological status of the banks is poor in the two tributary basins, and the nitrogen content in the waters exceeds the permissible limits for potable use and agricultural irrigation. Regarding the application of the biotic integrity index, it was found that in most of the sites there is the presence of organic contamination.

AB  - A 2-year study was conducted to evaluate the ecological status of 12 acid-sensitive and 12 non-acid-sensitive Maryland coastal plain streams during the spring, summer, and fall of 1992 to 1993. An index of biotic integrity (IBI) for fish, chemical parameters, and physical habitat conditions were evaluated in these streams. Correlations of land-use activities (forested streams vs. agricultural dominated streams) and watershed size were identified in the coastal plain streams with biological, chemical, and physical conditions. These data were also used to determine if a poor IBI for coastal plain stream fish can be related to stream sensitivity from acidic inputs.
   Physical habitat was more important than water quality in determining IBI values for the 2-year period. Acid sensitivity was also important in influencing the IBI but the influence of acid sensitivity was overshadowed by physical habitat. When variation in physical habitat was accounted for among sites, the IBI in nonacid-sensitive streams was higher than in acid-sensitive streams. Initial results demonstrated that IBI values were higher in agricultural dominated streams when compared to forested streams. Consideration of only two dominant land-use types caused oversimplification of these results because urban land use (often associated with negative effects) was positively correlated with forested streams and negatively correlated with agricultural streams.

AB  - Facilitation can drive the successional dynamics and change the restoration trajectory of degraded forests. However, the relative importance of facilitation by tree species after variable retention harvesting is unclear. We used a field experiment to evaluate the effect of two facilitator species, Castanopsis fissa (C. fissa) and Manglietia glauca (M. glauca), managed with variable retention harvesting, on the development of two target species, Castanopsis hystrix (C. hystrix) and Erythrophloeum fordii (E. fordii), in a Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) monoculture. The following variables were measured for all of the four interplanted tree species: structural growth, regeneration, aboveground biomass accumulation, leaf area index, and soil conditions. The results indicate that the abundance, growth, and aboveground biomass were relatively greater in plots planted with C. fissa compared with M. glauca and that the target species performed best with 50% retention harvesting of C. fissa, with an improved establishment of both target species indicating a positive interaction. In addition, the regeneration, leaf area index and soil conditions differed between the two facilitators in the variable retention harvesting treatments because of the different intrinsic characteristic of the facilitators. In summary, our results imply that managers have considerable flexibility to employ various types of facilitation schemes coupled with different harvesting systems for successful short-term restoration within a monoculture.

AB  - Defining environmental river types is an essential step in the development of accurate fish-based methods (IBI, Index of Biotic Integrity) to assess the environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the environmental typology of the rivers and streams in the region of Chapada Diamantina was developed. Thirty-five sampling sites representative of the upper Paraguacu River and its main tributaries were characterized to characterize the fish assemblages and abiotic environmental descriptors. A cluster analysis based on fish species CPUE was performed to define a first biological typology. Then, a discriminant analysis model was developed to select the environmental descriptors that explained the fish-based river types. The model selected 11 environmental variables and classified 91% of the cases. The river typology defined in this study will be used for the development of an IBI to assess the ecological status of the Chapada Diamantina rivers. It is expected that both the typology developed here and the future IBI will provide important and useful tools to develop and apply nature conservation-oriented management schemes in the Chapada Diamantina aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Nullah Aik and Nullah Palkhu, two tributaries of river Chenab, were investigated for the assessment of fish habitat degradation as indicator of stream health. Fish abundance data were collected from 18 sites from September 2004 to April 2006 to develop multimetric indices for fish assemblage integrity and to detect the intensity of habitat degradation. A total of 12 metrics were calculated on the basis of taxonomic richness, habitat preference, trophic guild, stress tolerance and origin of species to develop stepped and continuous index of biological integrity (IBI) criteria. Cluster analysis (CA) classified sites based on species composition into three groups, viz., reference, moderately impaired and impaired groups. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was applied to identify underlying ecological gradient to highlight the habitat degradation. NMDS segregated two sites as less impaired, five sites as moderately impaired and eleven sites as impaired groups. Axes 1 and 2 explained a total variation of 53.3%. First axis explained the level of habitat impairment, whereas axis 2 indicated species richness along longitudinal gradient of streams. Sites located upstream of Nullah Aik showed higher IBI scores which dropped to its lowest in downstream sites near Sialkot city. Lowest values of IBI of sites in close proximity of city indicated the role of anthropogenic activities in catchment areas. The results indicated that variability in water chemistry can be related as a function of stream sites impairments (i.e., unimpaired, moderately impaired, and severely impaired). Water quality parameters showed strong correlation with IBI scores. Significantly negative correlation of IBI scores with COD, TDS, turbidity, Fe, Cr, Zn and positive correlation with DO and pH was found. The results can be used for restoration and future management of small streams passing through urban areas of Pakistan.

AB  - The effects of short-term (7 d) exposure to environmental hypoxia (2.11 mg O-2 L-1; control: 6.96 mg O-2 L-1) and varying degrees of shell damage (1 or 2, 1 mm diameter holes; control: no holes) on respiration rate, clearance rate, ammonia excretion rate, scope for growth (SFG) and body condition index were investigated in adult blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). There was a significant hypoxia-related reduction in SFG (>6.70 to 0.92J g(-1) h(-1)) primarily due to a reduction in energy acquisition as a result of reduced clearance rates during hypoxia. Shell damage had no significant affect on any of the physiological processes measured or the SFG calculated. Body condition was unaffected by hypoxia or shell damage. In conclusion, minor physical damage to mussels had no effect on physiological energetics but environmental hypoxia compromised growth, respiration and energy acquisition presumably by reducing feeding rates.

AB  - Eastern boundary coastal upwelling ecosystems (EBUEs) are highly sensitive to climate variability, particularly to coastal wind change. Here, we test the response of the flesh yield of blue mussels cultured in the northern boundary of the Iberian-Canary current EBUE to climate-related variables. Significant relationships were found between the annual mean, seasonal build-up and phenology of the mussel flesh yield with meteorological variables such as continental runoff, intensity and direction of coastal winds, and solar radiation. Our analysis shows that better flesh yields occur during years characterised by dry winters, accompanied by early springs and followed by summers dominated by strong northerly winds that produce intense upwelling. Compared with other EBUEs, upwelling has weakened in the study area over the last fifty years, implying an overall decrease in mussel flesh yield. However, future climate scenarios suggest that coastal upwelling will intensify over the 21th century, particularly during the summer months, which would lead to a recovery of mussel flesh yield.

AB  - Sexual traits vary tremendously in static allometry. This variation may be explained in part by body size-related differences in the strength of selection. We tested this hypothesis in two populations of vervet monkeys, using estimates of the level of condition dependence for different morphological traits as a proxy for body size-related variation in the strength of selection. In support of the hypothesis, we found that the steepness of allometric slopes increased with the level of condition dependence. One trait of particular interest, the penis, had shallow allometric slopes and low levels of condition dependence, in agreement with one of the most consistent patterns yet detected in the study of allometry, namely that of genitalia exhibiting shallow allometries.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 114, 527-537.

AB  - Spatial variation of quality of fish communities in the whole Seine basin and nearby coastal streams were examined by the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The relationship between quality of fish communities and river alteration was also studied. A trend of fish community degradation was found from the periphery to the centre of the basin and from upstream to downstream. This trend is conform with the gradient of anthropic pressures observed in the catchment. Variations in IBI scores were significantly related to water quality, diversity of physical habitat and substrate clogging. In headwaters, effects of water quality and substrate clogging were predominant, suggesting that fish community quality is first linked to land use in the catchment. Downstream, IBI scores were mainly linked with diversity of habitat suggesting that fish community quality principally depends on direct river bed alterations. Relationships between each metric of the IBI and the river features tended to show that reduction of habitat heterogeneity first reduced species richness, whereas degradation of water quality first affected the functional structure of the fish community. These results provide useful elements to develop a global rehabilitation of fish communities at the whole basin scale.

AB  - We examined patterns in Maryland fish assemblages in 1(st)- through 3rd-order nontidal streams along an urbanization gradient in the Eastern Piedmont (EP) and Coastal Plain (CP) physiographic ecoregions of Maryland, USA, using 1995 to 1997 and 2000 to 2002 data from the Maryland Biological Site Survey (MBSS). Major urbanization and other historical stressors occur in both ecoregions, and there is potential for further stress over the next 25 y as urbanization increases. We assigned each MBSS site (n = 544 streams) to a class of urbanization based on land cover within its upsite catchment. We compared observed fish abundance and species richness to the probable (expected) assemblages within each ecoregion, and also assessed the accuracy of the Maryland fish index of biotic integrity (FIBI) to indicate catchment urbanization. Relationships between urbanization and fish assemblages and FIBI varied between the 2 ecoregions. Assemblages in EP streams exhibited stronger relationships with urbanization than those in CP streams, particularly when urban land cover was > 25% of the catchment. Across all EP stream orders (1(st), 2(nd), and 3(rd)), high urbanization was associated with low fish abundance and richness, low FIBI, and few intolerant fish species, resulting in assemblages dominated by tolerant species. Conservation practices minimizing urbanization effects on fish assemblages may be inadequate to protect sensitive fish species because of the invasiveness of urban development and stressors related to the urban stream syndrome.

AB  - In this study, efficiency analyses of the eleven lignite-fired, one hard coal-fired and three natural gas-fired state-owned thermal power plants used for electricity generation were conducted through data envelopment analysis (DEA). Two efficiency indexes, operational and environmental performance, were defined and pursued. In the calculation of the operational performance, main production indicators were used as input, and fuel cost per actual production (Y) was used as output (Model 1). On the other hand, in the calculation of the environmental performance, gases emitted to the environment were used as output (Model 2). Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is the main instrument for the measurement of relative performances of the decision making units with multiple inputs and outputs. Constant returns to scale (CRS or CCR) and variable returns to scale (VRS or BCC) type DEA models were used in the analyses. The relationship between efficiency scores and input/output factors was' investigated. Employing the obtained results, the power plants were evaluated with respect to both the cost of electricity generation and the environmental effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring of marine-ecosystem status and health requires indicators of community structure and function. As a structural indicator, we propose a Phytoplankton Community Index (PCI) based on the abundance of "life-forms" such as "pelagic diatoms" or "medium-sized autotrophic dinoflagellates". To calculate the PCI, data showing seasonal variation in these abundances are plotted in "life-form space" of two or more dimensions. Data from a "type-specific reference condition" are then enclosed within a reference envelope. Comparison data are plotted into the same coordinate system, and the PCI is the proportion ( between 0 and 1) of these new data that fall within the reference envelope. Results from initial applications of this method are shown for UK coastal waters in the northern North Sea ( near Stonehaven), a Scottish fjord ( Loch Creran), and the eastern Irish Sea ( including Liverpool Bay). The Stonehaven data ( 1997-2005) were used to compare values obtained from weekly sampling with those from monthly sampling. A spatial comparison between more- and less-nutrient-enriched waters in the eastern Irish Sea (1991-2003) showed little difference in phytoplankton community structure. Loch Creran has experienced a large change in the "balance of organisms", and hence a reduction in the PCI, between 1979-1981 and 2006/2007, associated with a decrease in chlorophyll but no apparent change in nutrients. These results are discussed in relation to the intended uses of the PCI as an index of biological quality for the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and an index of ecosystem health in the context of eutrophication. Although the method only measures change, it can also be used as an indicator of biological quality if the reference conditions are those defined for a WFD waterbody, and as an indicator of health if appropriately calibrated. Suggestions are made for further development.

AB  - For the first time a hematological approach has been used to assess the status of the population of Dione snake Elaphe dione in a Protected Area (protected area "Aytuarskaya steppe" of the Orenburg State Nature Reserve). The blood formula (WBC) was calculated with the integral leukocyte indices (lymphocyte-granulocyte index, leukocyte shift index, index of the heterophiles and lymphocytes ratio, index of the heterophiles and eosinophils ratio, index of the lymphocytes and eosinophils ratio), the surface area of the main leukocyte types was measured: heterophiles, basophils, eosinophils, azurophiles, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Intraspecific gender differences were revealed for all the indicators studied. In females, the proportion of heterophiles and monocytes in peripheral blood is higher, compared with males; in contrast, the proportion of basophils and eosinophils is lower. Heterophiles, basophils, and eosinophils were characterised by moderate association with a qualitative trait (sex of the individual), and monocytes - by strong association (r = 0.82, R-2 = 0.67, p = 0.001). Morphometric parameters of male granulocytic series exceeded similar parameters of female ones. There were no statistically significant differences in morphometric parameters of mononuclear cells (azurophiles, monocytes, and lymphocytes) between males and females. A strong positive correlation was found between the content of heterophiles (%) in the blood and the ratio of heterophiles and lymphocytes (r = 0.97, p = 0.001), which illustrated the significant contribution of the nonspecific blood defence system to adaptive responses of the body. The absence of differences in the integral index of the heterophiles and lymphocytes ratio for males and females (U = 1.33, p = 0.18) indicated a comparable level of impact and identity of the physiological adaptation mechanisms occurring in the animals in Protected Area conditions. The haematic picture and the dynamics of leukocytal indexes of Elaphe dione living on the reserve territory reflected the active response of the organism to a complex of environmental factors, with the most pronounced activation of immune processes in females in comparison with males.

AB  - The objective of this study is to assess water environment and ecological risks from heavy metals of soils in Hanjiang River Basin, China. We carried out investigations on the changing patterns of spatiotemporal distribution of soil chemical elements, and further identified the changing behaviors, geochemical process and driving forces of heavy metals in soil by integrated analysis of natural environmental factors and human activities. In order to achieve these goals, we used field investigation, laboratory testing and GIS spatial simulation. The following findings were achieved. Firstly, general soil weathering in the Hanjiang River Basin basically evolves from Ca and Na stages to K stage. Ca and Na decreased rapidly, and silicate weathering evolved gradually. Major ions are subject to carbonate dissolution. About 2/3 of the soils in the basin are alkaline (pH > 7) which provide good conditions for mineralization of organic nitrogen. Secondly, specific soil weathering processes differ in spatial patterns and element transport, driven by integrated interior forces (e.g., mineral materials) and external forces (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind, and gravity). Original mineral materials are changed into soils with different physical properties (soil texture, mechanical composition) and chemical components (organic matter). Upstream original mineral materials have been transported, accumulated, and deposited downstream, driven by forces of gravity, water transport, glacial effects, and wind. Thirdly, key ecological factors of plant growth change greatly. Increase of soil humus mitigates pollution hazards and enhances soil self-purification. Land use and cover is one of the key contributors to determine geochemical patterns of soil organic matter. Intensity of mineral weathering decreases with the decrease of biomass. The comprehensive pollution index and ecological risk index increased from northwest to southeast, corresponding to increased erosive rainfall and rainstorms more than human activities.

AB  - In Central Africa, forest planning relies on a method of forest production simulation that lacks precision and is liable to compromise logging sustainability. The aim of this study was to improve growth forecasts for four of the main commercial species in Central Africa. A survey was set up in south-eastern Cameroon, covering 387 trees: 136 Assamela (Pericopsis elata), 54 Moabi (Baillonella toxisperma), 124 Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) and 73 Tali (Etythrophleum suaveolens). Their diameter was measured regularly from 2009 to 2012. Competition intensity was quantified on the scale of a circular plot with a radius of 20m around each target tree. Topographic and hydrological characteristics were estimated with the aid of a geographic information system. Growth was modelled on the basis of tree diameter and growth conditions (competition index and local environment). The tree growth figures currently used in Cameroon are identical to those observed in forests undisturbed by logging in the case of Assamela, Moabi and Tali, but they overestimate the growth of Sapelli by 20%. A log-normal model incorporating tree diameter and competition intensity produced growth estimations for the four species with a determination coefficient (R-2) ranging from 0.092 for Assamela to 0.47 for Moabi. The topographic and hydrological variables did not significantly improve the quality of the forecasts. These models may be used to forecast growth on the basis of data from forest inventories as currently drawn up for planning purposes in Central Africa, in order to improve the definition of management parameters for the four species studied, such as minimum logging diameters or regeneration

AB  - Development assistance agencies have long urged developing countries to adopt environmental management techniques used in industrialized countries. They have ascribed shortcomings in the way developing states use those techniques to insufficient training, environmental matters being poorly integrated into economic decision making, other institutional weaknesses and lack of capacity. These reductionist explanations ignore the influence that socio-political and economic factors may have on state environmental management. They afford only a limited understanding of environmental practice in the Fiji Islands, a South Pacific archipelago and republic. The attempts of Fijian chiefly elite to maintain their power base-achieved through political participation in the state and economic development activities as much as through maintaining the communal system-shape the state's environmental management practices. Those practices have far less rational and democratic bases than one would expect either from the underlying logic of the techniques used (such as environmental impact assessment, environmental planning and protected areas), or from the way those techniques are applied in western, industrialized countries.

AB  - The critical factor in restoration and conservation of urban streams and their catchments is the human population, however the most of studies of urban ecosystems do not present social descriptors as concrete variables of analysis. The objective of this study is to perform an environmental diagnosis from a social-ecological perspective by considering both ecological and urban development descriptors of an urban basin. We selected 12 sampling sites of the Langueyu upper basin where social and ecological descriptors were determined. We arranged sampling sites according to their physicochemical characteristics (pre-urban, urban and post-urban sites). An ecological index was defined from habitat and biological descriptors: vegetation cover, richness and total density of invertebrates and organic matter. The index determined that urban and post-urban sites showed similar characteristics, and pre-urban sites presented the best habitat and biological conditions. An urbanisation index was defined from urban development descriptors: distance to the stormwater drainage network, number of industries, distance to a house without sewage, impervious surface and housing density. The results showed that the pre-urban and post-urban sites share a greater similarity in relation to the urban descriptors but with different impact in ecological quality. The headwaters in the hills (pre-urban zone) still presents a very good ecological condition (although threatened by urbanisation and tourism); however, once it crosses the dense urban area, no >5 km distance, the environmental degradation is alarming. We were able to determine that the structural measures associated with greater urbanisation, added to illegally connected sewer pipes and illegally industrial connections, produce the ecological degradation of the stream. This environmental diagnosis allowed us a deep understanding of the urbanisation impact on the ecological integrity of an urban stream in a developing country which, like many others, doesn't have monitoring programs or an integrated vision of water resources.

AB  - In contrast to general industrial robots, which are operated in normal environments and are easily accessible by human workers, telemanipulators are typically designed to perform specific and extreme tasks in hazardous areas. Teleoperation systems are difficult-to-equip fully intuitive or automated control systems because these are the kinds of manipulator systems used as substitutes to perform tasks that humans have to guide directly because they may require tough, sensitive, or sophisticated handling motions. Basically, these kinds of tasks are difficult to remotely perform through a slave manipulator operated by a human unless modification and optimization of the system are conducted. In this regard, the target system dealt within this study has similar disadvantages even though it has a high degree of freedom (DOF) arm structure. The performance of the current system was quantitatively evaluated to optimize the structure according to the considered main tasks. This work presents the various performance indices utilized and analyzes the current design of the considered telemanipulator system. An optimal design approach using the parameters associated with the frequent motions of the considered 6-DOF telemanipulator is then proposed based on the conducted analyses.

AB  - This paper compares the ecological response of reaches treated with traditional (check darns, CDs) and morphologically based (artificial steps, ASs) grade-control works installed in a mountain river, where an unmodified reach provided reference conditions. Coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) retentiveness was measured at the reach scale using artificial leaf release experiments. Macroinvertebrate sampling wits carried Out by it Surber net at pool- and run-type morphological units within the three reach types, and hydraulic and sediment characteristics were measured at each Surber sampling site. In addition to calculating a variety of parameters to describe hydrodynamic and macroinvertebrate characteristics within reaches and morphological units, biotic (Extended Biotic Index, IBE) and ecological (Fluvial Functionality Index, IFF) index scores were also calculated. Results averaged at the reach scale show that CPOM retention, macrobenthos taxa richness and diversity were higher in the presence of a natural bed morphology, whereas both types of grade-control works alter CPOM dynamics and macroinvertebrate communities. However, ASs showed CPOM retention dynamics and macroinvertebrate richness and diversity that were closer to the unmodified reach than CDs. Analysis at the unit scale demonstrated strong links between hydraulic variables and macroinvertebrate parameters Such as abundance, diversity and proportion of shredders (SHR). Overall, ASs seem to provide a good trade-off between the need to limit channel incision whilst maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Communication-induced checkpointing (CIC) protocols can be used to prevent the domino effect. Such protocols that belong to the index-based category have been shown to perform more efficiently. In this paper, some results of comparing index-based CIC protocols are proposed. First, we prove that comparing several protocols based on the lazy indexing strategy can be simply based on their checkpoint-inducing conditions. Next, we show that improved indexing strategies may not always yield a better performance than the classical strategy. Finally, we present a simulation study to verify our foregoing theoretical results. The simulation is conducted in the typical point-to-point computational environment. Influences of enhancements on indexing strategies and checkpoint-inducing conditions for index-based CIC protocols are discussed.

AB  - Knowledge about the biology and ecology of neotropical aquatic taxa is crucial to establish general ecological rules and water protection systems. Based mainly on published data, the present work shows the following biological and ecological characteristics of Anacroneuria species (Klapalek 1909): a) the wide range of environmental conditions of rivers where Anacroneuria species occur, b) species number decreases along an increasing elevation gradient, c) body size increases in relation to the maximum altitude of occurrence, d) altitudinal range increases with body size, e) there is a constant relationship between male and female body size, and finally, 0 larger females lay larger eggs. In temperate countries, the family Perlidae in general, and the genus Anacroneuria in particular, are viewed as excellent water quality indicators. We suggest that, considering the complexity of the group's ecology in South America, it should not be automatically considered an excellent bioindicator in the Neotropical region.

AB  - Global change is impacting aquatic ecosystems, with high risks for food production. However, the molecular underpinnings of organismal tolerance to both ocean warming and acidification are largely unknown. Here we tested the effect of warming and acidification in a 42-day experiment on a commercial temperate fish, the gilt-head seabream Sparus aurata. Juvenile fish were exposed to control (C 18 degrees C pH 8), ocean warming (OW 22 degrees C pH 8), ocean acidification (OA 18 degrees C pH 7.5) and ocean warming and acidification (OWA 22 degrees C pH 7.5). Proxies of fitness (mortality; condition index) and muscle proteome changes were assessed; bioinformatics tools (Cytoscape, STRAP, STRING) were used for functional analyses. While there was no mortality in fish under OW, fish exposed to OA and both OWA showed 17% and 50% mortality, respectively. Condition index remained constant in all treatments. OW alone induced small proteome adjustments (up-regulation of 2 proteins) related to epigenetic gene regulation and cytoskeletal remodeling. OA and both OWA induced greater proteome changes (12 and 8 regulated proteins, respectively) when compared to OW alone, suggesting that pH is central to proteome modulation. OA exposure led to increased glycogen degradation, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, anion homeostasis, cytoskeletal remodeling, immune processes and redox based signaling while decreasing ADP metabolic process. OWA led to increased lipid metabolism, glycogen degradation, glycolysis, cytoskeleton remodeling and decreased muscle filament sliding and intermediate filament organization. Moreover, as rates of change in temperature and acidification depend on region we tested as proof of concept an (i) acidification effect in a hot ocean (22 degrees C pH 8 vs 22 degrees C pH 7.5) which led to the regulation of 7 proteins, the novelty being in a boost of anaerobic metabolism and impairment of proteasomal degradation; and (ii) warming effect in an acidified ocean (18 degrees C pH 7.5 vs 22 degrees C pH 7.5) which led to the regulation of 5 proteins, with an emphasis on anaerobic metabolism and transcriptional regulation. The negative synergistic effects of ocean warming and acidification on fish survival coupled to the mobilization of storage compounds, enhancement in anaerobic pathways and impaired proteasomal degradation could pose a serious threat to the viability of sea bream populations.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) from coal mining in the Mpumalanga Highveld region of South Africa has caused severe chemical and biological degradation of aquatic habitats, specifically depressional wetlands, as mines use these wetlands for storage of AMD. Diatom-based multimetric indices (MMIs) to assess wetland condition have mostly been developed to assess agricultural and urban land use impacts. No diatom MMI of wetland condition has been developed to assess AMD impacts related to mining activities. Previous approaches to diatom-based MMI development in wetlands have not accounted for natural variability. Natural variability among depressional wetlands may influence the accuracy of MMIs. Epiphytic diatom MMIs sensitive to AMD were developed for a range of depressional wetland types to account for natural variation in biological metrics. For this, we classified wetland types based on diatom typologies. A range of 4-15 final metrics were selected from a pool of similar to 140 candidate metrics to develop the MMIs based on their: (1) broad range, (2) high separation power and (3) low correlation among metrics. Final metrics were selected from three categories: similarity to reference sites, functional groups, and taxonomic composition, which represent different aspects of diatom assemblage structure and function. MMI performances were evaluated according to their precision in distinguishing reference sites, responsiveness to discriminate reference and disturbed sites, sensitivity to human disturbances and relevancy to AMD-related stressors. Each MMI showed excellent discriminatory power, whether or not it accounted for natural variation. However, accounting for variation by grouping sites based on diatom typologies improved overall performance of MMIs. Our study highlights the usefulness of diatom-based metrics and provides a model for the biological assessment of depressional wetland condition in South Africa and elsewhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Few studies have provided information on parasitological indexes or other ecological characteristics of lice populations that parasitize small mammals in the Neotropical region. We used lice parasitizing a rodent species, Trinomys iheringi, as a study model to investigate the effect of parasite occurrence and intensity on the body condition of rodents and the effect of climatic conditions, sex and age class of T. iheringi. We also provide information on prevalence, mean intensity, aggregation, sexual ratio of adult lice, and proportion between life stages and lice parasitizing T. iheringi. The study was conducted in Ilha Grande, an island in southeastern Brazil. We used a logistic regression to run a model of lice occurrence using climatic variables (rainfall, temperature, humidity), and then adding sex and age classes. A total of 39 T. iheringi individuals were captured with 17 parasitized (43.58%). These animals hosted Gyropus (martini) martini (n = 94), Gliricola sp. (n = 8), and Pterophthirus wernecki (n = 2). The model with humidity and sex variables showed that the occurrence of lice was negatively associated with humidity. There are more males than females infested with lice, while most of the young individuals are not infested. The higher lice occurrence in the low humidity coincides with the birth period of T. iheringi. The contact among individuals are higher during the reproductive period of the host species, but males are more suscetible to the lice parasitism due to higher testosterone levels that reduce the immunocompetence. The distribution pattern of lice was aggregated, but there was no correlation between body condition index and lice infestation intensity. We highlight that the major occurrence of lice occurs in the driest period of the year, that males are more prone to parasitism by lice than females, and adults more prone than young.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of nondestructive biomarkers approach in giant toads (Rhinella marina). We obtained blood samples and the residual condition index of toads from rural and industrial zones from Coatzacoalcos River, Mexico (COA). In the blood samples, we determined the activity of enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and the presence of cell death (apoptosis). We found that the activity of the enzyme deltaaminolevulinic dehydratase was lower. Still, the glutathione s-transferase activity and the percentage of apoptosis in erythrocytes were higher in the toads of COA than laboratory toads. Meanwhile, some biomarkers in toads showed differences when compared between Industrial and Rural zones. These results and correlations between biomarkers showed how the response changed in the toads living near the industrial zones. We demonstrate that a nondestructive biomarkers approach can be useful in environmental studies with anuran amphibians.

AB  - Biodiversity and spatial-temporal distribution of hermit crabs captured as bycatch in the nonselective fishery of shrimp were analyzed in this study from July 2010 through June 2011 off coast Santa Catarina State (southern Brazil). Ecological indexes and redundancy analyses were conducted to understand the hermit community and their relationship with environmental factors. In total, 644 specimens were collected, representing two families, five genera, and six species, demonstrating remarkable species richness in the study area, mainly because Santa Catarina is a subtropical region. Isocheles sawayai showed the highest abundance, followed by Loxopagurus loxochelis. Both species demonstrated correlation with temperature (positive) and sediment grain size (negative). The highest richness and evenness values were estimated at the deeper area (17 m). However, in 5 m deep area showed the lowest evenness because of the high dominance of I. sawayai, resulting in a lower estimated diversity. During a period of lower temperature and higher salinity (July), higher levels of diversity were registered, probably because of the lower dominance of tropical species (I. sawayai) and the presence of some species distributed in offshore regions (Petrochirus diogenes, Dardanus insignis and Pagurus exilis). Thus, we detected that the capture effort designated in the shrimp fishery activities had a strong influence in the diversity of hermit crabs and other associated fauna, especially because of catch specimens in expressive abundance at various stages of development, including juveniles. This profile makes us argue in favor of constant monitoring of bycatch resources in order to preserve the marine fauna.

AB  - Distribution and plant mass of aquatic macrophytes, and their relation to environmental conditions was studied in the submontane-colline Slatina river in 2004. Diversity of macrophytes was low, only 8 vascular plants, 3 mosses and group Algae filamentosae were found. Myriophyllum spicatum is dominant species, Fontinalis antipyretica, Rhynchostegium riparioides and Algae filamentosae are frequent. Interactions between flow class, bed material, depth of water and the first three mentioned macrophytes, as well as Jungermannia leiantha were detected. Sparyanium erectum prefers more antrophogenic conditions and Myriophyllum spicatum prefers the light. According to cluster analysis, three distinct and ecologically well separated parts of the river were identified. Based on Reference index, poor ecological status for the studied part of the Slatina river was estimated.

AB  - The analysis of various ways of agricultural land assessment is presented. Disadvantages and limitations of the soil-ecological index application are shown. The necessity of differentiation and expansion of assessment indicators in conditions of agriculture intensification is justified. The experience of agroecological assessment, typology and classification of agricultural landscapes and soils for projecting the adaptive landscape farming systems is discussed. It is suggested that this experience and the existing databases of soil research in Russia should be used to create a system of integrated agricultural land assessment. As a starting point for its creation, it is necessary to formalize the assessment requirements in the form of a register of biological requirements of rops and cultivars and a register of agricultural technologies. In accordance with these requirements, a register of models for assessing agricultural lands by their agroecological groups within the provinces of natural and agricultural zones should be developed.

AB  - It is an open question whether adverse habitat conditions, characteristic for many anthropogenically impacted coastal habitats, can determine resistance to abiotic stress in populations of residing invertebrates. We tested experimentally for differences in stress tolerance between individuals of the Asian green mussel Perna viridis stemming from the heavily impacted Jakarta Bay and from two natural sites, Lada Bay and Pelabuhan Ratu, West Java. Mussel performance under hyposalinity and hypoxia was assessed in laboratory assays by measuring fitness-related response variables, e.g. body condition index, relative shell weight, byssus production, respiration rates and survival. We found stress-specific and population-specific differences in mussel resistance to adverse conditions: Individuals from the impacted Jakarta Bay performed better under hypoxia than their conspecifics from the natural sites, whereas the latter were more resistant to hyposalinity. We explain these differences by differential acclimation to environmental conditions in the respective habitats and by diverging degrees of food supply. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil Drought and Vegetation Response during 2001-2015 in North China Based on GLDAS and MODIS Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - PRECIPITATION
AB  - Drought is a natural disaster caused by long-term water deficit. Because the growth of crops and vegetation is closely related to soil moisture environment, it is of great significance to study the soil drought and vegetation response. In this paper, the soil moisture availability index (SMAI) was developed for quantifying soil drought conditions. The effectiveness and the ability of SMAI to recognize drought events were analyzed, while the vegetation condition index (VCI) was used to characterize the vegetation status. Temporal and spatial variations of soil drought and vegetation condition as well as the impacts of drought on vegetation in North China during 2001-2015 were comprehensively examined. We firstly concluded that SMAI related well with standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and drought events can be detected by SMAI. Next, the mean value of SMAI in North China showed a decreasing trend in recent 15 years. Finally, the SMAI positively correlated with VCI in most areas of North China, and the response of four types of vegetation to SMAI differed over time. The results of SMAI on vegetation would assist drought research and application in North China.

AB  - Despite California policies requiring assessment of ambient wetland condition and compensatory wetland mitigations, no intensive monitoring tools have been developed to evaluate freshwater wetlands within the state. Therefore, we developed standardized, wadeable field methods to sample macroinvertebrate communities and evaluated 40 wetlands across Northern California to develop a macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI). A priori reference sites were selected with minimal urban impacts, representing a best-attainable condition. We screened 56 macroinvertebrate metrics for inclusion in the IBI based on responsiveness to percent urbanization. Eight final metrics were selected for inclusion in the IBI: percent three dominant taxa; scraper richness; percent Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera (EOT); EOT richness; percent Tanypodinae/Chironomidae; Oligochaeta richness; percent Coleoptera; and predator richness. The IBI (potential range 0-100) demonstrated significant discriminatory power between the reference (mean = 69) and impacted wetlands (mean = 28). It also declined with increasing percent urbanization (R (2) = 0.53, p < 0.005) among wetlands in an independent validation dataset (n = 14). The IBI was robust in showing no significant bias with environmental gradients. This IBI is a functional tool to determine the ecological condition at urban (stormwater and flood control ponds), as well as rural freshwater wetlands (stockponds, seasonal wetlands, and natural ponds). Biological differences between perennial and non-perennial wetlands suggest that developing separate indicators for these wetland types may improve applicability, although the existing data set was not sufficient for exploring this option.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the patterns of development of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates in different types of reference mountain rivers. The study is based on reference river sites surveyed throughout the mountains in Poland and Slovakia in two European ecoregions (9-Central Highlands, 10-The Carpathians). A wide range of environmental variables were estimated, including water chemistry, hydromorphology, geology, and the spatial factor. Based on the Jaccard index, macrophyte and macroinvertebrate variation was confirmed between four mountain and upland river types. It was found that the biological diversification is mainly influenced by geological and associated chemical factors. In the case of macroinvertebrates, additionally, the importance of the spatial factor was revealed (difference between ecoregions). Finally, the habitat preferences of various taxa were identified. It was found that extreme mountain conditions can sometimes distort bioindicative response, as was detected in the case of macroinvertebrates in the highest mountain sites. We concluded that consideration of two groups of organisms enables more comprehensive and reliable monitoring than assessment based on a single group, especially when standard bioindicative methods can be distorted by extreme local conditions.

T2  - EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA  - English
AB  - The floodplain forests on two model areas on the Danube river sides were studied from the aspect of their present state, species richness, structure, dynamics, and ecological conditions. To identify the deciding environment gradient the data from the parallel phytocoenological and pedological observations were subjected to the canonical correspondence analysis carried out by the program CANOCO. The forest stands were differentiated according to the content of humus and granulometric composition of the soil. The analysis carried out by the program Fytan was one of the methods used for evaluation of ecological conditions by means of the Ellenberg's indication values. Its results confirm a relatively high habitat variability and, when comparing with the literature data, also a lower humidity. The Simpson's index of diversity lambda, Shannon-Weaver's index H', species richness index R1 (Margalef) and R2 (Menhinick) and indices of evenness E1 - E3 were used for evaluation of species richness and diversity of the studied stands. The individual diversity indices fluctuated within the following limits: H': 2.53-2.66, lambda: 4.85- 5.45, R1. 3.92-4.15, R2: 2.31-2.41.

AB  - Within tropical environments, short-term impacts of increased seawater temperature and pCO(2) on algae-herbivore interactions remain poorly understood. We investigated the isolated and combined 7-day effects of increased temperature (+ 4 degrees C) and pCO(2) (similar to 1000 mu atm) on the trophic interaction Ulva sp./Trochus histrio, by assessing: i) topshells' survival and condition index; ii) grazer consumption rates, nutritional composition and interaction strength expressed as a dynamic index. No survival differences were observed whilst body condition varied significantly. Topshells under high pCO(2) displayed poor performance, concomitant with lower consumption of macroalgae. Individuals exposed to increased temperature had better physical condition, thus stimulating herbivory, which in turn was negatively correlated with carbon and nitrogen contents. The dynamic index was temperature- and pCO(2)(-) interactively dependent, suggesting lower grazing pressure under single acidification. Despite some limitations inherent to a short-term exposure, this study provides new insights to accurately predict tropical species' phenotypic responses in a changing ocean.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to (1) identify an existing water quality index methodology that could be used in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and (2) apply the water quality index to Abu Dhabi's waters to communicate water quality conditions and track changes in conditions over time. The available monitoring data were reviewed to establish the types and frequencies of data available to populate an index, and a literature search was performed to identify and review existing water quality ind in use around the world. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index was selected and customized for use in Abu Dhabi. Using the Canadian Council of Ministers Water Quality Index, two different data aggregation methods were investigated for developing a single Emirate-wide Water Quality Index score. Finally, an alternative method for calculating indices when there are fewer than four parameters was investigated. Three Water Quality Indexs were developed for use in Abu Dhabi: Eutrophication Index, Microbial Index, and Heavy Metals (in sediment) Index. The Canadian Council of Ministers Water Quality Index methodology was found to be relatively easy to use and flexible as a building block for tailored indices, which are used to communicate marine water quality conditions to various stakeholders, including scientists, managers, policymakers, and the public.

AB  - The gonadal structure and cycle of the Leguminaia whaetleyi is described for the first time indicating that 5% of this species is simultaneous hermaphrodite. A total of 420 individuals were collected in monthly samples from October 2008 to September 2009 in Golbasi Lake, Turkey. Calculation of the condition index and histological examination of the gonads showed that gametogenesis began in January. Spawning occurred between May and August with one maximum peak in July. Annual maximum oocytes size peaked in July. The population consisted of simultaneous hermaphrodite individuals. Sex ratio of L. whaetleyi was significantly different from the expected 1: 1 ratio (P<0.05), and also female biased sex ratio was recorded. In hermaphrodite specimens, male and female follicles were mixed in the visceral mass but can be clearly distinguished by light microscopy study. L. whaetleyi appears to be a dioecious species in which 25 specimens were simultaneous hermaphrodite and under certain environmental conditions may be capable of self-fertilization. This suggests that detailed studies on sex ratio of L. whaetleyi may be helpful in understanding unionid phylogeny. J. Exp. Zool. 315: 30-40, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes are managed by many jurisdictions that use a variety of survey methods and gear types to monitor fish assemblages in coastal marshes. Lack of standardization in these methods makes it difficult for organizations to compare data because of inherent biases in gear types. Of equal concern is the uncertainty of the effect of gear bias on fish-related index scores for ecosystem health. Our first objective was to investigate whether there were differences in catch data between two commonly used sampling gears: fyke nets (FN) and boat electrofishing (EF). Secondly, we investigated whether catch differences in data associated with gear biases can lead to significant differences when these data are used to generate scores for biotic indices such as the published Wetland Fish Index (WFI). We sampled 26 coastal wetlands in Georgian Bay (Lake Huron) in the summers of 2004 and 2005. A majority (73%) of the more than 10,000 fish were caught by FN; this gear also captured a greater number of species and functional taxa and selected for larger piscivores. By comparison, EF captured larger invertivores. Fyke nets were more selective for individuals from the Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, and Ictaluridae families, while EF was more effective for darters (e.g., the Iowa darter Etheostoma exile and johnny darter E. nigrum) and white suckers Catostomus commersonii. Despite these biases in catch data, we obtained statistically similar WFI scores with both gear types. Therefore, although the fish abundance and species composition information collected from FN and EF are not directly comparable, when necessary they can be used interchangeably to generate a fish-based index of ecosystem health.

AB  - In the present study, seasonal variations of metal concentrations were examined in two oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis and Crassostrea sikamea, and in seawater from a heavily contaminated estuary and a reference estuary. Strong temporal fluctuations of metal concentration were observed in oyster tissues as well as in seawater from both estuaries, especially for the contaminated estuary and for C. hongkongensis with higher accumulation ability. A closer inter-element correlation was observed for Cu, Zn, Cr and Ni in both the dissolved and particulate phases from the contaminated site, indicating that these metals originated from the same industrial sources. Seasonal variations of metals in oysters were not significantly related to their concentrations in seawater, but were related to the variations of condition index. Our results showed that the seasonal patterns of metal concentrations in oysters were largely controlled by the biological process, while the variation as well as the concentration were dependent on the contamination levels and bioaccumulation ability.

AB  - Water-based tourism has consistently been popular. However, the water environment is fragile and easily affected by human activities. Thus, the sustainability of water-based tourism is at a serious condition. Quantitative evaluation is needed to formulate sustainable development strategies and guarantee the sustainable development of water-based tourism. From the goal of the sustainable development of tourism and characteristics of water-based tourism, this paper have built an evaluation index system for the sustainable development of water-based tourism, this study used to select 18 index factors from 5 aspects, namely, economic, social, environmental, management, and development conditions. Index weight coefficients are measured through the analytic hierarchy process. And a sustainable development evaluation model for water-based tourism is built based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Empirical analysis is performed with an actual case to verify the validity of the proposed method. Case analysis shows that the evaluation method for the sustainable development of water-based tourism presented in this study is valid and provides a reference for the management of sustainable development and formulation of strategies for water-based tourism.

AB  - Assessing effects of winter habitat quality and environmental conditions on fitness of migratory birds is important to understand factors that regulate migratory bird populations throughout the annual cycle. We evaluated effects of winter habitat occupancy, as inferred from tissue stable-carbon (delta C-13) and -nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values, on nutritional condition and arrival date of seven long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species sampled at Delta Marsh Bird Observatory (DMBO, Manitoba, Canada) during their spring migration to more northerly breeding areas. Additionally, we used a long-term dataset of DMBO to assess the effect of May minimum temperature, May minimum daily temperature, and El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index on body condition and spring arrival date. A positive effect of assumed mesic winter habitat on nutritional condition and arrival phenology was detected primarily in species overwintering in the Caribbean (Palm Warbler Setophaga palmarum, Northern Waterthrush Parkesia novaboracensis). We caution, then, against generalizing the results of previous isotopic studies inferring winter habitat use applied to Neotropical migrants wintering in the Caribbean (e.g., American Redstart Setophaga ruticilla) to those species or populations wintering elsewhere and especially away from dichotomous mangrove versus scrub habitats. In general, birds arrived later and in lower nutritional condition during colder springs, and early migrants did not adjust their timing of migration to spring temperature. Early arrival was associated with poorer nutritional condition, and most species had their lowest nutritional condition during the coldest periods of migration. ENSO, probably through its influence on weather and food availability during winter, carried over to northern latitudes and affected both spring arrival date and nutritional condition.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between the AVHRR data [transformed into a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] and ecological variables and, secondly, to evaluate the possibility of estimating actual evapotranspiration using AVHRR and other readily available data.  The study was undertaken across a range of conditions in Canada.  Meteorological and composited NDVI data were compiled for 15-day periods over the 1986 growing season and were supplemented by digital ecological and soil data.  The effect of soil and meteorological conditions on vegetation growth was modeled using the Versatile Soil Moisture Budget model, which accounts for additions and losses of water from various layers in the root zone.  The various data sets were integrated using a geographic information system.  We found that individual vegetation / soil combinations exhibited different NDVI trajectories, most closely related to the trends in potential evapotranspiration.  There was a highly significant association between coincident NDVI and actual evapotranspiration values (r = 0.77) or between NDVI and potential evapotranspiration for the previous 15-day period (r = 0.86).  High correlation was found between cumulative NDVI and cumulative actual evapotranspiration over the growing season (r = 0.96).  Actual evapotranspiration for individual 15-day periods could be estimated from NDVI and potential evapotranspiration values with a residual error of about 10-15%.  The results show that the NDVI trajectories provide important information on the seasonal development of vegetation at northern latitudes.  Results in estimating actual evapotranspiration were also encouraging but further work is needed to determine the accuracy limits for this geographic area.  The representativeness of the 1986 results for the region is subject of continuing study with 6 years of NDVI data.

AB  - Background. Aquatic macroinvertebrates have been widely used as bioindicators of the response of aquatic ecosystems to human activities that affect them. Thus, their use as bioindicators is included in different protocols for the ecological assessment of streams. Goals. This study assessed the ensemble of aquatic macroinvertebrates in Dali Creek along with its ecological condition. Methods. Six surveys over seven reaches of the Creek were conducted from April 2012 through November 2013. The multihabitat method was used to collect the macroinvertebrates, and a visual assessment was used to study the state of the aquatic habitat and the riparian vegetation. Results. The results show that Aquatic macroinvertebrates are abundant and diverse, particularly at the reference points located upstream on the Dali Creek and its tributary QR2. It was found significant differences between microhabitats sampled composition (K-W p<0.05). The BMWP index displayed a condition of high quality, with "very clean water to clean" condition. Similarly, the IHF index showed that all the sampling points present excellent condition except the QR3 point. Finally, the IMEERA index revealed that the ecological status of stream Dali and QR2 tributary is very good to good; while for the sites QR3 the condition is very bad, despite the natural restoration process of the stream channel. Conclusions. The relationships between structural complexity of the physical habitat and the macroinvertebrates diversity are interesting aspects for studying streams in the Colombian Andes.

AB  - Utilization of water in different parts of industrial life cycles brings a huge concern on environmental water and wastewater pollutions. In this research, environmental quality assessment of wastewater is studied using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy appliance is due to existance of statistical considerations (including standard deviations), various uncertainties, non-linearity and complexity of functions. A Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) is developed for prediction of a fuzzy wastewater quality index (FWWQI) where four variables of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and pH are considered. To assess the performance of the proposed index under actual conditions, water quality data of refineries at South Pars Special Economic and Energy Zone, Iran, are employed in the time interval from 2011 to 2014. Findings of this research indicated that only BOD and COD were the dominant pollutants for about 66% and 34% of analyzed time, respectively, which exceeds the standards. Moreover, the time pattern for the output indices represents that FWWQI varied from "Moderate" in 2011 to "Good" in 2014. In addition, comparison of the FWWQI results with two conventional classic methodologies indicated that the proposed fuzzy method well covers the two classic methodologies. Finally, it is noticed that all three proposed WQIs exhibit correspondingly "Good" level in the year 2014. Thus, the time pattern for the parameters and indices express continual improvement as outcome of ISO 14001 and HSE-MS.

AB  - The Norway rat is a globally distributed pest, known for its resilience to eradication and control programs. Efficient population control, especially in urban settings, is dependent on knowledge of rat demography and population ecology. We analyzed the relationship between four demographic outcomes, estimated by live-trapping data, and fine-scale environmental features measured at the capture site. Wounds, a proxy for agonistic interactions, were associated with mature individuals. Areas with environmental features favorable to rats, such as open sewers and unpaved earth, were associated with more mature individuals with a better body condition index. The control measures (environmental stressors) are likely to be disrupting the social structure of rat colonies, increasing the frequency and distribution of agonistic interactions, which were common in both sexes and maturity states. The relationship between the favorable environmental conditions and the demographic markers analyzed indicate possible targets for infestation control through environmental manipulation, and could be incorporated into current pest management programs to achieve long-term success. Our study indicate that urban interventions focused on removal of potential resources for rats could be potential long-term solutions by reducing the carrying capacity of the environment.

AB  - CONTEXT: Family-run cow-calf farms based on native grasslands exhibit low economic and social sustainability, as reflected in low family incomes and high workloads. Experimental results have shown that pasture-herd interaction management could improve native grasslands and animal productivity.
   OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the extent to which the sustainability of family-run livestock farms based on native grasslands could be enhanced by a systemic redesign informed by ecological intensification practices. The research questions address the initial state of farm sustainability, key bottlenecks to improving farm sustain ability, and changes in sustainability criteria achieved over three years of farm redesign.
   METHODS: The study was executed as part of a multi-level co-innovation project in Uruguay in which a team of scientist-practitioners and seven farm families participated in farm characterization, diagnosis, and redesign. The farm characterization took the form of indicators to describe the farms' management and bio-physical subsystems. Redesign plans were negotiated between the research team and the farmers. Frequent monitoring and evaluation cycles enabled finetuning across the years of implementation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Improvements were observed in the economic indicators gross margin (+55%), return to labor (+71%), and family income (+53%) and in the social indicator workload (-22%), and the environmental indicators bird diversity and ecosystem integrity index were maintained or increased slightly. These changes were explained by the uptake of coherent sets of ecological intensification practices causing changes in forage height (+30%), forage allowance (+69%), pregnancy (+22), weight of weaning calf per mating cow (+32%), and presence of tussocks (+65%). Ecological intensification principles resulted in synergistic positive effects between productivity-biodiversity tradeoffs and the scope for enhanced farm resilience and stability.
   SIGNIFICANCE: Cow-calf family-run farms can be transformed to produce positive environmental and social effects and viable economic results. The implementation of projects in a co-innovation context may be taken as a guide to scaling up and scaling out the ecological intensification of livestock production on native grasslands, contributing to an extension system at the national level with the aim of improving cow-calf systems sustainability.

AB  - This article presents the history of large oil spills in freshwaters, considering the processes of physicochemical and biological degradation of oil. It discusses the toxicity of oil for hydrobionts and effects of oil pollution on communities of plankton, benthos, and ichthyofauna, as well as challenges in mitigating the environmental impact of oil spills. The discussion is concerned with the state of the ecosystem in Lake Pyasino before the incidental spill of 2020, specifically, hydrochemical indicators; species composition; and abundance and biomass of plankton, benthos, and fish. Candidate technologies for restoring the Lake Pyasino ecosystem are reviewed, including "bottom-up" biomanipulation.

AB  - Purpose The existing concept in the building rating scheme especially in developing countries was more focused on the environment, economic, social and culture. The new approach of the classroom condition index (CCI) assessment scheme has its uniqueness in environmental and social aspects because of high building performance in secondary school buildings. The requirements set by the Ministry of Education Malaysia include providing a conducive learning environment, especially for students who are considered as the main users of classrooms in school buildings. Currently, the school administration needs to manually record the condition of the classroom to increase its comfort level. The lack of a structured scheme for classroom assessment makes it difficult for school administration to focus on the overall classroom condition (physical environmental aspect) in the school building. The purpose of this study is to develop a framework for classroom conditions by proposing a CCI assessment scheme for a secondary school building in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach Mixed methods were used to carry out the study. The first stage of this study concentrates on developing a system for CCI that relates to physical elements in the classroom. This is done by reviewing the literature on the classroom physical performance, as well as a comparison between several building rating systems locally and abroad. The structure of the proposed CCI scheme is grouped into four main themes, namely, space management quality (SMQ), building condition (BC), indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and teaching and learning quality (TLQ). In addition, there are 12 categories and 23 indicators listed under this theme. The second stage focuses on formulating assessment categories with their relevant performance indicators. This phase undergoes a validation process by conducting a survey (questionnaire) toward the classroom's main users, which are students and teachers. This is to ensure the accuracy of classroom conditions in the school building. A semi-structured interview was also conducted among building experts. They are building surveyors, building engineers, building designers and building performance experts to support the main findings in the second stage. Relative importance (RI) index approach has been applied to show the indicators weighting and ranking are used as data collections method by using Statistical Package of Social Science software to examine the RI of each category and indicator, respectively. Findings The findings show that prominent RI and balanced weights are formed from these four main themes. They are SMQ (19.9%), BC (26.6%), IEQ (33.2%) and TLQ (20.3%). The outcome of this study will contribute to a detailed assessment scheme for CCI at the secondary school building. The contribution of the CCI Assessment Scheme is more comprehensive and holistic than the conventional assessment process for BCs. It focuses specifically on classroom space as it is the most important area to achieve a high level of comfort comparing to other spaces in the school building. This holistic approach encompasses all types of classrooms. The concept of one tool fits all is seen as no longer a relevant adaptation in this context. This proposed tool is to be used only for the classroom (as the name CCI implies) and it cannot be used for the other types of spaces, for instance, teacher room, library, meeting room, toilet, canteen and, etc. This is because different spaces represent different physical indicators to be classified.
   This, in turn, contributes to a conducive learning environment for students in the school. Originality/value This paper provides the current information, knowledge and findings related to the classroom physical indicators in developing the assessment scheme for the classroom environment. It will assist both technical and non-technical experts to clarify the current condition of classroom physical performance that ideally may affect the students' learning environment. The novelty of CCI development is not only on the adopted method but it also includes the ideas on next generation model of rating system that ideally need specific indicators and weighting to be generated into an intelligent computerized system.

AB  - This study evaluated biological integrity expectations of fish assemblages in wadeable streams for the Alabama portion of the Choctawhatchee River watershed using a multimetric approach. Thirty-four randomly selected stream sites were sampled in late spring 2001 to calibrate an index of biotic integrity (IBI). Validation data were collected during the spring 2001, and summer and fall of 2003 from disturbed and least-impacted targeted sites (n = 20). Thirty-five candidate metrics were evaluated for their responsiveness to environmental degradation. Twelve metrics were selected to evaluate wadeable streams and four replacement metrics were selected for headwater streams. Scores that ranged from 58 to 60 were considered to be representative of excellent biotic integrity (none found in this study), scores of 48-52 as good integrity (31% of the sites in this study), 40-44 as fair (43%), 28-34 as poor (21%), and 12-22 as very poor (5%). Of the four stream condition categories (urban, cattle, row crop, and least impacted), the IBI scores for urban and cattle sites differed significantly from least-impacted sites. Row crop sites, although not significantly different from least-impacted, tended to have greater variability than the other categories. Lower IBI scores at both urban and cattle sites suggest that the IBI accurately reflects stream impairment in the Choctawhatchee River drainage.

AB  - In the paper, a novel practical approach to construct a composite indicator (CI) is proposed. The key idea is to decide the weights of sub-indicators in constructing a composite indicator by maximizing the sum of squared correlations between the CI and sub-indicators. The CI obtained in this fashion has the maximum sum of squared correlations among all linear estimators. In addition, the simple, exact and explicit solutions of weights are proposed under the condition of non-negative irreducible matrix. Moreover, under this particular condition, the proposed method will become the principal component analysis. For illustration purpose, the proposed novel approach is utilized to calculate Sustainable Energy Index and Human Development Index which are two often-used cases to compare models in the literatures. The results show that the power of the proposed method outweigh the methods of Hatefi, et al. (2010) and Zhou, et al. (2007) in terms of the sum of absolute values of all sub-indicators' correlations.

AB  - Urban environments rely on the surrounding natural ecosystems remnants as providers of ecosystem functions, therefore these areas not only support a unique biodiversity but also have a social value for maintaining public health and wellbeing. For this reason, urbanization is considered to be one the biggest threats to ecosystems, leading to native biodiversity simplification and, thus, to a detriment of the provided ecosystem services. Moreover, this change in land use results in high levels of landscape fragmentation and modification in areas surrounding the habitat remnants which, in consequence, become inadequate for many native species. In this context, it is important that urban planners have the information to assess the possible consequences of future changes in land use in order to increase the landscape chances of supporting both, native biodiversity and the needs of a growing human population. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the ecological integrity of natural and semi-natural vegetation patches immersed in an urban area in order to generate a conceptual framework for landscape assessment that allows urban planners to envision the best choice for city development at a given place. To do so, we developed a quantitative integral environmental evaluation index that includes ecological characterization, geological characterization, and environmental characterization (presence of anthropic disturbance) of the assessed area. We conclude that the index we have generated in this work is suitable to be used as a management tool to allow an unbiased valuation and to identify managing situations that require a short term response.

AB  - The giant honey bees Apis dorsata and Apis laboriosa construct nests of different shapes and sizes. A method was required to compare the shapes and sizes of these nests. We developed a nest shape index (NSI). It presents the ratio of the dimension of the upper horizontal attachment of the nest base (B), to the vertical dimension of the nest (V); NSI = B/V. We examined the NSI of A. dorsata nests. The results varied; NSI = 0.6-4.7. The shape of nests under a sloped support is characterized by the inclination index (II). This index presents the ratio of the vertical dimension of the nest (V) to the dimension perpendicular to the sloped base (P). The inclination index of the nests observed by us, varied; II = 1.2-3.0. The mean shape of A. laboriosa was NSI = 0.96. The difference between the NSI of A. dorsata and A. laboriosa is due to environmental conditions. These indexes make it possible to compare the shapes of different sized nests when real nests were measured or from measurement of nests in photographs. Knowing the indexes, one may assume in which environmental conditions the nests were constructed, and may draw and imagine the shapes of nests without ever having seen them. A nest in which the NSI = B/V = 2 is a semi-circle, a nest in which the B/V < 2 is a vertical semi-ellipse, and when B/V > 2 the nest is a horizontal semi-ellipse.

AB  - This report examines the relationships between six biological indices (condition factor, fat weight ratio, gonad somatic index, body length, mean age, and sex ratio) of Japanese sardine, the sardine stock biomass, and the sea surface temperature in the Doto region. 11,707 individuals were collected by purse seine in July approximately Oct. during the Years 1978 approximately 90. In terms of yearly biological indices, it became clear with statistical test that the gonad somatic index and indices except the sex ratio should be stratified sex-wise and age- or month-wise respectively. The relationships between the indices, the stock biomass, and the sea temperature was investigated with multiple regression analysis. The multiple regression equations of the indices were generally significant. The partial regression coefficients of variables in the regression equations indicated that the indices had negative and positive relationships to the stock biomass and the sea temperature respectively. In particular, the indices at 2 approximately 3 years of age and in October showed good consistency with the variation in the stock biomass and the sea temperature.

AB  - In the era of technological change, consumers face an environment increasingly complex, leading to significant challenges regarding buying and consuming choices and consumer protection. The most important and most influential technological changes in terms of the impact on the consumer, are iduced by internet, digitization and globalization. However, the era of technological change also means developing biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, new materials and new energy sources, all these changing people's lives, living conditions, their needs and their behaviour as consumers.
   The literature highlights the factors that influence purchasing behaviour and changes manifested in terms of values, stressing the importance of promoting and protecting consumer's rights and interests, The new responsible consumer can become a key driving force of sustainable development only if it is able to capitalize on new opportunities and to counter new risks of modern marketing technologies based on the Internet and mobile communications. This involves the assimilation of new knowledge throughout life to keep up with the accelerating pace of technological innovation and diffusion of e-commerce solutions and mobile commerce.
   We study the correlation between the composite index of consumer conditions and the level of participation in lifelong learning programmes in some Member States, based on secondary analysis of the data available at EU level,. The results confirm that the consumer's situation is better in countries where the level of participation in lifelong learning programmes is higher. At the same time, however, the correlation is not linear. This shows that the consumer's situation does not depend exclusively on formal continuing education but also other factors such as timeliness and severity of legal and institutional framework of consumer protection, the acquisition of knowledge through informal means, the requirement of different customers in different countries.

AB  - The paper introduces the Ecological State Macrophyte Index (ESMI), a method compliant with the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) for assessing the ecological status of lakes based on macrophytes. A description of the elaboration of macrophyte metrics, relevant reference conditions and a classification system for two types of high-alkalinity lowland lakes (stratified and polymictic), and a customised field survey procedure based on belt transects are presented. The ESMI evaluates two aspects of macrophyte community: taxonomic composition (index of evenness J) and abundance (colonisation index Z), which are combined into one multimetric. ESMI values range from 0 to 1, where 1 denotes pristine conditions and 0, highly degraded habitats. The high/good class boundary (H/G) was set at the first quartile of ESMI values of reference lakes. For the other classes, boundaries were set by dividing the range of ESMI values between the H/G boundary and the minimum value recorded in the dataset in a logarithmic scale into four. The ESMI correlated best with water transparency (Pearson's R = 0.62 in stratified lakes and 0.79 in polymictic ones), whereas the correlations with phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were somewhat weaker (R = -0.48 to -0.57). Based on the results of international intercalibration, the original class boundaries were modified (merged for stratified and polymictic lakes, the good/moderate boundary tightened to approximately 20 %), to make ESMI-based assessment results comparable with the outcomes of other European methods.

AB  - Evaluating the human disturbance on karst areas is a difficult task because of the complexity of these peculiar and unique environments. The human impact on karstic geo-ecosystems is increasingly important and there is an increasing need for multidisciplinary tools to assess the environmental changes in karst areas. Many disciplines, such as biology, geomorphology, hydrology and social-economical sciences are to be considered to sufficiently evaluate the impact on these intrinsically vulnerable areas. This article gives an overview of the evolution of environmental impact on karst areas of the island Sardinia (Italy). For this particular case, the most important impacts in the past 50 years are derived from the following activities, in decreasing importance: (1) mining and quarrying; (2) deforestation, agriculture and grazing; (3) building (widespread urbanisation, isolated homes, etc.) and related infrastructures (roads, sewer systems, aqueducts, waste dumps, etc.); (4) tourism; (5) military activities. To evaluate the present environmental state of these areas the Disturbance Index for Karst environments [Van Beynen and Townsend (Environ Manage 36:101-116)] is applied in a slightly modified version. Instead of considering the indicators of environmental disturbances used in the original method, this slightly modified index evaluates the disturbances causing the deterioration of the environmental attributes. In the Sardinian case study, 27 disturbances have been evaluated, giving rise to the definition of a Disturbance Index ranging between 0 (Pristine) and 1 (highly disturbed). This Disturbance Index simplifies the original KDI method, appears to adequately measure disturbance on Mediterranean karst areas and could be applied with success to other similar regions.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) requires Member States of the European Union (EU) to use a pool of bioindicators, that is, Biological Quality Elements (BQEs), including fish species and each Member State shall, in fact, certify the compliance with the ecological quality goals of the WFD. The New Italian Index of the Ecological State of Fish Communities (NISECI) is the WFD-compliant index for the analysis of the fish species BQE in Italian river water bodies, both wadable and non-wadable, that are not (using WFD definitions) heavily modified or artificial. The WFD requires each index to relate the conditions found in the field to reference conditions corresponding to the absence of anthropogenic alterations or to minor anthropogenic alterations. The present study defines the logical basis on the model of refinement for the reference conditions of the metrics and submetrics of NISECI relating to the biological condition of indigenous and non-indigenous species. The model was tested on an empirical basis using data from 284 ichthyological samplings taken from river basins throughout Italy. In order to clean random errors and stochastic noise due to possible different sampling methods, the data was only collected using protocols that guarantee adequately homogeneous and reliable data of abundance (overall and by size). The developed approach provided comparable and homogeneous results throughout Italian watersheds; this allowed a standardized and robust refinement of the threshold values of the demographic parameters of NISECI. The procedure used, consistent with the spatially based reference condition and expert judgement reference condition approaches envisaged by the WFD, improves the analytical performance of the NISECI by increasing its power of resolution and is applicable in every Italian zoogeographic and ecological context.

AB  - Taking advantage of multiple new remote sensing data sources, especially from Chinese satellites, the CropWatch system has expanded the scope of its international analyses through the development of new indicators and an upgraded operational methodology. The approach adopts a hierarchical system covering four spatial levels of detail: global, regional, national (thirty-one key countries including China) and "sub-countries" (for the nine largest countries). The thirty-one countries encompass more that 80% of both production and exports of maize, rice, soybean and wheat. The methodology resorts to climatic and remote sensing indicators at different scales. The global patterns of crop environmental growing conditions are first analyzed with indicators for rainfall, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as potential biomass. At the regional scale, the indicators pay more attention to crops and include Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Cropped Arable Land Fraction (CALF) as well as Cropping Intensity (CI). Together, they characterize crop situation, farming intensity and stress. CropWatch carries out detailed crop condition analyses at the national scale with a comprehensive array of variables and indicators. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), cropped areas and crop conditions are integrated to derive food production estimates. For the nine largest countries, CropWatch zooms into the sub-national units to acquire detailed information on crop condition and production by including new indicators (e.g., Crop type proportion). Based on trend analysis, CropWatch also issues crop production supply outlooks, covering both long-term variations and short-term dynamic changes in key food exporters and importers. The hierarchical approach adopted by CropWatch is the basis of the analyses of climatic and crop conditions assessments published in the quarterly "CropWatch bulletin" which provides accurate and timely information essential to food producers, traders and consumers.

AB  - Measuring body lipids and proteins of wild animals such as mallards is essential to determine the impact of the environment on their body condition. A major difficulty, however, is that biochemical analysis of carcass is tedious and therefore cannot be applied at a large scale. The main objective of this study was therefore to find out if simple measurements can be used as indices of total body lipids and proteins. Four classes of lipid and protein indices, derived on a 'source' group, were defined according to their complexity and condition of application (field or laboratory). Accuracy of the indices was evaluated on an independent group, of which the body composition calculated from indices was compared to carcass analysis. In live birds, body mass was an accurate and convenient predictor for both lipid and protein masses. If carcasses are available, extensive analysis provides a higher accuracy for body lipids only. This can be simply obtained through multiple regressions using abdominal fat mass and/or dry body mass. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - The present study aims to have a comparative study of the results, from biological monitoring as well as conventional method, based on physico-chemical variables. Water quality index (WQI) and planktonic diatom metrics have been used to determine water quality and ecological conditions of the Dong Nai River (DNR) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to find out the main environmental variables that regulate the phytoplankton community. A total of 51 planktonic diatom species, belonging to 23 genera, have been identified during the study period. Fragillaria was the most dominant diatom in the upper course site, while the Aulacoseira was the most dominant species in the middle and lower ones. One-way ANOVA showed that the mean of turbidity, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate were significantly different (P<0.05) among upper, middle, and lower course sites in both dry and wet seasons. The WQI showed that water quality in the Dong Nai River was classified in medium level at all sites, while water quality varied from good, moderate, to low level, based on the Biological Diatom Index (BDI) values. CCA indicated that nutrients (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and turbidity were the most important factors, regulating the variation in structure of the planktonic community. In this study, the BDI has been applied for the first time to biomonitor water quality in Vietnam. The sensitivity of the BDI to environmental stressors, supported the use of this index to bio-monitor surface water in tropical regions.

AB  - We examined spatiotemporal variations of metal levels and three growth related biomarkers, i.e., RNA/DNA ratio (RD), total energy reserve (Et) and condition index (CI), in green-lipped mussels Perna viridis transplanted into five locations along a pollution gradient in the marine environment of Hong Kong over 120 days of deployment. There were significant differences in metal levels and biomarker responses among the five sites and six time points. Mussels in two clean sites displayed better CI and significantly lower levels of Ag, Cu, Pb and Zn in their tissues than the other sites. Temporal patterns of RD in P. viridis were found to be site-specific. Across all sites, Et decreased in P. viridis over the deployment period, though the rate of decrease varied significantly among the sites. Therefore, temporal variation of biomarkers should be taken to consideration in mussel-watch programs because such information can help discriminate pollution-induced change from natural variation.

AB  - The assessment of estuaries based on benthic communities is widely used to determine impacts caused by human pressure and is one of the required tools for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Our study compared multimetric approaches (B-IBI and TICOR) to assess the benthic condition of three Portuguese estuaries (Mondego, Tejo, and Mira rivers) with different levels of natural and human induced stress. Benthic community condition was classified into quality status categories of the WFD and compared for consistency with a priori status categories based upon physical-chemical criteria. Both multimetric indices discriminated equally well between locations classified above or below the good status category but were unable to provide good separation between other quality classes (high/good, moderate, poor/bad). Metrics included in these indices are greatly affected by natural stress and we recommend the development of habitat-specific thresholds to increase the discriminatory ability of any benthic condition index.

AB  - This study investigates the frequency of microplastic (MP) ingestion and the relationship between microplastics in the guts of two commercial fish species in Iceland (cod; Gadus morhua and saithe; Pollachius virens) and the weight, length, gut fullness, and condition index (CI) of the fish. MPs were found in 20.5% of the cod (n = 39) and 17.4% of the saithe (n = 46). There was no significant correlation between gut fullness nor CI and findings of MPs, indicating that, especially in large individuals, MPs are not retained to a large extent, and if so, the CI is most likely not affected. A difference was found in fish length between fish containing plastic and fish without plastics. Further studies such as this must be conducted in all water ecosystems if we are to fully understand the impact that MP's are having at the individual, population, species, and ecosystem levels.

AB  - We report on the development and preliminary application of a songbird community-based index of biotic integrity. The bird community index (BCI) sorts bird species found at sample sites into a series of values representing the proportional species richness of 20 behavioral and physiological response guilds. Relative proportions of specialist and generalist guilds are used to assign a composite score to each sire. Scores from multiple sites indicate the overall biotic integrity of the study area. The BCI is intended to function as a landscape-scale indicator of biotic integrity, integrating conditions across large sample sites containing diverse ecological resources and intensities of human use. We developed the BCI with data from a 1994 pilot study in central Pennsylvania, then applied our preliminary index in 1995 and 1996 to independent samples of sites across the Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment area (MAHA). The 1995 and 1996 sample sites were selected using the probability-based sampling design of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), and therefore represent the total land area in MAMA. Our preliminary assessment indicates that MAHA exhibits six categories of biotic integrity, and that more than 40% of the land area supports the two highest biotic integrity categories. Pending BCI refinement and incorporation of landscape and vegetation explanatory variables, the BCI will be included in a suite of indicators designed to provide an assessment of overall ecological condition in MAMA.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency delegates to States and Tribes primary responsibility for monitoring the condition of wetlands under their jurisdiction, and suggests that wetland assessment be performed in a buildable process deemed the 1-2-3 framework. Level One assessment uses remotely-sensed data, Level Two uses a checklist of site attributes during a single visit, and Level Three includes effortful field surveys of biotic and water quality indicators. We used 16 accepted wetland assessment metrics that varied in levels of effort to evaluate the ecological integrity of 71 palustrine wetlands in New York State, including wetlands with a broad range of disturbance histories. We detected significant correlations across multiple levels and within levels, which indicates that these metrics, regardless of effort, are measuring similar attributes of wetlands. Most metrics also successfully distinguished between three wetland disturbance groups: natural, restored, and Area of Concern. The implication of this finding is that the landscape setting (as assessed by Level One) is linked to the biotic wetland community (as assessed by Level Three), and can be used to predict the ecological condition of a wetland using less complex methods. The relationships did have limits, however, indicating that some metrics either cannot be substituted or may not be as effective as previously thought at evaluating ecological condition of palustrine wetlands. The positive associations among the Levels indicate that it is possible to efficiently and validly evaluate and monitor wetlands using the 1-2-3 framework with appropriately selected indicator metrics.

AB  - A combination of bioenergetics and biochemical biomarkers in mussels was applied to assess possible pollution impacts in a protected semi-enclosed estuary (Amvrakikos Gulf, NW Greece) that receives pesticide discharges through riverine transport. Scope for growth, a physiological condition index representing the energy budget of the organism, was applied to detect general stress effects on the health status of mussels. The low energy budgets of mussels revealed stress conditions and provided early warning signals of possible consequences at higher levels of biological organization. Biochemical markers of exposure confirmed a risk of pesticide contamination. Decreased acetylcholinesterase activities indicated exposure to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. Responses of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase suggested the presence of contaminants capable of reactive oxygen species production that could be related to organochlorine pesticide contamination in the area. On the other hand, metallothionein levels implied low metal contamination.

AB  - This study assesses the frequency, distribution, characteristics, and chemical composition of microplastics (MPs) in the gut of highly consumed fish species, namely leaping mullet (Chelon saliens), common carp (Cyprinus carpioi), and Caspian kutum (Rutilus caspicus), in the southern Caspian Sea biome. Fibers are found to be the only shape of MPs. Black MPs and polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate polymers are dominant. MP frequency is highest in leaping mullet's gut, while kutum specimens exhibited the lowest MP frequency, reflecting that leaping mullet is a neritic species and thus highly exposed to MP influx in shallow coastal water, while the other species are benthopelagic. The estimated condition index reflected a significant difference between the species, implying that MPs may pose adverse health impacts on leaping mullet and common carp, with no undesirable effect on Caspian kutum. No significant relationship exists between biological parameters and the MP frequency in the fish gut.

AB  - We develop an inclusive wealth type index for natural capital in the Barents Sea that accounts for ecosystem services via trophic interactions. We consider three key fish species in the Barents Sea under stochastic growth dynamics. Compared to evaluation at market prices, the estimated wealth from the inclusive wealth approach is several times higher. Ecosystem wealth depends on the management scheme, and we consider both business as usual (BAU) and an optimized ecosystem-based management scheme (EBM). While BAU maintains wealth near its current level (5% increase in the long run), EBM increases wealth with almost 20% in the short run and more than 25% in the long run. Realized shadow prices suggest that prey species stocks are undervalued when evaluated at market prices.

AB  - Polonium-210 has been measured in Danish fish meat caught in the North Sea, the Kattegat and the Baltic in 1991-1994. Average values of 0.35, 0.65 and 0.96 Bq Po-210 kg(-1) fresh weight were observed for cod, herring and plaice fillets, respectively. The difference between species is statistically significant, whereas no effect of salinity could be observed. There is a high variation giving SD values in the range 70-100%. Mytilus edulis soft parts were analysed for Po-210 from II Danish locations ranging from full North Sea salinity to Baltic 8 parts per thousand water. Significantly increasing Po-210 concentrations with a decreasing 'condition index' were observed. Concentrations at two former phosphate industry sites were not statistically different from the other locations. The average Po-210 concentration in the M. edulis soft parts was 149 Bq kg(-1) dry +/- 55% SD (n = 41). The present levels of Po-210 in fish and mussels may represent a natural baseline.

AB  - Inland, in particular incity lake ecosystems have long been affected by numerous types of human interventions that have a negative impact on their water quality and ecological state. Thus, restoration of the lake ecosystems is a preliminary process. Integrated ecological engineering for restoration (IEER) was conducted in two gulfs (total 6.01 km(2)) of Lake Dianchi containing hypereutrophic water of frequent cyanobacterial blooms for four years. This technology consists of two main processes: (1) specially-designed equipment and filter-feeding fish to remove the cyanobacterial biomass, (2) re-plantation of macrophytes to restore aquatic ecological system. The biodiversity indices (Simpson-Wiener and Shannon) of the zooplankton and zoobenthos and the trophic state index (TSI) were used to assess the outcome of IEER. The results showed that the biodiversity index of zooplankton and zoobenthos have increased significantly in response to the improved growth conditions. The TSI values showed that the eutrophic level of the gulfs was not reduced, indicating that the IEER did not improve the water quality of the ecosystem. Failure of the IEER in improving water quality may partly resulted from the frequent cyanobacterial blooms. In future efforts should be made to consider species distribution, community structure, species interactions in addition to the biodiversity index and trophic state index.

AB  - The characteristics of the benthic community structure can effectively reflect the health status of the river ecosystem and the quality of the river ecological environment. It is of great significance to identify the limiting factors of benthic community structure for the maintenance of river ecosystem health. As a typical semi-arid ecological fragile area, the eco-environmental problems in the Wei River basin have become increasingly prominent. The benthic community structure is affected by multiple stresses such as habitat degradation and water quality deterioration. In this study, 18 national monitoring stations were selected to investigate the ecological environment and benthic invertebrate community characteristics in the Wei River basin in October 2019. W-statistics, Shannon-Winer index, Pielou index, Margalef index, and B-IBI index were selected to evaluate the community characteristics of benthic macroinvertebrates from three aspects of the community stability, community diversity, and community integrity. Principal component analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis were used to analyze the correlation and variability between zoobenthos community index and environmental factors. The results showed that the spatial difference of benthic community structure in the Wei River basin was not significant, and the Sal, NH3-N, Tub, DO in water environment and heavy metals in sediment were the main environmental factors affecting the community structure of benthos. Improving water quality and controlling pollution were the main strategies to improve benthic biodiversity and promote sustainable development in the Wei River basin.

AB  - In the Marine Protected Area of La Maddalena Archipelago, environmental protection rules and safeguard measures for nautical activities have helped in reducing anthropogenic pressure; however, tourism related activities remain particularly significant in summer. With the aim of evaluating their impacts, the biomarker approach using transplanted Mytilus galloprovincialis as sentinel organisms coupled with POCIS deployment was applied. Mussels, translocated to four marine areas differently impacted by tourism activities, were sampled before, during and after the tourist season. Moreover, endocrine disruptors in passive samplers POCIS and the cellular toxicity of whole POCIS extracts on mussel haemocytes were evaluated to integrate ecotoxicological information. Lysosomal biomarkers, condition index and mortality rate, as well as metals in tissues suggested an alteration of the health status of mussels transplanted to the most impacted sites. The cellular toxicity of POCIS extracts was pointed out, notwithstanding the concentrations of the examined compounds were always below the detection limits.

AB  - As a step towards determining the extent of degradation in non-tidal streams, a multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) based on fish assemblages was developed for the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). The MESS is a probability-based statewide sampling program designed to assess the status of biological resources and to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activities. We used data from 419 MESS sites sampled in 1994-95 to develop the IBI. Two distinct geographic strata, corresponding with ecoregional and physiographic boundaries, were identified via cluster analysis and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) as supporting distinctly different species groups. Reference conditions were based on minimally degraded sites. We quantitatively evaluated the ability of various attributes of the fish assemblage (candidate metrics) to discriminate between these reference sites and sites known to be degraded, using statistical tests and classification efficiency. Provisional formulations of the IBI were selected for each region based on high classification efficiency and broad representation of fish assemblage attributes. Fish IBI scores for 1995 MESS sites spanned a wide range of biological conditions, from good to very poor. Over all six basins sampled in 1995, half of the stream miles fell into the range of good to fair. Roughly 25% of stream miles showed some degradation. The IBI will be used in conjunction with physical and chemical data to answer critical questions about the health of Maryland streams and the relative impacts of human-induced stresses on the state's aquatic systems.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems play an important role in maintaining biodiversity, global carbon balance. Aiming at the desert steppe with an extremely fragile ecological environment, the spatiotemporal relation between vegetation fractional coverage (VFC) and climate was explored in this study in a pixel-scale analysis method. There was an overall increasing trend in the VFC of the study area. The coefficient of correlation between average precipitation from 2000 to 2013 and VFC was 0.81, and during the growing season, the coefficient of correlation between average temperature and VFC was -0.76. The two dominant factors of VFC in the study area, precipitation and temperature, were used as indicators to establish an ecological suitability index (ESI) for desert steppe to reflect the hydrothermal conditions for vegetation growth. The ESI of the study area varied from 0.03 to 0.94 with its average being 0.39, and the coefficient of correlation between ESI and VFC was 0.84. On the basis of ESI, an optimized layout adjustment was made for existing farmland in the study area so as to take advantage of natural conditions to the greatest extent and reduce impacts of human activities. The optimized layout of farmlands would adapt better to the natural climatic characteristics of the desert steppe regions, meanwhile, bring about ecological and environment benefits to the original agro-pastoral ecotone of the desert grasslands areas. Results from this study further our understanding of the desert steppe, and provide some reference for ecological restoration and new cycle of returning farmland to grassland policy.

AB  - To explore the spatiotemporal variation of benthic communities and assess their response to anthropogenic pressures and climatic variability, a seasonal biomonitoring of benthic macroinvertebrates in the Martil Basin was carried out. Macroinvertebrates were sampled seasonally at 19 sites from autumn 2015 to spring 2018, and the performance of the Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party (IBMWP), the Standardized Global Biological Index (IBGN), the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), and the Family Biotic Index (FBI) indices were assessed. The results showed a clear decline in taxa richness from the upper to the lower river sections. The overall water quality of the Martil River Basin ranged from moderate to poor, but the different indices produced various classification outcomes. The IBMWP index showed highest correlation with taxonomic richness being the most appropriate for assessing the water quality. Notwithstanding, we suggest that biotic indices should be included as an essential tool for assessing the water quality in Moroccan streams, for maintaining the ecological integrity.

AB  - The report of the World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development [(1999) Our Forests, Our Future: Report of the World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, U.K.)] has called attention to a global need to restore the functional integrity of nature. The assumption that the biophysical world is capable of supporting any intensity of economic and political activity is now obviously wrong. The failures are seen as global changes such as the global climatic disruption now underway. The global disruptions are the product of cumulative local disruptions. Despite a conspicuous need, the scientific community has been slow in developing tools to appraise the functional integrity of landscapes. The proposal is advanced that the first steps deal with forests because they are so large in their influences on global biophysics. Analyses carried out by the commission are elaborated here as an index of functional integrity in the forest zone. The proposal is based on a simple, transparent approach. The scale is 0-100 with 100 as the nominal climax. Decrements and increments are applied as the structural and functional integrity of the landscape varies with whatever cause. The unit of area for these trials has been 10,000 hectares. The index has been applied to extremes such as the large extractive reserves in Acre, Brazil (100), the once-forested landscape of Haiti (0), and a managed forest stand in Maine. The analyses offer a scalar system for defining how well landowners and governments are protecting the public's interests in the integrity of the habitat of all.

AB  - With the impact of global climate change and the acceleration of urbanization, the coastal zone of the Guangdong/Hong Kong/Macao Greater Bay area (GBA) faces the pressures of biodiversity reduction, loss of coastal wetlands, eutrophication of coastal waters and frequent marine pollution events, all of which affect the ecology of this environment and threaten high-quality development of the GBA coastal zone. This study looked at the coastal zones adjacent to nine cities in the GBA, and analyzed the temporal and spatial changes in key ecological and environmental factors using remote sensing, field observations and data collection. A pressure-state-response model was used to build coastal zone ecological security evaluation indexes. The resulting assessments based on the ecological security index of each administrative region in the GBA were used to evaluate their ecological security status, diagnose their existing problems and analyze the causes in each of them. The results showed that the state grade of the GBA coastal zone follows a V-shape, with the eastern and western parts in better ecological condition than the central part. With regard to the current management of the coastal ecological environment, this paper suggests six future policies for improvements to coastal protection in an effort to promote high-quality development in GBA coastal zones, including strengthening top-level planning, optimizing port design and strengthening supervision.

AB  - Wheat plants are most sensitive to soil water conditions after anthesis.  Under water stress, genotypic variability in grain set was noted.  Drought enhanced maturity, lengthened grain filling duration and adversely affected the number of grains/spike and 100-grain weight of wheat cultivars from the Philippines and Nepal.  Grain protein content increased with the increase in drought duration.  Siddhartha, NL 292, NL 370, and NL 496 all from Nepal produced the maximum grain yield and also harvest index under stressed conditions.

AB  - This paper uses a scenario analysis system - Range-ASSESS - to examine the potential for gains and losses of soil carbon in the Australian rangelands as affected by grazing and climate. The analysis involves a factorial examination of the effect of stocking rates and all possible 5-year historical climates between 1889 and 1999. The analysis also looks at the sensitivity of results to the method of calculation of safe carrying capacity, and to the thresholds used to calculate grazing and dryness indices that drive transitions in state and transition models. The analysis showed that different vegetation zones produced different responses to changes in stocking depending upon the spatial distribution of dryness index, nature of carbon state and transition model, rules governing transitions, and relative significance of soil carbon. At a stocking density equivalent to 100% of 1997 levels, the soil carbon loss from rangelands was about 400 Mt C in 40% of the 5-year periods using a sensitive growth deviation threshold to determine dryness index. If a less sensitive threshold was used, potential loss was reduced to about 200 Mt C. If the grazing pressure threshold for a grazing index of four is adjusted to a more generous level, then potential losses in the dry periods are substantially reduced. The analysis is intended to be indicative of a likely approximate outcome rather than a quantitative measure of system response. The results indicate that the interpretation of the effect of the drought-grazing pressure interaction on perennial plant survival, and consequent organic carbon input to soils, is a major source of uncertainty and a critical area for more experimental measurement.

AB  - We attempted to extend the inference scope of several detailed songbird habitat restoration studies in western Oregon to the broader region through a reanalysis and synthesis of five large-scale management experiments. This previous work demonstrated the importance of understorey vegetation to songbird habitat. However, individual studies have shown conflicting results regarding how vegetation responds to restoration thinning. Understorey vegetation covers 4-6 years after thinning was strongly related to pre-treatment conditions (indexed by the unthinned control treatment). Baseline models that accounted for the pre-treatment conditions showed that herbaceous cover consistently, but only slightly, increased following thinning. Shrub cover, however, tended to decrease following thinning when the pre-treatment cover was > 30 per cent. Each study had limited replication and most had limited geographic and environmental conditions, leading to the inconsistent findings when analysed separately. The reanalysis approach allowed us to test the repeatability of specific finding and demonstrated the applicability of restoration thinning for enhancing habitat in western Oregon.

AB  - The deposition of some heavy metals (Fe, CU Zn, Co, Ni, Cd and Pb), as an inorganic contaminant is described for two sites in the southeastern Mediterranean waters namely El-Mex Bay and Baltim zone. The concentration of heavy metals were studied in water, suspended matter, surficial sediments and the shells and soft tissues of bivalve mollusc, Venerupis decussata decussata L. to compare the influence of anthropogenic effect on the aquatic systems. The metal contents of the different environmental compartments in El-Mex zone were found to increase by several times compared to that recorded in Baltim region which is subjected to pronounced coastal erosion. The essential heavy metals (Fe, Cu and in) were found to be more concentrated in the soft parts, and were inversely related to size, (P<0.05) without gender. Pb, Cd, Co and Ni were more concentrated in the shells by factors of 16 4.2, 6.06 and 1.56 respectively. So shells may act for the removal of these metals (particularly Pb) from the surrounding medium. The concentration of some metals in El-Mex Bay showed an obvious increase with time. The increased concentration of some metals was found to affect growth and condition index in Venerupis.

AB  - Monitoring programs aimed at indicator species like the American marten (Martes americana) may index ecosystem conditions throughout the animal's range. Habitat-relation models may be useful to monitor indicator species and their habitats temporally. We constructed and field-tested a habitat-relation model for American martens to determine current distribution of the species in the Black Hills, South Dakota and establish baseline data for the population. We conducted a track-plate-box survey, selecting survey quadrats using the model, field reconnaissance, and area used by radiocollared martens. We performed stepwise logistic regression to test the model and predict the presence of martens in random quadrats throughout the study area and in quadrats surveyed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service. Of 46 10.2-km(2) quadrats surveyed, 14 (30%) had boxes visited by martens. High-quality habitat was positively and low-quality habitat negatively correlated to martens' presence. Logistic model coefficients predicted that martens would be detected in 6 of 68 (9%) random quadrats. When field-tested (post-analysis), the model correctly predicted outcomes for 3 (60%) of 5 quadrats surveyed.

AB  - The phenotypic stability for fruit yield and its component traits of 64 genotypes (48 hybrids and their 16 parents) of okra grown on three different dates indicated the significant differences among the genotypes (G), environments (E) and G x E interactions for all the characters (except number of nodes at first flowering for environment and G x E interactions) indicating variable response of different genotypes for various traits under varied environmental conditions. Non-significance of G x E (linear) against pooled deviation for most of the characters under study suggested that performance of genotypes remained similar for their linear regression on environmental index. Non-linear component (pooled deviation) also played an important role for all the characters except for number of nodes at first flowering and fruit length. On the basis of mean ((X) over bar), regression coefficient (bi) and deviation from regression (S(2)di); parents JOL-06(K)-2 and GO-2 as well as hybrid JOL-06(K)-2 x GO-2 were found stable and widely adapted for general cultivation for fruit yield and its components in okra.

AB  - Health evaluations of brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) nestlings from three colonies along the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States were performed in 2005, 2007, and 2008. The primary objective of this study was to establish baseline data for hematologic, biochemical, and serologic values from a relatively healthy population of free-living pelicans during early chick development. Relationships among health variables and colony site, ectoparasite infestation, sex, and body condition index were also evaluated. Reference intervals are presented for health variables, including novel analytes for the species, as well as a comparison of these results with previously published values for wild pelicans. No significant relationships were found between health variables and nestling sex or body condition; however, differences between colony sites and the presence of ectoparasites were detected. The inclusion of health assessments as a regular component of management programs for seabirds can provide data to better understand the effect to species of concern when drastic changes occur to the population and its environment.

AB  - Correlation and simulation analyses suggest that, for the Northeast Arctic (NA) cod stock, the total lipid energy (TLE (kJ)) contained in the livers of mature females is proportional to total egg production, making TLE a potential predictor of recruitment. Accordingly, the TLE of NA cod was estimated for a 51-year time period (1946-1996), using estimates of numbers at length derived from virtual population analysis, modelled values of proportion mature and weight at length, and observed values of the liver-condition index. A significant linear relationship between TLE and recruitment to age 3 was observed. The temporal trend in TLE suggests that the reproductive potential of the NA cod stock has been in decline since the mid-1970s. A multiple-regression model that included TLE, mean temperature, and mean alongshore wind stress as independent variables explained approximately 43% of the variation in recruitment. Reconstructing stock-recruit relationships using more sensitive measures of reproductive potential is the first step in resolving environmental effects on recruitment and in developing biological reference points that are more effective in stock conservation.

AB  - Atlantic croaker, Micropogonias undulatus, sampled from a transect along a pollution gradient show a trend of declining growth and physical condition. This trend is apparent in the mean size of 0-group croaker, in their recent growth rate measured by marginal otolith increment widths, in longer term growth rate as indicated by relative otolith weights, and in general physical condition as measured by an index of condition of the caudal fin. We suggest that these measures are indicators of stress associated with environmental conditions. Because croaker from different positions along the pollution gradient were distinguishable, it appears that they remain for extended periods within areas of degraded environmental quality.

Macroinvertebrates were sampled with a scoop net between September and December 1999 from 12 stations selected to correspond with different human activities in the catchment. The samples were hand sorted in the field, preserved in 70% alcohol before transportation to the laboratory for identification and counting. The stations were grouped into three condition categories (reference, moderate and impaired) according to the level of water and habitat quality. Twenty metrics representing the structural and functional organization of macroinvertebrates were evaluated for range, response to disturbance and stream size differences and redundancy with each other. Ten metrics met the test criteria and were used to provide the final scores for developing the M-IBI. Metrics values at both reference and impaired sites were used to establish the scoring criteria using inter-quartile ranges. The metrics displayed variability across the sites and the final index was able to separate reference sites from moderately impaired and impaired sites. There were variations in ecosystem integrity among stations and this was reflected in community composition and structure of resident macroinvertebrates. The index developed can, therefore, be used to monitor the integrity of streams within the Nyando River Basin.

AB  - Climate-driven sea ice loss has led to changes in the timing of key biological events in the Arctic, however, the consequences and rate of these changes remain largely unknown. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) undergo seasonal changes in energy stores in relation to foraging opportunities and habitat conditions. Declining sea ice has been linked to reduced body condition in some subpopulations, however, the specific timing and duration of the feeding period when bears acquire most of their energy stores and its relationship to the timing of ice break-up is poorly understood. We used community-based sampling to investigate seasonality in body condition (energy stores) of polar bears in Nunavut, Canada, and examined the influence of sea ice variables. We used adipose tissue lipid content as an index of body condition for 1,206 polar bears harvested from 2010-2017 across five subpopulations with varying seasonal ice conditions: Baffin Bay (October-August), Davis Strait and Foxe Basin (year-round), Gulf of Boothia and Lancaster Sound (August-May). Similar seasonal patterns were found in body condition across subpopulations with bears at their nadir of condition in the spring, followed by fat accumulation past break-up date and subsequent peak body condition in autumn, indicating that bears are actively foraging in late spring and early summer. Late season feeding implies that even minor advances in the timing of break-up may have detrimental effects on foraging opportunities, body condition, and subsequent reproduction and survival. The magnitude of seasonal changes in body condition varied across the study area, presumably driven by local environmental conditions. Our results demonstrate how community-based monitoring of polar bears can reveal population-level responses to climate warming in advance of detectable demographic change. Our data on the seasonal timing of polar bear foraging and energy storage should inform predictive models of the effects of climate-mediated sea ice loss.

AB  - The present study assessed whether the bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum may be appropriately deployed as a bioindicator in monitoring transitional environments, in terms of bioaccumulation potential and biomarker responses. The concentrations of trace metals, PAHs and PCBs were determined in sediments and clam tissue, and biomarkers were estimated at various levels of biological complexity (i.e. metallothioneins, lipofuscins, survival-in-air and reburrowing behaviour). Sediments and clams were collected biannually in 2004 and 2005 at eight sites within Venice lagoon, which were influenced differently by natural and anthropogenic impacts. Results highlighted that the broad variations of pollutant concentrations in sediments were not consistent either with the body residuals or with the biomarker responses. Consequently, on the basis of the observed weak responsiveness and sensitivity to anthropogenic stressors we suggest a more cautious use for R. philippinarum as sentinel organism, at least in estuarine sediments in the north Adriatic transitional areas.

AB  - The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has been directed to assist local landowners and communities to implement watershed improvement practices. The purpose of this study was to document current conditions in the Rocky River Watershed in North Carolina and the Saluda River Watershed in South Carolina. A variety of watershed assessment tools, including the NRCS Visual Stream Assessment (VSA), Stream Habitat Assessment (SHA), Riparian Vegetation Index (RVI), Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), and Land Quality Index (LQI) were wed on a statistically representative portion of both watershed. Overall, the SHA, VSA, and RVI rated the watersheds' condition as good, whereas the IBI rated them as fair. Correlations between IBI and the other indices were poor, perhaps indicating these indices measure different features within the watersheds. The LQI emphasized the need for better characterization of urban land and riparian corridors. Inclusion of suburban lawns with the urban land indicator improved correlations between IBI and LQI by 20%. This pilot study suggests further scrutiny in applying quantitative stream physical habitat measures to assess watershed renditions. It also indicates additional study of the IBI by NRCS. Resources devoted to statistical design were valuable and should provide the NRCS with a framework for conducting future watershed studies.

AB  - A rapid process of water reform in Australia has seen governments rely heavily on 'expert' or 'scientific' panel advice for river condition and environmental flow assessments. These multi-disciplinary teams of scientists have enabled a quick and relatively inexpensive injection of science into what is often a data-poor decision process. However, expert panels suffer from several important drawbacks including a lack of transparency and repeatability, and unquantified uncertainty. In the case of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, a government initiative to corporatize the government-owned authority led to the establishment of the Snowy Water Inquiry (SWI) that was required by law to propose and evaluate (within a six month period) a range of options for future river regulation, diversion and environmental flows. A Scientific Reference Panel (SRP) was therefore established to assess current (1998) river condition and to assess the likely environments benefits of a range of environmental flow options. The SRP attempted to overcome a number of the typical shortcomings of the expert panel approach by (i) integrating available data with expert opinion in its assessments, and (ii) developing a composite River Condition Index (RCI) underpinned by a conceptual framework that links habitat and biotic condition and comprises several sub-indices that translate qualitative assessments (relative to a pre-disturbance reference condition) into numeric values in a transparent and repeatable manner. The SRP estimated the level of uncertainty associated with its various assessments, and used these to quantify uncertainty estimates on RCI values. In this paper the RCI is described and its use is illustrated through presentation of the assessments of current (1998) river condition and the associated uncertainty analyses that were made for the rivers in the Snowy Mountains area. The results suggest that in spite of high levels of uncertainty associated with individual assessments, the SRP was able to demonstrate significant difference in current condition between rivers, and in likely future condition between different environmental flow scenarios. Although further investigations and lengthy negotiations occurred subsequent to the SWI to achieve corporatization, the environmental assessments made in the SWI provided the most comprehensive source of information available to governments and the community regarding the likely environmental outcomes of the proposed changes. Subsequent to the SWI the scenario-based approach to environmental flow assessment has become increasingly common internationally, and major Australian river condition assessments have adopted a similar conceptual framework to the RCI.

AB  - Within the framework of the biointegrator network (RINBIO), 92 man-made cages containing mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), distributed over 1800 km of the French Mediterranean coast, made it possible to assess chemical contamination by heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, As) and organic compounds (DDT, PCBs, HAP). The caging technique was adopted to compensate for the scarcity of natural shellfish stocks in the Mediterranean and to enable comparison of the sites regardless of their physicochemical and trophic characteristics. Models linking a biometric parameter (the condition index) to pollutant levels make it possible to adjust raw data on contamination for a reference individual, by making a clear distinction between physiological factors (growth) and environmental ones. The results demonstrate significant levels of pollutants in sites heretofore unsampled; the pollution occurs at limited areas, and the sources have been identified. Moreover, average contamination levels are comparable to those measured in wild species and in other areas. Overall, the research demonstrates the reliability of this methodological approach for monitoring marine pollution, especially in the Mediterranean. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drought is an insidious hazard of nature and is considered to be the most complex but least understood of all natural hazards. Large historical datasets are required to study drought and these involve complex interrelationships between climatological and meteorological data. Rainfall is an important meteorological parameter; the amount and distribution influence the type of vegetation in a region. To analyse the changes in vegetation cover due to variation in rainfall and identify the land-use areas facing drought risk, rainfall data from 1981 to 2003 were categorized into excess, normal, deficit and drought years. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor's composite dataset was used for analysing the temporal and interannual behaviour of surface vegetation. The various land-use classes - crop land (annual, perennial crops), scrub land, barren land, forest land, degraded pasture and grassland - were identified using satellite data for excess, normal, deficit and drought years. Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) were derived from satellite data for each land-use class and the highest NDVI mean values were 0.515, 0.436 and 0.385 for the tapioca crop in excess, normal and deficit years, respectively, whereas in the drought year, the groundnut crop (0.267) showed the maximum. Grassland recorded the lowest value of NDVI in all years except for the excess year. Annual crops, such as groundnut (0.398), pulses (0.313), sorghum (0.120), tapioca (0.436) and horse gram (0.259), registered comparatively higher NDVI values than the perennial crops for the normal year. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) was used to estimate vegetation health and monitor drought. Among land-use classes, the maximum VCI value of 92.1% was observed in onions for the excess year, whereas groundnut witnessed the maximum values of 78.2, 64.5 and 55.2% for normal, deficit and drought years, respectively. Based on the VCI classification, all land-use classes fall into the optimal or normal vegetation category in excess and normal years, whereas in drought years most of the land-use classes fall into the drought category except for sorghum, groundnut, pulses and grasses. These crops (sorghum 39.7%, groundnut 55.2%, pulses 38.5% and grassland 38.6%) registered maximum VCI values, revealing that they were sustained under drought conditions. It is suggested that the existing crop pattern be modified in drought periods by selecting the suitable crops of sorghum, groundnut and pulses and avoiding the cultivation of onion, rice and tapioca.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate which macroinvertebrate and deposited sediment metrics are best for determining effects of excessive sedimentation on stream integrity. Fifteen instream sediment metrics, with the strongest relationship to land cover, were compared to riffle macroinvertebrate metrics in streams ranging across a gradient of land disturbance. Six deposited sediment metrics were strongly related to the relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera and six were strongly related to the modified family biotic index (MFBI). Few functional feeding groups and habit groups were significantly related to deposited sediment, and this may be related to the focus on riffle, rather than reach-wide macroinvertebrates, as reach-wide sediment metrics were more closely related to human land use. Our results suggest that the coarse-level deposited sediment metric, visual estimate of fines, and the coarse-level biological index, MFBI, may be useful in biomonitoring efforts aimed at determining the impact of anthropogenic sedimentation on stream biotic integrity.

AB  - The environmental impact of microplastics is a challenging theme, especially under realistic experimental conditions. We investigated physiological responses to 0.1-1.0 mu m PVC particles intake by the mussel Perna perna after a relative long-term exposure (90 days) at a less extreme concentration compared with previous studies (0.125 g/L). Microplastic intake was inferred by the presence of PVC in the feces of mussels, and physiological damages were assessed through ingestion rate, assimilation efficiency, growth rate, cellular and molecular biomarkers (lysosomal integrity, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage), and condition index. All physiological responses showed nonsignificant effects of the microplastics on the exposed mussels. We suggest that, despite the experimental concentration of microplastics, mussels were able to acclimate to the exposure through their abilities for long-term recovery and tolerance to stresses. These data have positive implications for environmental health and in terms of human food resource because mussel farming is a worldwide practice that heavily relies on plastic materials, increasing the chances of microplastic exposure and mussels contamination.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides are extensively used and can be measured in aquatic ecosystems, including coastal waters. The effect of glyphosate on non-target organisms is an issue of worldwide concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subchronic exposure to glyphosate in juvenile oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Yearling oysters were exposed to three concentrations of glyphosate (0.1, 1 and 100 mu g L-1) for 56 days. Various endpoints were studied, from the individual level (e.g., gametogenesis and tissue alterations) to the molecular level (mRNA quantification), including biochemical endpoints such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities and malondialdehyde content. No mortality and growth occurred during the experiment, and individual biomarkers revealed only slight effects. The levels of gene expression significantly increased in oysters exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (GST and metallothioneins) or to all concentrations (multi-xenobiotic resistance). These results suggested an activation of defence mechanisms at the molecular level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper addresses a kind of risk decision-making problem existing widely in public administration and business management, which is characterized by ( 1) occurrence probabilities of states of nature can be estimated by analysing historical observations, but historical observations of different objects are unhomogeneous, ( 2) the relation between observations and occurrence probabilities of states of nature are affected by some qualitative and quantitative indicators, ( 3) it is a real-time decision-making problem, that is, there are many decisions for different objects to be made in a limited time, ( 4) considering decision's execution, impact of resource constrains is an important issue in decision-making process. In this paper, we develop a rule-based approach to address the problem. In the proposed approach, a two-step clustering method is employed to classify objects into categories, and observations in each category can be approximately viewed as homogeneous. For objects in each category, occurrence probabilities of states of nature are estimated by logistic regression, and the decision rule is obtained through solving an optimization model, which is to minimize the total decision risks while satisfying resource constrains. Effect and efficacy of our approach are illustrated through its application to China's customs inspection decision.

AB  - The companion paper, "Aged ACSR Conductors Part I - Testing Procedures", describes methods of test to determine the overall condition of Ontario Hydro's overhead conductors.  This paper presents the analysis of the test results relative to estimated "end-of-life" values.  The remaining useful life of conductors can be estimated from the curves of progressive degradation.  Air pollution studies have led to an environmental corrosion index, which has been correlated with remaining life based on the torsional ductility of steel core wires.  This has been used to map expected conductor life across the province.  The average service life is found to vary between about 67 and 77 years depending on the local contamination level.

AB  - To assess the responses of planktonic organisms to pollutants in the coastal ecosystems of Gwangyang and Jinhae bays in Korea, we investigated seasonal changes in various biological factors during the period from 2010 to 2012. Based on the characteristics of nutrient uptake by planktonic organisms under the coastal pollution conditions, we focused on four major parameters: total phytoplankton, harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and Escherichia coli to develop a planktonic index of biotic integrity (P-IBI). The threshold values for abundances of total phytoplankton, HAB species and HB were based on the zero Z-score following normal distribution of the data for each parameter during the three years. Based on this approach, the threshold values were: 1.2 x 10(6) cells L-1 for total phytoplankton; 3.3 x 10(4) cells L-1 for HAB species; and 1.7 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)for HB. Five grade levels for the P-IBI were established, based on the zero Z-scores. The threshold value for E. coli not to be normalized was based on the USEPA and the Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries guidelines. Validity of the grades and threshold values for each parameter established using the field data were tested by algal bioassays in a mesocosm enclosure, which supported the threshold values obtained in the field. In Gwangyang Bay, the annual integrated score for the P-IBI in 2010 was better than in the other years of the study. In Jinhae Bay, the P-IBI for the inner area of Masan Bay was Grade IV-V, indicating unhealthy conditions relative to the central and western outer areas, where the P-IBI varied from Grade II to III. The P-IBI values for Gwangyang and Jinhae bays were mostly rated as "Good (Grade II) or Fair (Grade III)", except for a few stations in the semi-enclosed areas of the inner part of Jinhae Bay. From an overall view based on the P-IBI developed in this study, the coastal ecosystem health status in Gwangyang Bay was in a better condition than Jinhae Bay. The P-IBI indicated also a change to an unhealthy status during the rainy periods of spring and summer, whereas during winter and autumn the index indicated healthy conditions.

AB  - This study describes variation patterns in the constant frequency (CF) segment of echolocation calls of the bat Hipposideros ruber within and among populations across the region of the Gulf of Guinea. Correlations of variation in CF with variation in body size, body condition, environmental humidity and presence of ecologically similar species are studied in an attempt to identify the forces driving the evolution of CF. We found that bats may adapt the frequency to humidity, and that CF may evolve under interspecific interactions, either of ecological or of social nature. The results support an adaptive value for the high values of CF, and challenge the 'Allotonic Frequency Hypothesis'. We found correlation between frequency and a body condition index, which may trigger social selection processes in this species sexually dimorphic in CF. Combined social and environmental selection on CF could trigger diversification of bats along ecotones separating habitats with contrasting air humidity.

AB  - Mussels within the Baltic Mytilus edulis x M. trossulus hybrid zone have adapted to the low salinities in the Baltic Sea which, however, results in slow-growing dwarfed mussels. To get a better understanding of the nature of dwarfism, we studied the ability of M. trossulus to feed and grow at low salinity (7 psu) compared with its performance at relatively high-salinity (20 psu) in controlled laboratory experiments, supplemented with field (Great Belt) growth experiments with M. trossulus and M. edulis in net-bags. Subsequently, the growth of M. trossulus transplanted in cages to various localities in the northern Baltic Sea was used to evaluate the effect of very low salinities, down to 3.4 psu. The laboratory feeding experiments with M. trossulus at 7 psu showed that the growth in shell length was negligible, whereas the body dry weight nearly doubled during the 15 d experiment, with a weight-specific growth rate of 3.7% d(-1). The same para meters measured at 20 psu showed a pronounced growth in both shell length and body dry weight, with a weight-specific growth rate of 2.2% d(-1). The growth rates of M. trossulus and M. edulis in suspended net-bags in the Great Belt (22 psu) were similar: 5.6 and 6.8% d(-1), respectively. M. trossulus in cage experiments had positive growth rates at locations with salinities above 4.5 psu, up to 2.60% d(-1), but negligible increase in the shell length, and at sites with salinities below about 4.5 psu, the somatic growth was negative, around -0.3% d(-1), which indicates valve closure and respiratory weight loss. A trend line in a plot of all available growth data for both mussel species as a function of salinity indicates that the growth of mussels is steadily hampered by reduced salinities from 30 psu down to about 10 psu, below which the growth is rapidly reduced to become negative below 4.5 psu. We suggest that reduced ability to produce shell material at extremely low salinity may explain dwarfism of mussels in the Baltic Sea. Reduced bio-calcification at low salinity, however, may impede shell growth, but not somatic growth, and this may at first result in an increased condition index, as seen in the benthic Baltic Sea mussels transferred to cages suspended in the water column.

AB  - To understand trophic responses of polar cod Boreogadus saida (a key species in Arctic food webs) to changes in zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities (prey), we compared its stomach contents and body condition between three regions with different environments: the northern Bering Sea (NB), southern Chukchi Sea (SC), and central Chukchi Sea (CC). Polar cod were sampled using a bottom trawl, and their potential prey species in the environment were sampled using a plankton net and a surface sediment sampler. Polar cod fed mainly on appendicularians in the NB and SC where copepods were the most abundant in the environment, while they fed on copepods, euphausiids, and gammarids in the CC where barnacle larvae were the most abundant species in plankton samples on average. The stomach fullness index of polar cod was higher in the NB and SC than CC, while their body condition index did not differ between these regions. The lower lipid content of appendicularians compared to other prey species is the most plausible explanation for this inconsistency.

AB  - Excessive soil nutrients, often from agricultural runoff, have been shown to negatively impact some aspects of wetland plant communities. We measured plant-available phosphorus (Mehlich-3: MeP) in soil samples, and assessed the vascular plant community and habitat degradation at 27 emergent and 13 forested wetlands in Ohio, USA. We tested two hypotheses: (1) that an index of vegetation biological integrity based on floristic quality was lower in wetlands with higher concentrations of MeP in the soil, and (2) that higher concentrations of MeP occurred in wetlands with more habitat degradation (i.e., lower quality), as estimated by a rapid assessment method. Hypothesis (1) was supported for emergent, but not for forested wetlands. Hypothesis (2) was marginally supported (P = 0.09) for emergent, but not supported for forested wetlands. The results indicate that the effect of concentration of phosphorus in wetland soils and the quality of plant species assemblages in wetlands is more complex than shown in site-specific studies and may depend in part on degree of disturbance in the surrounding watershed and dominant wetland vegetation type. Woody plants in forested wetlands are typically longer lived than herbaceous species in the understory and emergent wetlands, and may persist despite high inputs of phosphorus. Further, the forested wetlands were typically surrounded by a wide band of forest vegetation, which may provide a barrier against sedimentation and the associated phosphorus inputs to the wetland interior. Our results indicate that inferences about soil nutrient conditions made from rapid assessment methods for assessing wetland habitat condition may not be reliable. Published by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The natural history of an animal provides crucial information for more focused studies in areas such as ecology, ethology, and evolution. Dinodon orientate is a small, nocturnal, and rather rare endemic species in Japan. Here we provide information on the natural history of D. orientate including information on seasonal activity pattern, body size, body mass, and body condition index associated with sex, based on 110 individuals captured in Yamanashi Prefecture, central Japan. Both sexes demonstrated a similar trend in the seasonal activity pattern and body condition. The seasonal activity peak of both sexes was in September, probably because hatchlings appeared in September. Body condition was high at the beginning and end of the active season and low in summer. We did not observe sexual dimorphism in snout-vent length (SVL) or body mass. The seasonal trend in the body size distribution of captured snakes suggests that hatchlings of D. orientate (of around 180 mm SVL) appear in September, grow to an SVL of about 250 mm by late October, and begin hibernation in November. Juveniles emerge in April or May and grow to an SVL of around 350 mm by late September.

AB  - The relationships between female reproductive parameters (fertility, pregnancy, and lactation status) and body mass, body condition, and body length in South African fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) were investigated over 4 years. Ovulation rate in every year was 100% despite interannual differences in female body condition index (BCI). The overall pregnancy rate was 79%. The proportion of pregnant females was related to ECT but not to body mass or body length. In good years, BCI decreased through the first part of the reproductive cycle to a minimum at implantation and increased again through pregnancy. In 1989, BCI declined over the whole reproductive cycle, and there was a higher proportion of nonpregnant females and failures of lactation. Thus, poor nutritional conditions may affect reproductive success through failure to rear a pup, and pup production the following year may also be reduced. This lower rate of pregnancy is partly explained by an increase in the incidence of spontaneous abortions, but other parameters such as a lower implantation rate are also likely to be involved.

AB  - The clam Ruditapes decussatus is an important resource to preserve in coastal lagoon systems around the Mediterranean including the South Portugal. To assess spatial and temporal biomarker responses to contamination in the species, a multibiomarker approach was conducted using antioxidant enzymes, MFO system phase I and II; acetylcholinesterase, metallothionein (MT), delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and lipid peroxidation (LPO). The condition index (CI), metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also determined. The levels of contaminants were not particularly high and the antioxidant enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), MT in the digestive gland, and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) do not provide a suitable seasonal and spatial discrimination reversely to that regarding CYP450, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), MT in the gills, and LPO in both tissues. However, even those could vary with natural variables that may act as confounding factors. Thus, seasonal variability and natural range of biomarker responses must be carefully and accurately taken into account in ecotoxicological approaches of environmental quality assessment programmes.

AB  - The role of vegetation analysis by remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to support plans for sustainable development is discussed through a proposal of an index of ecosystem "integrity" or of regeneration capacity. The index is based on the vegetation "mass" of a given land cover type and the capacity that such mass has to contrast soil erosion. The index is therefore taking into account the effects of human activities and not merely the state of ecosystems in terms of their components. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the proposed index without RS and GIS techniques. These allow, respectively, to collect and to analyze the spatial data at relative low cost and in relatively short times. Time and money are the limiting factors for all the management plans. As an example of application, we have calculated the index for the Santos estuary drainage basin (Brazil) selected as a case study within the ECOMANAGE project funded by European Commission. The area was chosen because of its great economic importance and for relevant environmental problems (industrial pollution and urbanization pressure) that could limit the development. For estimating the relative vegetation mass, we have used the Leaf Area Index, while for the soil erosion, we have used the revised universal soil loss equation model. The maps of ecosystem integrity produced by the application of the index may be very useful to guide the planners in the development of the urbanization process that is threatening the "Mata Atlantica" and the mangrove forests.

AB  - A set of methodological tools were tested in order to assess the eutrophication quality of selected coastal areas in Eastern Mediterranean Sea, Greece, in the context of the Water Framework Directive under various anthropogenic pressures. Three, five-step tools, namely, TRIX, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) biomass classification scheme, and eutrophication index (El.) were applied in oligotrophic waters for (a) the whole water column and (b) the euphotic zone. The relationship among the eutrophication assessment indices and the ecological quality status (EcoQ) assessment indices for benthic macroinvertebrates (BENTIX index) and macroalgae (ecological evaluation index-EEIc) was also explored. Agricultural activities and mariculture are the pressures mostly related to the eutrophication assessment of the selected Greek coastal water bodies. Chl-a proved to be the criterion with the best overall correlation with the EcoQ indices, while TRIX with the lowest. Moreover, among the eutrophication indices, E.I. showed better overall agreement with BENTIX showing that probably it reflects the indirect relation of macroinvertebrates with water eutrophication in a better way. Among the eutrophication indices used, TRIX rather overestimated the eutrophication status of the selected coastal areas. The first stage of eutrophication was reflected more efficiently using E.I. than TRIX, but E.I. seems to be a rather sensitive index. A future modification of the high to good boundary of E.I. may be needed in order to demonstrate the high status of the relatively undisturbed Greek coastal sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental psychology is a field concerned with transactions between humans and their environments. Since human-environment interactions are culture-bound, a fuller understanding of such interactions requires sensitivity to the role of culture in the ways researchers theorize human behavior, conduct empirical studies, and interpret observed findings. In this article, we aim to advance the development of a culturally informed understanding of human-environment interactions, which we refer to as cross-cultural environmental psychology. We first discuss why a cultural perspective is useful. We then survey the field of environmental psychology as indexed by publications in this journal with a complementary set of three bibliometric analyses, which show that the field lacks cultural diversity in both its research participants and its authors, and it is in need of more cross-border, particularly cross-continent, collaborations. We offer a summary of previous cross-cultural studies in terms of how the influence of culture was conceptualized and how cross-cultural data was collected. We also provide resources and recommendations to environmental psychology researchers who are interested in conducting cross-cultural studies. We conclude the article with an illustration of the important principles and recommendations with reference to the articles in this special issue.

AB  - Using a comprehensive approach, intertidal, near- and offshore sites in the German Bight were analysed for their environmental quality by assessing the health of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). During a ten month sampling period mussels were studied with a set of biomarkers comprising lysosomal membrane stability and accumulation of lipofuscin, supplemented by biornarkers indicating nutritional status such as neutral lipids and glycogen in the cells of the digestive gland. Data were analysed in relation to sex, gonadal status, condition index and for the presence of parasites, to determine the overall health status of mussels at the respective sites. Mussels from all sites showed clear signs of stress, indicating an inferior environmental quality throughout the southern German Bight. Further, habitat characteristics such as inundation time and growing on- or off-bottom, as well as seasonal factors, can clearly influence the response of biomarkers in mussels exposed to similar levels of chemical environmental stress.

FX  - The authors are grateful to the Water and Shipping Authority (WSA) of Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven, Germany, the State Fishery Authority of Bremerhaven, Germany, and the Fishermen of Lower Saxony, Germany, who generously allowed the use of the offshore test field in the Weser estuary near the lighthouse Roter Sand for the mussel experiments. The authors are especially thankful to the WSA, who organized modification, shipping and anchoring of the buoyancy at Roter Sand. Further, we would like to thank the Niedersachsen Port Authorities (NPorts) of Wilhelmshaven, Germany, who generously allowed us to use the cargo bridge at Jade Bay for growing nearshore mussels on collector ropes. Special thanks go also to Captain Charly Lars and his crew of the AWI research vessel FK Uthorn who guided and supported us during every ship excursion. The sampling at the offshore site Roter Sand would not have been possible without the help of the AWI research diving group who spent much time and energy to obtain the mussels for all the analyses.

AB  - We evaluated the efficacy of Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti Species Complex (FIESC 20) isolates combined with extracts of Chenopodium ambrosioides and Enterolobium contortisiliquum on the in vitro mortality of Dactylopius opuntiae. Treatments used in the bioassays against D. opuntiae were selected using the Biological Index model. The interactions between control agents were calculated using the chi-squared test. The compatibility between FIESC 20 isolates and botanical extracts varied according to the type and concentration of the extracts. The aqueous extracts were the most compatible, whereas all hydroethanolic extracts of E. contortisiliquum were incompatibile with the fungi. Isolates URM6779 + 5% aqueous extract of E. contortisiliquum and URM6777 + 5% aqueous extract of E. contortisiliquum inflicted the highest levels of mortality and thus were judged good options for the control of D. opuntiae in vitro. However, it will be necessary to confirm their effectiveness as control agents under field conditions.

AB  - Douglas-Fir is the main species used in France for reforesting mid-elevation regions, mostly on former heathlands and coppices. In order to clarify its auto-ecological Limits, and to provide forest managers with relevant information for planting, we studied its productivity in a wide range of site conditions. Based on data from 202 Douglas-Fir pure stands at mid-elevation regions, site productivity was assessed using variance analysis with site types, site groups, and multiple regression analysis with ecological variables. Site index, determined from stem analysis data, was used as a species specific measure of site quality. Results show that Douglas-Fir site index is correlated to soil nutrient status, and secondarily to soil moisture regime. Mean stand productivity was generally high, but considerable variation in site index was determined within a study area that was classified by forest managers as uniform. Correlation between site classification and site index was confirmed, because it was based on synoptic factors that are simple and robust indicators of site productivity. Other methods to assess site quality, such as multiple regression on ecological variables and multivariate site groups, appear to be less explicative and robust for predicting site index. The results allow forest managers to predict the site index at parcel scale. Further investigation should be carried out in order to explain the major causes of the unexplained variance of site index by ecological variables, especially genetic variation, and effect of age.

AB  - This study reports the effect of an aqueous extract from Moringa oleifera Lam. flowers on Biomphalaria glabrata embryos and adults and on Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. The extract contains tannins, saponins, flavones, flavonols, xanthones, and trypsin inhibitor activity. The toxicity of the extract on Artemia sauna larvae was also investigated to determine the safety of its use for schistosomiasis control. After incubation for 24 h, the flower extract significantly (p < 0.05) delayed the development of B. glabrata embryos and promoted mortality of adult snails (LC50: 237 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)). Furthermore, treatment with the extract disrupted the development of embryos generated by snails, with most of them remaining in the blastula stage while control embryos were already in the gastrula stage. Flower extract killed A. sauna larvae with a LC50 value (0.2 +/- 0.015 mg mL(-1)) lower than that determined for snails. A small reduction (17%) in molluscicidal activity was detected when flower extract (2.37 mg mL(-1)) was exposed to tropical environmental conditions (UVI index ranging from 1 to 14, temperature from 25 to 30 degrees C, and 65% relative humidity). Toxicity to A. sauna was also reduced (LC50 value of 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg mL(-1)). In conclusion, M. oleifera flower extract had deleterious effects on B. glabrata adults and embryos. However, unrestricted use to control schistosomiasis should be avoided due to the toxicity of this extract on A. sauna. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly under threat as they are confronted with multiple anthropogenic impairments. This calls for comprehensive management strategies to counteract, or even prevent, long-termimpacts on habitats and their biodiversity, as well as on their ecological functions and services. The basis for the efficient management and effective conservation of any ecosystem is sufficient knowledge on the state of the system and its response to external influence factors. In freshwater ecosystems, state information is currently drawn from ecological assessments at the reach or site scale. While these assessments are essential, they are not sufficient to assess the expected outcome of different river restoration strategies, because they do not account for important characteristics of the whole river network, such as habitat connectivity or headwater reachability. This is of particular importance for the spatial prioritization of restoration measures. River restoration could be supported best by integrative catchment-scale ecological assessments that are sensitive to the spatial arrangement of river reaches and barriers. Assessments at this scale are of increasing interest to environmental managers and conservation practitioners to prioritize restoration measures or to locate areas worth protecting. We present an approach based on decision support methods that integrates abiotic and biotic ecological assessments at the reach-scale and aggregates them spatially to describe the ecological state of entire catchments. This aggregation is based on spatial criteria that represent important ecological catchment properties, such as fish migration potential, resilience, fragmentation and habitat diversity in a spatially explicit way. We identify the most promising assessment criteria from different alternatives based on theoretical considerations and a comparison with biological indicators. Potential applications are discussed, particularly for supporting the strategic, long-term planning and spatial prioritization of restoration measures. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Objective
   Relaxed natural selection, measured by Biological State Index (I-bs), results in unfavourable genes/mutations accumulation in population. Obesity is partly heritable. We aim to examine and compare the effects of relaxed natural selection on male and female obesity prevalence.
   Methods
   Data for 191 countries of the world were captured for this ecological study. Curvilinear regressions, bivariate and partial correlations, linear mixed models and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between I-bs and sex-specific obesity prevalence. Per capita GDP, urbanization and caloric intake were controlled for as the confounding factors. Fisher r-to-z transformation, R-2 increment in multivariate regression and F-test were used to compare the correlations.
   Results
   Curvilinear regressions, bivariate and partial correlations (controlled for GDP, urbanization and calories) revealed that I-bs was significantly correlated to obesity prevalence of both sexes, but significantly stronger to male than to female obesity prevalence. Curvilinear regression models also showed strong correlations. Mixed linear models, with effects of GDP, urbanisation and caloric intake controlled for, showed that male and female average obesity prevalence rates were significantly higher in countries with greater I-bs value than their equivalents in countries with lower I-bs. Between higher and lower I-bs countries, the gap of male obesity prevalence is 60% greater than the gap of female obesity prevalence. Stepwise multiple regression identified that I-bs was a significant predictor of obesity prevalence of both sexes. Multivariate regression showed that, adding I-bs as an obesity predictor, R-2 increment in male model was significantly greater than in female model.
   Conclusions
   Relaxed natural selection may drive males and females to accumulate metabolic faulty genes equally. Probably due to greater environmental, personal intervention in regulating female body mass, relaxed natural selection shows less contributing effects to female obesity prevalence than to male obesity prevalence. Gene therapy to prevent obesity may need to be also taken into account.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - We evaluated the relative importance of "bottom-up" (production-limited) and "top-down" (predator-mediated) processes during early marine residence in a population of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Columbia River, USA. We examined length, mass, and condition index of age-0 juveniles collected in the ocean during June and September across 11 years in relation to conditions in the river, estuary, and coastal ocean and to future adult returns. Characteristics of juveniles in September, but not June, were related to adult returns. During years when coastal waters were relatively cool and productive, juveniles captured in September displayed relatively low condition and reduced otolith growth compared with years when coastal waters were relatively warm and unproductive; this contrast indicates that top-down effects such as selective mortality or competition are important during early marine residence. Key physical (river plume volume during emigration) and biological (condition) variables and their interaction accounted for >95% of the variation in adult returns. Future research should focus on evaluating predators and competitors and understanding how river plume structure influences survival.

AB  - Pressure-state-response environmental indicators are proposed for New Zealand fish stocks. This work was a technical background to the development of a core set of indicators sought by the Ministry for the Environment. It has led, through an extensive programme of consultation, to a set of confirmed indicators. The initial proposals and their basis are described together with their relationship to the confirmed indicators. The proposed indicators could readily be calculated as part of the stock assessments conducted annually by the Ministry of Fisheries and this is recommended. For many stocks, especially minor stocks, only proxies for the preferred indicators would be possible. The proxy indicators would not be useful in all cases, and target or threshold values for them could generally not be calculated. Shortcomings and difficulties in the proposed indicators are described. A state indicator that separates changes induced by fishing from those of a natural origin is described, but it could be obtained for only a few stocks.

AB  - Monitoring changes in financial conditions provides valuable information on the contribution of financial risks to future economic growth. For that purpose, central banks need real-time indicators to promptly adjust their policy stance. In this paper, we extend the quarterly growth-at-risk (GaR) approach of Adrian et al. (2019) by accounting for the high-frequency nature of financial conditions indicators. Specifically, we use Bayesian mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) quantile regressions to exploit the information content of both a financial stress index and a financial conditions index, leading to real-time high-frequency GaR measures for the euro area. We show that our daily GaR indicator (i) displays good GDP nowcasting properties, (ii) can provide an early signal of GDP downturns, and (iii) allows day-to-day assessment of the effects of monetary policies. During the first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic period, it has provided a timely measure of the tail risks to euro-area GDP. (C) 2021 International Institute of Forecasters.

AB  - Macrophyte-based methods for lake ecological status assessment universally include hydrophytes. Emergent plants (helophytes) are presumed to respond more directly to soil characteristics, wind exposure or shoreline management, hence are usually not considered as reliable indicators of water nutrient enrichment. The aims of the study were to explore the potential role of helophytes as eutrophication indicators and to test whether including or excluding emergent vegetation affects the indicator value of the Ecological State Macrophyte Index (ESMI) used in lake monitoring in Poland. Data on macrophyte composition and abundance (76 hydrophyte and 48 helophyte communities) and water quality from 490 Polish lowland lakes were analysed. Based on the frequency distribution and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordination, helophyte communities that exhibited clear trends of occurrence and abundance along the eutrophication gradient and enabled differentiation between lakes in diverse ecological conditions were identified. The effect of emergent vegetation on assessment metric diagnostic capacity was tested using modified index ESMI calculated with helophytes being included (CompESMI(TOT)) and excluded (CompESMI(HYDR)) by comparing correlations between both metrics and eutrophication indicators (trophic state indices). Compared to CompESMI(TOT), CompESMI(HYDR) correlated slightly, though significantly weaker with most of the water quality indicators, and only for TSITP the difference in metric responses was statistically non-significant. The added diagnostic value of including emergent vegetation was between 0.04 and 0.08 of r(2) increase and this benefit was more pronounced in more degraded lakes. The presented results demonstrated that emergent vegetation provides reliable information on ecosystem ecological conditions and can support assessment of the ecological status of lakes under eutrophication pressure.

AB  - This paper represents an overview of feasible modelling approaches concerning the habitat suitability as well as the development of "biological quality components", which are to be consulted as indicators of reaching the "good ecologically state" within the implementation of the European water framework directive. An analysis of the coherent literature shows that habitat models are able to support action plans, however, depending on the local situation they must be supplemented by individual-based, migration- and (meta-) population models. Therefore, a five step procedure is being suggested.

AB  - The present study analyzed the Na/K-ATPase activity (mu mol ADP/mg protein/h) of Macrobrachium rosenbergii larvae at specific developmental stages using different environmental concentrations of sodium vs potassium and calcium vs magnesium, for pairwise comparison. In addition, we also compared the effect of various sodium potassium adsorption ratio (SPAR) mediums to Na/K-ATPase activity. The first experiment compared the effect of sodium concentrations (4000 and 5000 ppm) vs potassium concentrations (150 and 200 ppm), while the second experiment compared the effect of calcium concentrations (180 and 240 ppm) vs magnesium concentrations (300 and 400 ppm), as in pairwise combination on the Na/K-ATPase activity. The third experiment compared Na/K-ATPase activity for various SPAR mediums (20, 30, 40 and 50). Larval condition index (LCI), larval dry weight and percent survival were determined at the 1st, 4th, 7th and 11th stages for each experiment. For each experimental treatment, triplicate 80-l closed-loop RAS systems were used. Initial larvae stocking density was 300 larvae l(-1). For each container, a 40 mg batch of larvae was collected at each of the 4 larval stages to analyze Na/K-ATPase activity and LCI. These results revealed that at the 1st and 4th larval stages both sodium and potassium independently and in combination, affected (P < 0.05) Na/K-ATPase activity. However, at the 7th stage, enzyme activity was confirmed only among the treatments, independently. At the 11th stage, enzyme activity was demonstrated among the combined treatments, in addition to potassium, alone. Calcium and magnesium only showed larval Na/K-ATPase activity independently at the 1st and 4th larval stages. Results also showed that at the 1st and 4th larval stages, Na/K-ATPase activity was significantly higher for SPAR 20 but, at the 7th and 11th stages the enzyme activity was significantly higher at both SPAR 20 and 30. Accordingly, our findings have demonstrated that, Na/K-ATPase activity is highly variable during M. rosenbergii larval development and that it is mainly affected by interactions of common environmental macro-elements involved in larval osmoregulation. As such, we recommend M. rosenbergii hatcheries to operate as close as possible to SPAR 30 for early larval development and SPAR 40 for later larval development.

AB  - The composition, distribution and source of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments and tissues of the mussel Modiolus capax from three sites with increasing anthropogenic impact in La Paz Bay on the Gulf of California, were determined. Levels of total PAHs in sediments (18.9-94.5 ng/g dw) were below the effect range low for marine sediments at all sites. PAHs in mussels (147.01-271.09) were higher than in sediments and similar to mussels from other moderately contaminated sites. The origin of PAHs was predominantly petrogenic, attributed to port activities and a thermoelectric plant. The mussels of Las Pacas and Pichilingue showed the lowest condition indexes and some organisms with the presence of benzo(a)pyrene in their tissues, which is among the most toxic hydrocarbons and may represent a risk to human health. However, this study only represents a baseline for future studies, which are necessary to dismiss risks to human health and the ecosystem. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding growth in early life stages is fundamental for commercial fisheries management, but there are few studies dealing with growth trajectory divergences occurring during the juvenile stage. We monitored the growth of individually tagged two-year-old juvenile Greenland halibut captured in the wild and maintained at 4 degrees C for 17 months. The animals were still at the juvenile stage (no ovary or testis development through the maturation stage) at the end of the experiment. In the absence of energetic allocation to gonad development, female juveniles were larger than male juveniles, with a greater gain in mass and length. Female juveniles rapidly reached a higher Fulton's condition index compared to male juveniles. However, no difference in glycogen, lipid, or protein liver composition or muscle energy storage was found between the sexes. Plasma cortisol was higher in male juveniles, suggesting males were more sensitive to captivity than females. Pre-maturation divergences in juvenile growth could result in or accentuate the size-related sexual dimorphism observed in nature among adults.

AB  - The chemical contamination (organic compounds, metals, radionuclides, microplastics, nutrients) of English Channel waters has been reviewed, focussing on the sources, concentrations and impacts. River loads were only reliable for Pb, whereas atmospheric loads appeared robust for Cd, Pb, Hg, PCB-153 and gamma-HCH. Temporal trends in atmospheric inputs were decreasing. Contaminant concentrations in biota were relatively constant or decreasing, but not for Cd, Hg and HBCDD, and deleterious impacts on fish and copepods were reported. However, data on ecotoxicological effects were generally sparse for legacy and emerging contaminants. Intercomparison of activity concentrations of artificial radionuclides in sediments and biota on both Channel coasts was hindered by differences in methodological approaches. Riverine phosphate loads decreased with time, while nitrate loads remained uniform. Increased biomass of algae, attributable to terrestrial inputs of nutrients, has affected benthic production and shellfisheries. A strategic approach to the identification of contaminant impacts on marine biota is recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under the assertions of making the EIA process more agile and less bureaucratic, some countries have taken opposing measures to democratize environmental management by reducing public involvement by adopting controversial changes such as eliminating the public participation of special classes of projects. The importance attached to public participation in practice is echoed in the scientific literature not only as a principle in itself, but there seems to be a general agreement that public participation is also central to an effective environmental assessment. This article aims to identify the forms of public participation in the EIA process of projects in the State of Espirito Santo. In order to do so, the documentary research methodology was adopted within the framework of the State Environmental Institute, in the environmental licensing processes of projects that presented an Environmental Impact Study. Decree No. 1,777-R, which provides for the System for the Licensing and Control of Pollution and Environmental Degradation Activities / SILCAP, which is currently the main instrument used by the state environmental activities related to environmental licensing. The survey included all the physical and digital documents available for public participation in 44 environmental licensing processes between January 2007 and May 2016.

AB  - Bouchung Stream is a large tributary of the Geum River watershed that is simultaneously affected by wastewater treatment plant effluents and agricultural activities in the watershed area. The focal subject was to diagnose the chemical and biological health of the temperate stream by using a combined approach of the multi-metric water pollution index (WPI) and the index of biological integrity (IBIKR), using datasets from 2008-2014. Water chemistry analyses indicated seasonal and inter-annual variations mainly linked to the intensity of monsoon rainfall in the watershed, potentially causing the availability of agricultural runoff water. The main events of phosphorus inflow and nitrogen dilutions occurred during July-August. Temporal and spatial heterogeneities were observed and were largely recognizable due to nutrient enrichment and organic matter intensification. Chlorophyll showed weak linear relation to total phosphorus (R-2 = 0.17) but no relation to total nitrogen (p > 0.05). Fish compositions analyzed as trophic/tolerance guilds in relation to water chemistry showed visible decline and modifications. Average WPI site scores ranged from 33-23, indicating an excellent upstream to fair downstream water quality status. Correspondingly, IBIKR scores ranged between 38-28 approximating with WPI site classification, as well as both indices showed higher regression relation (R-2 = 0.90). Fish guild analyses revealed tolerant and omnivore species dominating the downstream, while sensitive and insectivores depleting in approximation with changing water chemistry and was confirmed by the principal component analysis. In addition, the fish guilds meticulously responded to phosphorus inflows. In conclusion, overall stream health and water chemistry analyses indicated continuous chemical and biological degradation influencing the trophic and tolerance fish guilds. Moreover, the combined application approach of WPI and IBIKR could help in better understanding the chemical and biological mechanisms in rivers and streams.

AB  - Sound environmental management to control marine plastic pollution requires a careful assessment of environmental costs and benefits of replacing single-use plastics with their biodegradable counterparts. This research employs the standard life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to assess and compare the environmental impact of plastic straws made from polypropylene (PP), and its biodegradable alternatives made from polylactic acid (PLA) and paper (PA) in the United States. Eight environmental impact categories, not including marine litter, were analyzed and a composite relative environmental impact index (REI) was derived for quantitative comparison. The results show that US daily consumption of disposable drinking straws (500 million straws daily) may carry significant environmental burdens regardless of straw types, with the feedstock manufacture stage of the life cycle creating most of the contribution. The REI index values were 2.4 for PP straws, 6.4 for PLA straws, and 5.1 for PA straws with landfill and 3.2 for PP straws, 6.8 for PLA straws, and 4.9 for PA straws with incineration. A sensitivity analysis did not show much change in REI with increasing marine litter rate, demonstrating that replacing PP straws with PLA or PA straws for controlling marine plastic pollution would come with environmental costs in other categories. The trade-off can be quantitatively represented by the difference in REI between PP straws and PA or PLA straws. Our analysis also indicates close-loop recycling can greatly reduce the environmental impact of PP straws, serving as a technological development to control plastic pollution. While disposable straws were used as a case study in this work, the findings are extensive to other single-use products.

AB  - Prescribed fire is a common tool used to conserve and manage the integrity of forest ecosystems. We investigated short-term juvenile amphibian capture and body condition changes subsequent to fire (i.e., one prescribed burn and two wildfires) in a southern United States pine forest. We surveyed amphibians and predatory invertebrates before and after fires occurring during summer 2010. We tested for treatment (i.e., control, wildfire, or prescribed burn) and status (i.e., preburn or postburn) differences in 1) genus-level captures, 2) amphibian health (inferred through a body condition index), and 3) predatory invertebrate captures. Bufo and Scaphiopus captures increased in the prescribed burn treatment; whereas, no differences in Gastrophryne captures were observed. We did not detect a burn status effect on amphibian body condition. Predatory invertebrate captures were higher postburn in the control and wildfire treatments. Neither a low-intensity prescribed burn nor high-intensity wildfires negatively impacted short-term juvenile amphibian captures. Further, we speculate that Bufo and Scaphiopus survivorship may have been higher after the prescribed burn.

AB  - The results of long-term bioindication studies aimed to evaluate the state of the silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) in Yoshkar-Ola under different anthropogenic load conditions are presented. An increase in the morphometric indices of the shoot system and leaf lamina area under anthropogenic load was observed. The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) index of B. pendula leaves growing on short shoots did not depend on the ontogenetic state of the tree, while in the case of leaves collected from long shoots, such a dependence was revealed. The most informative morphometric parameters of B. pendula indicating the state of the environment included the FA index of leaves growing on short shoots and the damaged leaf area.

AB  - Lake Peipsi sensu lato consists of limnologically and hydrochemically different parts, Lake Peipsi sensu stricto, Lake Lammijarv, and Lake Pihkva. The eutrophic L. Peipsi s.s. and the hypertrophic Lake Pihkva were studied. The aim was to find out if the ecological state of these lake parts has improved, stabilized or deteriorated during a ten-year period, 2003-2012. For this purpose, data on loadings, in-lake nutrient concentrations, water transparency, water level, chlorophyll a concentration, as well as phyto- and zooplankton were compared for two five-year sub-periods (2003-2007 and 2008-2012). Comparison demonstrated a decline in the loading of total phosphorus (TP) from rivers on the Estonian and Russian sides as well as in its mean concentration in both lake parts. Both phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial biomass decreased in response to the reduced nutrient content in the lake water. The responses of zooplankton were contradictory. Changes in the occurrence of indicator species and declining mean zooplankter weight reflected a continuous eutrophication process while changes in the abundance of rotifers and the genus Daphnia indicated a subtle shift towards recovery. Our results show a modest improvement in the ecological condition of both lake parts.

AB  - Background. Klein's sole, Synapturichthys kleinii (Risso, 1827), is a rare fish, included in the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient, and its biology is poorly known. Biological investigations of S. kleinii have been surprisingly rare in Tunisian waters. In the presently reported study, we investigated the reproductive period, size at first sexual maturity, and fecundity of S. kleinii along the Tunisian waters, with the aim of achieving the first complete and comprehensive description of the reproduction of this fish in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Materials and methods. A total of 294 specimens of S. kleinii were sampled over two years, off the Tunisian coasts. Sex ratio was estimated through the seasons of the year and the size classes. The stage of maturity was determined macroscopically only for females. Monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI), monthly hepatosomatic index (HSI), and condition factor (K) were calculated for males and females of S. kleinii. Size at first maturity was estimated only for females during the spawning season. Eighteen mature females at spawning stage were collected, weighed, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution for fecundity estimation.
   Results. Annual sex ratio showed significant differences between males and females. In specimens exceeding 27 cm in total length females outnumbered males significantly. The Klein's sole reproduction period started in October and ended in January. The gonadosomatic index reached highest values in November for females and males. Females attained sexual maturity at 20.53 cm total body length (TL). Total fecundity ranged from 3647 to 23 174 eggs. We found a low correlation coefficient between total fecundity and total length, but a high correlation coefficient between eviscerated weight and ovary weight.
   Conclusion. Our results constitute a preliminary baseline for monitoring changes in the biological indexes linked to the reproduction cycle and length at first sexual maturity of S. kleinii. The presently acquired data will enable biologists to assess the status of this fish and develop culture technology in natural waters and will be useful for the fishery biologists and conservation biologists, for successful development, management, production, and ultimate conservation of this favoured Tunisian food fish.

AB  - To evaluate the importance of non-consumptive effects of predators on prey life histories under natural conditions, an index of predator abundance was developed for naturally occurring populations of a common prey fish, the yellow perch Perca flavescens, and compared to life-history variables and rates of prey energy acquisition and allocation as estimated from mass balance models. The predation index was positively related to maximum size and size at maturity in both male and female P. flavescens, but not with life span or reproductive investment. The predation index was positively related to size-adjusted specific growth rates and growth efficiencies but negatively related to model estimates of size-adjusted specific consumption and activity rates in both vulnerable (small) and invulnerable (large) size classes of P. flavescens. These observations suggest a trade-off between growth and activity rates, mediated by reduced activity in response to increasing predator densities. Lower growth rates and growth efficiencies in populations with fewer predators, despite increased consumption suggests either 1) a reduction in prey resources at lower predator densities or 2) an intrinsic cost of rapid prey growth that makes it unfavourable unless offset by a perceived threat of predation. This study provides evidence of trade-offs between growth and activity rates induced by predation risk in natural prey fish populations and illustrates how behavioural modification induced through predation can shape the life histories of prey fish species.

AB  - An environmental assessment of 16 sampling sites in the Iskar River catchment has been fulfilled accomplished for the period April 2004 - August 2006. The following basic structural parameters of macrozoobenthic communities have been determined: dominance (c), evenness (e), species diversity (H), species richness (d) and the saprobic index after Pantle & Buck.
   The larger part of the upper river stream was in the best ecological state. The saprobic index varied between xenosaproby and beta-mesosaproby, and the macrozoobenthic communities were stable and ecologically sufficient. Local worsening of the saprobic condition was observed only below the town of Samokov, where the saprobic index was between beta-or alpha-mesosaproby. The worst environmental conditions were observed in the middle part of the Iskar River. The macrozoobenthic communities at Novi Iskar sampling site (after the city of Sofia) were highly disrupted and the saprobic index showed polysaproby as a result of high organic loading. At the sampling site near to Eliseina the disruption of the community structure was also observed during some seasons, but the probable reason for that was the heavy metal pollution. A slow improvement of the ecological state as a result of active self-purification was reported at the stations located in the lower river stream. In the section between Koinare and Oryahovitsa the state was stable beta-mesosaproby. The specific conditions near the village of Gigen right before the infusion into the Danube (slow stream velocity, unsuitable sandy substrate, and large variations in depth due to the direct influence of the Danube River) did not allow the development of stable makrozoobenthic communities.

AB  - The impact of vertical wind shear on the sensitivity of tropical cyclogenesis to environmental rotation and thermodynamic state is investigated through idealized cloud-resolving simulations of the intensification of an incipient vortex. With vertical shear, tropical cyclones intensify faster with a higher Coriolis parameter, f, irrespective of the environmental thermodynamic state. The vertical shear develops a vertically tilted vortex, which undergoes a precession process with the midlevel vortices rotating cyclonically around the surface center. With a higher f, the midlevel vortices are able to rotate continuously against the vertical shear, leading to the realignment of the tilted vortex and rapid intensification. With a lower f, the rotation is too slow such that the midlevel vortices are advected away from the surface center and the intensification is suppressed. The parameter, (b), measuring the effect from the low-entropy downdraft air on the boundary layer entropy, is found to be a good indicator of the environmental thermodynamic favorability for tropical cyclogenesis in vertical shear. Without vertical shear, tropical cyclones are found to intensify faster with a lower f by previous studies. We show this dependency on f is sensitive to the environmental thermodynamic state. The thermodynamical favorability for convection can be measured by (m), which estimates the time it takes for surface fluxes to moisten the midtroposphere. A smaller (m) not only leads to a faster intensification due to a shorter period for moist preconditioning of the inner region but also neutralizes the faster intensification with a lower f due to enhanced peripheral convection.

AB  - .In this paper, we explore a new parametric class of exact solutions of the Einstein field equations (EFEs) under the Karmarkar condition for anisotropic fluids. The solutions are verified by examining different physical aspects, viz. static stability criterion, energy conditions, stability factor, adiabatic index, causality condition, in connection to their cogency. Due to the well behaved nature of the solutions for different n values, we develop models of objects with different masses and radii, such as PSR J1614-2230, Cen X-1, Her X-1, Vela X-1, LMC X-4 and SMC X-4 and discuss the behavior with a graphical representation of the class of solutions of the first three objects extensively.

AB  - Assessing risks to marine ecosystems is critical due to their biological and economic importance, and because many have recently undergone regime shifts due to overfishing and environmental change. Yet defining collapsed ecosystem states, selecting informative indicators and reconstructing long-term marine ecosystem changes remains challenging. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems constitutes the global standard for quantifying risks to ecosystems and we conducted the first Red List assessment of an offshore marine ecosystem, focusing on the southern Benguela in South Africa. We used an analogous but collapsed ecosystem - the northern Benguela - to help define collapse in the southern Benguela and derived collapse thresholds with structured expert elicitation (i.e. repeatable estimation by expert judgment). To capture complex ecosystem dynamics and reconstruct historical ecosystem states, we used environmental indicators as well as survey-, catch- and model-based indicators. We listed the ecosystem in 1960 and 2015 as Endangered, with assessment outcomes robust to alternative model parametrizations. While many indicators improved between 1960 and 2015, seabird populations have suffered large declines since 1900 and remain at risk, pointing towards ongoing management priorities. Catch-based indicators often over-estimated risks compared to survey- and model-based indicators, warning against listing ecosystems as threatened solely based on indicators of pressure. We show that risk assessments provide a framework for interpreting data from indicators, ecosystem models and experts to inform the management of marine ecosystems. This work highlights the feasibility of conducting Red List of Ecosystems assessments for marine ecosystems.

AB  - The environmental importance of peatlands has stimulated efforts to restore their specific ecosystem structure and functions. Monitoring and assessment of the ecological state of the peatland is fundamental in restoration programmes. Most studies have focused on the responses of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, on testate amoebae (TA). To our knowledge, none have investigated whether these two groups show concordance in the context of restoration of drained peatland. Here we assess community concordance between TA and vegetation in boreal peatlands belonging to four different land use management classes (natural, drained, restored 3-7 years ago, and restored 9-12 years ago). TA and vegetation communities were concordant when all of the studied sites were compared. However, there was no concordance within management classes except for sites restored 3-7 years ago. We found that TA and vegetation communities are not surrogates of one another when measuring the success of restoration, and that thorough studies of both communities are required to build a holistic understanding of the changes during restoration from an ecosystem perspective. TA seemed to respond faster to changes caused by restoration and, hence, could be better early indicators of restoration success than plants. Furthermore, studies of the relationships between TA and plant communities could provide important insights to aid understanding of the link between the recovery of ecosystem structure and the reinstatement of ecosystem functions.

AB  - To meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, the States of Maryland and Virginia are using benthic biological criteria for identifying impaired waters in Chesapeake Bay and reporting their overall condition. The Chesapeake Bay benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) is the basis for these biological criteria. Working together with the states and the US Environmental Protection Agency, we developed a method for impairment decisions based on the B-IBI. The impaired waters decision approach combines multiple benthic habitat-dependent indices in a Bay segment (equivalent to water bodies in the European Water Framework Directive) with a statistical test of impairment. The method takes into consideration uncertainty in reference conditions, sampling variability, multiple habitats, and sample size. We applied this method to 1430 probability-based benthic samples in 85 Chesapeake Bay segments. Twenty-two segments were considered impaired for benthic community condition. The final decision for each segment considers benthic condition in combination with key stressors such as dissolved oxygen and toxic contaminants. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The selection of the best weed control option can be improved using decision-support systems considering the different factors affecting the efficacy (weed species, growth stage, climatic conditions) and the economics of the treatments. An interactive microcomputer program called GESTINF has been developed to assist in the selection of weed control options in soybean and winter wheat. Using observed weed densities, crop weed-free yield and grain price as input data, the program estimates potential crop damage from multispecies weed complexes and ranks the different weed control options according to expected net returns. The program also gives estimates of yield loss due to weeds surviving the treatment and an environmental index indicating how hazardous the treatment is for the water-table, thus allowing a selection of treatments both on an economic and an environmental basis. The system has been tested for 4 years in different locations of north-eastern Italy. The system forecasted the yield losses observed in the field fairly accurately and proved capable of selecting appropriate interventions on the basis of type of flora and weed growth stage.

AB  - Stomach contents of skipjack tuna 46-70 cm in total length and caught off the Canary Islands by live bait between May 1988 and January 1991 were analyzed. Of the 400 stomachs examined, 33.7% (135) were empty. In the remaining stomachs (265), 59.4% of the prey were digested while 40.6% were undigested. All the undigested prey were consumed as live bait and consisted of chub mackerel Scomber japonicus (76.9%), sardine Sardina pilchardus (10.7%), bogue Boops boops (7.3%) and silverside Atherina presbyter (5.1%). Digested food was only chub mackerel. Of this prey, a part was consumed as bait (36.1%) and the remaining as natural food (63.9%). Adult skipjack were not found to feed on their young. Chub mackerel consumed as natural food ranged between 14 and 25 cm in total length. Skipjack 46-58 cm in total length fed on chub mackerel 14-19 cm while larger skipjack preyed on chub mackerel 18-25 cm. The percentage of body mass ingested by the skipjack was enough to sustain its condition index at an optimum level.

AB  - The occurrence and composition of toxic algae, and presence of viruses and other human microbial pathogens in production areas of mussels are factors determining suitability of mussel products for human consumption. As bivalves feed by filtering large volumes of water, potentially toxic viruses, algae, and bacteria as well as phytoplankton are ingested. With the expansion of mussel aquaculture and subsequent increase in human consumption of mussel products, improved risk management is required for consumer protection. For example, shifting production to offshore areas (e.g. wind farms) can decrease the hazards of infection due to dilution of contaminants, and increase overall health of mussels. In addition, the deployment of off-bottom cultivation methods such as longlines increases the condition index, growth, and aesthetic appearance of mussels. However, other hazards like algal toxins not yet monitored on a regular basis, may play a more important rule offshore. Here, we present an analysis of biological, economic, and consumer health-related aspects of mussel cultivation under near- and offshore conditions.

AB  - The clam Ruditapes decussatus was transplanted from a natural recruitment area of Ria Formosa to three sites, surveyed for nutrients in water and sediments. Specimens were sampled monthly for determination of Escherichia coli, condition index and gonadal index. Higher nutrient values in low tide reflect drainage, anthropogenic sources or sediment regeneration, emphasising the importance of water mixing in the entire lagoon driven by the tide. Despite the increase of effluent discharges in summer due to tourism, nutrient concentrations and E. coli in clams were lower in warmer periods. The bactericide effect of temperature and solar radiation was better defined in clams from the inlet channel site than from sites closer to urban effluents. High temperature in summer and torrential freshwater inputs to Ria Formosa may anticipate climate change scenarios for south Europe. Seasonal variation of nutrients and dam contamination may thus point to possible alterations in coastal lagoons and their ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The reproductive cycle and gonadal development of Donax striatus from a sandy beach in Ajuruteua, Amazon region, were studied. Monthly sampling took place from March 2015 to April 2016. Histological analysis was performed on 420 individuals, and the oocyte diameters were determined from histological sections and used to determine the reproductive period. The population showed a balanced sex ratio (1:1) with a size at first maturity of 10.9 mm in males and 8.9 mm in females. The population showed r-strategist characteristics and continuous spawning, and the reproductive cycle showed no seasonal variation or significant relation with any environmental parameter. The organic matter was significantly higher in the rainy season. According to the generalized linear model analysis (GLM), only the condition index (CI) had a significant relationship with the organic matter of the sediment. The type of reproductive strategy adopted by D. striatus corroborates the global breeding hypotheses for species of tropical environments. For conservation, it should be recommended to harvest this species at a shell length above 13 mm.

AB  - Significant efforts are invested in field studies using fish, and it is important to optimize the number of organisms collected to evaluate the possible impacts of contamination. This paper provides ecotoxicologists with the approximate numbers of fish needed to identify statistically significant differences among samples using physiological indices and biochemical markers of fish health. The numbers of fish to collect are reported for ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD); ethoxycoumarin-o-deethylase (ECOD), serum sorbitol dehydrogenase (sSDH), stress proteins, gonadosomatic index, liver somatic index, condition factor, and biliary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The number of fish to collect was as few as four for ECOD activity (with a power of 80%), but as high as 106 for CF (with a power of 95%). Achieving statistical significance between sites does not help in the interpretation of the biological significance of a parameter, but well-planned field samplings will maximize the chances of correctly identifying areas of concern.

AB  - 1. An Index of Stream Condition (ISC) has been developed to assist broad scale management of waterways by providing an integrated measure of their environmental condition.
   2. The ISC provides scores for five components of stream condition: (i) hydrology (based on change in volume and seasonality of flow from natural conditions); (ii) physical form (based on bank stability, bed erosion or aggradation, influence of artificial barriers, and abundance and origin of coarse woody debris); (iii) streamside zone (based on types of plants; spatial extent, width, and intactness of riparian vegetation; regeneration of overstorey species, and condition of wetlands and billabongs); (iv) water quality (based on an assessment of phosphorus, turbidity, electrical conductivity and pH); and (v) aquatic life (based on number of families of macroinvertebrates).
   3. The ISC is intended for use by managers at state and regional levels and can be used to report on stream condition, assist with priority setting, judge the long-term effectiveness of rehabilitation programs and assist with adaptive management. The best available scientific information was used by a multidisciplinary group of scientists and managers to create a stream assessment procedure that can be used routinely by people with limited scientific training.
   4. ISC development included trials in four catchments in Victoria, Australia. Over 80 stream reaches were assessed and the results were used to refine the ISC to improve the ease of measurement and ensure that outcomes met the expectations of users. The ISC is now available to be used more widely for reporting on stream condition.

AB  - A Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) was developed for the Moiben River. The index assesses effects of human disturbance on the biotic condition of stream macroinvertebrate communities. Eight stations were selected to represent different land-use types including forestry, settlement, grassland and mixed farming, practiced at different intensities. A total of 22 metrics were correlated against habitat quality and water quality parameters to determine their interrelationships. Ten metrics were shown to be responsive to changes in water and habitat quality, so could be used to separate sites according to levels of degradation. These were taxa richness (of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and intolerant taxa richness), assemblage composition (percentage Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera [EPT] individuals, and percentage of individuals in dominant taxa), pollution tolerance (percentage of tolerant individuals) and three functional feeding group metrics (ratio of scraper:filterer individuals, percentage gatherer genera, and percentage predator individuals). We calculated B-IBIs by summing metrics for each site, after transforming them to a discrete 1, 3, 5 scale. Values for the final index correlated well with measures of human influence based on qualitative assessment of habitat quality (Pearson's r(2) = 0.88). This preliminary benthic macroinvertebrate B-IBI shows promise for developing biological standards, which would facilitate long-term monitoring of streams in the upper reaches of Lake Victoria Basin.

AB  - As part of a regional study by the Atlantic Slope Consortium (ASC) to develop ecological and socioeconomic indicators of aquatic ecosystem condition, we developed and tested a protocol for rapidly assessing condition of the stream, wetland, and riparian components of freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Aspects of hydrology, vegetation, in-stream and wetland characteristics, and on-site stressors were measured in the field. The resulting metrics were used to develop an index of overall condition, termed the Stream Wetland-Riparian (SWR) Index. Values of this Index were compared to existing biotic indices and chemical measures, and to a Landscape Index created using satellite-based land cover data and a geographic information system (GIS). Comparisons were made at several levels of spatial aggregation and resolution, from site to small watershed. The SWR Index and associated Landscape Indices were shown to correlate highly with biological indicators of stream condition at the site level and for small contributing areas. The landscape patterns prevalent throughout the entire watershed do not necessarily match the patterns found adjacent to the stream network. We suggest a top-down approach that managers can use to sequentially apply these methods, to first prioritize watersheds based on a relative condition measure provided by the Landscape Index, and then assess condition and diagnose stressors of aquatic resources at the subwatershed and site level.

AB  - The reproductive condition of 172 guitarfish Rhinobatos percellens was evaluated in animals incidentally captured in the captures of chinchorro playero between August 2005 and October 2006 at Salguero beach on Santa Marta, Colombia. To understand the reproductive cycle and how it is influenced by the environmental conditions, the reproductive systems were described. The guitarfish is a viviparous matrotrophic ray, with compound ovaries. Four ovarian developmental stages and nine espermatogenic phases of compound testis were observed. The vitellogenetic development was simultaneous to embryonic growth, with an active reproductive ( matting, births, gestation) period between October and April, and a reduction in activity from May to September when embryos stop their growth. North hemisphere rhinobatids show an inverse cycle. Guitarfish females produced between two and four embryos with a gestation period of ten months from April to December; maternal size did not have any relation with embryo length and number. Biological indexes (gonadosomatic, hepatosomatic and condition factor) did not show clear time tendencies in relation to reproductive dynamics; they must be analyzed altogether with environmental condition and food availability.

AB  - The relationship between trade and environmental conditions receives considerable attention whenever countries are in the process of negotiating trade agreements. In this paper using a non-parametric non-stochastic production frontier approach, we first develop an environmental efficiency index for a sample of high income and low and middle income countries and then examine the role of trade on the changes in environmental efficiency. The paper shows that, in addition to the per capita income which exhibits an environmental Kuznets type relationship, trade-related variables such as trade composition, the share of polluting exports and openness of a country are important determinants of environmental efficiency.

AB  - A comparative stud was conducted in 1993 an 1994 to determine the effects of salinity and temperature on 2- and 4-year-old eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) reared in suspension and on the bottom, in a low- and a high-salinity environment in New Brunswick, Canada. Growth rates, glycogen concentrations, and condition indices were recorded throughout the study. Oysters cultured near the surface in the high-salinity environment displayed superior growth (16 mm/year) as compared to all other rearing combinations. In contrast, oysters cultured on the bottom at low salinity exhibited poorest growth (7.9 mm). In all instances, growth of 2-year-old oysters was superior to that of 4-year-old oysters. Oysters cultured on the bottom at high salinity displayed comparable growth to those reared in suspension at low salinity (12.6 and 13.4 mm, respectively). Although condition indices were not always significantly different among oysters of different sizes and reared under different conditions, for the most part, results were generally consistent with patterns observed for growth and glycogen concentrations.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides include active matter and adjuvants (e.g. polyethoxylated tallow amines, POEAs). In addition to a previous investigation on the effect of glyphosate on oysters, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of sub-chronic exposures (35 days) to three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 100 mu gL(-1)) of Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and POEAs on oysters belonging to the same age group. Low mortality rates were calculated, and only few significant differences (i.e. shell length) between exposure conditions were observed at a given date. However, when comparing the biomarker's temporal variations, some different patterns (e.g. condition index, reproduction, parameters of oxidative stress) were observed depending on the molecules and concentrations. These results suggest that a longer exposure to an environmental concentration (0.1 mu g L-1) of R-EX and POEAs could induce harmful effects on oysters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Field measurements of infiltration rates are frequently used to index environmental conditions, soil hydrology, and the potential of rainstorm response for judicious and efficient water management. Since the commonly adopted method of infiltration measurement using double-ring infiltrometer tends to give higher values of infiltration, and most of the rainfall simulator infiltrometers developed in the past have higher cost and low transportability, making investigations expensive and limited to specialized studies, this study aims at the development of a low-cost, highly portable rainfall simulator infiltrometer (RSI). In this RSI, raindrops are produced at the end of capillary holes drilled through a 10 mm thick circular perspex sheet. The RSI is calibrated for various rainfall intensities. The characteristics of the simulated rainfall are evaluated for intensities of 100 mm/h and 200 mm/h. Field tests are conducted to evaluate the infiltration, runoff and soil-cover conditions. Infiltration is also measured simultaneously with the double-ring infiltrometer (RI), and values are found to be 2 to 3 times higher than those measured with the developed RSI. The effect of rainfall intensity and type of soil cover on runoff and soil erosion is also studied.

AB  - As the largest tributary of the Yellow River and a large semi-arid area, the ecological status of the Wei River Basin, China, has become an important issue of concern. Habitat, water quality and biological pressure are the factors affecting the structure and function of rivers. However, it is a challenging task to determine the joint rather than isolated influence of factors on the watershed. Plankton is sensitive to the status of water system, so it is used to analyze the interaction between habitat indexes and physic-chemical parameters of water body. In this study, plankton and water samples were collected from 21 sampling sites in the whole Wei River Basin in October 2019. The planktonic index of biotic integrity (P-IBI), biomass, abundance, diversity index and trophic status were established. The integrity of plankton in the basin was evaluated. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess the correlation and variability between 23 physicochemical factors and habitat indexes of planktonic community. The results show that the applicability and accuracy of P-IBI are good. The planktonic integrity of the ecosystem in the basin is "critical". The upper and lower reaches of the main stream are better than those of the middle reaches, while the upper reaches of the two major tributaries are in poor condition due to the influence of cities and industries. Wei River system is better than Jing River and Beiluo River system. Physical and chemical factors, including dissolved oxygen, turbidity, phycocyanin and chlorophyll, are the main driving forces affecting the integrity of plankton in the study area. Relatively speaking, the contribution of physicochemical parameters to P-IBI was greater than that of habitat indexes, and there was a shared ex-planatory variance between them. The abundance level can best reflect the isolation effect of two aspects of the environment. The results show that the planktonic index of biotic integrity is a potential tool to reflect the interaction of habitat conditions and physical and chemical factors. The whole basin scale research is helpful to promote habitat restoration and water conservation.

AB  - The Manila clam is emerging as a relevant species for the Portuguese market. The present work was conducted in the Tagus estuary to evaluate 1) the metals and As content in the sediments of the Tagus estuary, especially on those areas subjected to Manila clam harvesting 2) the metals and As content in clams, and the risk associated with their consumption 3) the physiological and biochemical responses of the clam to metals and As contamination, and its possible role as a pollution bioindicator in the estuarine environment. The most contaminated sediments were identified nearby industrial areas, nevertheless clams collected in low contaminated areas showed high metals and As concentrations. The condition index, glycogen content, membrane oxidative damage, biotransformation enzymes and metallothioneins showed consistent responses to metals and As content in clams. Results emphasize the need for the development of a management plan for the species exploitation in the Tagus estuary.

AB  - Data from literature on neutral red retention time (NRRT) in lysosomes, micronucleus (MN) frequency and condition index (CI) in mussel Mytilus, especially Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis, were re-analyzed to ascertain their statistical power in detecting a minimum 20% spatial/temporal change in field studies. Results showed that CI largely displayed higher statistical power (>90%) than lysosomal NRRT and MN frequency (<50%), suggesting that data from the latter two biomarkers may lead to erroneous conclusions if sample size is inadequate. Samples of green-lipped mussel Perna viridis were also analyzed in Hong Kong. To achieve statistically valid power, the optimal sample sizes for monitoring lysosomal NRRT, MN frequency, CI and gonosomatic index (GSI) were determined as >= 34, >= 90, >= 16 and >= 29, respectively. Natural variability of lysosomal NRRT and MN frequency was significantly greater than CI and/or GSI in mussels, rejecting the general belief in the greater variability of higher-tiered hierarchical biomarkers.

AB  - An index was developed for estuarine macrobenthos in the Gulf of Mexico that discriminated between areas with degraded environmental conditions and areas with undegraded or reference conditions. Test sites were identified as degraded or reference based on criteria for dissolved oxygen levels, sediment toxicity tests, and sediment contamination. Discriminant analysis was used to identify a suite of measures of benthic community composition and diversity that would most successfully distinguish degraded from undegraded sites. The resultant benthic index was composed of a linear combination of three factors: the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the proportion of total benthic abundance as tubificid oligochaetes, and the proportion of total benthic abundance as bivalve molluscs. This index was used to evaluate the spatial patterns of degraded benthic resources in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Changes of zoobenthos structure in the main channel, upper reaches and tributaries of the River Mzymta (Sochi region) during four-year Olympic construction activity were analyzed. It was showed that river stretches in the upper reaches and minor tributaries, which were not affected by the construction, were inhabited by typical lithorheophilic fauna, and zoobenthos was characterized by high diversity and biomass. The natural state of the ecosystem in the main river channel was disturbed and the slopes of the flood plain and the channel itself were damaged. The pebble-boulder ground was covered by clay sediments and finely dispersed mineral particles. As a result, in the section of the river from the construction zone until the sea, a distance of about 40 km, the biomass of zoobenthos decreased. Small chironomid larvae began to predominate and the food supply of juvenile Black Sea salmon (Salmo trutta labrax Pallas, 1814) has considerably decreased.

AB  - Restoration of urban lakes becomes necessary to slow down unfavourable processes and to recover their recreational role. Macrophyte communities are good bioindicators, thus they can be used to assess the effectiveness of restoration.
   The aim of the study was to determine the dynamics and patternof macrophyte recovery as a result of the restoration measures in a degraded shallow urban lake characterized by strong cyanobacterial blooms. Annual changes in the composition and areal coverage of littoral macrophyte phytocoenoses, and in the Ecological State Macrophyte Indexwere recorded using a GPS and the ArcGIS programme and analysed in relation to changes in water quality for three years following restoration measures (phosphorus inactivation, aeration, and biomanipulation).
   The shifts were statistically significant in the first two for total nitrogenconcentrationand three years for chlorophyll aconcentration, whereas total phosphorus concentration only decreased significantly in the third year. Changes in water transparency were not significant. The ecological status of the lakewas good or moderate. A characteristic pattern of recovery was observed. Phytocenotic richness increased (from 9 to 12 communities) and total phytolittoral area decreased (from 42 to 37 ha, i.e. 12%) during restoration efforts. The area of hypereutrophic plant communities (Ceratophyl-letumdemersi, Hydrocharitetummorsus-ranae, Typhetumangustifoliae) decreased, the former submerged community returned (Potametumlucends) and the area of some existing communities (e.g. nympheids) increased.
   Slow return of elodeidswas caused by low transparency andlack of submerged vegetation propagules, which are the most probable limiting factors of the recolonization process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The direct equivalence between ecology and thermodynamics has not been attained despite accepted thermodynamic features of the ecosystem. This article explores the homeomorphism between ecology and statistical mechanics by analysis of ruderal vegetation. In conventional thermostatistical algorithm, the pro-kinetic effect of temperature on molecules was replaced by the anti-kinetic effect of species diversity on biological individuals. The existence of an ecological equivalent of the thermodynamic Boltzmann constant was empirically verified. From the relationship of this constant with biocenological variables, we derived a probable ecological equation of state under stationary and quasi-stationary conditions. This equation of state is homeomorphic with regard to the ideal gas state equation, and it is useful to infer the value of some biocenological parameters whose direct measurement is difficult, as biomass, energy and dispersal. According to these results, ecosystem assessment from conventional thermostatistics is plausible and empirically verifiable. This approach offers useful analytical tools for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Higher success of micro-budded plants was recorded (30.71%) on six-month-old Rangpur lime rootstocks by using 60-day-old scion buds, which was higher than the five-month-old rootstock seedlings (18.66%) with same age of scion buds. Further, in order to increase the success, micro-budding was attempted under protected structures. Success of micro-budding on Rangpur lime was higher in polyhouse (56.49%) than shade nethouse (34.44%) and open conditions (21.50%) than other rootstocks. The number of days taken for sprouting was much earlier under protected conditions in Rangpur lime (13.36%) followed by Troyer citrange (14.82%) and trifoliate orange (19.54%) rootstocks. Micro-budded plants under open conditions took longer time for sprouting on Rangpur lime (18.32). Success of micro-budding was found to be significantly higher in protected structures than the open conditions for all the rootstocks. The results suggested that micro-budding technique could be gainfully exploited for shortening the propagation period and early biological indexing of citrus.

AB  - Background: Volatile substance abuse is practiced mainly by adolescents and young adults. Its effects are central nervous system excitation followed by central nervous system depression, at times accompanied by seizures. It may cause sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias, reflex vagal inhibition respiratory depression, and anoxia. Chronic toxicity may involve the nervous system, heart, kidney, and liver: Toluene-based adhesives are among the most commonly inhaled substances. Case Report: A 14-year-old female presented with confusion, hallucinations, and intermittent laughing and crying after having inhaled contact glue several times daily in the course of 5 days. Her condition improved within 3 h. Urinary hippuric acid was 93.9 g/g creatinine indicating heavy toluene exposure (biological exposure index, BEI, is 1.6 g/g creatinine). Conclusion: In this patient, urinary hippuric acid was a biomarker for her toluene abuse.

AB  - As part of a case study in Liaozhong county of the Liaoning province and to assess soil ecological effects of conservation tillage, ecological indexes of the soil nematode were compared under traditional plow tillage (PT) or under a 10-yr conservation tillage consisting of no-tillage and straw mulch (CT). The results indicate that the fungivores to bacterivores ratio (F/B) at a depth of 0-5 cm under CT was significantly higher, but significantly lower at a 15-30 cm depth, compared to PT. The nematode channel ratio (NCR) value was directly in opposition to the F/B ratio. CT conditions significantly elevated the soil nematode dominance index (lambda) and the micro- to plant-feeding nematode ratio (WI), but decreased the evenness index (J), the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (Hg) and the richness index (SR) compared to PT conditions. Additionally, compared to PT, the trophic diversity index (Td) in CT soil was significantly lower at a depth greater than 15 cm, yet higher in the 15-30 cm depth layer. the conservation tillage significantly decreased maturity indexes for free-living nematodes (MI), for total nematodes (MMI), for free-living nematodes with c-p values of 2-5 (MI2-5) and for total nematodes with c-p values of 2-5 (MMI2-5), as compared to plow tillage. Soil nematode faunal analysis suggested that, enrichment index EI and structure index SI were both significantly lower under the conservation tillage than under plow tillage. Correlation analysis suggests that, WI, lambda, Hg, J and SR are suitable for indicating the effects of conservation tillage on soil quality. maturity indexes of MI, MMI, MI2-5 and MMI2-5 and structure index SI can be good indicators for evaluating the conservation tillage effects on soil environmental quality.

AB  - The urgency of the problem studied in the paper is conditioned by the fact that stable functioning and development of economic entities, sectors of the economy, regions and the country cannot be carried out without investments. In the modern economy of the Russian Federation, whose conditions of existence can be called non-stationary, one of the problems is attracting investment resources into economic activity and overcoming the conditions for slowing and stopping the growth of the country's economy caused by external unfavorable economic circumstances. In connection with the foregoing, the policy of attracting and managing investments in the regions of the Russian Federation, with a view to ensuring conditions for overcoming the crisis phenomena and resuming the economic growth of the country and its subjects is of particular interest. The intensification of the state investment policy is a core prerequisite for the transition of the economy to sustainable growth. However, in economic market conditions the state is not able to solve this problem to the full. Therefore, the process of activating investment policy at the regional level is becoming topical. The purpose of the paper is to study the management and implementation of investment policy in the region on the example of the Republic of Tatarstan, the analysis and assessment of the investment environment's state. The leading method to research this problem is the statistical one, which is a method of quantitative analysis of a set of homogeneous facts that determine in the aggregate the transition of quantitative changes to qualitative ones. The paper presents the results of assessing the socio-economic development of the region, analyzes the indicators that allow characterizing the investment environment's state. The paper also presents the strategic priorities of the region's investment activities, analyzes the opportunities for their implementation in conditions of non-stationary state, and makes sound conclusions about the need to activate regional investment policies. The materials of the paper are of practical value for specialists dealing with the implementation of the investment policy of the region.

AB  - With accelerating climate variability and change, novel approaches are needed to warn managers of changing ecosystem state and to identify appropriate management actions. One strategy is using indicator species-like seabirds as ecosystem sentinels-to monitor changes in marine environments. Here, we explore the utility of western gulls (Larus occidentalis) breeding on Southeast Farallon Island as a proxy of ecosystem state in coastal California by investigating the interannual variability in gull foraging behavior from 2013 to 2019 in relation to upwelling conditions, prey abundances, and overlap with humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) as gulls frequently feed in association with whales. Western gulls have a flexible diet and forage on land and at-sea. We combined gull GPS tracking data during the incubation phase, ecosystem survey data on multiple predator and prey species, and derived oceanographic upwelling products. When foraging at sea, gulls overlapped with cool upwelled waters. During 2015-2017, 25% more gull foraging trips visited land than in other years, where land trips were on average similar to 8 h longer and 40% further than sea trips, which coincided with high compression of coastally upwelled waters (habitat compression) in 2015-2016. Gull foraging behavior was related to local prey abundances, where more foraging occurred near shore or on land when prey abundances were low. However, visual surveys indicated that similar to 70% of humpback whale observations co-occurred with gulls, and the year with the most foraging on land (2017) corresponded to regionally low relative whale abundances, suggesting gull movement patterns could be an indicator of whale presence. Further, both whales and gulls forage near-shore under high upwelling habitat compression and low krill abundance. Hence, the deployment of year-round tags on gulls with the capability of near real-time data accessibility could provide important fine-scale metrics for conservation and management of the threatened yet recovering eastern Pacific humpback whale population between infrequent and coarse surveys. Entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes are major inhibitors to whale recovery and have increased concomitantly with human use of ocean resources. Moreover, as climate variability and change increase, novel indicators should be explored and implemented to inform marine spatial planning and protect species across multiple scales from new risks.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) is a significant catecholamine neurotransmitter in the brain of mammal, and DA is one biological index of some diseases at the same time. Due to various drawbacks in clinical trials of the existing methods for detecting dopamine, there is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive detection methods to diagnose and monitor these diseases. In this study, we report a simple, effective, sensitive, non-toxic and environmentally friendly method for the DA detection based on fluorescence analysis, more specifically, we use the characteristic of dopamine, dopamine oxidative polymerization, so as to achieve testing of dopamine. The way only uses a common alkali, polyethyleneimine (PEI), to start the polymerization process, and make the experiment very simple and cheap. The optical properties of polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles which formed under different response times and different concentrations were studied for the first time. After the experimental conditions were optimized, a good linear relationship was obtained from 1.0-200 mu M with the correlation coefficient of 0.99904 and the detection limit was 0.3 mu M. This method is highly selective and has great potential for detection of dopamine related diseases.

AB  - Six oil samples collected from the Sagara oil field, Shizuoka Prefecture, were geochemically analyzed. Unlike the Niigata oils, the Sagara oils: (i) are low-sulphur light oils dominated by gasoline and kerosene fractions; (ii) have low values of environment index in light hydrocarbon compositions; (iii) have high Pr/n-C-17 and low Ph/n-C-18 ratios and high oleanane/hopane ratios; (iv) have high relative abundance of C-29 and low relative abundance of C-28 regular steranes; and (v) have 'light' stable carbon isotope compositions. These characteristics show that the source rocks of the Sagara oils contain mainly marine organic matter, but with more input of terrigenous organic matter deposited under more oxic conditions compared to those of the Niigata oils. The light carbon isotope compositions and the low relative abundance of C-28 regular steranes of the Sagara oils suggest that their source rock is not Miocene, but probably Paleogene in age. The Sagara oils probably migrated along faults from deeper parts of the basin.

AB  - Posidonia oceanica is an endemic seagrass from the Mediterranean Sea. It is an indicator of water quality and of the ecological state of coastal ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to test acoustic telemetry for monitoring the position of P. oceanica meadow limits with varied types. After evaluating the accuracy of the system, we present results from a spatiotemporal survey of P. oceanica meadows on nine sites located on the French coast. The method has been demonstrated to be highly efficient for high precision underwater mapping regardless of meadow type, with 1 cm accuracy for a distance of 40 m between the base and the pointer. A temporal survey led at Cerbere-Banyuls shows a weak global progression of 4 m(2) (progression of 26 m(2) - regression of 22 m(2)) between 2006 and 2010. Finally, we discuss the cost and efficiency of this method, and wether it should be generalized for further studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of the present work was to test the response of Perna perna to oil contamination in the marine environment. Mussels Perna perna were collected on several occasions from the pillars of Rio-Niteroi Bridge, Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, including after a major spill of MFO380 in January 2000. Condition index evaluation and neutral red assay were carried out in these mussels, which were also tested for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) concentration by using GC/ MS. The PAH burden in mussels, analyzed before and after the oil spill, increased between 2 and 5 fold. This change was dominated by measurable increases in naphthalene, phenanthrene, dibenzothiophene, and their respective alkylated homologs. Although indicative ratios revealed petrogenic contamination after the spill, source indicative ratios for PAHs in the mussels differ from that for the oil. In agreement to what is reported in the literature for other bivalves, Perna perna responds reliably to variations in oil derived PAHs in the environment, proving to be a suitable biomonitor of petroleum contamination. Neutral red assay turned out to be a sensitive biomarker of alterations in mussels exposed to oil and made evident the occurrence of threshold reaction triggered by higher levels of contamination.

AB  - Plant-based assessments can contribute to wetland conservation and management by providing a standardized method to monitor biological communities in relation to human activity. One major challenge, however, is that their measurements must be fairly insensitive to temporal variation in community composition, which can be difficult since marsh plant communities are known to be influenced by natural climatic cycles. Variation in the scores for an index of biological integrity (IBI) was evaluated in relation to plant community changes that occurred between years with differing precipitation inputs throughout the growing season (dry: 240mm in 2008, 198mm in 2009; wet: 324mm in 2010, 329mm in 2011). Species composition and IBI scores were measured by sampling macrophytes in the centre of the wet meadow zone at 47 semi-permanent to permanent natural and constructed marshes. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations revealed that although plant community composition shifted between dry and wet years, IBI scores were sensitive to only 21% of the total inter-annual variation in species composition. The first NMS axis was positively correlated with IBI scores (r=0.85) as well as several environmental parameters (r(2)>0.2), including dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, potassium, shoreline slope, and salinity. The wet meadow IBI also yielded consistent scores between dry and wet years (Spearman's rho=0.82; Wilcoxon z-score=0.53, P-value=0.60) and was able to distinguish a change in biological condition among sites against a backdrop of natural variation (F-test=3.0, P<0.001).

AB  - Environmental conditions of a large river in southeastern Brazil were assessed by evaluating fish assemblage structure (index of biotic integrity, IBI), landscape use (forest, pasture, urban area, and tributary water) and riparian condition. A survey of the 338 km-long middle reach of the Rio Paraiba do Sul, containing a large urban-industrial complex, was conducted in two seasons: summer/wet and winter/dry. Fish were sampled with a standardized level of effort twice at seven sites, between March 2001 and April 2002, by gill nets, cast nets, sieves and seines. Riparian condition was evaluated by direct observations, and land use maps were used to assess landscape condition of an 8 km(2) buffer surrounding each site. IBI scores ranged from 5 to 36 (out of a possible range of 4-40), with lowest values at an urban-industrial landscape, and highest scores upstream and downstream, indicating the river's recovery capacity. The most appropriate time to assess IBI was during the winter/dry period, when sampling was more effective and the IBI was more sensitive to changes in environmental quality. Landscape use and riparian condition were correlated, and IBI was positively correlated with % pasture, % tributary area, and riparian condition, but negatively correlated with % urban area. In some cases urban areas eliminated riparian woody vegetation, destabilizing site physical habitat structure.

AB  - The general aim of this study is to update the inventory of the fish species and to specify distribution patterns in the Nero River ichthyofauna in order to establish some basis for the conservation of these fish communities and their habitat. From February 2009 to January 2010, thirty-three sites were sampled monthly with gill nets and a backpack electrofisher, and environmental variables were recorded. Overall, 46 species included in 33 genuses, 24 families and 9 orders were collected. Eleven families and 30 species were the first records for the Nero River. Including all species previously listed in the literature, the number of species presently known in the Nero River and its tributaries is revised to 59. Four families, Alestidae (21%), Schilbeidae (19%), Cyprinidae (17%) and Cichlidae (16%) that made up 73% of the total number of the catches, were the most dominant. The most dominant numerical species were Schilbe mandibularis and Brycinus longipinnis. Fish species and sampling sites along with eight environmental variables were ordinated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) coupled to the Monte Carlo test. Ecological status based on fish assemblage according to environmental variables and anthropogenic pressures showed that miss dead wood leaves and roots, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, mud, nitrite, basin width, dissolved oxygen and pH, were the primary factors influencing fish distribution. The environmental tolerance index (ETI), ecological tolerance (t(k)) and optima (u(k)) values of 10 species to 8 different environmental variables were analyzed. Six species (Hemichromis fasciatus, Epiplatys chaperi, Barbus ablabes, B. longipinnis, Hemichromis bimaculatus and Chromidotilapia guntheri) have high ETI and a cosmopolitan distribution in the Nero River. In the tributaries of the middle course, high concentrations of nitrite in the water, added to the presence of a lot of tolerant species in the ichthyofauna are indications of disturbance of these areas. Subsequent recommendations were formulated for efficient restoration and conservation management of this River. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Matched chemical and ecological monitoring data were used to assess the effects of iron on benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Three measures of iron exposure: dissolved, total, and particulate iron were assessed. Ecological responses were normalised to an unimpacted reference condition to make site-specific predictions of the reference condition. Ecological data were expressed as an Ecological Quality Index (EQI), indicating quality relative to the reference condition. Quantile regression analysis was used to derive thresholds as an EQI value equivalent to the cut-off between good and moderate ecological status for water quality classification. Thresholds for Good Ecological Status ranged from 1.25 to 2.46 mg L-1 depending on the measure of exposure and ecological response.

AB  - This article presents evidence on the relationship between price and financial stability. We construct an annual index of financial conditions for the United States, 1790-1997, and estimate the effect of aggregate price shocks on the index using a dynamic ordered probit model. We find that price-level shocks contributed to financial instability during 1790-1933 and that inflation rate shocks contributed to financial instability during 1980-97 The size of the aggregate price shock needed to alter financial conditions depends on the institutional environment, but we conclude that a monetary policy focused on price stability would contribute to financial stability.

AB  - Structurally complex landscapes and organic management have been shown to augment natural pest enemy populations on arable land. Here, body condition and reproductive capacity of wolf spiders were studied to see if these traits can explain the larger populations in these environments. Females of Pardosa spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) were collected at 7 organically and 7 conventionally managed fields situated in landscapes with different proportions of perennial crops, annual crops, forest, and different numbers and sizes of fields. Body condition (relative female weight) and fecundity (number of offspring and relative egg sac weight) were measured for each captured spider. In contrast to the hypothesis, Pardosa females caught in fields situated in landscapes dominated by large fields of annual crops had superior body condition. Farming practice had no effect on either body condition or fecundity measures. It is suggested that increased spider body condition in homogeneous landscapes may be due to less competition for available resources, although temporal variation should be included before drawing final conclusions on spiders' body condition in the agricultural landscape.

AB  - In this study we use multi-year time series to examine the dynamic characteristics of coupled physical-biogeochemical processes that modulate interannual coastal hypoxia in the Benguela upwelling system in the southeast Atlantic. The results confirmed earlier findings on the role of advection to explain much of the seasonal-decadal variability. These results challenge the predominantly biogeochemical basis, namely benthic-pelagic coupling, to understand the variability of hypoxia and its ecosystem implications. Unexpectedly, the results showed that the variability was insensitive to changes in the electron-donating capacity (carbon export fluxes) but strongly dependent on the advected oxygen fluxes. The dynamics of the interaction of equatorial and polar boundary conditions (ocean-shelf exchange) and seasonally phased shelf advection were the key forcing functions that explained hypoxia variability in seasonal-decadal time scales. The vulnerability of the system to climate change lies in the long-term response of the equatorial system that governs seasonal and interannual warming at the Angola-Benguela front as well as wind stress in the Luderitz southern boundary that governs ventilation. The proposed model was able to explain most of the decadal scale variability of two different ecosystem-state indicators. The model predicts a long-term decline of present ecosystem function with climate change. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The New Jersey Bureau of Freshwater and Biological Monitoring (BFBM) has been conducting Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) monitoring on rivers and streams (with drainage area > 12.95 km(2)) in the Northern part of the state since 2000 using Karr's original IBI format with several regional modifications. In an effort to increase the overall performance of the IBI and to assess smaller headwater streams, a new design and approach to metric development was evaluated on approximately 230 high gradient streams. This design, developed by Thomas Whittier and Robert Hughes, has been implemented for numerous Western U.S. studies, as well as the Connecticut multi-metric indices (MMI). Analysis resulted in two distinct stream classes; a coldwater community (Headwaters IBI) with drainage area < 10.36 km(2) consisting of brook trout, sensitive salamanders, and native crayfish and cool/warmwater fish communities (Northern FIBI) with drainage area > 10.36 km(2). Over 140 metrics from ten ecological classes were tested for signal to noise, range, responsiveness, and redundancy. A total of eight metrics representing seven ecological classes were selected for the Northern FIBI and six metrics representing five ecological classes were selected for the Headwaters IBI. These two indices provide the Bureau with an effective and sensitive biological tool to monitor and assess all non-tidal, wadeable streams in the Piedmont, Highlands, and Ridge and Valley physiographic ecoregions.

AB  - Environmental modeling has long been a recognized part of environmental risk assessment. Traditionally, environmental models have been deterministic models for specific processes over small areas using spatially aggregated subunits for data collection and processing. For an analysis of environmental risk factors on a regional scale, such models are not always appropriate because of uncertainties in the processes, heterogeneity of the environment, and extensive data requirements. Under such circumstances, statistical modeling of the environment can offer useful insights because it deals with a combination of processes and provides a broad view of the degree and significance of the factors impacting ecological resources on a regional scale. Using data from the Eastern Cornbelt Plains ecoregion of Ohio, USA, Me have developed several statistical models relating anthropogenic activities on the watershed and a set of stream condition variables to the biological quality of stream segments. The effects of land use and in-stream physical and chemical factors on the biological indicator, the index of biotic integrity, have been studied using nested watersheds as geographic units. The effects of scale and spatial aggregation have been integrated into the model. A geographic information system database was built using Arc/Info(R) software (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) for integrating and summarizing data. The results can be used as a screening model to help planners review the potential cumulative impacts of human activities on indicators of fish community structure. Future work will try to account more explicitly for distance decay of pollutants and the effects of underlying geology and soils on variations in biological diversity.

AB  - Environment-oriented traffic management zoning (TMZ) provides an important way to study spatial variation of urban traffic environment. The TMZ can be used to manage the urban traffic environment and establish regional improvement strategies. In this study, a spatial immune cluster method based on aiNet (Artificial Immune Network) is designed to facilitate the traffic environment zoning. Spatial coordinates are employed to measure the spatial correlation of the traffic system, and the weightings of different indices are calculated with the use of PCA (principle component analysis). For the case of Beijing, the whole city area is divided into evenly distributed grid cells. An urban traffic environment index system is developed to measure the traffic environment condition of different grids based on the concept of traffic sustainability. The GIS (Geographical information System) software of ArcGIS and database programming are used to calculate the indexical values of each grid. In order to classify the grid data set, we use two analysis methods, i.e. immune cluster algorithm and K-mean algorithm, and it is found that the immune cluster algorithm has better performance for the classification. With the use of this method, the study area is divided into 4 zones.

AB  - The floodplain wetland habitat in the lower Gangetic plains of West Bengal played a significant role in protecting from environmental degradation like pollution, lowering groundwater table, natural hazards, and others as well as supports for human wellbeing. Thus, it is needed to investigate the health status of wetlands and suggest restoration strategies to protect the livelihood patterns dependent on wetlands. This paper presents the health of the wetland ecosystem by comprising the wetland ecosystem health index (WHI) in 2011 and 2018 at the block level of Malda district, as a part of the lower Gangetic flood plain using the pressure-state-response model (PSR model) and AHP method. A total number of six Landsat satellite images and statistical census data were used to determine the wetland health. Wetlands are classified as very healthy (2.81-3.33), healthy (2.41-2.80), sub-healthy (2.01-2.40), unhealthy (1.61-2.00), and sick (0-1.60) category on the basis of the wetland ecosystem health index score. The results of this study showed that the wetlands located surrounding English Bazar, Manikchak, Ratua-II, and Kaliachak-II blocks have a sub-healthy to very healthy condition in 2011 but changed to unhealthy to sick category in 2018 due to the increase of rapid urbanization, population density, and development activities. These areas have belonged to the sub-healthy to sick category in the year 2011 as well as 2018 due to high wetland pressure. Our observation reveals that the ecosystem service value provided by wetlands decreased by 62.51% and 20.46 in the observed period. Management of WEH should emphasize on large (>100 ha) and medium (51-100 ha) sizes of wetlands in the Diara region of West Bengal. Developing local-level institutions and setting restoration goals are useful strategies to manage wetland resources, and protecting biodiversity should be guided by the Government organization and NGOs.

AB  - The river sediment is a sink for heavy metals flowed into a river from natural and anthropogenic sources. It can be a potential pollutant source in varying environmental conditions. The Taehwa River runs through Ulsan City with different geological terrains and different land uses. Hence, research on the determination of various factors affecting accumulation and mobility changes in heavy metals in the river sediment is important. The present research investigated the mineralogical compositions of the Taewha River sediment in addition to the distribution, speciation, sources, and contamination level of As and heavy metals. The sediment showed different mineralogical changes associated with flowing distance, indicating the influence of country rocks, comprising igneous rocks in the upper stream region and sedimentary rocks in the lower stream region, on mineral composition. The total concentrations of As and heavy metals in the sediment exhibited the order of Zn>Pb>Cr>Cu>Ni>As>Cd. The overall concentrations of As and heavy metals increased in the downstream region, albeit with varying degrees. According to the Environmental Protection Agency guideline for sediment pollution, including the index of pollution intensity (I-POLL) and the potential ecological risk index (RI), the sediment in the sampling stations was discovered to be polluted to varying degrees from anthropogenic activities. An abrupt increase in Pb, Zn, and Cd concentrations was observed at Station 3 in summer and fall, which was linked to the increased clay mineral content caused by seasonal and lithological changes. The sources of this increase can be attributed to a nearby industrial complex or the oxidation of sulfide minerals, which could be related to an abandoned amethyst mine. Sequential extraction studies show that potential toxicity varies for each metal. By comparison, metals such as Cr, Ni, and Cu with higher percentages in exchangeable fractions and fractions bound to carbonates can be highly toxic. The statistical analysis indicates that two groups of metals, one including Zn, Cd, and Pb and another including Cr, Ni, As, and Cu, had distinct origins.

AB  - This study evaluated the impacts of submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) on a rocky intertidal community of South Portugal, during April-November 2011. Chlorophyll-a concentration was higher at the SGD site in respect to the Reference site. Epibenthic community structure differed between sites, with an increase in Chthamalus spp. and a decrease in macroalgae coverage at the SGD site. The abundance and body size of Mytilus galloprovincialis were consistently higher at the SGD site. During mid-spring, under potentially higher SGD and less favorable conditions for coastal phytoplankton, the ecophysiological condition of M. galloprovincialis and G. umbilicalis was also higher at the SGD site. These beneficial effects on filter-feeders and herbivores probably resulted from local increases in prey availability, supported by SGD-driven nutrient inputs. Conversely, P. depressa was not favoured by SGD, probably due to a lower dependency on algae as food. The analysis of epibenthic community structure and ecophysiological condition represents a promising approach to disentangle the ecological impacts of SGD on intertidal ecosystems.

T2  - ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA
LA  - English
AB  - Some data based on quantitative measurements at the individual and histological levels have been compared in four different populations of Mytilus edulis from the Biscay coast.  Each population has been divided into two groups, corresponding to animals living at high and low tide levels.  Biometric measurements show evident differences between samples from these two groups at all the studied stations.  This should be the result of a distinct adaptation to hydric stress.  On the other hand, a positive correlation between the flesh condition (FC) index and the mean epithelial thickness (MET) of digestive tubules has been found.  So, authors conclude that both FC and MET are good populational stress indices, and the use of both parameters simultaneously can be helpful in the assessment of environmental stress.

AB  - We evaluated the health condition of a temperate river during June-November 1999 through applications of the index of biological integrity (IBI) using fish assemblages and qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI) as well as chemical analyses. Overall IBI values ranged from 13 to 37 and averaged 23 (n = 25, standard error = 1.16), indicating a "poor" or "very poor" condition according to the criteria of modified Karr [Fisheries 6 (1981) 21]. The values of mean IBI declined at a rate of 0.22 km(-1) (R-2 = 0.9 1, p < 0.05) along the longitudinal distance from the headwaters to the downstream sites. Reduced IBI values at downstream sites reflected low forest cover. high population density and high nutrient enrichments. Ecotoxicity tests using the river water also showed that toxic impacts were evident in the downriver sites. These factors resulted in decreases of riffle benthic species and insectivores and increases of tolerant species, anormalies and exotic species in the river. Spatial pattern in IBI agreed with QHEI values, which showed a linear relation (R-2 = 0.99 8, P < 0.001) with species richness. Field measurements of conductivity and pH, an indicators for variation of conservative ions, showed that the river water was diluted by 40% fold by summer monsoon rain and surface run-off from the watershed, resulting in a physical and chemical instability during the monsoon. For these reasons, average IBI values during the monsoon and postmonsoon decreased >20% compared to the premonsoon, indicating that IBI values were also affected by flow regime. Based on the overall physico-chemical data and 1131 values, the river health is rapidly degrading due to the combined effect of chemical contaminations and habitat modifications.

AB  - The cohesion of activated sludge biological flocs is controlled by the ratio between hydrophilic exopolymers in which bacteria are embedded and hydrophobic interactions. As shown in this study highly hydrophobic bacteria coexist in the flocs with highly hydrophilic bacteria which seem to release large quantities of exopolymers (polysaccharides, DNA, proteins...). Addition to the activated sludge of easily assimilable nutrients such as glucose does not change the hydrophobicity of bacteria but increases both exopolymer production and the sludge volume index. The environmental conditions and the bioavailability of nutrients may considerably shift the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. Moreover experiments carried out with four different strains to fourteen isolated from activated sludges have shown that a few strains (variable types) have quite considerable possibilities of hydrophobic property variations in the course of growth.

AB  - Species can show strong variation of local abundance across their ranges. Recent analyses suggested that variation in abundance can be related to environmental suitability, as the highest abundances are often observed in populations living in the most suitable areas. However, there is limited information on the mechanisms through which variation in environmental suitability determines abundance. We analysed populations of the microendemic salamander Hydromantes flavus, and tested several hypotheses on potential relationships linking environmental suitability to population parameters. For multiple populations across the whole species range, we assessed suitability using species distribution models, and measured density, activity level, food intake and body condition index. In high-suitability sites, the density of salamanders was up to 30-times higher than in the least suitable ones. Variation in activity levels and population performance can explain such variation of abundance. In high-suitability sites, salamanders were active close to the surface, and showed a low frequency of empty stomachs. Furthermore, when taking into account seasonal variation, body condition was better in the most suitable sites. Our results show that the strong relationship between environmental suitability and population abundance can be mediated by the variation of parameters strongly linked to individual performance and fitness.

AB  - The increasing attention on environmental problems is stimulating the development of integrated evaluation approaches to territorial transformations, where different facets have to be considered. The present paper focuses on the development of a novel integrated evaluation model for measuring the ecological states and the economic values of an environmental system employing both a system of indicators and a mathematical model of Lotka-Volterra. This integrated evaluation model aims at investigating the relations between the landscape ecology and economics, and at simulating possible and future transformation scenarios for the landscape planning and management. As case study, we consider an environmental system located in Piedmont (Italy), in the Monferrato Ovadese area. The present paper proposes a suitable support for local governments to visualize outcomes and possible future scenarios, aiding the decision-making process in the definition of territorial transformation policies and actions.

AB  - To analyze the dependence of intensification rates of tropical cyclones (TCs) on the variation of environmental conditions, an index is proposed here to measure the lifetime maximum intensification rates (LMIRs) for the Saffir-Simpson scale category 4-5 TCs over the western North Pacific. To quantitatively describe the intensification rate of major TCs, the LMIR is defined as the maximum acceleration in the sustained-wind-speed over a 24-h period of an overwater TC. This new index, LMIR, is generally independent of the indices for RI frequency. The results show that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modulates the inter-annual relationship between the LMIR and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The PDO's modulation on the ENSO's effect on the LMIR is explored here by considering the relationship between the LMIR and the environmental conditions in different PDO phases. While the ENSO's effect on the LMIR for the warm PDO phase is generally by affecting the variations of upper ocean heat content, ENSO mainly influences the variations of zonal wind and vertical wind shear for the cold PDO phase. Our results suggest that fast translating TCs tend to attain strong intensification during the warm PDO phase, while a warm subsurface condition may permit slow-translating TCs also to become strongly intensified during the cooling PDO phase. These findings have an important implication for both prediction of RI and the long-term projection of TC activities in the western North Pacific.

AB  - Ecological environment assessment can not only provide significant references for effective solutions to regional ecological problems, but also promote the benign interaction of socio-economic-ecological development. This study selected the Heihe River Basin (HRB) as the typical area to comprehensively evaluate the ecological environment from 2010 to 2030 based on the dynamics of land system (DLS) model, which is coupled with the biological abundance index (BAI), vegetation coverage index (VCI), water density index (WDI), land degradation index (LDI), and eco-environment quality index (EQI). The results indicate that the BAI and VCI will be high in the south and east, low in the north and west in general. Under the future baseline scenario, the changes of biological abundance, vegetation coverage, and deteriorating land in the midstream and downstream regions will may seriously hinder restoration of the ecological environment. In particular, the BAI in the midstream and downstream regions will decline more rapidly, with a rate of 10.30% and 18.59%, respectively. The water area will be scattered and less abundant overall, but the WDI in the midstream, that is up to 3.86 in 2030, will be higher than that in other regions. Results also show that the regions with high EQI are mainly located in the northeast and south region. It is predicted that the ecological fragile zones in the future will mainly distribute in the midstream and downstream regions, especially in Jiayuguan City and Jinta County. The EQI will drop by 44.28% and 11.40% during 2010-2030 without external conditions intervened. In addition, Qilian Mountain, Jiuquan City, Gaotai County, Linze County, and Shandan County will also have relatively strong recovery capacities under the influence of ecological policies.

AB  - In the present work, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF) fluorescent probe was prepared by post-synthetic modification of MIL-53-NH2(Al) with carboxylatocalix[4]arene (CC[4]A). The introduced CC [4]A could not only enhance the fluorescence performance and the recognition ability of the probe, but also sustain the high stability under UV light and moisture conditions. A method based on the as-synthesized CC[4]A@MIL-53-NH2(Al) probe was established for sensing hippuric acid. The detection limit was determined to be as low as 3.7 mu g mL(-1). Over the concentration range of 0.005-3 mgmL(-1), the calibration curve was obtained with a satisfactory linearity (R-2 = 0.993). The method was successfully used for rapid and highly selective direct monitor of hippuric acid in human urine. The sensor had great potential to be used as a simple diagnostic tool for hippuric acid in human urine which is regarded as a biological index of toluene exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A conceptual model was constructed for the functioning the algae-dominated rocky reef ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea. The Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (reef-EBQI) is based upon this model. This index meets the objectives of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. It is based upon (i) the weighting of each compartment, according to its importance in the functioning of the ecosystem; (ii) biological parameters assessing the state of each compartment; (iii) the aggregation of these parameters, assessing the quality of the ecosystem functioning, for each site; (iv) and a Confidence Index measuring the reliability of the index, for each site. The reefEBQI was used at 40 sites in the northwestern Mediterranean. It constitutes an efficient tool, because it is based upon a wide set of functional compartments, rather than upon just a few species; it is easy and inexpensive to implement, robust and not redundant with regard to already existing indices.

AB  - Effects of depth and biological parameters on PCB levels in cultivated mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) on raft coming from the Galician coast (north-western Spain) have been studied. For this purpose, samples from 5 harvesting zones (Muros, Portonovo, Bueu, Canvas and Sada) placed at three different depths (1, 5 and 10 m) on raft rope were investigated. The analyzed congeners were PCBs IUPAC n degrees 31, 28, 52, 101, 118, 153, 105, 138, 156 and 180, and they were isolated by Soxhlet extraction and analyzed by GC-ECD and GC-MS. Statistical methods were applied to evaluate the results and to determine the possible influences of biological parameters (lipid content, condition index and shell length) with levels of individual PCB congeners. Only the concentration of PCB52 in samples coming from Portonovo zone was correlated with depth (P = 0.003). By means of multivariate techniques of data exploration, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), spatial variability of PCB levels in raft mussels from the investigated harvesting areas has been studied.

AB  - Legume-cereal intercropping is increasingly being appreciated in dryland areas, where severe climatic conditions and intensive agricultural practices, generally dominated by continuous cereal cultivation, determine depletion of soil nutrient resources and decline of soil fertility. This research aimed to assess whether and to what extent a newly introduced legume-based intercropping system is able to ameliorate the biological fertility status of an arable soil in a way that is still noticeable during the succeeding durum wheat cropping season in terms of changes in bacterial community structure, soil C and N pools, and crop yield. A field experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions in Southern Italy on a sandy clay loam soil cultivated with durum wheat following in the rotation a recently established grain legume (pea, faba bean) barley intercropping. Soil chemical, biochemical and eco-physiological variables together with compositional shifts in the bacterial community structure by LH-PCR fingerprinting were determined at four sampling times during the durum wheat cropping season. Soil fertility was estimated by using a revised version of the biological fertility index. Results showed that even though the microbial biomass was significantly altered, the preceding legume intercrops stimulated C-related functional variables thus leading to an increased release of mineral N, which was larger in crop treatments succeeding pea-based than faba bean-based intercropping. The increased N made available in soil enabled the succeeding durum wheat to achieve an adequate grain yield with a reduced N-fertilizer use. Soil type and environmental conditions rather than crop treatments were major determinants of bacterial community structure. The biological fertility status was not varied, suggesting that in intensively managed rainfed areas long-term crop rotations with intercropped legumes are needed to consistently ameliorate it.

AB  - The cost of park-recreational, residential, and residential-transport urban landscapes of Moscow has been estimated taking into account land use and the relationships between ecosystem services and ecological functions and properties of individual landscape components. On the basis of the methodology previously proposed by the authors, a wide range of ecosystem services of urban landscapes, mainly associated with soils and their ecological state, has been assessed. The cost of ecosystem services provided by the soil in urban landscapes is 20-30 times higher in comparison with that of green spaces, and some soil services can be considered invaluable because of the difficulty of renewing this natural resource. The cost of ecosystem services of undisturbed soils of park and recreational landscapes is 1.5-2 times higher than that of anthropogenically transformed soils of residential and residential-transport urban territories. The main contribution to the overall cost of ecosystem services of soils in urban landscapes is due to the following services: carbon sequestration, preservation of the genetic material of biota, and filtration and accumulation of chemical elements in the ecosystem. These services can be considered as promising in the monetization of ecosystem services in urban landscapes. The decline in the cost of ecosystem services from park and recreational landscapes to residential and residential-transport landscapes is largely determined by the deterioration of the ecological state of soils. The benefits provided by the natural block of landscapes are comparable to or greater than those of the cultural (human-created) block. In relation to the all-Russia assessment of ecosystem services, a specific feature of urban areas is a significant share (on average, 25%) of the cultural block in the total cost of ecosystem services and a decrease in the cost of regulatory services by about 30%. The results of the economic assessment of ecosystem services of urban landscapes indicate an underestimation of the value of natural components, a significant contribution of soil to the natural block, the need to search for simplified integral indicators of its state, and the presence of cost calculation problems. The methodological approaches and provisional results of this study can be used in urban planning with the aim to preserve the soil cover of urban landscapes and optimize their functioning.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of metal contamination on the biological responses of 0-group juvenile European flounder and to assess and compare the quality of four estuarine habitats located in the Eastern English Channel. Fish otolith growth and condition indices (RNA : DNA ratio, Fulton's K condition index) were measured and found to be significantly lower in individuals from the Seine estuary compared to those of the Canche, Authie and Somme estuaries. No obvious effects of hydrological condition or food availability on the flounder biological responses were observed. Sediments from the Seine showed the highest metal concentrations, bioavailable proportion and enrichment factors. Higher metal concentrations were observed in fish from the Seine compared to the other ones caught in less polluted estuaries. These results suggest that contaminants may have a negative impact on the early life history stage of flounder.

AB  - In assessing the health of rivers, the standardization of environmental and biological information as a baseline is essential in order to determine the set of conditions that are closest to the natural state of ecosystems. This is the case especially in pen-urban rivers where anthropogenic transformations occur rapidly and constantly. The objective of this work was to determine hydromorphological, physicochemical and biological parameters in 10 mountain rivers of the Mexico Basin, in order to establish a network of potential reference conditions and to validate the regional ecological quality. The potential reference conditions in this study are defined as oligotrophic water bodies with well-oxygenated concentrations and low ion concentrations. These conditions were recorded in 4 sub-basins with high hydromorphological quality. These results were corroborated through a base assembly composed of the macroinvertebrate families Baetide, Chrironomidae, Dugesiidae, Heptageniidae, Limnephilidae, Tipulidae and the class Arachnida (Acarina). The algal community was represented by Nostoc parmelioides, Placoma regulare, Batrachospermum gelatinosum, Paralemanea mexicana, Draparnaldia mutabilis, Prasiola mexicana and Vaucheria bursata. The major disturbances were structural changes in the riverbed that affect the structure and function of rivers. (C) 2017 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Instituto de Biologia.

AB  - Two series of experiments with Pinus sylvestris L., 10 and 20 years old, were analysed with regard to genotype-environment interaction. The series cover a wide range of site conditions with regard to length of growing season, environmental differences within localities and spacing between trees. The genetic material comes from factorial crosses in one of the series and a mixture of full-sib, half-sib and provenance material in the other. The origin of the parents is south-central Sweden, and the trials cover approximately the same geographical range as the parent trees. Despite few replicates and large experimental error, the following conclusions could be drawn: (a) genotype-environment interaction for Pinus sylvestris in south-central Sweden seems to be of importance for growth capacity, but the reaction differs between young and old plant stages; (b) the origin of the genetic material, as long as it is restricted to south-central Sweden, does not seem to have any significant effect on genotype-environment interaction; (c) a large part of the interaction seems to be explained by a linear relationship between the genotypes and an environmental index.

AB  - The productivity of the prickly-pear cactus Opuntia ficus-indica, which is cultivated worldwide for its fruits and stem segments, was predicted based on the responses of its net CO2 uptake to soil water status, air temperature and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Each of these environmental factors was represented by an index with a maximum value of unity when that factor was not limiting net CO2 uptake over a 24-h period. The water index, the temperature index, and the PPFD index were determined for 87 sites in the contiguous United States using data from 189 weather stations and for 148 sites worldwide using data from 1464 weather stations. The product of these three indices, the environmental productivity index (EPI), was used to predict the productivity of O. ficus-indica under current climatic conditions and under those accompanying a possible increase in the atmospheric CO2 level to 650-mu-mol mol-1. Sites with temperatures always above -10-degrees-C and hence suitable for prickly-pear cultivation numbered 37 in the United States and 110 worldwide; such sites increased by 43 and 5%, respectively, for the global warming accompanying the elevated CO2. Productivity of O. ficus-indica was at least 15 tonnes dry weight hectare-1 year-1, comparable to that of many agronomic crops, for 20 sites with temperatures always above -10-degrees-C in the contiguous United States and for 12 such sites worldwide under current climatic conditions; such sites increased by 85 and 117%, respectively, under the elevated CO2 condition, mainly because of direct effects of the atmospheric CO2 level on net CO2 uptake. In summary, simulations based on EPI indicate that O. ficus-indica may presently be advantageously cultivated over a substantial fraction of the earth's surface, such regions increasing markedly with a future doubling in atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB  - Juvenile Pacific pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) were captured by beach seine in two adjacent channels leading from headwaters to coastal marine areas in 2004 and examined for sea lice. The sample sites represented the key areas of potential wild/farmed interaction by sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi) in the Finlayson and Mathieson Channels. The mean prevalence of infestation Was 18.4% with a mean density of 0.28-0.64 lice g(-1). The ratio of L. salmonis life stages was 26%:35%:39% for copepodid/chalimus: pre-adult: adult life stages respectively. There was no significant effect of sample site on sea lice prevalence. There was a significant increase in sea lice density between headwater and seaward sample sites. Significantly higher condition indices were recorded for pink salmon from the Finlayson Channel compared to the Mathieson Channel. There was no significant effect of sample site on condition indices within each channel between sample sites towards the headwaters, adjacent to and seaward from commercial salmon farms. There was no effect of sea lice density on the condition indices of juvenile pink salmon sampled at each site. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This is the first record of the copepod Pseudomyicola spinosus in the scallop Argopecten ventricosus in northwestern Mexico, and describes: (1) the known annual prevalence and intensity of this copepod on scallops from culture sites (Gulf of California) and natural populations (Pacific coast), (2) the histopathological effects caused on the soft tissues of scallops, and (3) the relationship between prevalence and intensity records and environmental parameters. The copepod was present throughout the period of investigation, showing similar prevalence and ratio of copepod to scallop patterns in both cultured scallops and wild specimens from natural habitats. Highest prevalence and ratio values were detected in summer-autumn at both sites, probably because scallops showed a weak condition from the combined effects of spawning, reabsorption of residual gametes, and high temperature. The condition index of A. ventricosus showed a significant correlation with the presence of the copepod in Magdalena Bay (-0.67). P. spinosus was observed in the gills of scallops, producing alterations or rupture of filaments, and in the stomach, causing detachment and loss of the epithelium. No relationship between copepod infestation with temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and seston were found during the investigation. Although P. spinosus was present year-round at both sites, no association between infestation and scallop mortalities was detected. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pollution exposure is thought to affect animals through increased maintenance costs, which lead to a decrease in the energy available for other production processes. This can cause weight loss in animals that are chronically exposed to sublethal pollution levels. Starvation and food deprivation have been shown to affect the expression of commonly used bioindicators in fish. The experiments reported in this article were designed to examine the effect of dietary restrictions (in the absence of pollution exposure) on metallothionein and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD; an indicator of CYP1A1 expression) levels in mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus, a fish that has been extensively examined as an environmental bio-indicator species. Dietary restriction over a 35-d period led to weight loss and alterations in physiological indicators (condition index, liver glycogen, and RNA-DNA ratio) consistent with a reduction in available food. Liver EROD activity increased up to 20-fold on a gram basis and 7-fold on a total-liver basis after 35 d of food restriction. The induction of EROD activity was dependent on the level of caloric restriction. Metallothionein levels initially decreased but then increased slightly to near baseline levels after 35 d of dietary restriction. These results are discussed in the context of using mummichogs as bioindicators of pollution exposure.

AB  - Cod populations in Newfoundland and Labrador waters have shown differing growth, condition and recruitment since near-universal declines in these properties during the cold period of the late 1980s and early 1990s. To assess the influence of variable prey communities on these parameters, we compared cod energetics and diet in populations off Labrador and the northeast and south coasts of Newfoundland. Many properties were highest in the southern group(s) and lowest in the northern group(s), including growth, somatic condition, liver index and age-at-maturity. Most differences could be explained by variations in diet, as measured by stomach contents and stable carbon isotopes (delta(13)C). The diet of Labrador cod consisted almost entirely of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), and these cod displayed the most benthic delta(13)C signatures. Northeast cod had a more varied diet that included capelin and other fish, but still had mostly benthic delta(13)C signatures; suggesting the importance of benthic prey like shrimp in this population. South coast cod exhibited the most varied diet, including capelin (Mallotus uillosus), zooplankton, crabs and other fish, and had the most pelagic delta(13)C signatures. Among and within populations, the benefits of a more pelagic diet in medium-sized (30-69 cm) cod included higher somatic condition, higher liver index (lipid stores) and greater spawning potential (decreased incidence of atresia). It is hypothesized that major rebuilding of Newfoundland and Labrador cod stocks will require a return to a system that supports mostly pelagic feeding (i.e. capelin) in cod. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - American black bear (Ursus americanus) damage to apiaries can result in substantial economic loss. We used records of black-bear apiary conflicts collected by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to characterize damage in the Upper and Northern Lower peninsulas of Michigan from April 2003 to May 2011. Most conflicts occurred between May and July, and the number of conflicts decreased across years. The number of reported conflicts was directly correlated with bear population size. However, we found no positive association between numbers of reported conflicts with bear condition as indexed by winter severity and hive abundance. Intolerance toward black bears increased 30% after >1 black bear-apiary conflict occurred. The effectiveness of direct or indirect management for reducing repeated conflicts was similar, and overall management actions may have reduced black bear-apiary conflict.

AB  - A laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the interactive effects of temperature and diet on condition indices of juvenile black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri, reared for time periods ranging from 2 to 42 days. After fish were reared for varying periods, growth, morphometric (Fulton's K) and biochemical [RNA:DNA (R:D) ratios] indices were measured. Fulton's K responded primarily to temperature, with progressive decrease in condition over time for fish reared at high temperatures. In contrast, R:D ratios were primarily affected by diet composition, with the highest values observed for fish reared on fish-based diets as opposed to vegetable-based diets. Significant effects of rearing time were also observed for Fulton's K and R:D ratios, as were some interactive treatment effects. In addition, Fulton's K and R:D ratios were not significantly correlated, perhaps due to the different periods of time integrated by each index or their relative sensitivity to lipid and protein deposition. These results highlight the complex responses of these condition indices to environmental variables and nutritional status.

AB  - This study is the first to analyze the relationship between ecological indices (substrate moisture, nutrient content, substrate dispersion/aeration, substrate pH and humus content) and life forms of the vascular flora in and around Lake Provala; these relationships may serve as reliable indicators of the ecological conditions prevailing in this ecosystem. Since the development of certain life forms, in addition to climatic conditions, depends on plant requirements for several major environmental factors expressed as ecological indices, we established the relationship between the ecological index and life form of vascular plants collected over an eight year period in this system using correspondence analysis. We found a significant correlation between the development of certain life forms and levels of substrate moisture, nutrient content and substrate dispersion/aeration. These relationships help explain the predominance of hemicryptophytes and hydro-helophytes in the riparian zone of the lake, as these forms are perfectly adapted to water-saturated or aquatic environments rich in nutrients and relatively well aerated. There was no significant relationship between life forms and substrate pH or the content of organo-mineral compounds (humus) in the soil.

AB  - Adaptations to captivity that reduce fitness are one of many reasons, which explain the low success rate of reintroductions. One way of testing this hypothesis is to compare an important behavioural response in captive and wild members of the same species. Thanatosis, is an anti-predator strategy that reduces the risk of death from predation, which is a common behavioral response in frogs. The study subjects for this investigation were captive and wild populations of Mantella aurantiaca. Thanatosis reaction was measured using the Tonic Immobility (TI) test, a method that consists of placing a frog on its back, restraining it in this position for a short period of time and then releasing it and measuring how much time was spent feigning death. To understand the pattern of reaction time, morphometric data were also collected as body condition can affect the duration of thanatosis. The significantly different TI times found in this study, one captive population with shorter responses, were principally an effect of body condition rather than being a result of rearing environment. However, this does not mean that we can always dismiss the importance of rearing environment in terms of behavioural skills expressed.

AB  - This is the first evaluation of growth and survival of spat of the Cortez oyster Crassostrea corteziensis (Hertlein) produced under controlled conditions in a coastal area in the state of Sonora, Mexico for aquaculture purposes. A suspended culture technique, used for the Pacific oyster C. gigas, was used. The Cortez oyster has an isometric shell growth during the first 13 months, reaching 71.3 +/- 1.9 mm length, 52.6 +/- 1.3 mm thickness and 25.1 +/- 0.8 mm width. Allometric growth was found between total weight and length, thickness and width (survival was 70%). The relationships between particulate organic, inorganic material, chlorophyll a and environmental parameters with growth are described. Growth rates of C. corteziensis were affected by temperature with retardation at less than 18 degrees C. For aquaculture purposes, it is recommended that spat be sowed after winter, and oyster harvest occur at the end of autumn. According to the von Bertalanffy equation, Cortez oysters would reach the traditional exploitation size of 65 mm (mean length) at harvest. Finally, the results of this study have shown that C. corteziensis is a good candidate for aquaculture projects in this region.

AB  - This is the first calculation of an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the Okavango River to quantitatively assess the biological status of the river. The assessment indicated a definite degradation of the biotic component of the Okavango River. Furthermore isolated problem areas were also identified such as habitat and trophic level degradation, increased pollution and the reduced fish stocks at several localities along the river. Several measures were proposed to counteract this trend to ensure a sustainable fisheries component of the Okavango River in future.

AB  - To evaluate the potential development of a macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Prairie Pothole Region wetlands, we sampled the aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish communities in 24 semipermanent wetlands located throughout central North Dakota. Wetland basins were selected to encompass a range of surrounding land-use, ranging from 100% grassland to 100% cropland. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to identify the influences of fish, and temporal and spatial variation on the macroinvertebrate community. We also used RDA to look for relationships between wetland macroinvertebrate communities and land-use. Seventeen potential invertebrate metrics were tested by graphical analyses. We identified a strong influence on the macroinvertebrate community due to the presence of fish. A number of invertebrate taxa decreased in abundance as the summer progressed, and there was noticeable variation in the invertebrate community among individual wetlands of the region. However, we detected no strong relationships between the varying degrees of agricultural land-use in the wetland catchments and the invertebrate community. Consequently, we were unable to identify any effective IBI metrics indicative of land-use disturbance. Lack of correspondence between land-use and macroinvertebrates in this habitat is most likely due to a high degree of natural disturbance (e.g., presence of fish, temporal changes) and a low diversity community of resilient taxa in Prairie Pothole Region wetlands.

AB  - An index of biotic integrity (IBI) that used eight fish assemblage metrics was examined for effectiveness in estimating anthropogenic impacts to 60 Florida lakes ranging in size from 2 ha to more than 12,400 ha. The lakes ranged in trophic status from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic and had aquatic macrophyte abundances (percent lake volume infested) ranging from less than 1% to 100%. Fish species were classified by trophic feeding guild and tolerance to increases in turbidity or warming and decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration. Fish assemblage metrics tested were as follows: number of fish species, number of native fish species, number of Lepomis species, number of piscivorous species, number of generalist species, number of invertivore species, number of species intolerant of increased turbidity or warming and decreased dissolved oxygen concentration, and number of species tolerant of increased turbidity or warming and decreased dissolved oxygen concentration. The total IBI scores and the data used to calculate individual metrics were unable to accurately predict the degree of anthropogenic impact to 60 Florida lakes, as estimated by personal observations of local limnologists, lake chloride concentrations. and road densities in the watersheds. Lake surface area and lake trophic status have a dominant influence on the fish assemblage metrics tested in this study. Thus, the IBI approach may be of limited usefulness for predicting anthropogenic impact in lake data sets that have wide ranges of surface areas and trophic status classifications.

AB  - A 5-month experiment combining a geochemical survey of metals with a bioaccumulation study in batches of Crassostrea gigas was conducted in two shellfish farming areas and a marina in Normandy (France). Various endpoints at different levels of biological organization were studied. ROCCH data showed differences in biota contamination between the two shellfish areas but the present study revealed only slight differences in metallic contamination and biomarkers. By contrast, significantly different values were recorded in the marina in comparison with the two other sites. Indeed, higher levels of Cd, Cu and Zn were measured in the oysters from the marina, and these oysters also showed a poorer physiological condition (e.g., condition index, histopathological alterations and neutral lipid content). For coastal monitoring, the multi-biomarker approach coupled with an assessment of metallic contamination in biota appeared to be suitable for discriminating spatial differences in environmental quality after only a few months of exposure.

AB  - Sea turtles naturally have gastrointestinal microbiota; however, opportunistic behavior and pathogenicity of some bacteria have also been reported. Therefore, it is important to generate information on possible risks to turtles and human health. Five monthly field trips were carried out with captures of Chelonia mydas in the Ojo de Liebre lagoon complex. Physical examinations were performed and their morphometries were recorded; oral and cloacal swabs were made and seeded in McConkey and TCBS culture media. Bacterial agents were isolated and identified using the API (R) 20E system. Turtles body condition index and the percentages of abundance and prevalence of each microorganism were calculated. Finally, the relationship between the size of the turtles and the presence of the microorganisms was determined. 178 Chelonia mydas were captured, 523 isolates of gram-negative Enterobacteria from seven different species were obtained; the presence of proteobacteria in Chelonia mydas was not related to their age class. Among the microorganisms found, Vibrio fluvialis and Burkholderia cepacia are zoonotic. These studies allow us to understand the role of microorganisms in the diseases of wild populations and the risks to public health associated with their illegal consumption.

AB  - Body weights and fat levels of non-breeding maned ducks on the southern tablelands of New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory were high during spring and summer, and low during autumn and winter. During the non-breeding season, paired females were fatter than unpaired females but fat levels of paired and unpaired males did not differ. Protein levels of females did not vary significantly with season, but protein levels of males were lower in winter. Females undergoing rapid follicle development before laying were fatter than non-breeding birds in the same months. Before laying, females stored fat but not protein for egg production. They used 44% of their pre-laying fat while laying, and a further 47% of the body fat present at the beginning of incubation was used during it. Laying and incubating maned ducks, and ducks with young, were less fat than non-breeding birds in the same months. Body condition of maned ducks was related to food availability, whether breeding or not, to the stage of breeding, and in females to pair status.

AB  - To support tropical maize (Zea mays L.) breeding efforts, the current work aimed to assess harvest index (HI) in modern hybrids and determine the effect of different planting densities on grain yield and HI under well-fertilized (HN) and nitrogen (N) deficient conditions. Harvest index and grain yield of 34 hybrids on average reached 0.42 and 7.06 t/ha (five environments), indicating a large potential for improvement in HI relative to temperate hybrids. Ear weight (r = 0.88), HI (r = 0.78) and shoot dry weight (r = 0.68) were strongly associated with grain yield. In the second experiment, seven hybrids were evaluated at planting densities of 5, 7, 9 and 11 plants/m(2) under HN (six environments) and N deficient (LN) conditions (four environments) to assess the effect of planting density on grain yield and HI. Grain yield increased by 40.4 and 21.8% under HN and LN conditions when planting density was increased relative to the lowest planting density. Harvest index increased from 0.42 at 5 plants/m(2) to 0.45 at 11 plants/m(2) under HN conditions and decreased from 0.44 at 5 plants/m(2) to 0.42 at 9 plants/m(2) under LN conditions. Harvest index was maximized at planting densities of 8.33 plants/m(2) and 5.30 plants/m(2) under HN and LN conditions, respectively, while grain yield was maximized at 9.93 plants/m(2) and 7.89/m(2). Optimal planting density maximizing both HI and grain yield were higher than planting densities currently used in tropical germplasm. It can be concluded that productivity in tropical maize could be increased both under intensive (+40.4%) and lower-input management (+21.8%) by increasing planting densities above those currently used in smallholder agriculture in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, in environments targeted by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center.

AB  - Chemical contaminants are released from mining, domestic and industrial effluents into an aquatic environment. Sediments (n = 10) were collected with an Eckman grab at ten stations in the Densu Estuary for ecological risk assessment. The spatial distribution of organic characteristics and ecological risk of metals-zinc, lead, copper, mercury, iron, and manganese in sediment-were analyzed using standard methods. The organic parameters occurred in the ranges, as follows: % C, 0.76 to 2.05, % TN, 0.06 to 0.015; % TP, 0.44 to 1.38; and C/N, 12.31 to 34.81. The ranges of metal concentrations (mg/kg) were as follows: Fe, 201.10 to 720.90; Mn, 40.10 to 152.70; Zn, 7.3 to 158.3; Pb, 1.9 to 84.7; Cu 3.4 to 23.0; and Hg, 0.01 to 0.05. The mean concentration of metals in the sediment were Fe > Mn > Pb > Zn > Cu > Hg. The highest mean concentration of Fe suggested redox conditions in the Densu Estuary. There is a low contamination factor (CF) for five metals (Zn, Hg, Fe, Cu, and Mn) (CF < 1) to high contamination of Pb (3 < CF <= 6). The average Pb concentration was above local and geological backgrounds, suggesting an anthropogenic source of pollution from industrial and domestic effluents and agrochemicals. The sediment was extremely enriched by Pb (EF > 50) with a positive index of geoaccumulation (0 < Igeo <= 2) than other metals. There is considerable to a very high degree of contamination (DC) (3 <= DC >= 6) of metals in the sediment of Densu Estuary. The potential ecological risk index (<= 40 PERI < 80) suggested a very low to moderate ecological risk of metal pollution. The study provides baseline knowledge on geochemical contamination in tropical estuarine systems for the development of effective chemical control strategies towards sustainable management of coastal waters.

AB  - Leeches can parasitize many vertebrate taxa. In amphibians, leech parasitism often has potential detrimental effects including population decline. Most of studies on the host-parasite interactions involving leeches and amphibians focus on freshwater environments, while they are very scarce for terrestrial amphibians. In this work, we studied the relationship between the leech Batracobdella algira and the European terrestrial salamanders of the genus Hydromantes, identifying environmental features related to the presence of the leeches and their possible effects on the hosts. We performed observation throughout Sardinia (Italy), covering the distribution area of all Hydromantes species endemic to this island. From September 2015 to May 2017, we conducted > 150 surveys in 26 underground environments, collecting data on 2629 salamanders and 131 leeches. Water hardness was the only environmental feature correlated with the presence of B. algira, linking this leech to active karstic systems. Leeches were more frequently parasitizing salamanders with large body size. Body Condition Index was not significantly different between parasitized and non-parasitized salamanders. Our study shows the importance of abiotic environmental features for host-parasite interactions, and poses new questions on complex interspecific interactions between this ectoparasite and amphibians.

AB  - This work presents an exploratory analysis of the potential relationship between offshore shrimp catches and environmental factors at the Gulf of California, using shrimp harvest information from Guaymas, Sonora, and Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico. Multiple correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between landings time series and environmental variables, including average rainfall, fluvial discharge, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino Multivariate (MEI) Indices. Environmental index series were split for January through June (cold season) and July through December (warm season), since shrimp Populations show two reproduction peaks throughout the year. These two spawning seasons give rise to two cohorts: the cold-season (April-June) and the warm-season (October-November), the former sustaining the fishery during the open season (September-March) and yielding 90% of total catch between September and October. Our findings indicate that the mean PDO index for the cold season accounted for the highest percentage of catch variation, suggesting that conditions during the cold season (January-June) may determine recruiting in the April-June cohort. This information may be used to derive catch forecasts several months in advance.

Naturally, each part has specifics functions related with mass and energy, those functions have influence between the parts directly and indirectly, and these functions are subjected to the basic laws of thermodynamics. If each part of the ecosystem is taken as thermodynamics system its entropy generation could be evaluated, then the total entropy generation of the ecosystem must be sum of the entropy generation in each part, to be in accordance with the Gouy-Stodola theorem. With this in mind, in this work an environmental indicator, for any kind of ecosystems, can be determined as a function of the ratio of total entropy generation for reference state, for instance a healthy forest; and the entropy generation of new different state of the same ecosystem can take, for instance a deforestation. Thus, thermodynamics concepts are applied to study the eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems; the strategy is based on techniques that integrate assumptions of the methodology of entropy generation inside ecosystems. The results show that if the amount of entropy generation is small respect a reference state; the sustainability of the ecosystem will be greater. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Watershed integrity, the capacity of a watershed to support and maintain ecological processes essential to the sustainability of services provided to society, can be influenced by a range of landscape and in-stream factors. Ecological response data from four intensively monitored case study watersheds exhibiting a range of environmental conditions and landscape characteristics across the United States were used to evaluate the performance of a national level Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) at regional and local watershed scales. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r(s)), response variables displayed highly significant relationships and were significantly correlated with IWI and ICI (Index of Catchment Integrity) values at all watersheds. Nitrogen concentration and flux-related watershed response metrics exhibited significantly strong negative correlations across case study watersheds, with absolute correlations (|r|) ranging from 0.48 to 0.97 for IWI values, and 0.31 to 0.96 for ICI values. Nitrogen-stable isotope ratios measured in chironomids and periphyton from streams and benthic organic matter from lake sediments also demonstrated strong negative correlations with IWI values, with |r| ranging from 0.47 to 0.92, and 0.35 to 0.89 for correlations with ICI values. This evaluation of the performance of national watershed and catchment integrity metrics and their strong relationship with site level responses provides weight-of-evidence support for their use in state, local and regionally focused applications.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and the excessive human harvesting of forests have led to a continuous decline in the carrying capacity of forests in China. As a result, quantitative means of measuring forest resource carrying capacity are greatly needed, with a view to identifying problem areas and their causes and formulating effective response strategies. This paper puts forward a framework and methodology for constructing a forest resource carrying capacity index (FRCCI). To do this, we first calculate a forest ecological security index (FESI), using an evaluation index system. Ideal FESI values are then simulated by introducing a forest ecological location coefficient (FELC), and the FRCCI is obtained as the difference between the ideal FESI and the FESI. The study considers the 1086 counties that compose the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China, using forest and socioeconomic data for 2015. The resulting FRCCI values indicate that the forests of Yunnan province are generally in a state of "no overload," while Sichuan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces occupied a state of "critical overload" and Anhui and Jiangsu provinces experienced "general overload." The spatial pattern of the FRCCI in the study region presented significant centralization, with high FRCCI values mainly clustered in areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and low FRCCI values mainly clustered in areas in the midstream and downstream reaches of the River. The study identifies 416 counties identified as forest carrying capacity problem areas (38.31% of the study area); these areas were mainly concentrated in Shanghai and Anhui province. We argue that a number of measures would be helpful in improving FRCCI values, including promoting the forest state index by strengthening reforestation as well as afforestation, reducing the external pressure on forests by means of energy saving and emission reduction strategies, and formulating comprehensive policy measures to promote the carrying capacity of forests in the whole study area and in the problem areas.

AB  - On the use of the sensitivity levels of birds to forest fragmentation in the evaluation of the Biotic Integrity: a study case in the north of State of Parana, southern Brazil. A Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is presented based on levels of bird sensitivity to forest fragmentation. Three levels of sensitivity were considered: high, medium, and low. In the present study, 30 bird species were selected, 10 in each level, and the presence/absence of them were verified in 39 forest fragments in the north of the State of Parana, southern Brazil. Based on occurrence data of those selected species, the IBI was calculated in each fragment. The IBI values were influenced by the area of forests fragments (r(2) = 0,34; P < 0,01; F = 18,02). The IBI was also correlated with the species number occurring in the forest fragments (Pearson; r = 0,829, P < 0,01). The largest and more preserved forest fragment presented the highest IBI value (0.85). Therefore, the smaller, isolated and more disturbed forest fragments had the smallest IBI values. It is important to consider that the sensitivity levels of bird species are variable according to different fragmented landscapes; it means that, a previous study to determine the sensitivity levels of bird species is a key factor to an useful IBI. Such procedure can make the IBI an interesting tool for environmental evaluation.

AB  - In a constantly changing world, animals must account for environmental volatility when making decisions. To appropriately discount older, irrelevant information, they need to learn the rate at which the environment changes. We develop an ideal observer model capable of inferring the present state of the environment along with its rate of change. Key to this computation is an update of the posterior probability of all possible change point counts. This computation can be challenging, as the number of possibilities grows rapidly with time. However, we show how the computations can be simplified in the continuum limit by a moment closure approximation. The resulting low-dimensional system can be used to infer the environmental state and change rate with accuracy comparable to the ideal observer. The approximate computations can be performed by a neural network model via a rate-correlation-based plasticity rule. We thus show how optimal observers accumulate evidence in changing environments and map this computation to reduced models that perform inference using plausible neural mechanisms.

AB  - China's Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is the largest water conservancy project in the world, and plays a significant role in flood control and water transport. To study the health status of the tributaries of TGR, we set up 175 sampling sites, including 15 reference sites and 160 impaired sites on 36 important tributaries of TGR, and collected zoobenthos at these sampling sites. We selected 26 candidate metrics, analyzed them in terms of the distribution range, discriminant ability and correlation. Eight core metrics (i.e., total taxa, ephemerida+trichoptera+plecoptera taxa, diptera taxa, ephemerida%, trichoptera%, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, dominant species% and filter%) were identified, and then the benthic indexes of biological integrity (B-IBI) was established. The B-IBI was then used to evaluate the ecological status of 36 tributaries of TGR. Among all the sampling sites, "excellent", "good", "fair", "poor" and "very poor" accounted for 5.14%, 13.14%, 28.00%, 44.57%, and 9.14%, respectively. Among all streams and rivers, "excellent", "good" "fair", "poor" and "very poor" accounted for 5.56%, 41.67%, 50.00%, 2.78%, and 0%, respectively, showing a general good condition for all tributaries. There was a significant difference in health status between tributaries in the TGR dam and those in its upper reaches. The B-IBI established in this study can capture the health status of 36 important tributaries of TGR. This study does not only enrich the practice of health assessment using B-IBI, but also provides some reference for the evaluation of similar rivers across the world.

AB  - Aim. Assessment of the effect of nanoparticles of oxides of cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc on the biological state of ordinary chernozem.
   Material and Methods. The effect of Co3O4, CuO, NiO and ZnO nanoparticles on the biological properties of soil was studied on ordinary chernozem (Rostov-on-Don, Russia). We studied the effect of various concentrations of pollutants depending on their content in soil of 3, 10, 30 backgrounds. Co3O4, CuO, NiO and ZnO nanoparticles with a size of <50 nm and TiO2 of <100 nm.
   Results. Contamination of ordinary chernozem by Co3O4, CuO, NiO and ZnO and their nanoparticles leads to a deterioration in its biological properties in terms of: total bacteria numbers; abundance of bacteria of the genus Azotobacter; activity of catalase; activity of dehydrogenases and decrease in seed germination and length of radish roots. The oxides of the elements under study had an approximately equal negative effect on these indicators, while among the nanopowders the most toxic were the oxides of copper and zinc and the least was cobalt oxide. It was established that the nanopowders of Co3O4, CuO, NiO, and ZnO reduce the biological indices of ordinary chernozem to a greater extent than the `conventional' forms of oxides. A stimulating effect of the studied substances on the biological properties of ordinary chernozem was not recorded. This indicates a high toxicity of the studied substances, which is also characteristic of nanoparticles of other elements.
   Conclusion. Contamination by nanoparticles of oxides of cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc has a negative effect on the biological state of chernozem and is more pronounced than contamination by 'conventional' forms of these oxides.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are often included in bioassessment programs of river health as sensitive indicators of nutrient status and pollution. Many diatom-based indices have been developed and are frequently used to infer conditions in water quality. However, concerns have been raised regarding the robustness of these indices in riverine systems that have natural variability in environmental conditions, including seasonal change of water quality parameters, especially in terms of physical and chemical characteristics of water, which also influence diatom community composition. Here, we used three diatom-based indices (Diatom-based eutrophication/pollution index, EPI-D; Biological Diatom Index, IBD; Watanabe's Index, WAT), which have previously been validated as robust for water quality assessment in China, to explore their response to temporal changes in water quality and diatom community structure in a riverine network over time. Concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), temperature (t), and turbidity in April 2010 were significantly higher than in November 2007. The 141 diatom taxa we found in April 2010 were fewer than the 194 taxa we found in November 2007. On both occasions, the three diatom indices responded to same water quality variables (phosphorus and chloride or nitrogen) as reported in previous studies. Of the three diatom indices tested, EPI-D provided the most robust measure of natural seasonal changes in water quality and indicated the phosphorus and chloride. Our study confirms that these three diatom indices are effective for evaluating long-term water quality in large rivers.

AB  - Introduction: Tackling socioeconomic health inequalities is a big public health challenge and ecological deprivation indexes are essential instruments to monitor and understand them. In Portugal, no standard ecological deprivation index exists, contrasting with other countries. We aimed to describe the construction of the Portuguese version of a transnational deprivation index, European Deprivation Index.
   Material and Methods: The European Deprivation Index was developed under the Townsend theorization of deprivation. Using data from the European Union -Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey, we obtained an indicator of individual deprivation. This indicator became the gold-standard variable, based on what we selected the variables at aggregate level (census) to be included in the European Deprivation Index, a total of eight. The European Deprivation Index was produced for the smallest area unit possible (n = 16 094, mean/area = 643 inhabitants) and resulted from the weighted sum of the previous variables. It was then classified into quintiles.
   Results: The first quintile (least deprived) comprised 20.9% national population and the fifth quintile (most deprived) 18.0%. The European Deprivation Index showed a clear geographic pattern -most deprived areas concentrated in the South and in the inner North and Centre of the country, and the least deprived areas in the coastal areas of North and Centre and in the Algarve.
   Discussion: The development of the European Deprivation Index was grounded on a solid theoretical framework, individual and aggregate variables, and on a longitudinal Europe-wide survey allowing its replication over the time and in any European country.
   Conclusion: Hopefully, the European Deprivation Index will start being employed by those interested in better understand health inequalities not only in Portugal but across Europe.

AB  - The global interest in the assessment of quality condition of some benthic habitats on hard bottoms, such as the coralligenous bioconstruction particularly important for the biodiversity maintenance in the Mediterranean Sea, is recently increasing. Using a synthesis of recent knowledge and ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicles) imaging data acquired in the Bay of Naples (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy), the Coralligenous Bioconstruction Quality Index (CBQI) was developed.
   This new index can compare different types of coralligenous habitat (rocky cliffs, submerged shoals, and platform banks) located at both shallow and deep bottoms, and calculate their quality status taking into account coralligenous communities structuring, bottom abiotic factors and anthropic stress evaluation. The data analysis was relatively fast and easy to perform due to the use of morphological groups for coralligenous characterization and anthropic impact categories mainly related to fishing activities.
   The CBQI may provide a useful tool for the establishment of monitoring protocols and management programs to assess the quality of coralligenous bioconstructions,.in different areas of Mediterranean Sea, since it takes into account and discerns the change in communities due to environmental characteristics and/or to anthropic pressure.

AB  - Body mass and body composition of 27 adult Velvet Scoters (Melanitta fusca) were studied. These birds were collected from January to March in the Gulf of Gdansk, Poland. Body mass, fat, and protein contents of both males and females decreased significantly between mid and late winter, possibly because of a physiological process or a result of worsening environmental conditions. In mid-winter, the mean body mass of males and females did not differ significantly, whereas in late winter the difference in body mass between sexes became prominent. There was no difference in fat mass between the sexes, but females had higher lipid indexes despite their smaller size. The lack of expected fat mass increase in late winter may be due to the spring migration strategy of Velvet Scoters, which apparently opt to fly short distances rather than make long non-stop flights after departure from the Gulf of Gdansk. Body mass was the best predictor of fat mass accumulated by Velvet Scoters wintering in the Gulf of Gdansk.

AB  - The black locust Robinia pseudoacacia L. is a common species that originated from North America. In Europe, it is an invasive and introduced plant. Due to its low habitat requirements and ecological plasticity, this species colonizes new anthropogenically transformed areas quickly. This study investigated the chemical composition of selected tissues of Robinia pseudoacacia L. in five various habitats with different levels of anthropopression conditions in southern Poland. The presented research aimed to compare the chemical composition of black locust parts tissues (leaves, branches, and seeds) and the soil under its canopy. To determine the heavy metal contamination and enrichment in soil, the geoaccumulation index, enrichment factor, contamination factor, pollution load index, and potential ecological risk index were calculated. The results showed that all examined soils are considerably or very highly contaminated and the main heavy metals, which pollute the studied samples, are cadmium (1.3-3.91 ppm), lead (78.17-157.99 ppm), and zinc (129.77-543.97 ppm). Conducted research indicates that R. pseudoacacia leaves are the primary carrier of potentially toxic elements. Due to low bioaccumulation factor (BAF) values, it is clear that black locusts do not accumulate contaminants in such amounts that it would pose risk to its use in degraded area reclamation. The obtained results showed that R. pseudoacacia is able to grow in a wide range of habitats and could be applied for greening urban habitats and disturbed ecosystems caused by industry.

AB  - Climate change within the UK will affect winter starvation risk because higher temperatures reduce energy budgets and are likely to increase the quality of the foraging environment. Mass regulation in birds is a consequence of the starvation-predation risk trade-off: decreasing starvation risk because of climate change should decrease mass, but this will be countered by the effects of predation risk, because high predation risk has a negative effect on mass when foraging conditions are poor and a positive effect on mass when foraging conditions are good. We tested whether mass regulation in great tits (Parus major) across the UK was related to temporal changes in starvation risk (winter temperature 1995-2005) and spatial changes in predation risk (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus abundance). As predicted, great tits carried less mass during later, warmer, winters, demonstrating that starvation risk overall has decreased. Also, the effects of predation risk interacted with the effects of temperature (as an index of foraging conditions), so that in colder winters higher sparrowhawk abundance led to lower mass, whereas in warmer, later, winters higher sparrowhawk abundance led to higher mass. Mass regulation in a small bird species may therefore provide an index of how environmental change is affecting the foraging environment.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effect of thermal-hydraulic variables in female buffaloes with or without direct solar exposure in a year of strong El Nino through behavior responses and infrared thermography to reinforce the environmental comfort indicators, in Marajo Island, Para, Brazil. The experiment was carried out in Cachoeira do Arari municipality and 20 female Murrah buffaloes were randomly assigned to two groups: Group WS (n = 10) was kept in pickets with native trees. Group NS (n = 10) was kept in crush squeeze with no shade. Data on air temperature (AT, degrees C), relative air humidity (RH, %), wind velocity (WV, m/s), rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), and body surface temperature (BST) were collected. Practical Buffalo Comfort Climatic Condition Index (BCCCI), practical Buffalo Environmental Comfort Index (BECI), Temperature and Humidity Index (THI) and Benezra's Thermal Comfort Index (BTCI) were obtained. Infrared thermography analysis was carried out with a FLIR T-series T640bx camera. Data on time spent grazing, ruminating, idleness, and in other activities were recorded. A significant difference in AT of similar to 1 degrees C was found between the groups at 6 a.m., 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. THI indicated emergency conditions. Female buffaloes were at danger PBCCCI conditions at 2 p.m. There was also significant difference for RT between treatments at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., whose values were higher (P < 0.05) for animals from NS Group, with the highest mean time at 2 p.m. Pearson correlation was significant and positive (P < 0.01) between RT mean and VUL, TI and ORB mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. The total time given to grazing was 518.2 min for the group NS and 629.5 min for the group WS. Rumination was more pronounced in the afternoon shift for the group NS. Buffaloes kept in a system with trees graze, ruminate and perform other activities with more intensity than animals raised in systems without access to shade, and tend to hyperthermia, mainly at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., in Marajo Island, Para, Brazil.

AB  - Protection of non-human biota from ionizing contaminants, especially in the vicinity of nuclear installations is a very important aspect for nuclear engineers and ecologists. In this view, a baseline data on the activity concentration of Po-210 and Pb-210 were quantified in different tissues of molluscs inhabiting the intertidal region along the coast of Kudankulam. The activity concentration was noticed higher in the organs associated with digestion and metabolism. Filter feeding bivalve molluscs registered the maximum activity of Po-210 in their whole body compared to grazing gastropods. Po-210:Pb-210 ratio was calculated to be greater than unity in most of the analysed tissues. The ecological sensitivity of molluscs to the radiation exposure and the safeness of the environment was analysed by calculating the external and internal dose rate. The hazard quotient for molluscs was lesser than the global bench mark dose rate of 10 mu Gy h(-1). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine ecosystems in the eastern channel and southern bight of the North Sea provide nursery habitats for juvenile fishes. We examined the age 0-group juveniles of three flatfish species: Solea solea, Limanda limanda and Pleuronectes platessa, collected in five nursery areas with different characteristics ( three sites located near small estuaries and two affected by important inputs of industrial effluents), to evaluate habitat influence on their growth and condition. We measured a biochemical index (RNA: DNA ratio), a morphometric index (Fulton's K condition index), plus a recent growth index (marginal otolith increment width) on each individual (about 3 months old), collected during surveys in autumn 1999. The three indices displayed few significant differences among the five nursery sites and different patterns for each species. We suggest that the investigated nursery areas provide habitats of equivalent quality for the age 0-group juvenile flatfishes in spite of different anthropogenic disturbances. On the other hand, this study focuses on the importance of using different biological indicators to assess habitat quality and environmental stressors in coastal areas.

AB  - Drought severity and impact assessments are necessary to effectively monitor droughts in semi-arid contexts. However, little is known about the influence land use-land cover (LULC) has-in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurations-on drought effects. Coupling remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques, drought evolution was assessed and mapped. During the growing season, drought severity and the effects on LULC were examined and whether these differed between areas of land change and persistence. This study used areas of economic importance to Botswana as case studies. Vegetation Condition Index, derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index time series for the growing seasons (2000-2018 in comparison to 2020-2021), was used to assess droughts for 17 constituencies (Botswana's fourth administrative level) in the Central District of Botswana. Further analyses by LULC types and land change highlighted the vulnerability of both human and natural systems to drought. Identified drought periods in the time series correspond to declared drought years by the Botswana government. Drought severity (extreme, severe, moderate and mild) and the percentage of land areas affected varied in both space and time. The growing seasons of 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2015-2016 were the most drought-stricken in the entire time series, coinciding with the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO). The lower-than-normal vegetation productivity during these growing seasons was evident from the analysis. With the above-normal vegetation productivity in the ongoing season (2020-2021), the results suggest the reversal of the negative vegetation trends observed in the preceding growing seasons. However, the extent of this reversal cannot be confidently ascertained with the season still ongoing. Relating drought severity and intensities to LULC and change in selected drought years revealed that most lands affected by extreme and severe drought (in descending order) were in tree-covered areas (forests and woodlands), grassland/rangelands and croplands. These LULC types were the most affected as extreme drought intersected vegetation productivity decline. The most impacted constituencies according to drought severity and the number of drought events were Mahalapye west (eight), Mahalapye east (seven) and Boteti west (seven). Other constituencies experienced between six and two drought events of varying durations throughout the time series. Since not all constituencies were affected similarly during declared droughts, studies such as this contribute to devising appropriate context-specific responses aimed at minimising drought impacts on social-ecological systems. The methodology utilised can apply to other drylands where climatic and socioeconomic contexts are similar to those of Botswana.

AB  - Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) devices were deployed together for three one-month periods in coastal waters of Sardinia (Italy), in order to assess the levels of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb in areas differently affected by anthropogenic activities. DGT devices were more sensitive than mussels in detecting differences in metal concentrations between sites, while interpretation of the biomonitoring data revealed difficulties related to the biotic and abiotic factors that can influence the measurements. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between Cd and Pb concentrations measured in the mussel tissues and bioavailable metal levels in seawater. Moreover transplanted mussels did not accumulate Cu and Ni following pre-exposure, although DGT showed significant concentrations of bioavailable forms of these metals in seawater. The results provided an estimate of the water quality with respect to dissolved metals and pointed out the usefulness of a combination of biomonitoring and DGT techniques for a better understanding of trace metal availability in coastal waters.

AB  - A major issue for water resource management is the assessment of environmental degradation of lotic ecosystems. In order to quantify the extent of resource degradation resulting from anthropogenic disturbances, a fish-based index, the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), has been used throughout North America and recently in Europe. The IBI is based on the assumption that fish assemblage attributes change in a characteristic fashion with stream degradation. In this study, using data from 1979 to 1991, we analysed the impact of 9 salmonid farm effluents on fish assemblages in some Brittany streams. Annual production of these farms varied between 2 and 300 tons. The data were first computed using a principal components analysis. Ordination of the points indicated longitudinal changes in fish assemblages from upstream to downstream and separated sites sampled upstream from sites sampled downstream from the fish farms. Depending on stream size, we found, downstream from trout farms, an increase in both density and biomass of most species, extirpation of sensitive ones (Cottus gobio L. ), and appearance of pollution-tolerant (Rutilus rutilus L.) and exotic forms (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.). Finally, we modified the IBI and compared it with chemical variables to illustrate how this index can be applied to quantify disturbances of the quality of stream water induced by fish farms. This IBI, based on 10 fish assemblage attributes, showed close agreement with these independent chemical measurements.

AB  - Hatchery-reared juvenile sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus (mean shell height = 22.2 +/- 0.1 mm) were grown uncontained on the seabed (5-9 m depth) and suspended in pearl nets (3 m above the seabed) at three sites (Site 1, 2 and 3) in Lunenburg Bay, N. S., Canada, between March 1992 and March 1993. Shell and tissue growth rates reached their peak in mid-summer and decreased to the lowest values in winter, although growth never stopped. Monthly measurements of shell heights of individually tagged scallops in pearl nets (100 per net) and on the seabed, yielded mean (+/- s.e.) annual growth rates of 93 +/- 5.5 and 117 +/- 4.5 mu m/day, respectively, at Site 1, 72 +/- 3.0 and 93 +/- 3.8 mu m/day at Site 2, and 79 +/- 2.8 and 73 +/- 5.6 mu m/day at Site 3. There were significant differences in shell growth rates among the three sites and between the two culture methods in most of the months. The highest shell growth rates generally occurred at Site 2, regardless of culture method. Shell growth rates were significantly higher in bottom than in suspended culture during most measurement periods, Mean final soft tissue condition index of scallops in suspended culture was significantly higher than in bottom culture at Site 2. Mean final adductor muscle condition index and mean final whole dry weights of scallops were significantly lower in suspended culture than in bottom culture at Site 2. Water temperature at all three sites ranged from similar to -2 to 16 degrees C during the year. There were significant differences in annual mean particulate organic matter concentration between depths, but not among sites, Annual mean chlorophyll concentration differed among sites, but not between depths within sites, Stepwise multiple regression analyses, with water temperature, total particulate matter concentration, and chlorophyll concentration as independent variables, were highly significant for all sites and culture methods. They explained between 46% and 66% of the total variance of shell growth rates in suspended culture and between 36% and 78% in bottom culture, respectively and 55% and 80% for soft tissue growth rates of scallops in suspended and bottom culture, respectively. Growth of scallops in bottom culture at these shallow sites is comparable to animals of the same seed populations grown in the more expensive and labour-intensive suspended culture at the same sites.

AB  - Laboratory-based bioaccumulation and toxicity bioassays are frequently used to predict the ecological risk of contaminated sediments in the field. This study investigates the bioassay conditions most relevant to achieving environmentally relevant field exposures. An identical series of metal-contaminated marine sediments were deployed in the field and laboratory over 31 days. Changes in metal concentrations and partitioning in both sediments and waters were used to interpret differences in metal exposure and bioaccumulation to the benthic bivalve Tellina deltoidalis. Loss of resuspended sediments and deposition of suspended particulate matter from the overlying water resulted in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn (major contaminants) becoming lower in the 1-cm surface layer of field-deployed sediments. Lower exchange rates of overlying waters in the laboratory resulted in higher dissolved metal exposures. The prediction of metal bioaccumulation by the bivalves in field and laboratory was improved by considering the metal partitioning within the surface sediments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Birds are indicators of vegetation structure and ecological conditions. The singing activity of birds declines during late-morning periods, which can affect estimates of abundance and conclusions regarding vegetative conditions indexed by birds. Therefore, it is important to quantify periods of bird activity so biologists can plan studies. We determined hourly detections from singing males of 22 nongame bird species in ponderosa pine, quaking aspen, and grassland vegetation types in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Detections of 12 of 22 species differed among 1-hr intervals after sunrise. Detections of yellow-rumped warblers, Townsend's solitaires, red-breasted nuthatches, western tanagers, and American robins decreased on count-episodes more than 4 hrs after sunrise. Detections of dusky flycatchers declined on count-episodes more than 3 hrs after sunrise and detections of black-capped chickadees were greatest during the first hour after sunrise and declined afterward. Detections of many other species from songs or calls decreased on count-episodes more than 5 hrs after sunrise. We recommend that bird counts in the Black Hills be completed within 4 hrs after sunrise so estimates of bird abundance are not affected by reduced singing among males.

The geoprocessing techniques to identify different levels of degradation through consistent data and repeated measurements. The objective of this research was to use Vegetation Indexes (NDVI) to detect degradation processes of pastures grown in the municipality of Colorado do Oeste - RO. For the study, were used OLI/Landsat satellite images 8 scenes 230/69 and 229/69 for the year 2015, with subsequent verification of a field of pasture conditions. The indexes indicated that 66.69% of the municipality present pastures with some degree of degradation. Of this percentage, 35.19% were classified with moderately (Grassland 3), 24.88% strongly (Grassland 2) and 6.62%, extremely degraded (Grassland 1), and only 33.30% of the pastures in the study area are in adequate production conditions. The methodology used was satisfactory for differentiation of pasture degradation levels.

AB  - Drought is a natural hazard which occurs in all climatic zones. The effect from drought can cause a serious problem for agricultural activities, economies and the environment. There is a need to characterize drought events in terms of drought severity, frequency and possibility of drought occurrence for better drought management. An examination of drought characteristics and drought severity using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) was carried out for different land cover types. The study examined how data mining techniques such as association rules could be used to elucidate the relationships between VCI and SPI in order to predict the possibility of drought occurrence. Rainfall datasets were collected from the Thai meteorological department for the period 1980-2009 and digitally encoded into a Geographic Information System database. SPI values were derived both temporally and spatially for quantitative measurement of drought events over the 30-year period. Monthly VCI values were calculated from NDVI data collected from year 2001 to 2009 using multi-temporal Terra MODIS Vegetation Indices Product (MOD13Q1). Data mining technique was introduced and applied to generate association rules between VCI and SPI to predict the possibility of drought occurrence. The results from multi-temporal SPI analysis shown drought event occurred more often for the 3- and 6-month SPI in October at the central and the northeastern part of the region. Spatial SPI revealed that high-drought-risk areas were in the southwest and extending to the central part of the region. The statistically significant correlations between monthly VCI and SPI at the multiple timescales were found for mixed deciduous forest in dry period. This result indicated vegetation condition for this forest type was sensitive for precipitation during dry period. Drought events were found to affect the rice crop in the central part of the region more, as observed from the negative correlation between VCI and SPI during growing season. The representative association rules from VCI and SPI revealed drought event also occurred for paddy field in the central part of the region. Drought periods within the growing season for this area are becoming more prevalent even with increase in annual rainfall. Shorter scale of SPI was found to be effective in characterizing drought conditions. This study combined the different level of software and dataset used which are able to predict future occurrence and severity of drought using the current condition. Results can be applied to assess drought severity and drought-affected areas for efficient drought management and planning.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to the assessment of the potential for sustainable use of cultural landscapes based on their physical conditions and history of land use development. The most stable areas (which have experienced no change in land use throughout the study period) as identified by multitemporal analyses of historical maps, were overlaid with physical conditions in the form of a geo-complex model, constituted of data relating to geology, climate, soil conditions, slope, aspect and potential natural vegetation. Using the formula of relative frequencies of areas' land use forms, multiplied with relative frequencies of the physical condition within the land use forms, we produced a so-called affinity of land use form to physical conditions index (Affinity Index). This Affinity Index was used to assess the land form potential of the geo-complex. A comparison of present and proposed land use patterns could be employed as a tool with which to assess the potential for the sustainable management of landscapes which takes into account aspects of the cultural landscape.

AB  - We examine lacustrine wetland plant assemblages in the Central Corn Belt Plain portion of the Lake Michigan basin and developed a multimetric plant index of biotic integrity (PIBI). Our objectives were to determine the structural and functional attributes of littoral zone plant assemblages of least-impacted lacustrine wetlands, establish and test candidate metrics, statistically test and calibrate metrics, and finally validate a PIBI along a disturbance gradient. Of 35 candidate metrics, we chose 11 metrics that were grouped into four categories: species richness and composition, species tolerance, guild structure, and vegetation abundance. Based on Spearman correlations, we identified a suite of metrics, particularly those related to species richness and tolerance that had a strong response to human-induced habitat change. The overall PIBI correlated strongly with independent measures of habitat quality (p < 0.001) using a qualitative habitat index developed for lacustrine habitats. We validated the lacustrine PIBI by comparing index response to various landuse, landcover, and management types. Least impacted lakes and lakes classified as recreational or undergoing ecological restoration were not statistically separable and received the highest index scores, while the lowest scores were associated with industrial and residential land use. Least-impacted sites differ significantly (p < 0.001) from both industrial and residential lakes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the recognition of the importance of biological diversity in biological conservation grows, an ongoing challenge is to develop metrics that can be used for effective conservation and management. The ecological integrity assessment has been proposed as such a metric. It is held by some to measure species composition, diversity, and habitat quality, as well as ecosystem structure, composition, and function. The methodology relies on proxy variables that include data on landscape characteristics such as patch size, abiotic factors such as hydrology, and some features of vegetation structure and composition. We suggest that the measure is flawed on four levels. First, its putative representation of general ecological form and function, and its lack of specific detail about how it actually represents those attributes, leaves the metric without the focus needed to be useful for measuring ecological features on the ground and testing associated hypotheses and predictions. Second, the proxy variables used to represent biological diversity, such as habitat (vegetation) metrics and vascular plant species diversity, are not empirically correlated with diversity of a range of taxa or of other components of the biota. Third, like other ecological indices that integrate many distinct features, the ecological integrity index is subject to the loss of information in its condensation of multi-dimensional variability into a one-dimensional index, and it may be subject to systematic bias from the conversion of raw data into categorical scores. Fourth, the sampling protocols are at risk of sampling bias, observer bias, and measurement error, any of which can confound the estimation of conservation value. In terms of biological diversity, the methodology produces an unreliable estimate of the number of vascular plant species and their relative percentages of occurrence, and an absence of any protocols for taxa other than plants. For these reasons we believe that ecological integrity assessment is currently of limited value as a measure of site-specific biological diversity and its change over time. A considerable amount of investigation is needed in order to have confidence in the results of an ecological integrity assessment, especially if it is to be used for regulatory purposes. We suggest further refinements and discuss alternative measures of biological diversity that provide reliable metrics for assessing change. A thoughtful choice among measures can help to identify the most appropriate assessment for conservation decisions.

AB  - Drought is the most restricting factor in agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions. This research was conducted on 19 facultative and winter wheat genotypes grown under normal irrigation (N), early post-anthesis (S-1), and late post-anthesis (S-2) drought stress conditions. The experiments were conducted at Karadj, Arak, and Jolgehrokh Agricultural Research Stations in Iran, during 2008-11 cropping seasons. Stress reduced grain number per spike, thousand grain weight, grain weight per spike, harvest index, biological weight, and grain yield. Effect of environment, irrigation, and genotype on most of the traits, including grain yield, was significant. Remobilization, efficiency of remobilization, and pre-anthesis photo-assimilate contribution to grain filling increased under drought stress condition. Correlation coefficients between those traits and grain yield were significantly positive under N, S-1, and S-2 conditions. Based on different drought tolerance indices, the improved line Alvd//Aldan/Ias58*2/3/Gaspard was identified as the most tolerant genotype under anthesis and post-anthesis drought stress conditions. It also had the highest remobilization, efficiency of remobilization, and pre-anthesis photo-assimilate contribution to grain filling under drought stress conditions.

AB  - Developmental instability, measured as fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in bilateral traits, has been used widely as an indicator of genetic or environmental stress in a variety of plant and animal taxa. FA arises as small deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry which reflect 'mistakes' in developmental processes resulting from the inability of the genotype to buffer itself effectively against environmental perturbations. Recently, it has been proposed that FA in the otoliths can be used as an indicator of condition in larval fish. This paper reviews the conceptual and methodological aspects of FA relevant to its potential use as a measure of well-being. Its simplicity makes FA an attractive tool to measure developmental precision and condition. However, there are several pitfalls, such as measuring error or potentially size dependence. Subtle asymmetries, i.e. between sides variation of a trait at the individual level, may not always be indicative of condition and should be interpreted with caution. The past-growth record of otoliths may provide a powerful means of studying the development of asymmetries at the level of the individual. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - Transplantation of mussels to new aquaculture sites is currently being undertaken in Istria (Croatia) to increase production, minimize potential seasonal urban contamination, and secure safer seafood products. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of season and transplantation on physiological indices (condition index and meat yield) of mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were obtained from five aquaculture areas in Istria (central Lim Bay, Raa, Budava, Vabriga, and Pomer) and moved to a reference site in inner Lim Bay from April to July. Results showed that both season and transplantation affected physiological indices of mussels. Higher physiological indices were found in cultivated mussels from all areas in summer compared to spring, except in mussels from Vabriga and Pomer. In addition, higher physiological indices were found in mussels transplanted from central Lim Bay to the reference site in inner Lim Bay. Transplantation negatively affected physiological indices of mussels from Vabriga and Pomer, with no change in mussels from Raa and Budava. In conclusion, mussels from all areas exhibit satisfactory commercial results (15%) during the peak summer harvesting season. For most transplanted mussels, transplantation itself represents additional stress, bringing into focus adaptation processes, stock genetics, and favorable ecological conditions.

AB  - This is the first study performed to determine the health status of the razor clam, Ensis macha, including six different populations along Argentina Patagonian coast and one of Chile. The parasites and pathologies affecting E. macha were analyzed and their prevalence and mean intensity values were calculated. To establish which factors affect the presence and intensity of infection, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were applied. Basophilic inclusions, ciliates, coccidians protozoans and turbellarians were found. We report an Aporocotylidae digenean and hemocyte infiltrations. None of the parasites is OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) notifiable, and none seemed to be pathogenic, with the exception of the digenean. The prevalence of the parasites was affected mainly by environmental factors (such as site of sampling and season) instead of intrinsic conditions of the clam (such as size, condition index, sex and gonadal stage). On the other hand, the maximum intensity of parasites was not only related with cold seasons but also with the partially spawned gonadal stage of E. macha. During this stage, the clams would need to store energy for the next gametogenesis cycle, might be more susceptible to infection by the parasites. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An important element of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 15 - i.e. to enhance "ecosystem resilience ... through conservation and restoration" - remains largely unaddressed by existing indicators. We here develop an indicator addressing just one of many possible dimensions of ecosystem resilience, by focusing on the capacity of ecosystems to retain biological diversity in the face of ongoing, and uncertain, climate change. The Bioclimatic Ecosystem Resilience Index (BERI) assesses the extent to which a given spatial configuration of natural habitat will promote or hinder climate-induced shifts in biological distributions. The approach uses existing global modelling of spatial turnover in species composition within three broad biological groups (plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) to scale projected changes in composition under a plausible range of climate scenarios. These projections serve as filters through which to analyse the configuration of habitat observed at a given point in time (e.g. for a particular year) - represented as a grid in which cells are scored in terms of habitat condition. BERI is then calculated, for each cell in this grid, as a function of the connectedness of that cell to areas of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape which are projected to support a similar composition of species under climate change to that currently associated with the focal cell. All analyses are performed at 30-arcsecond grid resolution (approximately 1 km cells at the equator). Results can then be aggregated to report on status and trends for any desired set of reporting units - e.g. ecoregions, countries, or ecosystem types. We present example outputs for the Moist Tropical Forest Biome, based on a habitat-condition time series derived from the Global Forest Change dataset. We also describe how BERI is now being extended to cover all biomes (forest and non-forest) across the entire terrestrial surface of the planet.

AB  - In Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), drinking water quality monitoring is conducted by the provincial government on all public water supply systems and results are communicated to communities on a quarterly basis. This paper describes the application of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) as a communications tool for reporting the drinking water quality results. The CCME WQI simplifies the communication of results while integrating local expert opinion, without challenging the integrity of the data. The NL Department of Environment and Conservation successfully tested the use of the CCME WQI on selected drinking water quality data sets, and developed a phased approach for its implementation as a practical means of presenting available physical, chemical, organic and microbiological results to communities. The CCME WQI index categorization schema was modified by adding a new ranking category to incorporate local expert opinion. This paper describes the development of the phased approach for calculating water quality indices, the testing methodology used, the rationale for modifying the existing CCME WQI index categorization schema, and the implementation of an automated CCME WQI calculator in the provincial drinking water quality database. The paper also discusses the challenges encountered in using the CCME WQI especially with respect to incorporation of contaminants, microbiological and trihalomethanes data. The benefits and downfalls of this application are also discussed.

AB  - The relationship between diatom indices and water quality index in physico-chemical variables are explored at different ten locations of Cauvery River in parts of Tamil Nadu, India. Macrophytic and epiphytic diatom assemblages in the study areas were identified from 2012 and 2013. Their relationships with physico-chemicals parameters are examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis with forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation. The results of the present study on diatom assemblages in Cauvery River at Siluvampalayam and Koneripatti indicates moderate pollution, while at Peramachipalayam, Kottampatty, Sanyasipatti and Bhavani shows high level of pollution due to sewage, industrial effluents and dying factories. Water quality index reveals that water of river Cauvery to be unpolluted in the upstream of the city and unfit for drinking towards the downstream at Bhavani town.

AB  - In the context of global change, ectotherms are increasingly impacted by abiotic perturbations. Along the distribution area of a species, the populations at low latitudes are particularly exposed to temperature increase and hypoxic events. In this study, we have compared the proteomic responses in the liver of European flounder populations, by using 2-D electrophoresis. One southern peripheral population from Portugal vs two northern core populations from France, were reared in a common garden experiment. Most of the proteomic differences were observed between the two experimental conditions, a cold vs a warm and hypoxic conditions. Consistent differentiations between populations were observed in accumulation of proteins involved in the bioenergetics-and methionine-metabolisms, fatty acids transport, and amino-acid catabolism. The specific regulation of crucial enzymes like ATP-synthase and G6PDH, in the liver of the southern population, could be related to a possible local adaptation. This southern peripheral population is spatially distant from northern core populations and has experienced dissimilar ecological conditions; thus it may contain genotypes that confer resilience to climate changes.

AB  - In this paper, free vibration of functionally graded (FG) microbeams under thermal environment based on modified couple stress theory is investigated. The internal length-scale parameter is considered to account for material size effect. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is employed, and the eigenvalue problem for obtaining the natural frequencies of FG microbeam is solved for different boundary conditions. Trial functions are expressed in simple algebraic polynomial forms, and application of different boundary conditions in Rayleigh-Ritz method is explained in detail. The convergence of the method is investigated, and the results are compared with the available results in the literature. The material properties of the microbeam are assumed to vary in the thickness direction with a power-law function. It is shown that by increasing the temperature change in the microbeam, the natural frequencies decrease. In addition, it is observed that natural frequencies of microbeam based on modified couple stress theory differ significantly from natural frequencies of classical beam. It is also concluded that increase in FG index results in increase in natural frequencies, but for very high FG indexes, natural frequencies do not change considerably.

AB  - The physiological state of an animal may have a significant impact on its reproductive success because individuals in good body condition are generally considered to be competitively superior to individuals in poor body condition. In this study, we tested if body condition at weaning affected survival and reproduction of prairie votes (Microtus ochrogaster (Wagner, 1842)) living under ecologically relevant conditions at two different initial population densities. We detected no evidence that better body condition at weaning was associated with either enhanced survival or reproduction. Moreover, genetic analysis of parentage found that mating between males and females was random with respect to body condition. Results of this study indicate body condition at weaning was not a reliable predictor of future survival or reproduction in prairie voles. This may be because body condition at weaning does not accurately forecast the energetic state of prairie voles at later ages, or because other factors have a greater effect on an individual's survival and reproductive success at the densities observed in this study.

AB  - How should the success of river and floodplain restoration be assessed? What should we be restoring? We contend that the benchmark for restoration should be the river in its "natural," that is, quasi-equilibrium condition prior to deliberate modification. The pre-modification condition of the river represents a quasi-equilibrium state in which the river accommodates and adjusts to catchment water and sediment fluxes, whether in a pristine or modified catchment. The resulting assemblage of river landforms (e.g., bars, channels, backwaters) is in balance with the prevailing flood and sediment regime. Furthermore, equilibrium channel forms can adjust to changes in, for example, flood magnitude and frequency via for example, channel expansion or contraction. A restored river system is one that once was anthropogenically restricted, but now has regained capacity to adjust its form. River restoration needs understanding of the history and trajectory of pre-modification channels, so that the "right" river type can be restored. To assess the scope and success of restoration, we propose using a natural character index (NCI). The NCI is the ratio between a parameter which describes the form and function of a river now (observed) and the same parameter measured at a point or points in time past (expected). Exemplar parameters include sinuosity, floodplain width, active channel width, bar area (at a given flow) and riparian vegetation. Measurement of these parameters utilizes a combination of aerial photos, archive maps and LiDAR-derived terrain models, the availability of which necessarily limits and determines what parameters can be used in NCI assessment. LiDAR is a useful tool providing an opportunity to comprehend pre-modification river and floodplain character. We illustrate the NCI concept and its potential for use in assessing restoration effects using examples from New Zealand, Spain and Croatia. The result is an index of use as a "first cut" preliminary assessment for river practitioners.

AB  - Two major international initiatives - the Convention on Biological Diversity's target to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment - raise the profile of ecological data on the changing state of nature and its implications for human well-being. This paper is intended to provide a broad overview of current knowledge of these issues. Information on changes in the status of species, size of populations, and extent and condition of habitats is patchy, with little data available for many of the taxa, regions and habitats of greatest importance to the delivery of ecosystem services. However, what we do know strongly suggests that, while exceptions exist, the changes currently underway are for the most part negative, anthropogenic in origin, ominously large and accelerating. The impacts of these changes on human society are idiosyncratic and patchily understood, but for the most part also appear to be negative and substantial. Forecasting future changes is limited by our poor understanding of the cascading impacts of change within communities, of threshold effects, of interactions between the drivers of change, and of linkages between the state of nature and human well-being. In assessing future science needs, we not only see a strong role for ecological data and theory, but also believe that much closer collaboration with social and earth system scientists is essential if ecology is to have a strong bearing on policy makers.

AB  - A Multimetric Phytoplankton Index (MPI) is proposed to support management policies for the assessment of transitional ecosystems and the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive. The MPI incorporates Hulburt's dominance index, bloom frequency and Menhinick's diversity index, calculated on the basis of phytoplankton species composition.
   Chlorophyll a concentrations were also included, to provide biomass data and to guarantee continuity and comparison with past evaluations. The MPI was calculated by averaging the ratios of the resulting values of each metric to those of a reference site characterised by low anthropogenic impact.
   The MPI was set up using data from over a 10-year period in several stations in Venice Lagoon (Northwestern Adriatic region), a highly valuable and heterogeneous transitional environment, subject to significant anthropogenic pressures. The dataset included physico-chemical data, nutrient and contaminant concentrations. Statistical analyses allowed us to gauge the MPI's responses to anthropogenic pressures and to verify its reliability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Yield stability (simply "stability'') is a crop genotype's performance over a range of environmental conditions, such that a specific genotype may be less sensitive to environmental change (i.e., above-average stability) or more sensitive to environmental change (i.e., below-average stability) relative to other genotypes. The ideal genotype for most crops is believed to have both above-average yield and above-average stability. The objective of the study was to determine the pattern of genotype adoption and use of processing sweet corn in relation to yield and stability. I hypothesized that if yield and stability influence decision-making on genotype choice, then differences among commercial genotypes in such traits would relate to the pattern of adoption and use of those genotypes. Stability analyses of ear mass and case production were conducted on processing sweet corn genotypes grown in varied environments of the United States' Upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest. Yield and stability of the 12 most tested genotypes were then related to the extent of their adoption and use by a sweet corn processing company over a 20-year period. Although some genotypes exhibited above-average yield or above-average stability, data revealed there was no evidence of both traits in individual genotypes currently used in processing sweet corn. Adoption of genotypes with below-average yield or stability was less than other genotypes. Genotype adoption pattern of case production showed the greatest proportion of adoption of above-average stability genotypes. Stable case production across all environments is a more important trait in a genotype to the sweet corn processor than a genotype with record yields under favorable conditions. This conclusion is consistent with the industry's need to have a predictable level of performance in the processing facility, through which all raw product must flow, on a daily basis for the about three-month window of harvest in the northern United States.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has as its objective the establishment of a framework for the protection of continental, groundwater and surface, transitional, and coastal water. The phytoplankton is one of the biological quality elements established for determining the ecological status within the Directive. Phytoplankton biomass, composition and abundance, together with frequency of blooms, are the metrics to be assessed according to the WFD.
   For the Mediterranean coastal water only biomass (chlorophyll a) has been intercalibrated by the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group. In the present contribution, a multimetric index PHYMED for ecological classification of coastal water bodies in Valencia Region is developed based on biomass and phytoplankton community composition.
   First, a conceptual model was established to develop a system of indicators based on the composition of the phytoplankton community. Formulating the model required a preliminary analysis of the existing correlations between the parameters related to the phytoplankton community composition and the variations in the pressure indicators in each coastal water body. After discarding those variables which did not readily allow a distinction between coastal water bodies to be discerned four phytoplankton variables were selected to constitute the PHYMED index. Reference conditions were determined based on the analysis of pressures and impacts and supplemented by a thorough territorial analysis.
   To verify that this index responded well to the varying ranges in pressure, a statistically significant correlation was confirmed to exist between the index and the phosphorus values.
   The results obtained from this index were compared with those derived using chlorophyll a finding that the existing deviations presently arising from the use of chlorophyll a as an ecological status indicator can be corrected with the proposed multimetric index.

AB  - Current management strategies for the control and suppression of the American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus = Rana catesbeiana Shaw) and other invasive amphibians have had minimal effect on their abundance and distribution. This study evaluates the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) on pre- and prometamorphic Bullfrog larvae. Bullfrogs are a model organism for evaluating potential suppression agents because they are a successful invader worldwide. From experimental trials we estimated that the 24-h 50% and 99% lethal concentration (LC50 and LC99) values for Bullfrog larvae were 371 and 549 mg CO2/L, respectively. Overall, larvae that succumbed to experimental conditions had a lower body condition index than those that survived. We also documented sublethal changes in blood chemistry during prolonged exposure to elevated CO2. Specifically, blood pH decreased by more than 0.5 pH units after 9 h of exposure and both blood partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and blood glucose increased. These findings suggest that CO2 treatments can be lethal to Bullfrog larvae under controlled laboratory conditions. We believe this work represents the necessary foundation for further consideration of CO2 as a potential suppression agent for one of the most harmful invaders to freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding and modelling bivalve growth dynamics under variable environmental conditions are crucial for the development of management and sustainability aquaculture plans. This work proposes a new dynamic bivalve growth model that combines net production Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and the species-specific growth dynamics of the Ecophysiological Model for Mussels (EMMY). In our approach, the assimilated energy is first used for metabolic requirements, and the surplus partitioned between shell formation, somatic growth, reserves and reproduction. We also incorporate site-specific estimates for feeding and spawning. We compare the performance of our model with a standard DEB model for the simulation of mussel growth in a low seston environment (Ria de Ares-Betanzos, NW Spain). Our model provides realistic estimations of shell and soft tissue growth, while the standard DEB model overestimates soft tissue growth. Indeed the Relative Mean Square Error (RMSE), which measures the discrepancy between field and simulated shell-soft tissue relationships, of our model is below 10% of that obtained with the standard DEB. Our model also captures the different effects of environmental variability on shell and flesh growth.

AB  - This paper aims at investigating and comparing some sustainability indices in the literature while proposing some new indices. A solar driven hybrid system made of a PV cell, an alkaline electrolyzer and a PEM fuel cell is chosen to apply these indices because renewable-based stand-alone hybrid systems for generating electricity seem to be very promising for the future. Some sustainability indices and methods, such as sustainability index, exergetic sustainability index, extended exergy accounting and thermo ecological cost analysis, exist in the literature. In addition to these indices, new indices proposed in this paper contain thermo-ecological cost (TEC) of irreversibilities, extended TEC, extended exergy-based sustainability index and the extended exergetic ecological index. A daily dynamic performance analysis is made for one year. According to the results, exergy efficiency values range from 0.027 to 0.121 while extended exergy efficiencies vary between 0.08 and 0.14. Finally, the proposed indices are classified for designing environmental cycles, assessing environmental effects under operation conditions, and evaluating sustainability in every aspect.

AB  - Nutrient or/and organic pollutions have been used as one of the key factors influencing the stream health, so research approaches were frequently focused on chemical analysis rather and biological analysis. Our objective of the present study was to diagnose the chemical and biological stream health using chemical multi-metric model of nutrient pollution index (NPI) and biological multi-metric fish model of the index of biotic integrity (IBI), respectively in an urban stream. Seven years dataset from 2008 to 2014 were used for the health assessments. The nutrients regime (TN, TP), sestonic chlorophyll, total suspended solids (TSS), electrical conductivity, BOD, and COD showed a typical polluted stream with large temporal and spatial fluctuations due to variations of Asian monsoon rain. The analysis of fish trophic guilds and fish tolerance guilds showed that omnivore fish species and tolerant species were dominated the community and the proportions were directly determined by water chemistry (nutrient and organic matters). Chemical model of NPI showed "poor-very poor health condition" by the criteria of the model and showed same results with the biological model of fish IBI. The degradation of the stream health was mainly due to massive effluents from the wastewater treatment plants. Overall, our data suggest that the multi-metric chemical and biological models may be used as a key tool diagnosing the stream health condition in an urban stream.

AB  - 1. Spatial prioritization tools provide a means of finding efficient trade-offs between biodiversity protection and the delivery of ecosystem services. Although a large number of prioritization approaches have been proposed in the literature, most are specifically designed for terrestrial systems. When applied to river ecosystems, they often fail to adequately account for the essential role that landscape connectivity plays in maintaining both biodiversity and ecosystem services. This is particularly true of longitudinal connectivity, which in many river catchments is highly altered by the presence of dams, stream-road crossings, and other artificial structures.
   2. We propose a novel framework for coordinating river conservation and connectivity restoration. As part of this, we formulate an optimization model for deciding which subcatchments to designate for ecosystem services and which to include in a river protected area (RPA) network, while also deciding which existing river barriers to remove in order to maximize longitudinal connectivity within the RPA network. In addition to constraints on the size and makeup of the RPA network, the model also considers the suitability of sites for conservation, based on a biological integrity index, and connectivity to multiple habitat types. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach using a case study involving four managed river catchments located in Hungary.
   3. Results show that large increases in connectivity-weighted habitat can be achieved through targeted selection of barrier removals and that the benefits of barrier removal are strongly depend on RPA network size. We find that (i) highly suboptimal solutions are produced if habitat conservation planning and connectivity restoration are done separately and (ii) RPA acquisition provides substantially greater marginal benefits than barrier removal given limited resources.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Finding a balance between conservation and ecosystem services provision should give more consideration to connectivity restoration planning, especially in multi-use riverscapes. We present the first modelling framework to directly integrate and optimize river conservation and connectivity restoration planning. This framework can help conservation managers to account better for connectivity, resulting in more effective catchment scale maintenance of biological integrity and ecosystem services delivery.

AB  - The threatened Yarra pygmy perch (Nannoperca obscura) is an obligate freshwater fish endemic to the south-eastern coast of mainland Australia, where a majority of river systems have been heavily modified since European settlement. The purpose of this garden study was to explore any relationship between the growth rate of juvenile N. obscura with respect to salinity. Trials were conducted encompassing perceived and potential ranges within the species' environment, through five salinity treatments and recorded growth after 8 weeks. Two brood-groups were trialed simultaneously to observe any intrapopulation variance in phenotypic response potentially linked to genetic variance. The salinity trials found a clear model indicating increasing growth for moderate salinities (i.e. 2.5-7.5 ppt), therefore identifying the ideal salinity range for N. obscura juveniles. Phenotypic response between brood-groups was varied and inconsistent, potentially reflecting low genetic variability. With a limited genetic variance restricting adaptability, tolerance to a changing environment would be reduced. Therefore increased salinization and subsequent flushing events within habitats may be key threats to the species' survival.

AB  - The development of nanobiology requires a fundamental understanding of the interaction features between light and cells as well as cells containing nanoparticles. In this study, the generalized multiparticleMie (GMM) theory was employed to calculate the scattering properties of cells under refractive index matching conditions. The angular distribution of scattered light is statistically averaged to obtain a good fit for the experimental results. Based on a simplified cell model, the variabilities between the scattered light pattern of normal cells and that of cancerous cells were examined. The results indicate that the small angle scattering is sensitive to the organelle distribution, which could be applied in the diagnostics of cancerous cells. Finally, the effects of cellular uptake of nanoparticles on the scattering pattern was also investigated.

AB  - The relative importance of indicators of biotic and abiotic components of water ecosystems of the Tsimlyansky and the Manychsky (Proletarian and Veselovsky) reservoirs in the process of formation of states of ecological trouble: "ecological stress," "extraordinary ecological situation" and "ecological disaster," provided by a number of existing normative and methodical documents is investigated. For this purpose, the shares of indicators as a percentage of their total number in the dynamics of negative changes in aquatic ecosystems were compared on the basis of long-term monitoring information of Roshydromet and data of own expeditionary investigation in reservoirs on hydrobiological, toxicological and physico-chemical indicators. The role of the biotic component increases as the state of the aquatic ecosystem deteriorates of the Tsimlyansky reservoir, on the contrary, decreases in the Manychsky it is established. The role of the abiotic component is great and similar in all reservoirs; it increases already in a state extraordinary ecological situation but in ecological disaster is somewhat reduced. It is concluded that the proposed new approach to the analysis of the role of biotic and abiotic components in the development of negative changes in the ecosystem opens up new opportunities in the study of the formation of water quality and the state of water bodies.

AB  - To evaluate urban human settlement, we propose a human settlement environment development index (HSEDI) model by choosing vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, impervious surfaces, slope, wetness, and water condition as the evaluation factors. We applied the proposed model to Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1998 to 2010 and digital elevation model (DEM) data with a 30-m resolution were used to calculate the values of the six evaluation factors. The HSEDI value in Xuzhou City was found to be between 2.24 and 8.10 from 1998 to 2010, and it was further divided into five levels, uninhabitable, moderately uninhabitable, generally inhabitable, moderately inhabitable, and inhabitable. The best HSEDI value was in 2007. The generally inhabitable region was about 100.98 km(2), covering 30.87% of the total area in 2007; the moderately inhabitable region was about 170.58 km(2) covering 52.15% of the total area; the inhabitable region was about 32.03 km(2), covering 9.79% of the total area; the percentage of the uninhabitable region was zero; and that of the moderately uninhabitable region was very small, less than 1.00%. Moreover, we analyzed the habitability in the respect of spatial patterns and change detection. Results show that the degraded regions of habitability quality are mainly located in the urban fringe and the improved regions are mainly located in the main urban and rural areas. Reason for the degraded habitability quality is the rapid progress of urbanization. However, the increase in urban green spaces and the construction of the main urban area promoted the improved habitability quality. Besides, we further analyzed socio-economic and socio-demographic data to confirm the results of the habitability analysis. The results indicate that the human settlement in Xuzhou City is in a satisfactory condition, but some efforts should be made to control the possible uninhabitable and moderately uninhabitable regions, and to improve the quality of the generally inhabitable regions.

AB  - The microregion of Ostrow Lednicki in the province of Wielkopolska was the center of the formation of the Polish State in Early Middle Ages. The analysis of skeletal remains and parish records from the region documented the biological status of inhabitants and its changes over a millennium. The study material comprised 424 human skeletons from an Early Medieval burial ground on Lake Lednica, records of 2,704 deaths from the registers of the Roman Catholic parish of Dziekanowice, made between 1818-1903, data on the deaths of 929,192 inhabitants of rural areas all over the province Wielkopolska obtained from Prussian statistical materials for the years 1865-1900, and comparative data from the literature. Assuming both a stationary population model and a stable population model with nonzero natural increase, parameters of life tables and measures of opportunity for natural selection (Crow's index I-m, potential gross reproductive rate R-pot, and the biological state index I-bs) were calculated for the Early Middle Ages and for the two periods of the 19th century which were characterized by different laws of land ownership and thus different rural economies. In the first period, peasants were tenants, whereas in the second, they were given freehold of the land they cultivated. Causes of death were also analyzed. A distinct increase in longevity from the early Middle Ages to the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was found. This was related to a higher level of demographic development in the parish of Dziekanowice during the 19th century, which was achieved earlier than in other areas of Poland. This was confirmed by genetic measures: coefficients of exogamy and coefficients of kinship. The reasons were related to the historical prominence of this region and to its proximity to the first two capitals of the Polish state, Gniezno and Poznan. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The ubiquity of microplastics in aquatic and terrestrial environments and related ecological impacts have gained global attention. Microplastics have been detected in table salt, drinking water, and air, posing inevitable human exposure risk. However, rigorous analytical methods for detection and characterization of microplastics remain scarce. Knowledge about the potential adverse effects on human health via dietary and respiratory exposures is also limited. To address these issues, we reviewed 46 publications concerning abundances, potential sources, and analytical methods of microplastics in table salt, drinking water, and air. We also summarized probable translocation and accumulation pathways of microplastics within human body. Human body burdens of microplastics through table salt, drinking water, and inhalation were estimated to be (0-7.3)x10(4), (04.7)X10(3), and (0-3.0)x10(7) items per person per year, respectively. The intake of microplastics via inhalation, especially via indoor air, was much higher than those via other exposure routes. Moreover, microplastics in the air impose threats to both respiratory and digestive systems through breathing and ingestion. Given the lifetime inevitable exposure to microplastics, we urgently call for a better understanding of the potential hazards of microplastics to human health.

AB  - Fishing of Nassarius mutabilis is by far the most important activity carried out by artisanal fisheries in the central and northern Adriatic Sea, accounting for more than 35% of total fishing effort and yielding from 2000 to 3000 t of landings each year. This gastropod is targeted from the beginning of autumn to the end of spring using basket traps. Despite its importance under a socioeconomic point of view, the scientific studies on the biology and ecology of this species are very scarce and the failure of the current management measures could also be attributed to the scarce knowledge on the biology of this species in the area. Taking this statement into consideration, the results of the present study contribute to fill a few existing gaps and may be useful to improve the management measures currently in force. Samples were collected from March 2006-March 2008 during monthly fishing surveys and carried out using basket traps in the central Adriatic Sea. A total of 383 males (size range 7-29 mm SH) and 504 females (size range 15-32 mm SH) were caught. Mean SH (+/- SD) of males was 15.84 +/- 3.57 mm and mean SH of females was 25.31 +/- 3.06 mm. A significant difference in the biometric characteristics between the two sexes was discovered. The condition index (CI) showed similar seasonal trends for both sexes, with a decrease from late winter to spring followed by an increase from summer to fall-early winter. The minimum values were recorded in summer and the maximum ones in winter, following an opposite trend in respect to water temperature. In the males this trend was observed starting from size classes larger than 11 mm SH, hence this size might be very close to the size at first sexual maturity. The size at first maturity hypothesized for females (16-20 mm SH) agrees with the minimum landing size (MLS) currently established for this species (20 mm SH). The absence of small females (SH < 15 mm) and large males (SH > 23 mm) leads to suppose a sex reversal from male to female at around 20 mm SH. On this basis, the management measure of MLS leads to the selective retention of females and, hence, to a sexual gap between the two sexes with possible consequences on the biology of the species and the resilience of the stock. The peaks of CI observed for males and females confirmed that the spawning season of this gastropod occurs in late winter-early spring, according to the abundant presence of egg capsules attached to submerged substrates in that period at sea. Consequently, from a management point of view, it would be advisable to shorten the fishing season that at present extends from fall to later spring.

AB  - Aim. The aim of this work was to study the content of poisonous substances in the aquatic environment of the river Terek during the year of 2016 in the territory of the Chechen Republic. Materials and methods. Water samples of the river Terek were analyzed in the Laboratory of Environmental Control of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. Dry residue was determined by weight analysis; stiffness by acid-base titration; acid-base properties by potentiometric method; the ion content was determined spectrophotometrically; concentration of heavy metals was identified with voltammetric analyzer; concentration of calcium and magnesium ions was measured titrometrically with Trilon B in the presence of an appropriate indicator. Results. The intensity of contamination of the water body was assessed according to the following parameters: total hardness, dry residue, permanganate value, pH, chlorides, dissolved oxygen, sulfates, nitrates and heavy metals content. In the course of the study, sensory characteristics such as smell, taste, turbidity and color were also determined; indicator value - permanganate value, which characterizes the contamination of water bodies with industrial and household wastewater as well as atmospheric precipitation. Conclusion. Studies of the ecological state of Terek, the main river of the Chechen Republic, have shown that the quality of the water body corresponds to hygienic standards: the content of pollutants is much lower than the maximum permissible concentration. In terms of water quality, the Terek River belongs to the 2nd class of surface water bodies, the water quality characteristic is relatively clean and the river pollution index corresponds to II.

AB  - Fish provide powerful tools for assessing aquatic environments. Three attributes are especially significant: the sensitivity of fish to most forms of human disturbance, their usefulness at all levels of biological organization and the favourable benefit-to-cost ratio of fish assessment programmes. Fish can be used as indicators over wide temporal and spatial ranges. Because they cover all trophic levels of consumer ecology, fish can effectively integrate the whole range of ecological processes in waterways. Fish have been used in many different roles for assessing river health and monitoring responses to remedial management. Three of these applications appear to have particular value for management of Australian rivers: (i) automated systems monitoring fish ventilation can provide sensitive, broad-spectrum and continuous sensing of water quality to protect receiving waters or water-supply intakes; (ii) programmes collecting routine data on commercial or recreational fisheries can be designed and analysed so as to isolate confounding effects due to fishery-specific factors and, hence, used to detect and monitor environmental change on large scales; (iii) the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBT) can be modified to suit Australian conditions and fish communities to meet the important need for a predictive model of aquatic environmental quality. The IBI is a quantitative biological tool with a strong ecological foundation that integrates attributes from several levels of ecosystem organization. Examples of the use of IBI elsewhere suggest its robustness, flexibility and sensitivity can cope effectively with the low diversity of the Australian fish fauna and the dominance of ecological generalists. A provisional structure is suggested for a test of the IBI in four riverine regions of New South Wales.

AB  - Phase transitions between alternate stable states in marine ecosystems lead to disruptive changes in ecosystem services, especially fisheries productivity. We used trawl survey data spanning phase transitions in the North Pacific (Gulf of Alaska) and the North Atlantic (Scotian Shelf) to test for increases in ecosystem variability that might provide early warning of such transitions. In both time series, elevated spatial variability in a measure of community composition (ratio of cod [Gadus sp.] abundance to prey abundance) accompanied transitions between ecosystem states, and variability was negatively correlated with distance from the ecosystem transition point. In the Gulf of Alaska, where the phase transition was apparently the result of a sudden perturbation (climate regime shift), variance increased one year before the transition in mean state occurred. On the Scotian Shelf, where ecosystem reorganization was the result of persistent overfishing, a significant increase in variance occurred three years before the transition in mean state was detected. However, we could not reject the alternate explanation that increased variance may also have simply been inherent to the final stable state in that ecosystem. Increased variance has been previously observed around transition points in models, but rarely in real ecosystems, and our results demonstrate the possible management value in tracking the variance of key parameters in exploited ecosystems.

AB  - A cross-cultural approach to conservation and natural resource management will enable resource managers to access the full potential of dual knowledge epistemologies and facilitate genuine co-management. To achieve this epistemological convergence in Aotearoa, New Zealand, a framework and an ecological assessment tool are required that can employ indicators from both neoclassical ecological science and indigenous science, in particular matauranga Maori. The Ecological State Assessment Tool (ESAT) was developed to assess quantitative scientific data using Maori ecological indicators. ESAT models population or social data weighted according to an applied Maori ecological perspective. ESAT may be applied to any conservation project to integrate Maori ecological knowledge in resource management. We illustrate the utility of ESAT in a case study of how different conservation management practices affect the ecological health of a short-tailed bat colony (Mystacina tuberculata), Pekapeka O Puketiti-Piopio. Applying ESAT shows that although pest control programs were achieving management targets, social engagement had a significant effect on ecological health outcomes for the bats. ESAT may assist territorial authorities and the Crown to meet their resource management obligations to Maori under the Treaty of Waitangi, value mcitauranga and provide a way for Maori and ecologists to conceptualise and understand each other's epistemology. Furthermore, ESAT can be adapted to include any cultural or ecological indicators, enabling its application internationally.

LA  - English
AB  - The effect of the light collection conditions on a scintillation counter's performance have been studied by measuring the characteristics of a counter with a rectangular plastic scintillator surrounded by air, water, and paraffin oil, and those of a counter with trapezium scintillators with angles between side faces of 5.6, 7.5, and 10-degrees.  The measurements demonstrate that the time resolution is mainly defined by a number of collected photons.  When the refraction index of the environment rises, the effective light propagation velocity towards the PMT rises.  It is possible to select an angle between the faces of a trapezium scintillator at which the detected signal amplitude is virtually independent of the scintillation site.

AB  - As the horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus (Steindachner, 1868) is one of the most exploited commercial species of the Black Sea fisheries, the knowledge of its different biological aspects related to growth and reproduction is highly important. This paper presents preliminary results of the analysis of morphological measurements (total length, total weight), Fulton relative body condition index, age, sex and degree of maturity of the horse mackerel population from the Romanian Black Sea coast. 563 individuals were collected between June and November in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2018, from trawl and trap net catches. Their mean total length was 11.4 +/- 2.4 cm, their mean total weight was14.4 +/- 8.5 g and they had between 0 and 4+ years with a mean age of 1.7 +/- 1.1 years. The data analyses of their measurements highlighted significant temporal differences between years and months, but no differences occurred between areas and sexes. These results should contribute to a better knowledge of the biology of the horse mackerel and may help to improve the management of the stock of this species for sustainable fisheries.

AB  - The authentication of seafood origin is essential to establish a reliable product traceability system. In principle, appropriate markers can confirm the product origin without additional information. Scallop is an important shellfish product around the world. Its nutritional quality can be closely related to several environmental factors and varies between different habitats, yet it is not known if quality variation can be a reliable marker indicating product origin. In this study, the regional quality characteristics of scallop (Argopecten irradians) harvested from 18 farms in the North China Sea was investigated. Seven nutritional indices (moisture, ash content, sugar, crude protein, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, condition index, amino acid chemical score) show considerable geographic differences. Based on quality composition data, cluster analysis demonstrates three different scallop product origins: those from the North Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, Middle Yellow Sea, and Laizhou Bay. Fatty acid biomarkers reveal that quality variations are caused by regional differences in pelagic food sources. Results suggest that nutritional quality indices could be a potential marker to indicate geographic sources of cultured scallop.

KW  - ecological integrity

KW  - methods in ecology
AB  - The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) has been widely used since the 1980s to estimate ecological integrity-the capacity of an ecosystem to support and maintain its full range of components and processes. Despite this, IBI approaches have been criticized for their lack of objectivity, of justification for the selection of metrics, and of statistical rigor. In this paper, we assessed the potential of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Structural equation modeling (SEM) as complementary methods for assessing ecological integrity. We use an iconic freshwater ecosystem dataset from Northeastern Illinois to assess ecological integrity using both classical IBI approach, and compare this with alternative methods. When we attempt to replicate the IBI methodology, we find issues with the approach including the possibility of the same IBI value for many possible levels of ecological integrity. We showed with the use of other methods (CCA) that the use of tolerant species, total abundance, and total richness-all defining components in IBI -can result in misleading interpretations of ecological integrity and that IBI scores might not comprehensively depict integrity scenarios. Structural equation modeling allowed us to test a conceptual causal model of ecological integrity. We found that water quality had an effect on the diversity and abundance of fish, and these in turn had an effect on trophic function, revealing important relationships between variables that contribute to ecological integrity. We conclude that CCA and SEM can complement multimetric indices, like IBI, and help with the development of more reliable, objective, and science-based estimations of ecosystem integrity, as well as generate testable hypotheses about ecological integrity.

AB  - Twelve Parmotrema tinctorum individuals were collected from the Yaoluoping national nature reserve of Anhui Province, China. The relationships between biological characters of lichen individuals and their environmental factors were analyzed by methods included Redundancy analysis (RDA). Based on the information, variation patterns of different individual's biological characters were described. The analysis results manifested that the biological characters showed a certain extent stability in a individual, but exhibit more variation among all twelve individuals, of which the hyphae diameter and anatomical character, had minimum variation coefficients not only within a individual, but also between all the analyzed lichen individuals. Redundancy analysis showed that environment factor moisture had a significant negative correlation with illumination, had the most-positive correlation and the most-negative correlation with hyphae diameter and biological index medulla width, respectively; While environment factor altitude had the most-negative correlation with lower cortex width and the most-positive correlation with rhizoid density. The atranorine content could response to illumination condition sensitively; whereas the algae layer thickness could reflect comprehensive environment change very well. The nutriment investment strategy within different function parts of a lichen thallus deserve to investigate deeply, which is of great importance in revealing the response model of lichens to environment change.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the progressive acclimation of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Mussels were purchased from a local mariculture facility during summer (SW temperature 27 degrees C, salinity 37.5 psu) and winter (13 degrees C, 37 psu) seasons, and transferred to the laboratory for acclimation to reduced SW salinities (37, 28, 18.5 and 11 psu). At the beginning and at the end of acclimation processes tests of mussel survival in air were provided. After 14 days of acclimation the DNA integrity, p38-MAPK activation, metallothionein induction, oxygen consumption rate, and condition index were measured. Survival in air (SOS test), as a physiological index Of Mussel's health and vitality, had significantly lower LT50 values (11 psu) in the summer than in the winter, and it seems to be negatively affected by acclimation in comparison to controls (37 psu and mariculture). Condition indexes (CIs) were not significantly different, but mussel's acclimation resulted in decline (i.e., a negative trend). especially of CI-2 and CI-3 calculated on the basis of mussel tissue weight and shell sizes. Oxygen consumption rate (Vo(2)) of M. galloprovincialis acclimated to reduced salinities was a concentration-dependent process and increased considerably to about 51 and 65% in lower SW concentrations (28 and 18 psu) compared to control mussels (37 psu). DNA integrity, determined by Fast Micromethod (R), was negatively impacted by salinity acclimation and corresponding physiological stress as well. Some differences in 1D protein expression patterns between control groups and mussels acclimated to 28,18.5 and 11 psu (SW) were established. Reduced SW salinities ( 18.5 and 11 psu) resulted in significantly higher p38-MAPK phosphorylation, whereas the SW salinity of 28 psu decreased p-p38 significantly compared to control (37 psu). The concentration of metallothioneins in mussels' gills was reduced at 28 and 18.5 psu, while it was significantly higher at 11 psu. Results indicated that SW salinity variation (i.e., hypoosmotic stress) in the marine environment call affect all investigated parameters. This investigation expands our understanding of multifactorial effects of the physical marine environment on the specificity of investigated biomarkers and biotests, providing insight into the acclimation, adaptive and stress response processes of mussels. Effects of environmental factors have to be considered in sampling strategies for monitoring programmes to prevent false interpretation of results. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Critical transitions between ecosystem states can be triggered by relatively small external forces or internal perturbations and may show time-lagged or hysteretic recovery. Understanding the precise mechanisms of a transition is important for ecosystem management, but it is hampered by a lack of information about the preceding interactions and associated feedback between different components in an ecosystem. This paper employs a range of data, including paleolimnological, environmental monitoring and documentary sources from lake Erhai and its catchment, to investigate the ecosystem structure and dynamics across multiple trophic levels through the process of eutrophication. A long-term perspective shows the growth and decline of two distinct, but coupled, positive feedback loops: a macrophyte-loop and a phosphorus-recycling-loop. The macrophyte-loop became weaker, and the phosphorus-recycling-loop became stronger during the process of lake eutrophication, indicating that the critical transition was propelled by the interaction of two positive feedback loops with different strengths. For lake restoration, future weakening of the phosphorus-recycling loop or a reduction in external pressures is expected to trigger macrophyte growth and eventually produce clear water conditions, but the speed of recovery will probably depend on the rates of feedback loops and the strength of their coupling.

AB  - Traditionally, biologists have developed indices that assess nutrition and condition of wild ungulates. However. many attempts to validate such indices have failed to indicate the range of conditions under which they work. Furthermore. Such validation tests often fail to identify sensitivity to small but biologically meaningful differences, and emphasize statistical rather than biological relationships. We evaluated 20 models that were developed to assess nutritional condition of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsonii). We analyzed sensitivity, bias, accuracy. precision applicability across a wide range of body conditions, and field practicality. Because models were derived using captive elk. we incorporated data from 6 wild cows to assess suitability of condition-index models for free-ranging elk. We found that most condition indicators available to biologists were weakly related to actual nutritional condition, were insensitive to small changes in condition, or often showed nonlinear relations that restricted their value to a narrow range of body condition. Art arithmetic combination of a rump body-condition score and subcutaneous rump-fat thickness for live animals, and a modified carcass-evaluation score for dead animals, were the most sensitive and accurate indices of nutritional condition that we tested.

AB  - The report on 'Europe's Environment', published in 1995 by the European Environment Agency, presents clear information on (a) the state of the environment, (b) pressures stressing it, and (c) the human activities behind these issues. It sets the style for improved presentation of environmental management issues through the use of environmental indicators. This will help the UK environmental manager to target policy and/or management response, and to view their issues whether at local, regional or national level - within a wider European and thereby global context. Key environmental problems for Europe are transport, land degradation, diffuse pollution of water, loss of natural habitats, waste production, and a range of local pressures - such as poor air quality - caused by conurbations. Future environmental management must be capable of integrated multi-media application, and should be applied at the most appropriate level, drawing on a range of approaches from 'top down' regulation through to a 'bottom up' commitment by individuals.

AB  - Adaptive management (AM) promises to improve our ability to cope with the inherent uncertainties of managing complex dynamic systems such as watersheds. However, despite the increasing adherence and attempts at implementation, the AM approach is rarely successful in practice. A one-size-fits-all AM strategy fails because some watersheds are better positioned at the outset to succeed at AM than others. We introduce a diagnostic tool called the Index of Management Condition (IMC) and apply it to twelve diverse watersheds in order to determine their AM "fitness"; that is, the degree to which favorable adaptive management conditions are in place in a watershed.

AB  - The costs and benefits associated with migration differ depending on individual decisions regarding the distance to migrate and where to winter. These decisions affect an individual's winter experience, which may in turn impact reproductive success the following breeding season. We investigated whether winter location influences performance on the breeding grounds in a short-distance migrant, the Ipswich Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis princeps Maynard, 1872), endemic to Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. We used stable hydrogen isotope analysis to infer the winter location of individuals breeding on Sable Island, and investigated whether body condition, timing of breeding initiation, and number and condition of nestlings varied with winter location. Males wintered farther north than females, and males from the northern end of the wintering range were in better condition, established territories earlier, and tended to produce heavier nestlings than those wintering farther south. Conversely, females that wintered farther south had significantly earlier first egg dates than those that wintered farther north. The results of this study suggest that individual decisions about migration distance can impact reproductive success and that optimal winter locations differ between male and female Ipswich Sparrows.

AB  - Reproductive biology of invasive species is not often studied relative to the invasion process, although it may provide an accurate indicator of the invasion stage. We evaluated the reproductive biology of the exotic fish species Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus and Poecilia sphenops in the Teuchitlan River, Jalisco, Mexico by fertility, size at first maturity, sex ratio, gonad maturity stage, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, size-structure, and habitat. The reproductive variables were related to environmental characteristics using the non-metric analysis of multidimensional scaling. A total of 1374 specimens of P.bimaculatus and 571 of P.sphenops were captured by seine netting and electrofishing. Maximum fertility of P.bimaculatus was 15.99 +/- 2.27 embryonated eggs and embryos and, for P.sphenops, 31.26 +/- 4.17. Females predominated among P.bimaculatus, while in P.sphenops the sex ratio was similar to 1:1. We found mature female and male of P.bimaculatus in degraded sites and juveniles in the springs. Poecilia sphenops reproduced along the river. The establishment of both invasive species in the Teuchitlan River is evidence that they share the reproductive habitat with native fish species, and tend to spread and colonize new areas.

AB  - The first step in the establishment of a host-biting fly relationship is host location. While a number of studies highlight the role of host emitted products as important cues affecting host location by biting flies, the role of host temperature is far from clear. We investigated the role of different nest microclimatic variables affecting the interaction between pied flycatchers and two biting flies: black flies and biting midges. Biting midge abundances increased with temperature inside the nest, supporting the potential importance of nest temperature as a cue used by insects to localize their hosts. The possibility that biting fly infestations were associated to ecological conditions in the vicinity of the nests is also discussed. Furthermore, we found a negative association between nestling weight (including tarsus length as a covariate in the analyses) and the interaction between the abundance of biting midges and the presence/absence of black flies in nests. The potential negative effect of these ectoparasites on nestling weight (condition index) and potential differences in the bird phenotypic/genetic quality associated with nest site choice and parasite infestations are considered.

AB  - This paper mainly studies the effect of artificial lighting environmental factors on the psychological emotions of observers in the large and practical space of the museums. The purpose is to reveal the relationship between the observers' response and the artificial lighting condition in the actual art museum space. Field research regarding three art museums in Japan was carried out and the optical environment parameters applied in those museums were quantified. The innovation method is to define the artificial lighting environment space in the way of classified lighting design. Thirty one observers were invited to evaluate the three art museum's lighting environment. In addition, this paper analyzes and discusses the influence of the actual spatial lighting parameters of museum buildings on observers' psychological emotions (comfort, clarity, preference and warmth), under three modes of illuminance and correlated colour temperature (CCT) combination. Using one-way analysis of variance and correlation analysis, through analysis get the correlation of the four evaluation and three lighting environments indexes are less than 0.05, the observer in an environment with high illuminance and a high CCT had higher psychological evaluation of the art museum.

AB  - Unio ravoisieri is an endemic freshwater mussel inhabiting North Africa rivers. Morphological diversity in U. ravoisieri was examined at eight sites covering the three main drainage systems in northern Tunisia. Variation was assessed using 10 shell measurements in 193 specimens. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to test the effects of sex and sites on shell traits. Simple and partial Mantel correlations on external and internal shell traits and geographic locations of populations were performed to test for spatial effects. Our results showed significant differences in shell morphometric characters among locations, but no evidence of sexual size dimorphism. Mantel correlations between geographic and all shell morphometric distances were significant, indicating an isolation-by-distance pattern. However, partial Mantel correlation did not detect a significant correlation between internal and external shell morphometric distances after controlling for geographic distance. The nonparametric Spearman correlations between geographical parameters (latitude, longitude and altitude) and external shell traits, as well as growth index were significant, but no significant relationships were demonstrated for internal traits or for condition index. Assessment of the underlying processes involved in this differentiation is not straightforward, because of the likely complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors.

AB  - The impacts of human activities in Longgan Lake region on the distribution of Pb-210 in lake sediment made it difficult to establish geochronological sequence. However, environmental proxies recorded these human activities and could be used as time marker to check Pb-210 dating results. Based on the analysis of Pb-210(exc) distribution in cores LS-1 and LGL-1, and in combination with the human activities records in grain-size and element concentration, the sedimentation rates in the upper layers of these two cores were determined to be 0.19 and 0.23 cm/a respectively. The MAR (mass accumulation rates) of these two cores demonstrated that natural condition, such as precipitation and runoffs, led to the variation of MAR before human disturbance, and human activities controlled the sedimentary processes afterwards, which obviously reduced the particles influx into the lakes. During 1940s when human activity had not changed the water system within the catchment, Pb-210 activity was abnormally strong in lakes along middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which might be attributed to less precipitation and can be used as a time marker for geochronological research.

AB  - The biological, morphological, and biochemical characteristics of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) eggs were examined as potential egg-quality criteria. In addition, the metabolic utilization of body stores during early development of cultured and wild Atlantic salmon was compared. Fertilization and hatching success and survival of developing embryos and alevins were recorded as a biological measure of egg quality. This measure was related to levels of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, dry matter, and ash as potential biochemical indicators, and to egg size, yolk-sac volume, and alevin size at hatching as potential morphological indicators of egg quality. Egg diameter and alevin length were positively correlated with egg weight and alevin weight, respectively, whereas egg diameter and weight were not correlated with alevin length and weight. Eggs collected from wild Atlantic salmon had higher protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and energy content, which declined simultaneously during development, and were associated with higher fertilization and hatching success and greater size and survival of embryos and alevins, than those collected from cultured stock. It is suggested that for egg-quality criteria, energy content of eggs can be used as a condition index for development and survival of salmonids.

AB  - Research has been carried out of the main characteristics of phytoplankton communities in order to assess the ecological status and ecological potential of the types of lakes in Bulgaria, according to the requirements of WFD 2000/60/EC. Eighty lakes/reservoirs have been researched on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria. The assessment was made on the basis of four main metrics (phytoplankton biovolume; Algae Groups Index; transparency, chlorophyll a) and three additional metrics (% Cyanobacteria; intensity of algal "bloom" and presence of toxic species). More than half of the researched lakes in Bulgaria are in compliance with the WFD requirements for good ecological state (high and good ecological status, maximum and good potential). A classification system for assessment of ecological status or potential has been developed using above mentioned phytoplankton metrics. The existing 17 types of lake in Bulgaria are classified in two main groups: oligotrophic lake types and mesotrophic lake types.

AB  - The IPCC has predicted changes manly in temperature, rainfall and extreme events. Rises in earth surface temperature of 0.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C has been already detected during 20th century. Plant physiology, productivity, and phenological cycle depend on climatic conditions. In this work meteorological series comprising 50 years of three productive oasis (Mendoza, Argentine) were analyzed, through climatic and ecological indexes. Were compared statistically in two decades of the whole series (a beginning one and a final one), and their variation over time was analyzed by lineal regression. Comparative analysis of the two decades showed different changes according the studied zone. The East zone showed the highest number of indexes which might affect viticulture suffering variation. On the North and South zone, the number of indexes showing variation had been lower compared to the East zone. To know the climatic changes that occurred at local level, their magnitude on the last 50 years and their tendency will allow to evaluate their possible impacts on vine physiology, phenology modification, sugar accumulation and phenolic compounds as well as to elaborate new assays and strategies in order to mitigate their negative effects.

AB  - The decision-making process in the conservation of urban roads relates disciplines with a social, technical and political profile, in most cases entails a conflict at the time of public spending in urban spaces. The aspiration of the public administrations to promote the different quality standards in urban streets, in the face of ever-smaller budgets, suggests the need to devise new formulas and strategies that allow guiding their efforts towards public spending with perspectives of urban sustainability.
   This study focuses on the evaluation and diagnosis of urban streets through an integrated multi-criteria model of a sustainable nature. The application of the model allows generating guidelines for priority action in public investment in urban infrastructure.
   The developed methodology defines two fundamental stages: a novel approach to inspection the urban streets and the determination of the Urban Street Condition Index (USCI) through MIVES (Multi-criterion decision making).
   The results shows that the Schimmplfeng Avenue present a significant USCI, when 3 avenues presented adequate values and 6 streets requiring actions in public spending. The results in each of the requirements (urban infrastructure, accessibility and mobility) indicate that urban streets with tourist profile have obtained better indices than commercial or neighborhood streets.

AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were used to elucidate the sources of sedimentary organic matter in nearshore marine environments at three different locations: (1) Naples harbour, (2) Formia harbour, and (3) Gulf of Gaeta (Tyrrhenian Sea). The sites showed different environmental characteristics, with the latter one considered as the control site, because it hosts "mussel farms'' cultivated for human food. Significant differences in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 were found at Naples harbour compared to the other two sites. In particular, the lowest delta N-15 (> 4%) and the highest delta C-13 (>= 1.6%) values were found in mussels collected in Naples harbour, while similar delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were detected in Formia harbour and in the Gulf of Gaeta. As shown by a Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR)-mixing model, N-15-depleted and C-13-enriched mussels highlight the influence of anthropogenic inputs on this area, particularly of organic fertilizers.

AB  - We developed an estuarine index of biotic integrity to assess habitat quality in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Fish were collected at 18 fixed stations with a 61-m X 3.05-m beach seine once per month in July and August from 1988 to 1999. Stations were designated high or low quality depending on the total nitrogen concentration, number of low dissolved oxygen events, extent of human disturbance, abundance of macroalgae, and presence or absence of eelgrass Zostera marina. We used stepwise discriminant analysis on 13 candidate metrics based on fish community data to determine those most important in distinguishing between high and low habitat categories. We then used discriminant analysis and canonical discriminant analysis with the resulting significant metrics. The six metrics that were able to discriminate between sites were the number of estuarine spawner species, proportion of killifish, number of individuals, proportion of flounder, Shannon's diversity index, and proportion of benthic-associated species. Discriminant analysis with these metrics distinguished among sites with an overall error rate of 22%. Surprisingly, when an index was calculated from the metrics, sites designated as low quality based on environmental data had the highest scores whereas high-quality sites had low scores. Degraded sites in the upper estuary may have scored high due to the availability of shallow-water refuge from predation, abundant food, and warmer water with less current. Our results indicate that upper estuaries are important to juvenile fish and are worth protecting despite apparent human impacts. Further, an index of biotic integrity may not be useful in estuaries because of their characteristically harsh environmental conditions, which result in fish communities that are dominated by tolerant species that are habitat and feeding generalists.

AB  - Fine sediments in excess of natural background conditions are one of most globally common causes of stream degradation, with well documented impacts on aquatic communities. The lack of agreement on methods for monitoring fine sediments makes it difficult to share data, limiting assessments of stream conditions across jurisdictions. We present a model that circumvents these limitations by inferring fine sediments in Oregon streams through sampling of macroinvertebrates. Tolerances to fine sediments (<0.06 mm diameter) were calculated for 240 macroinvertebrate taxa, from a calibration dataset of 446 sites across Oregon, as well as an independent validation dataset of 50 samples. Weighted averaging methods were used to infer fine sediment levels in streams by weighting the tolerances of modeled taxa observed in a sample by their abundances. The final model, the Biological Sediment Tolerance Index (BSTI), showed a strong relationship to measured fine sediments (calibration r(2) = 0.49, validation r(2) = 0.58). Root mean-squared-error was small in the calibration dataset (2% fines), but larger in the validation dataset (14% fines). Repeatability was assessed by examining variability in BSTI at 14 sites across Oregon. Because field methods for sampling macroinvertebrates are standardized across resource agencies in Oregon and the responses of macroinvertebrates represent the actual effects of fine sediments on stream ecosystems, the BSTI may offer water resource managers' a cost-effective method for assessing fine sediment conditions in their ongoing efforts to improve water quality across the state.

AB  - Environmental indicators are often aggregated into a single index in environmental studies. Commonly, an aggregated index is derived in a specific weighting scheme imposed from the outside. The paper presents a novel approach by letting each unit under study choose a set of weights. It applies the concept of self- and cross-appraisal in generating various aggregated indices from two linear programming optimization models. The proposed method is illustrated via a case study of the Mid-Atlantic region. Results show that the derived aggregated indices reveal environmental conditions of the study area in an objective and robust fashion. The proposed method is a valuable tool for integrated environmental assessment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After new highway construction near or across a stream, the site often requires remediation to reestablish suitable habitat for local biota. This study addresses effectiveness of environmental mitigation efforts for these construction projects, and contributes to the development of a protocol for environmental mitigation to be adopted by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Effects of remediation on two small KY, USA, streams, Cedar Creek and Holts Creek, were assessed using U.S. EPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (RBP). Habitat assessments and fish species assemblage surveys (index of biotic integrity) were conducted for three sectors of each stream. A decrease in total habitat assessment scores was observed at the remediated sector in each stream. However, for both streams the IBI fish assemblage scores were similar for upstream and remediated sectors, indicating that habitat impact resulted in limited effects on fish assemblages. The overall score for the downstream reach of Cedar Creek also was similar to upstream and remediated sectors, but the downstream portion of Holts Creek scored lower, primarily because of reduced number of fish species and abundances. This was likely due to stream characteristics and lack of diversity. The U.S. EPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols proved to be well suited for quantitative assessments of fish assemblages for small stream sectors with limited impacted areas. Although habitat quality scored somewhat lower in the remediated sectors of both streams, there were no major impairments of overall stream productivity and no apparent blockage of fish migration. The most apparent deficiencies in habitat restoration involved protective and riparian vegetation, resulting in diminished bank stability, increased prospects for bank erosion, moderate downstream siltation, and consequences of stream channelization.

AB  - Growing interest in speciation issues requires solving many problems connected with environmental sample preparation for analysis and it is extremely complicated. This process requires huge knowledge related with sampling, transportation, preservation and storage of samples. Incorrect proceeding with samples results in chemical, physical and biological processes which run very fast and bring about changes of properties and concentration of analytes. It results in wrong assessment of environmental state. Appropriate proceeding with environmental sample in order to prepare it for analysis is necessary to prevent above-mentioned processes. On the basis of literature concerning selected metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Al), issues connected with speciation analytics were presented and basic stages of analytical procedure of speciation determination of heavy metals in bottom deposit samples were characterized. Stages such as sampling and storage of bottom deposit samples, extraction, enrichment and determination were taken into account.

AB  - We examined fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and body condition (BC) as two measures of environmental stress using museum specimens of Lophuromys aquilus, a rodent species complex wide-spread across the African Albertine Rift. We related FA and BC to a spatially-derived index of anthropogenic impact using a principal components analysis (PCA). We found no relationship between the four PCA scores and mean FA or BC, but did find that FA variance was higher in areas with lower anthropogenic impact. There was also a negative, albeit non-significant, trend for PC3, suggesting that populations with higher than average BC were in areas with higher anthropogenic impact. Overall, our case study does not support FA and BC as effective predictors of environmental stress with low to moderate habitat disturbance. In fact, L. aquilus, as a habitat generalist, may be positively affected by some aspects of anthropogenic change. Studies relating environmental stress to anthropogenic impact should examine sites with a wide range of habitat qualities and human impact and utilize multiple measures of environmental stress to characterize the health of one or more populations.

AB  - Vegetation indices are widely employed to evaluate wetland ecological condition, and are expected to provide sensitive and specific detection of environmental change. Most studies evaluate the performance of condition assessment metrics in the context of the data used to calibrate them. Here we examined the temporal stability of the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI) for vegetation of depressional forested wetlands by resampling sites in 2008 that were previously sampled to develop the FWCI in 2001. Our objective was to determine if FWCI, a composite of six vegetation-based metrics, provides a robust measure of condition given inter-annual variation in environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall) between sampling periods. To that end, we sampled 22 geographically isolated wetlands in north Florida that spanned a wide land use/land cover intensity gradient. Our results suggested the FWCI is robust. We observed no significant paired difference in FWCI across or within land use categories, and the relationship between FWCI in 2001 and 2008 was strong (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001). This was despite surprisingly high composition change. Mean Jaccard community similarity within sites between years was 0.30, suggesting that most of the herbaceous taxa were replaced, possibly because of different antecedent rainfall conditions or sampling during different phenological periods; both are contingencies to which condition indices must be robust. We did observe some evidence of convergence toward the mean in 2008, with the fitted slope relating 2001 and 2008 FWCI scores significantly below one (0.63, 95% CI = 0.53-0.73). The most variable FWCI component metric was the proportional representation of obligate wetland taxa, suggesting that systematic changes may have been induced by different hydrologic conditions prior to sampling; notably, however, FWCI computed without this component still exhibited a slope significantly less than 1 (0.72, 95% CI = 0.61-0.88). Moreover, there was evidence that species lost from reference sites (higher condition) were replaced by taxa of lower floristic quality, while species lost from agricultural sites (consistently the lowest condition land use category) were replaced by species of higher quality. A significant positive association between FWCI and the ratio of coefficients of conservatism (CC) of species lost to those gained suggests some overfitting in FWCI development. However, despite modest evidence of overfitting, FWCI provides temporally consistent estimates of wetland condition, even under conditions of substantial taxonomic turnover. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We conducted laboratory starvation experiments on juvenile chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) captured in the neritic marine waters of northern Southeast Alaska in June and July 2003. Temporal changes in fish energy density (whole body energy content [WBEC], cal/g dry weight), percent moisture content, wet weight (g), length (mm), and size-related condition residuals were measured in the laboratory and were then compared to long-term field data. Laboratory water temperatures and salinities averaged 9 C and 32 psu in both months. Trends in response variables were similar for both experimental groups, although sampling intervals were limited in July because fewer fish were available (n=54) than in June (n=101). Overall, for June (45-d experimental period, 9 intervals), WBEC, wet weight, and condition residuals decreased and percent moisture content increased, whereas fork length did not change. For July (20-d experimental period, 5 intervals), WBEC and condition residuals decreased, percent moisture content and fork length increased, and wet weight did not change. WBEC, percent moisture content, and condition residuals fell outside the norm of long-term data ranges within 10-15 days of starvation, and may be more useful than fork length and wet weight for detecting fish condition responses to suboptimal environments.

AB  - Quantum coherence is one of the primary non-classical features of quantum systems. While protocols such as the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) and quantum tomography can be used to test for the existence of quantum coherence and dynamics in a given system, unambiguously detecting inherent "quantumness" still faces serious obstacles in terms of experimental feasibility and efficiency, particularly in complex systems. Here we introduce two "quantum witnesses" to efficiently verify quantum coherence and dynamics in the time domain, without the expense and burden of non-invasive measurements or full tomographic processes. Using several physical examples, including quantum transport in solid-state nanostructures and in biological organisms, we show that these quantum witnesses are robust and have a much finer resolution in their detection window than the LGI has. These robust quantum indicators may assist in reducing the experimental overhead in unambiguously verifying quantum coherence in complex systems.

AB  - The effect of soil applied zeolite, foliar application of selenium and silicon on the agronomic and physiologic traits of canola grown under salt stress conditions was investigated in two-year field experiment during 2012 and 2013. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks, arranged in factorial with 27 treatments forming combinations of zeolite (0, 5 and 10 ton ha(-1)), selenium (0, 2 and 4 g liter(-1)) and silicon (0, 2 and 4 g liter(-1)) and three replicates. The results indicated that zeolite improved plant growth in terms of plant height and increased yield and yield components of canola. In addition, biological yield, harvest index and oil percentage increased due to zeolite application. Zeolite could decrease respiration, malondialdehyde and proline in salt-stressed plants. Soluble sugars and potassium content increased in response to zeolite application while sodium content significantly decreased. Selenium led to an increase in plant height, silique number, seed number in silique, biological yield, harvest index and oil percentage, while respiration, malondialdehyde, proline and sodium decreased on account of selenium application. Similarly, silicon had a significant effect on growth and agronomic traits and increased them. Silicon promoted chlorophyll synthesis while preventing malondialdehyde, proline and sodium accumulation in plant tissues. Catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were suppressed by using silicon on plants. Interaction between zeolite and selenium was significant on leaf relative water content, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content and activity of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, seed weight, seed yield, photosynthesis and soluble sugar content were affected by selenium and silicon application.

AB  - Background. Fish-based indices for evaluation of river ecosystem quality have been used since the 1980s, when the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was first introduced. Assessment of the ecological status of rivers, based on fish assemblages is required by the Water Framework Directive. During last 15 years a number of national assessment methods based on fish fauna were developed. The recently designed tool for fish-based assessment of ecological status (EFI+IBI_PL) applied in river monitoring in Poland is presented in this paper.
   Material and methods. The new European Fish Index EFI+ is a multimetric tool consisting of two specific indices, each with two metrics developed separately for salmonid- and cyprinid-river zones. Those metrics were used in the European intercalibration process to validate national methods. However, the original EFI+ method is not adequate to some lowland river types (physical-factor classification), so it was complemented by a type-specific modification of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI_PL). The method was tested on fish data from 493 sites located in 431 surface water bodies sampled in 2011-2012 according to the CEN standard 14011.
   Results. The EFI+ index was adapted to the specificity of Polish rivers by eliminating some inconsistences of the ecoregion division and problems related to the lack of the Dniester River in the EFI+ software and presented in this paper as EFI+PL. The index of diadromous fish occurrence (D) was also adapted from an original EFI+ method and used as a supplementary assessment tool. Specific IBI metrics were developed for large lowland rivers (with sandy or gravel bottom substrate), organic rivers (flowing through peat areas), and rivers connecting lakes (with the presence or lack of salmonid fish species). A software tool for indices calculation was also developed. The method combination (EFI+ IBI_PL) was than tested on a set of 493 monitoring sites sampled in 2011-2012. Both indices classified the highest percentage of sites into moderate ecological state/potential class, but for IBI_PL this percentage was much higher than for EFI+. Percentage of sites classified to good ecological status or high ecological potential by IBI_PL index were lower than for EFI+. The analysis indicates the consistence of classification for 77% of sites to high/good and below good ecological status by the EFI+PL/IBI_PL method and pressure index.
   Conclusion. The results of a two-years monitoring program show that the combination of modified EFI+ and IBI methods can be applied as a tool for river ecological status assessment in Poland, however some further method modifications are needed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop an integrative approach in ecotoxicology (from biomarkers to population genetics) to assess the ecological status of fish populations. Flounders (Platichthys flesus) collected after the spawning season in the heavily polluted Seine estuary were compared with the moderately polluted Bay of Douarnenez. The muscle energetic reserves were highly depleted in Seine vs. Douarnenez fish. The Seine fish displaying a reduced capacity to manage the oxidative stress and a higher energetic metabolism. An increase in the content of muscle membrane phospholipids (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, free sterols) was detected in the Seine vs. Douarnenez fish. The data integration allowed to hypothesize relationships between membrane phospholipids, xenobiotic metabolism, bioenergetics, and antioxidant defence. The genetic diversity considering neutral markers was maintained in the heavily polluted Seine population compared with the Douarnenez population. Finally, we suggest that the high physiological cost of tolerance to toxicants in the Seine flounder population could compromise its capacity to respond in the future to an additional stressor like warming waters in shallow depth. Thus, this population could be submitted to an ecological risk.

AB  - Island varanids seem to be an exception to the rule that territorial vertebrate taxa often become gigantic relative to mainland relatives when on islands, whereas non-territorial species become dwarfed (Case 1978). However, no systematic island/mainland studies have examined the empirical size trends in this group of carnivorous lizards. We perform such an analysis for the Australian region and critically evaluate various selective agents that might be responsible for size changes in several island populations. Insular gigantism occurs at least four times among the island populations examined. The magnitude of size change is positively correlated to prey abundance on the islands (as indirectly measured through a condition index of the lizards, essentially a measure of how fat they are) and the size of prey: islands with large prey have large varanids and vice versa. Since the island population with the largest size change, the Reevesby Varanus rosenbergi, was introduced less than 100 years ago, these size changes can be quite rapid. This might indicate that selective coefficients are strong, however, we can not exclude the possibility that these size differences have no genetic component and simply reflect environmental differences in growth rate and shifts in age structure between island and mainland locations.

AB  - With the objective to determine the influence of land use on the quality of the fluvial ecosistms within Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, physicochemical variables (conductivity, concentrations of ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate) and various benthic invertebrates indices (IBMWP, BMWQ and MCLM) Were Measured. In total, 82 stretches of rivers belonging to the Tajo, Guadiana, Jucar and Segura watersheds were sampled during the summer of 2001. The percentage of every land use type on a regional scale (drainage area) was calculated, obtained from the CORINE Land Cover and tools from ArcGIS 9.0 software. The correlation analysis results showed it significantly strong relationship between nutrients and biotic indices and the urban. forested and dry agriculture uses. For irrigated agriculture. low Correlations were found for nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and biotic indices. Given the importance of agriculture in the Castilla-La Mancha Region (53 % of the area) and the effects on the fluvial ecosystems, this Study highlights the need for improved wastewater treatment, its well its good agricultural management practices and the maintenance of the riparian corridor.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seasonal pattern of the gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (K), and sex ratio in the catfish Auchenipterichthys longimanus (Siluriformes: Auchenipteridae) as an approach to identify its reproductive period. A total of 589 A. longimanus specimens (251 males and 338 females) were captured in the rivers of the Caxiuana National Forest, in the Brazilian state of Para, between July, 2008 and July, 2009. Among the male specimens, 171 were classified as adults and 80 as juveniles, while there were 249 adults and 89 juvenile females. Using a sinusoidal equation, analysis of the GSI revealed a reproductive asynchrony between the genders, with males attaining their highest GSI values in January, while females peaked in March. For males, the sinusoidal regression for GSI values was significant only when used the complete data set (P=0.001), wears no trend was identified for bimonthly means (P=0.136). For females, by contrast, significant values were obtained for both the complete data set (P=0.012) and bimonthly GSI means (P=0.026). For the condition factor, the sinusoidal equation returned significant seasonal variation in both raw data (P=0.02) and with mean values (P=0.00) for males, but only with raw data for females (P=0.04), which appears to reflect variation in the energy budget between genders. With regard to the sex ratio, more reproductive females were captured than males in January and March, 2009, which suggests a pattern of segregation related to the reproductive process. These parameters are fundamental to the assessment, protection, and management of natural fish stocks, as well as providing guidelines for the development of conservation strategies.

AB  - In this study, coconut fibers were pretreated using NaOH solution and liquefied in hot-compressed water. A Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to identify the optimum liquefaction condition. The individual and interactive effects of four factors on liquefaction reaction were evaluated by the response surface methodology (RSM). After the pretreatment, the natural fiber crystallinity index (CrI) was increased, as proved by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractograms. The resulting liquid and residues were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and it was found that the liquefied liquid mainly contained aromatic phenolic compounds and its derivatives.

AB  - The 400-500 wolves currently living in the Apennine range of peninsular Italy are slowly recolonizing the Alps and are expected to move northward. A nationwide management plan for the Italian wolf population is being prepared, and a zoning system with connecting corridors has been suggested. We developed a large-scale probabilistic model of wolf distribution as a contribution to the planning process. Thirteen environmental variables related to wolf needs and human Presence were analyzed in 12 well-studied wolf territories and in 100 areas where the species has been absent for the Past 25 years. These two areas were used as a training set in a discriminant analysis to evaluate Potential wolf presence throughout the entire country. We used the Mahalanobis distance statistic ns an index of environmental quality, calculated as the distance from the arrange environmental conditions of the wolf territories. Based on the Mahalanobis distance statistics, we constructed an actual and potential spatial distribution of the wolf for all of peninsula Italy. The jackknife procedure trans used to assess the stability of the distance model and showed good confidence in our model (coefficient of variation less than or equal to 13%). Distance from the wolf territories' centroid ns an index of environmental quality for the wolf was tested using 287 locations where wolves have been found dead in the past 25 years as a consequence of human action (poison, shotgun car accidents). A useful contribution to conservation Planning resulted from comparing the frequency distribution of the Mahalanobis distance of the dead wolf locations with the percentage? of study area within each distance class. This showed how the number of wolf casualties would greatly decrease with Protection of only a minor part of the study area and indicated the usefulness of our approach for evaluation of other conservation options, such as core areas and corridor identification.

AB  - Pinna nobilis, commonly known as the fan mussel, is an endemic and endangered species of the Mediterranean Sea. Using specimens collected monthly from March 2008 to February 2009, this study examines the gonadal development and biochemical composition in the adductor muscle of the fan mussel in relation to environmental parameters, such as chlorophyll-a, seawater temperature, salinity, particulate organic and particulate inorganic matter at Karantina Island, Aegean Sea, Turkey. We observed gonadal development primarily in the spring months and at the beginning of the summer. The spawning period was observed from May to September (primarily in July, with 88.8%). Monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was inversely correlated with protein of adductor muscle and positively correlated with glycogen of adductor muscle, meat yield, and the adductor muscle index (p <= 0.05). Our findings suggest that protein in the adductor muscle was used as an energy reserve for gametogenesis. No correlation was found between reproduction and environmental parameters, with the exception of salinity (p>0.05).

AB  - The issue of climate change has occurred very strongly during the last 2 decades on global scale in analysis of estimated inferences on the environment of vulnerable states. Pakistan is one of the states that has high vulnerability index to natural disaster. Currently, climate of Pakistan is growing warmer; and we are moving around different signals of change. Meanwhile, it is important to ascertain climate trend of temperature, rain, wind speed and humidity in Pakistan on sequential basis. Therefore, this study aims to ascertain the climate trend through model specification of Stretched distributions comprising Lindley Stretched Exponential distribution, Exponentiated Stretched Exponential distribution, Kumaraswamy Stretched Exponential distribution and Transmuted Stretched Exponential distribution. A sort of comparison among new proposed, classical and modern models is also put up to evaluate the relative quality of statistical models for Climate data through Maximized Log Likelihood, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Consistent Akaike Information Criterion, Hannan Quinn Information Criteria and Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Findings specify that Kumaraswamy Stretched Exponential distribution is the best fit for modeling mean minimum temperature (C-o) data, Lindley Stretched Exponential distribution is the best fit for modeling total July's rain (mm) data, Transmuted Stretched Exponential distribution is the best fit for modeling wind speed (knots) data, Exponentiated Stretched Exponential distribution is the best fit for modeling humidity (%) data according to model specification. Generally, the results demonstrate that and new proposed models are ascertained best models for specification of climate data in Pakistan. It is also observed that these models proved stretchy and flexible for modeling climate data in the state of Pakistan.

AB  - Current methods of wetland assessment rely on the use of ecological indicators such as vegetation and amphibians, but often lack an in-depth analysis of soil parameters. The objective of this study was to determine whether the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method (ORAM) can be used to predict soil quality in forested wetlands. Soil cores were taken from six wetlands ranging in ORAM scores. The soil samples were analyzed for key soil parameters (aggregate stability, bulk density, organic matter, C, N, S, P, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity). Some of these soil parameters (i.e., microbial biomass, soil C, N and S, bulk density, soil moisture) were correlated with the ORAM scores, while others (i.e., P, pH, aggregate stability) showed no correlation. Enzyme activity was correlated with the ORAM score for one of the four sampling events. When analyzed together by a principal component analysis, the soil parameters did not separate the wetland sites along a gradient of ORAM scores. Our results indicate that the ORAM reflects some of the key soil quality conditions, but not all. We further discuss whether some of the soil parameters we selected are appropriate indicators of the quality of wetland soils.

AB  - Forest growth models are useful tools for investigating the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest.
   Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones.
   Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more 'efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity has a negative impact on many coastal ecosystems, compromising the significant direct and indirect socio-economic benefits provided in these areas. Maintaining activities that depend on coastal zones while preserving the ecological state of the ecosystems represents a management challenge. Management of coastal zones requires scientifically based knowledge, due to the complexity of the ecological processes which occur in these ecosystems and because of interaction with the socio-economic system. The effectiveness of coastal management instruments and programmes needs to be evaluated to determine the success of adopted measures and to establish improved goals. Some of the research areas that can support coastal management include marine spatial planning, ecological modelling, development of tools to communicate science to managers, and interaction between coastal ecosystems and socio-economics. This paper reviews management instruments to address coastal zone problems and of some research areas to support management.

AB  - Bivalve populations are controlled by several biotic and abiotic factors. Parasitism is among the biotic factors but is often neglected. In the present study, we focused on the transcriptomic and biochemical responses of Cerastoderma edule when parasitized as first intermediate host by the trematode Bucephalus minimus (sporocyst, the most damaging stage), and taking into account seasonal patterns. In order to test the hypothesis that the presence of B. minimus compromises cockle regular gene expression and biochemical performance and increases their vulnerability to other parasite species infection, cockles were sampled every other month during one year in Arcachon Bay (French Atlantic coast). Overall, results showed that B. minimus induced its first intermediate host defence mechanism against oxidative stress (mainly at gene level), increased host metabolism and energy demand especially in summer (revealed at both gene and biochemical level, although without significant differences) and was accompanied by a higher metacercariae abundance. Results allowed to accept the posted hypothesis and to conclude that transcriptomic and biochemical markers can provide additional and ecologically relevant information about parasite effects on their hosts, reflecting the invasion effects of pathogens but also the environmental conditions that animals experience.

AB  - In an effort to better portray changing health conditions in Chesapeake Bay and support restoration efforts, a Bay Health Index (BHI) was developed to assess the ecological effects of nutrient and sediment loading on 15 regions of the estuary. Three water quality and three biological measures were combined to formulate the BHI. Water quality measures of chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, and Secchi depth were averaged to create the Water Quality Index (WQI), and biological measures of the phytoplankton and benthic indices of biotic integrity (P-IBI and B-IBI, respectively) and the area of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) were averaged to create the Biotic Index (BI). The WQI and BI were subsequently averaged to give a BHI value representing ecological conditions over the growing season (i.e., March-October). Lower chlorophyll-a concentrations, higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, deeper Secchi depths, higher phytoplankton and benthic indices relative to ecological health-based thresholds, and more extensive SAV area relative to restoration goal areas, characterized the least-impaired regions. The WQI, P-BI and BHI were significantly correlated with (1) regional river flow (r = -0.64, -0.57 and -0.49, respectively; p < 0.01), (2) nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sediment loads (all positively correlated with flow), and (3) the sum of developed and agricultural land use (highest annual r(2) = 0.86, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively) in most reporting regions, indicating that the BHI is strongly regulated by nutrient and sediment loads from these land uses. The BHI uses ecological health-based thresholds that give an accurate representation of the health conditions in Chesapeake Bay and was the basis for an annual, publicly released environmental report card that debuted in 2007.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) seed oil has desirable properties for producing advanced biofuels and as a healthy cooking oil. It has been grown for centuries, but basic recommendations for nitrogen (N) fertilizer requirements are still needed to support widespread industrial cultivation across North America. A replicated N-response plot-scale study was conducted on a northern Mollisol soil for two growing seasons to 1) determine seed and oil yield, seed oil content, and vegetative response; 2) determine indices of N use efficiency; and 3) measure post-harvest residual inorganic soil N as an index of environmental risk. Seed and oil yield response to N fertilization was described with a quadratic function, which predicted maximum seed yield (1450 kg ha(-1)) and oil yield (580 kg ha(-1)) at about 130 kg N ha(-1). However, seed and oil yield did not differ significantly among N-rates above 34 kg N ha(-1). Seed oil content averaged 400 g kg(-1) among all N rates. Agronomic efficiency declined above 34 kg N ha(-1), which coincided with an increase of post-harvest soil nitrate-N plus ammonium-N (residual N). Considering N use efficiency, simple cost analysis, and risk associated with residual N, a rate of 34 kg N ha(-1) is recommended.

TI  - Lentic green sunfish populations in Nebraska Sandhill lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) is common throughout Midwestern streams and rivers. However, relatively little is known about lentic populations. Our objective was to relate population characteristics of green sunfish to the fish and invertebrate community as well as the physical and chemical habitat of natural lakes in the Nebraska Sandhills. Green sunfish were collected in 10 of 30 lakes sampled in 1998 and 1999 with trap nets. The number of stock (i.e., 8 cm) and longer green sunfish per trap net (catch-per-unit-effort; CPUE) was variable, ranging from 0.2 to 1,429, but was positively related to yellow perch (Perca flavescens) CPUE. However, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and green sunfish CPUE were not related, likely because only five lakes contained both species. Green sunfish condition, indexed with relative weight [Wr, stock to quality length (8-15 cm)], was positively related to yellow perch Wr [stock to quality length (13-20 cm)]. Green sunfish CPUE was lower in lakes containing largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Green sunfish Wr and size structure were inversely related to Bosmina sp. mean length. In addition, green sunfish condition and size structure were high in lakes with a low proportion of submersed vegetation. These relationships suggest that high quality green sunfish populations coexisted with high quality yellow perch populations and are most likely to occur in lakes with low submersed vegetation coverage.

AB  - The present study analyzed the relationships of two different biological assemblages (diatom and macroinvertebrate) when they are used to characterize a set of stations (from reference stations to impacted stations) within the Shahrood River. In particular, we examined the issue of concordance among these assemblages and the physicochemical parameters detected, using both multivariate and multimetric methods. In addition, the trophic diatom index and Hilsenhoff family-level biotic index for macroinvertebrate assemblages were used to evaluate the ecological status of the Shahrood River. Diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Shahrood River differed significantly between reference and impacted stations. ANOSIM showed a significant difference in the composition and abundance of diatoms and macroinvertebrates among reference, influence and impact stations, especially between reference and impact stations. Results of CCA ordination showed that benthic diatoms and macroinvertebrate assemblages were mainly affected by DO, TSS, NO3 (-), PO4 (3-) concentrations and heavy metals such as Zn and Cd. Biotic indices for the Shahrood River suggested a water quality category of "fair" with fairly substantial organic pollution for the impacted stations. Finally, our results suggest that an appropriate management and restoration policy needs to be implemented for the Shahrood basin.

AB  - Body condition is a qualitative evaluation of an animal and is directly related to its fitness, with the relative mass index (RMI) as a tool for indirect estimation of energy reserves. This study evaluated if the body condition of birds differs between guilds, if it is reflected in levels of subcutaneous fat, and if it is influenced by the weather season and ectoparasite presence. The RMI was calculated for Antilophia galeata (frugivorous), Arremon flavirostris, Eucometis penicillata (omnivorous), Basileuterus culicivorus, and Myiothlypis leucophrys (insectivorous). It varied among guilds (F-2,F- (295) = 187.92; P < 0.05), with insectivorous species having negative values. The RMI varied between the wet and dry seasons only for A. galeata (F-1,F- 1 = 7.28; P < 0.05) but remained positive throughout the year in omnivorous species. The RMI did not vary with the presence/absence of ectoparasites nor among the different levels of subcutaneous fat, which were predominantly low. The negative RMI of insectivores and its variation in frugivorous between seasons suggest that the body condition is influenced by the type of diet and the availability of food resources, indicating that birds with a specialized diet may be more sensitive to environmental variations that result in fluctuations in the food supply.

AB  - This study aimed at determining the effect of heat exposure on physical workload and maximum acceptable work duration in a hot and dry climate. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, as an environmental index, and heart rate and core body temperature, as physiological indices, were used to assess environmental heat stress. For this purpose, the study was conducted on 86 acclimatized workers of six different sites of an oil industry. The comparison between heart rate at rest and work hours and core body temperature at rest and work hours revealed the existence of a significant different between heart rate and Core Body Temperature (P value < 0.001). The results also indicated a significant difference between WBGT(TWA) and the limit value (P value < 0.001). However, the results uncovered that the MAWD should be reduced in some units and, consequently, the work-rest regimens were modified based on this reduction. In addition, the results of this study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in and heart rate after work in excessive heat stress conditions. Heat exposure is perceived as a significant problem by the workers who worked in such workplaces. The results of this study can help managers and workers better plan and control thermal stresses.

AB  - As understanding of the complex relations among environmental stressors and biological responses improves, a logical next step is predictive modeling of biological condition at unsampled sites. We developed a boosted regression tree (BRT) model of biological condition, as measured by a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (BIBI), for streams in urbanized Southern Coastal California. We also developed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark for comparison with the BRT model. The BRT model explained 66% of the variance in B-IBI, identifying watershed population density and combined percentage agricultural and urban land cover in the riparian buffer as the most important predictors of B-IBI, but with watershed mean precipitation and watershed density of manmade channels also important. The MLR model explained 48% of the variance in B-IBI and included watershed population density and combined percentage agricultural and urban land cover in the riparian buffer. For a verification data set, the BRT model correctly classified 75% of impaired sites (B-IBI <40) and 78% of unimpaired sites (B-IBI >= 40). For the same verification data set, the MLR model correctly classified 69% of impaired sites and 87% of unimpaired sites. The BRT model should not be used to predict B-IBI for specific sites; however, the model can be useful for general applications such as identifying and prioritizing regions for monitoring, remediation or preservation, stratifying new bioassessments according to anticipated biological condition, or assessing the potential for change in stream biological condition based on anticipated changes in population density and development in stream buffers.

AB  - We surveyed the opinions of 16 water quality experts in order to develop a water quality index for contact recreation in freshwaters in New Zealand. The index was developed by postal surveys using the Delphi method, involving feedback of information to the panel members at each iteration. Determinands selected for use in the index were as follows: faecal bacterial indicators (faecal coliforms or E. coli), pH, Munsell colour. visual clarity indicators (black disc visibility or turbidity), and nutrients promoting nuisance growths (filtered BOD,, and dissolved forms of phosphorus and nitrogen). "Sub-index" curves relating suitability-for-use to these water quality determinands have been developed. The mean ("consensus") sub-index curves can be used to interpret water quality data in terms of suitability-for-use scores. We advocate using the lowest suitability-for-use score for a water as its overall index value for contact recreation. Thus the water body's suitability-for-use is determined by its "poorest" characteristic. The index is now ready to be tested by water managers for its utility in state-of-environment reporting.

AB  - Climate change asks for the reduction in the consumption of fossil-based fuels and an increased share of non-regulated renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. In order to back up a larger share of these intermittent sources, battery services' are needed, currently provided only in large scale by hydropower, leading to more rapid and frequent changes in flows (hydropeaking) in the downstream rivers. Increased knowledge about the ecosystem response to such operations and design of cost-effective measures is needed. We analysed the response of fish communities to hydropeaking (frequency, magnitude, ramping rate and timing) and the interaction with the habitat conditions in Austrian rivers. An index of biotic integrity (Fish Index Austria) was used to compare river sections with varying degrees of flow fluctuations under near-natural and channelized habitat conditions. The results showed that habitat conditions, peak frequency (number of peaks per year), ramping rate (water level variation) and interaction between habitat and ramping rate explained most of the variation of the Fish Index Austria. In addition, peaking during the night seems to harm fish more than peaking during the day. Fish communities in hyporhithral and epipotamal types of rivers are more affected by hydropeaking than those in metarhithral type of rivers. The results support the findings of other studies that fish stranding caused by ramping rates >15cmh(-1) are likely to be the main cause of fish community degradation when occurring more often than 20 times a year. While the ecological status degrades with increasing ramping rate in nature-like rivers, fish communities are heavily degraded in channelized rivers regardless of the ramping rate. The mitigation of hydropeaking, therefore, requires an integrative approach considering the combined effects of hydrological and morphological alterations on fish. (c) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding the structure and function of a lake's ecosystem is the premise and foundation to implementing ecosystem-based management. However, evaluating the status of the ecosystem of a lake as a whole is still difficult when it comes to selecting indicators, determining standards, and interpretating results. In order to quantify the ecosystem status of Lake Baiyangdian (BYD), a holistic food web model was built using Ecopath with Ecosim. Eleven Ecological Network Analysis indicators classified into three categories (ecological function, ecological maturity, and food web structure) were selected according to their representativeness and availability. Based on the published literature on similar freshwater lakes or reservoirs in the world, quantile-based classification criteria are obtained. Furthermore, the Analytic Hierarchy Process was employed to assign the weight of an indicator according to its importance, sensitivity, and adaptability. An integrated evaluation framework was formed after synthesizing the evaluation value using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. It was concluded that the ecological state of Lake BYD in 2009-2010 could be graded "Bad", featuring a low-quality mature ecosystem, low trophic transfer efficiency, and linear, simple, and fragile connections between trophic levels. More specifically, the "Medium" grade detritivory:herbivory ratio (D:H), mean trophic level of the catch (MTLC), and "Bad" grade of transfer efficiency (TE) indicate that the composition of trophic species is unbalanced and the material and energy transfer is inefficient. "Good" grades of total primary production over biomass (TPP/TB), biomass over total system throughput ratio (TB/TST), and relative ascendency (A/C), together with "Median" grade of total primary production over total respiration ratio (TPP/TR), show characteristics of a mature ecosystem due to a high biomass of macrophytes, although here is a "low quality" in terms of exergy. In terms of the performance of the food web structure, all indicators achieve a "Bad" grade, suggesting a linear, simple, and fragile network. According to our modeling results, controlling the excessive macrophyte biomass, restoring fish biodiversity, and mitigating the pressures of overexploitation are suggested for the ecosystem-based management of BYD. This paper provides an integrated method to evaluate the ecological state of a shallow lake when its own reference state is unavailable.

AB  - Excessive urban growth has led to an urban environmental degradation in megacities in less developed countries. Using fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data obtained by satellite remote sensing, we analysed the inter-annual variations and trends in the urban environment of 17 megacities in Eurasia from 2000 to 2016. Taking the average environmental condition for all the megacities in 2000 as the baseline, the urban environmental conditions were evaluated by a Comprehensive Environmental Index (CEI) from 2001 to 2016. The variation and trends analysis of CEI revealed that the overall environmental conditions in Chennai, Dhaka, Kolkata and Tianjin showed significant deterioration trends. Environmental qualities in newly developed urban areas experienced degradation in Bangalore, Beijing, and Mumbai. The area of environmentally deteriorated urban land has been expanding in Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai in India and Dhaka in Bangladesh since 2001. By contrast, the area of environmentally degraded urban land in Chinese megacities expanded to the largest extent in the period of 2007-2009 and decreased afterwards. The result suggests that greening and strong emission control strategies significantly contributed to urban environmental quality enhancement in rapidly developing megacities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concept of inclusive development provides equal opportunities for all participants in access to the labor market and resource allocation. This concept emphasizes the equality of human capital, the ecological state of the environment, social protection and food security. This concept is fundamentally different from the standard perception of economic growth, because it has broader goals than simply increasing incomes and GDP. It rejects the position that positive results are an automatic consequence of growth; here the basic condition is human development and increase of its well-being, reduction of poverty. Therefore, it is not the result of distribution that becomes primary, but the involvement in the process of social reproduction. An alternative system of characterization of the country's position according to the resulting indicator of the Inclusive Development Index was presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In this research the methodical development of the system of estimation of the index of inclusive development for regions of the NUTS 4 level of the European classification is resulted.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES

KW  - DISTURBANCE INDEX
AB  - With growing populations and ever increasing pressure on resources, the need to live sustainably with our environment has increased in significance. When considering such anthropogenic pressures, karst landscapes are as vulnerable, if not more so, than any other environment. Such vulnerability arises from the rapid transit times of percolating water, the poor filtering ability of carbonate bedrock, and the highly specialized biota of subterranean karst. The Karst Sustainability Index (KSI) was created as a standardized metric of sustainable development practices in karst settings. The KSI uses predetermined targets to ascertain the overall sustainability of a karst region. Indicators are designed to incorporate common measures of sustainability for the three domains of social, environmental, and economic resource use. Benchmarking the current state of karst environments allows the comparison of sustainability practices temporally and spatially to highlight areas where remedial policies or actions are needed. This is the first index to incorporate the emerging field of environmental sustainability with karst landscape assessment. To test the applicability of the KSI, a study was undertaken in the Tampa Bay Metropolitan Area, which encompasses four counties that are entirely karst. The TBMA was found to be progressing towards the sustainable management of karst resources, and the KSI provided a robust measure of sustainability.

AB  - Healthy river ecosystems can provide fundamental ecological services for human survival and social development. However, previous studies that have sought to assess river ecosystem health have primarily focused on individual biological communities rather than on all aquatic communities and have been based on a single-index assessment method, thereby leading to large uncertainties in the results. In this study, we developed a new framework for the integrated assessment of aquatic ecosystem health based on the principal communities of fish, zoobenthos, phytoplankton, and zooplankton in rivers. An index of biotic integrity was used to evaluate the health of fish and zoobenthos communities, and a diversity index was used to evaluate the health of zooplankton and phytoplankton communities. To integrate the health assessment results from these four communities, a quantile normalization method was developed, where uncertainties in assessments obtained using the diversity index were well compensated for by the assessments obtained using the biotic integrity index. The framework was then applied to a pilot city, which is being constructed as a civilized freshwater ecological city in China. The results were then compared with those previously obtained based on the single-community method. Using this new framework, we found that the aquatic ecosystem health changed regularly in space and over time. Large differences were detected among the assessments of the four individual communities based on the single-community method, with the health score determined using phytoplankton being the highest, followed by that of zoobenthos, zooplankton, and fish, which made it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion regarding aquatic health status. The integrated assessment framework presented in this study successfully overcame the narrow perspective of the single-community method, thereby reducing uncertainties in the assessments based only on a single diversity index, and instead provides a comprehensive view of the status of aquatic ecosystem health. Thus, this integrated framework could assist river managers and stakeholders in developing comprehensive strategies for ecological restoration and water resource management and could become a key research tool for the health assessment and rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems globally.

AB  - Consistent assessments of biological condition are needed across multiple ecoregions to provide a greater understanding of the spatial extent of environmental degradation. However, consistent assessments at large geographic scales are often hampered by lack of uniformity in data collection, analyses, and interpretation. The index of biotic integrity (IBI) has been widely used in eastern and central North America, where fish assemblages are complex and largely composed of native species, but IBI development has been hindered in the western United States because of relatively low fish species richness and greater relative abundance of alien fishes. Approaches to developing IBIs rarely provide a consistent means of assessing biological condition across multiple ecoregions. We conducted an evaluation of IBIs recently proposed for three ecoregions of the western United States using an independent data set covering a large geographic scale. We standardized the regional IBIs and developed biological condition criteria, assessed the responsiveness of IBIs to basin-level land uses, and assessed their precision and concordance with basin-scale IBIs. Standardized IBI scores from 318 sites in the western United States comprising mountain, plains, and xeric ecoregions were significantly related to combined urban and agricultural land uses. Standard deviations and coefficients of variation revealed relatively low variation in IBI scores based on multiple sampling reaches at sites. A relatively high degree of corroboration with independent, locally developed IBIs indicates that the regional IBIs are robust across large geographic scales, providing precise and accurate assessments of biological condition for western U.S. streams.

AB  - Land-cover degradation affects the ability of forests to provide water ecosystem services (ESw). This study explores the forest-water nexus and provides an overview of the water management related to potential hy-drological impacts of land-use and land-cover change in the Rio Grande de Comitan-Lagos de Montebello watershed in southeastern Mexico. A combination of methods recommended by the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA), as well as scenario modelling based on an ecological index of riparian quality, were used to assess how alternative reforestation or deforestation scenarios can affect water provision and water quality at different scales. The results indicate that water quality is positively related to forest cover. The effects of terrain and forest-cover conditions on fog inputs and actual evapotranspiration were relevant to increase the water yield under reforestation scenarios. However, strategies for improving the efficient consumption of both green and blue water resources must be considered at a local scale. Deteriorated ESw are also related to inadequate management of water resources in the study area, so water security for local populations requires land use policies that should consider forest-based solutions, sustainable agricultural practices, and the development of efficient distribution networks for water.

AB  - An index of condition was developed for wild Red Grouse chicks aged 10-30 days. This was derived from the difference between the observed weight and that expected from the chick's age, or stage of feather development. To measure it, the chicks needed to be caught only once. Variations in condition among different broods of wild chicks were greater than variations among broods of captive chicks in the same years, probably because the wild chicks' environment was harsher and more variable. Within years, the condition of wild chicks was not related to their brood size. Among years, mean condition was correlated both with breeding success and with the biomass of green heather food available in spring. This was because the chicks' condition and survival were poor for two years following an episode of severe weather damage to the heather.

AB  - It is a relevant task for current agricultural research to predict and interpret the influence of climate change on the harmful organisms of crops and to adapt the phytosanitary management. Interpreting the bioclimatic scenarios of Phytophthora infestans, which is the causal agent of late blight of potato in the crops areas in Ciego de Avila during the period November - April for the years 2025 and 2030 under scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 was the aim of this work. In the making of the bioclimatic scenarios, were used daily data of accumulated precipitation and the average temperature from the Regional Model PRECISCARIBE. In addition, the biological indexes required by the phytopathogen to develop epiphytics which are considered in the method of "threshold of rains" recommended by the technical instruction of the crop in Cuba were taken into account. The results agree on the existence of not favorable meteorological conditions for the development and evolution of late blight in both 2025 and 2030. Specifically, the scarce occurrence and the low cumulative of precipitations that do not exceed the levels indicated by the threshold line, as well as the incidence of average temperatures above 24 degrees C. The bioclimatic scenarios obtained for this Oomycetes provide information for future planning and phytosanitary management of the crop as well as for the selection of cultural inputs and services that favor the application of climate-smart agriculture that contributes to the sustainable production of the tuber.

AB  - The Incomati river basin is a transboundary basin shared by three countries: South Africa, Mozambique and Swaziland. To assess the water requirements of the environment, as stated in the Tripartite Interim Agreement (TIA) signed by the three riparian countries in Johannesburg in 2002, Mozambique needs to monitor the ecological state of the river, including the estuary. A monitoring system has to be established that can evaluate the environmental fresh water requirements based on appropriate indicators that reflect the health of the Incomati estuary.
   The estuary of the Incomati has important ecological functions but it also is an important socio-economic resource. Local communities depend on the estuary's natural resources. Modifications of the river flow regime by upstream developments impact on the productivity of the estuary, diminishing fish and shrimp production, reducing biomass of natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds and mangroves and increasing salt intrusion. A decrease in estuary productivity consequently affects the incomes and living conditions of these communities.
   Based on an understanding of the effects of different pressures on the estuary ecosystem some indicators for monitoring the environmental state of the estuary are suggested, including the extent and vitality of mangrove forests. This latter indicator is further elaborated in the paper.
   Remote sensing techniques were used to identify and quantify mangrove forests in two selected areas of the estuary (Xefina Pequena Island and Benguelene Island). Five satellite images covering a period of 20 years (1984-2003) showed that the area covered by non-degraded mangroves significantly decreased on both islands, by 25% in Xefina Pequena Island and 40% in Benguelene Island. Moreover, the study of biomass reflection using NDVI also showed a significant decline in biomass densities over the last 20 years.
   Possible causes of these changes are reviewed: natural rainfall trends, modifications of the river flow regime, and increasing harvesting levels of mangrove woods. The findings presented in this paper show that mangrove forests are relevant indicators of the state of the estuary. which can be assessed by means of remote sensing techniques. Follow-up research is required that will establish the relative importance of the causal factors on the vitality of the estuarine mangrove forests. It is concluded that remotely sensed images may provide important data for an environmental monitoring system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is proposed, based on the fish communities and populations in streams of the Hondo River basin, Mexico-Belize. Freshwater environments in this area are threatened by exotic fishes, eutrophication, and pesticide pollution, among other problems. This IBI should allow to identify the most vulnerable sites and eventually guide rehabilitation efforts. Data on composition, structure, and function of fish communities were evaluated. Twenty-three sites in the Mexican part of the basin were explored; a stratified sample of 13 sites was used to design the IBI, and the rest were used to test and refine the index. Thirty-four candidate indicator metrics were scanned for their correlation with an index of water and habitat quality (IWHQ), as well as for the possible influence of stream width and altitude or distance to the Hondo River mainstem. Twelve variables were selected to constitute the IBI: relative abundances of Astyanax aeneus, 'Cichlasoma' urophthalmus, Poecilia mexicana, Poecilia sp. (a new species, probably endemic to the upper Hondo River basin), Xiphophorus hellerii, and X. maculatus; relative abundances of bentholimnetic, herbivore, and sensitive species; percentage of native and tolerant species; and Pielou's evenness index. Most of the sites have a low-medium quality and integrity, showing impact due to partial channelization or to suboptimal water quality, reflected in scarcity or absence of sensitive species, frequent excess of tolerant species, occasional presence of exotics, dominance of herbivores (perhaps due to proliferation of filamentous algae), or dominance of the opportunistic species P. mexicana. The streams with better water and habitat quality are those farthest away from the river mainstem, probably because of lower human population and economical production.

AB  - Initiatives to enhance natural stock of lobster imply the production of high-quality postlarvae. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological condition of postlarvae produced under hatchery conditions by comparing the nutrient profiles of larvae stage I and postlarvae stage IV of American lobster (Homarus americanus) fed frozen adult Artemia with a mixture of dry commercial products. Body sterols, acetone mobile polar lipids and phospholipids levels were lower in stage IV than in stage I, while cholesterol was nearly 400 % higher in the former. The C-20 mono-unsaturated acids and C-22 n-3 decreased between stage I and IV in both neutral and polar lipids, while linoleic (18:2n-6 cis) and linolenic (18:3n-3) acids increased concomitantly. The levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the polar fraction were twice lower in postlarvae compared to stage I larvae and almost completely depleted in the neutral fraction while eicosapentaenoic acid levels were reduced by nearly 30 % in the polar lipids and by over 70 % in the neutral lipids. Results suggested possible dietary phospholipids and DHA deficiencies that lead to the low levels observed in the postlarvae stage IV.

AB  - To assess the potential of carbon isotope discrimination as a selection criterion for enhancing stress yield, simulated water deficit field studies were undertaken to measure its genetic variation and association with yield and yield related traits. Discrimination was significantly reduced in terminal stress compared to well watered conditions. Carbon isotope discrimination was significantly correlated with grain yield, biological yield, harvest index, and productive tillers under terminal and preanthesis stress.

AB  - An assessment of the ecological condition of south Florida estuaries based on regional probabilistic monitoring was conducted during the summer of 1995. Samples and data were collected on water and sediment quality, benthos, and fish tissue contaminants. Elevated concentrations of metals and pesticides were measured in both sediments and fish tissue with some exceedances of guidance values. Bottom dissolved oxygen levels over 23-37% of the area were below state criteria. Eighty-eight percent of surface waters had greater than 10% penetration of ambient light to a depth of 1.0 m. Nine percent of the area studied in South Florida exhibited degraded biology and impaired use based on a calculated index of ecological condition. Using the probability-based monitoring design, useful information of this type can be provided to resource managers regarding estuarine condition on a regional scale.

AB  - For many years, fisheries management was based on optimizing yield and maintaining a target biomass, with little regard given to low-frequency environmental forcing. However, this policy was often unsuccessful. In the last two to three decades, fisheries science and management have undergone a shift towards balancing sustainable yield with conservation, with the goal of including ecosystem considerations in decision-making frameworks. Scientific understanding of low-frequency climate-ocean variability, which is manifested as ecosystem regime shifts and states, has led to attempts to incorporate these shifts and states into fisheries assessment and management. To date, operationalizing these attempts to provide tactical advice has met with limited success. We review efforts to incorporate regime shifts and states into the assessment and management of fisheries resources, propose directions for future investigation and outline a potential framework to include regime shifts and changes in ecosystem states into fisheries management.

AB  - Juvenile turbot (5-125 g) were reared under two experimental temperatures: 10 degrees C and 16 degrees C, and three experimental photoperiods: LDN (natural photoperiod), LD16:8 (16 h light: 8 h darkness), LD24:0 (continuous light), to study effects of temperature and photoperiod on growth, activity and oxygen consumption. Growth was strongly affected by temperature and was higher at 16 degrees C than at 10 degrees C. Continuous light had a growth-promoting effect at 10 degrees C from mid-December to late March, while at 16 degrees C this effect was restricted to December and January. A seasonal change in the condition index was found. The groups reared in continuous light had higher condition indices in winter. The experimental groups held at 16 degrees C had a higher O-2 consumption than those at 10 degrees C. The LD24:0 groups invariably had a higher overall O-2 consumption than did the LDN and LD16:8 groups, the differences being caused by reduced O-2 consumption in the latter groups during darkness. The LD24:0 groups displayed higher activity than the LDN groups, in which activity was very low at night.

AB  - Annular seabream, Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758), were caught off the coast of the Gulf of Gabes (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean) between April 2008 and March 2010 by commercial catches. With a total 2066 specimens the fish ranged in size from 7.7 cm to 18.5 cm total length and from 7.5 g to 123.3 g in weight. Changes in biological parameters (weight, length, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index and condition factor) were examined in order to provide information on the spawning period and reproductive cycle in the gulf. Overall sex ratio was 1 : 1.52 in favour of females. The reproductive season extends from March to June, with a spawning activity peak in May. Total length at sexual maturity was 10.5 +/- 0.22 cm (males) and 10.6 +/- 0.3 cm (females). The results of this study could help to establish a recommended minimum capture size.

AB  - Amazonian headwater streams trail a heterogeneous landscape, with marked natural variation of geomorphological conditions and hydrological periods. Southern Brazilian Amazon is subjected to high degradation pressure, mainly from deforestation. Hence, we characterize pristine headwaters structure (hydromorphology and water physical-chemical variables) and variation among hydrological periods (dry, beginning of the rainy period and end of the rainy period), to define reference conditions for conservation-oriented classification, monitoring and rehabilitation of the southern Brazilian Amazon streams. Stretches of 10 pristine streams from the Teles Pires River, a major tributary of the Tapajos River, were analysed for hydromorphology, water physical-chemical variables and controlled for habitat integrity (forested proportion on buffer zones and habitat integrity index). We found variation among hydrological periods and spatial heterogeneity on pristine stream structure. Most variables showed great variation ranges at the same hydrological period and high variation coefficient values, reflecting the natural environmental heterogeneity among streams protected by a riparian forest. Variation among hydrological periods and spatial heterogeneity between streams in this region, combined with current high levels of deforestation, indicates the need for the conservation of a high proportion of streams and their respective riparian forests. Here, we have presented reference range values for monitoring and rehabilitation programs integrated in the Amazonian aquatic conservation efforts. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Studies examining how wildlife populations perceive and respond to habitat are common, and many attempt to understand how the quality of available habitats influences population processes such as survival and recruitment. Traditional methods to estimate habitat quality (e.g. population density) have not led to great advancement in our understanding of relationships between habitat and fitness in recent years. Metrics from the discipline of conservation physiology could help researchers to address these difficulties and to meet the challenges that habitat alteration poses to biodiversity. Incorporating physiological metrics that relate energetics or environmental stress to habitats may be powerful measures of habitat quality. By quantifying field metabolic rates, body condition, or concentrations of stress hormones in individual organisms, researchers may identify mechanisms associated with habitat that underlie observed patterns in vital rates (survival and fecundity). Physiological metrics offer useful tools that may identify mechanisms of habitat quality and detect the causes of declines in biodiversity. However, integration among physiologists, ecologists and conservation biologists will require new partnerships and approaches to respond to complex ecological issues.

AB  - Caged zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, were transplanted to 6 monitoring sites receiving industrial effluents suspected of containing genotoxic chemicals. After a residence time of 2 months, the induction of micronuclei (MN) in haemocytes was determined as a criterion for genetic damage. The mean MN frequencies observed in mussels exposed to effluents ranged between 5.0 and 8.8 parts per thousand. These rates were significantly higher than the baseline level of 2.0 parts per thousand recorded in a concurrent control mussel group reintroduced at the reference location. Biological fitness descriptors (mortality, attachment biotest, condition index, gonadic index) revealed no relationship between the general well-being of the mussels exposed under contrasted environmental conditions and the frequency of MN induced in their haemocytes. The biological feasibility of the transfer technique of zebra mussels, together with a moderate, but significant, inducibility of MN, are major features towards the development of a first tool for in situ monitoring of genotoxicity in freshwater environments using a common indicator species.

AB  - Most regional municipal solid waste landfills in Serbia are operated without control of landfill leachate and gas or with no regard for implementation of national and European legislation. For the first time in Serbia, groundwater and soil at a landfill were subject to systematic annual monitoring according to national, European legislation and adopted methodologies. Characterisation of the groundwater and soil samples from the landfill included ten metals (Fe, Mn, As, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr, Cu and Hg), 16 EPA PAHs, nutrients and certain physicochemical parameters, in order to assess the risks such poorly controlled landfills pose to the environment. This impact assessment was performed using specially adapted pollution indices: LWPI, the Single factor pollution index and the Nemerow index for groundwater, and geo-accumulation index, ecological risk factor and selected rations of PAHs for soil. The data analysis included multivariate statistical methods (factor analysis of principal component analysis (PCA/FA)) in order to assess the extent of the contaminants detected in the groundwater and soil samples.
   The pollution indices (LWPI: 3.56-8.89; Nemerow index: 2.02-3.78) indicate the quality of the groundwater at the landfill is degrading over time, with PAH(16), TOC, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn as the substances of greatest concern. Heavy metals Hg (I-geo <= 3.14), Pb (I-geo <= 2.22), Cr (I-geo <= 3.31) and Cu (I-geo <= 2.16) represent the worst soil contamination. Hg has moderate (52.9) to very high (530.0) potential ecological risk, demonstrating the long-term potential effects of bioaccumulation and biomagnification.
   The results of this work indicate that Cr and Cu should possibly be added to the EU Watch List of emerging substances. This proposition is substantiated by relevant state and alike environmental information from nations in the region. This study demonstrates the need to develop a model for prioritization of landfill closure and remediation based on environmental risk assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As soil erosion is a major threat for global food security, soil and water conservation (SWC) structures are essential in degraded lands of the tropics facing water scarcity. However, some fundamental questions regarding the impact of SWC measures on soil aggregate stability, organic carbon (SOC) pools within bulk soils and aggregates, and biological activities remain unexplored. A 11-year study was conducted, involving a combination of tree (Emblica officinalis) + grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) + legume (Stylosanthes seabrana), comparing in-situ soil water storage measures, staggered contour trenches (SWC1), continuous contour trenches (SWC2), stone mulch (SWC3), and vegetative barriers (SWC4), to a control (SWC0). We calculated three novel indices: biological activity index (BAI), oxidative stability (OXS), and normalized soil stability index (NSSI). SWC1 and SWC2 reduced soil erosion by similar to 63% and 51% compared to SWC0. Labile C concentration improved by similar to 47, 31, and 15% for SWC1, SWC2, and SWC4 compared to SWCO. SWC1 and SWC2 had 50 and 33% greater recalcitrant C than SWC0, respectively, in the top layer. Considerably higher amount of aggregate associated C was observed with SWC1 and SWC2 than with SWC0. NSSI values of SWC1 and SWC2 were similar to 1.92- and 1.87-fold higher than that of SWC0 in the upper layer. BAI was improved by 1.34-2.65 times under SWC conditions compared to the control. For macroaggregates, OXS of C for SWC1 and SWC2 were similar to 12% higher than that for SWC0 at the surface. Overall, fruit and pasture yield under SWC1 were similar to 51 and 82% higher than SWC0, respectively. System water productivity was similar to 61% higher for SWC1 compared with SWC0. Therefore, staggered contour trenching or continuous contour trenching could be recommended for improving soil structural stability and SOC storage and for reducing soil erosion in degraded lands of semi-arid, dry, tropical regions.

AB  - Early arrival at the breeding grounds for migratory birds is associated with greater reproductive success. According to the condition-dependent arrival hypothesis, only those individuals in superior physiological condition are able to bear the costs (e.g., poor environmental conditions, limited food availability) of early arrival. Condition has usually been measured in terms of energy reserves or mass but other physiological measures of condition such as hematocrit and immune function have been gaining attention. We examined several measures of condition and their association with date of first capture in Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) arriving at breeding grounds in northeastern Pennsylvania. Earlier arrivals had higher hematocrit and H/L ratios and lower lymphocyte counts. Arrival date was also negatively associated with fat score. Fat score was positively related to hematocrit, total number of leukocytes, and number of lymphocytes, but the other hematological parameters were not associated with traditional measures of condition (keel score, fat score, or a body condition index). Our results provide some support for the condition-dependent arrival hypothesis and suggest that there may be immunological differences between early- and late-arriving birds.

AB  - In Poland, land consolidation works are mainly carried out in the southern part of the country. In three administrative regions (voivodships): Lubelskie, Podkarpackie and Malopolskie, in the years 2004-2013, a large number of land consolidation projects were carried out compared to the national average, namely, above 20 thousand hectares in each of the regions. In other three regions (Warminsko-Mazurskie, Zachodniopomorskie, Kujawsko-Pomorskie) there have been no land consolidation projects, although research shows (Jedrejek et al., 2014) that the need for consolidation works is found in all regions. According to Woch and Glazewski (2014), one of the reasons for this is the difficulty in the implementation of land consolidation projects resulting from the need to preserve the valuable natural qualities of the environment in protected areas. The aim of the article is to analyse and assess the natural potential of individual municipalities, as well as to juxtapose the calculated indices against the area size of the already completed land consolidation works. In the article, we attempt to answer the following questions: Is there a relationship between the natural conditions of the municipalities where the consolidation work on agricultural land was carried out, and the area size of the implemented consolidation projects in the studied area? Is the impact of the natural potential of municipalities positive or negative in relation to the on-going land consolidation projects? What are the environmental conditions of the municipalities in which the consolidation of agricultural land was carried out?
   The study involved the query of literature on the subject. Analysis and evaluation of natural conditions was made on the basis of research following a spatial-statistical approach. The potential of the natural environment has been analysed in terms of valorisation of the agricultural production space, analysis of the forest cover (afforestation) index, and the index of protected areas. A synthetic assessment of the natural environment potential index was made, and then Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between the calculated environmental potential index, and the area size of the completed consolidation projects. The research area comprised the Lublin region (Lubelskie voividship). Administrative unit of the municipality served as the primary entity under assessment. The units in which land consolidation projects were carried out in the years 2004-2013 were analysed in detail.
   Research has shown that the potential of the natural environment in the majority of municipalities in the Lublin region has beet determined on the medium level. It has also been shown that there is correlation dependence between the area size of the completed land consolidation projects and the level of the potential of natural conditions. The quality of the natural environment in rural areas is potentially threatened by the intensification of agricultural production, because economic expansion may affect the disappearance of natural habitats and reduce biodiversity. Therefore, preservation of natural potential is antagonistic to simultaneous actions aimed at improving the conditions of agricultural production. On the other hand, the threat to forms of nature protection comes from the lack of modernization of infrastructure in rural areas, including sewage and waste management, which are inseparable activities in the implementation of the land management and agricultural works.

AB  - Transplanted mussels, Mytilus edulis (L.), were used as bioindicators to assess the metal contamination and biological effects of the dredging activities in the harbour of La Rochelle-La Pallice which result in the dumping of sediment in the site of the 'Le Lavardin' located in the vicinity of two economically important shellfish farming zones, Immersion of dredged material appeared to have no influence on the growth of mussels within their first year of development, when compared to the size of individuals sampled from neighbouring farming zones (40 mm), The Dry Condition Indexes calculated from individuals present in the disposal site were similar to those found in mussels sampled from a natural population. After three months of immersion around the disposal site, copper and zinc concentrations were similar to those recorded in individuals from a natural population. In contrast, the cadmium concentration was lower, Mussels from the northern stations of the site exhibited lead contamination, However, the respective roles of both dredged material and coastal inputs in the disposal site could not be distinguished.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of metal stress on the reproduction of dominant species, such as oysters, in seriously contaminated estuarine environments has great ecological implications. In the present study, the reproductive conditions were examined monthly for 1 year in oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis from a heavily metal-contaminated site (Baijiao, mainly by Cu and Zn) in the Jiulong River estuary and a relatively clean nearby estuary (Jiuzhen). Oysters sampled in the contaminated site showed a delayed gametogenesis, a relatively shorter spawning period, and a lower gonad condition index in comparison to the oysters sampled in the reference site. In particular, we found that the proportion of females increased significantly in the contaminated oysters, which provided the first evidence that the feminization in wild oyster populations could be related to trace metal pollution. Additionally, the potential detoxification mechanism of trace metals in oysters was also investigated. Compartmentalization of trace metals in membrane-limited vesicles in hemocytes could be an important detoxification mechanism for the contaminated oysters. Our findings indicated that the long-term metal exposure may greatly influence the reproduction of the oysters and finally affect the recruitment and population of this species.

AB  - Exergo-environmental analysis is essential tool to detect cost-ineffective components and identify thermodynamic improvements which could promote the cost effectiveness of the overall propulsion and power systems. In this study, exergo-environmental index of a turboprop engine is evaluated by using energetic, exergetic and environmental methodologies at dynamic load conditions. Dynamic experimental data of the turboprop engine are obtained for six different torque values (at 240 Nm, 350 Nm, 485 Nm, 552 Nm, 580 Nm and 630 Nm). Results show that the highest component related total environmental impact rate is found at gas generator turbine with the value of 6.42 Pts/hr, while the lowest component related total environmental impact is at combustor as 2.44 Pts/hr at all torques. The highest and lowest environmental impact rates of exergy destructions are found for combustion chamber and power turbine as 31.30 Pts/hr at 630 Nm and 4.94 Pts/hr at 230 Nm, respectively.

AB  - The common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) is a small, nonterritorial, live-bearing lacertid that is sexually dimorphic in several morphological traits (e.g., tail length, snout-vent length, head size). Using microsatellites, we examined paternity in a wild population and investigated whether sexual dimorphism could be the result of intra- or intersexual selection. We found multiple paternity in 65.4% of 26 clutches. There was no evidence of assortative mating. Successfully reproducing males were larger and heavier and had longer tail regenerates or intact tails compared to those that did not reproduce. Tail length and body condition of males were related to the number of offspring sired. However, we found no evidence that head width was related to male reproductive success. We conclude that (1) males with higher body condition index might be more successful in male-male interactions or might be able to search more effectively for females, (2) sex divergence in relative tail length in common lizards reflects the action of sexual selection for male reproductive success, and (3) intersexual dietary divergence could be an alternative hypothesis for head size difference between sexes rather than intrasexual selection.

AB  - Most rivers worldwide are highly regulated by anthropogenic activities through flow regulation and water pollution. Environmental flow regulation is used to reduce the effects of anthropogenic activities on aquatic ecosystems. Formulating flow alteration-ecological response relationships is a key factor in environmental flow assessment. Traditional environmental flow models are characterized by natural relationships between flow regimes and ecosystem factors. However, food webs are often altered from natural states, which disturb environmental flow assessment in such ecosystems. In ecosystems deteriorated by heavy anthropogenic activities, the effects of environmental flow regulation on species are difficult to assess with current modeling approaches. Environmental flow management compels the development of tools that link flow regimes and food webs in an ecosystem. Food web approaches are more suitable for the task because they are more adaptive for disordered multiple species in a food web deteriorated by anthropogenic activities. This paper presents a global method of environmental flow assessment in deteriorated aquatic ecosystems. Linkages between flow regimes and food web dynamics are modeled by incorporating multiple species into an ecosystem to explore ecosystem-based environmental flow management. The approach allows scientists and water resources managers to analyze environmental flows in deteriorated ecosystems in an ecosystem-based way.

AB  - Land hermit crabs play an important role in island ecosystems. They are seed dispersers and debris scavengers in coastal forests to accelerate the decomposition of organic substances. Since the establishment of Dongsha Atoll National Park, Dongsha Island, Taiwan in 2007, researchers have been able to reach the atolls easily and conduct ecological surveys of land hermit crabs. In the current survey conducted from 2013 to 2018 on Dongsha Island, we recorded six land hermit crab species: Birgus latro, Coenobita rugosus, C. brevimanus, C. violascens, C. cavipes, and C. purpureus. Of these, C. cavipes and C. purpureus were newly recorded on Dongsha Island. C. rugosus was the dominant species, with a much larger population than those of other the species. C. rugosus demonstrated no sex ratio bias; however, C. rugosus males were considerably larger than C. rugosus females. Approximately 80% of C. rugosus used the shells ofAchatina spp. and demonstrated the presence of three cohorts. We also provide the body size and weight for condition index of C. rugosus. Surprisingly, three individuals of C. purpureus, the species endemic to Japan, were also recorded. Overall, our study revealed the current situation of land hermit crabs on Dongsha Island.

AB  - A successive 2-year (2019 and 2020) field experiment was conducted in northern Bangladesh (Rangpur district) to observe the status of soil quality and heavy metal risk due to tobacco cultivation in this area. Soil samples were collected randomly from four major sub-districts (Rangpur Sadar, Badargonj, Gangachara, and Mithapukur Upazila) where Mithapukur was a non-cultivating tobacco field and the rests were tobacco-growing fields. Along with heavy metal concentrations, physicochemical parameters were analyzed to observe the progressive change in the soil. Results depicted that values of bulk density, particle density, porosity, soil organic matter (SOM), and major nutrients (N, P, K, S) were decreased in the tobacco-growing field from 2019 to 2020, whereas significant improvement was observed in non-tobacco-growing field at successive year analysis. However, exchangeable bases were raised in the tobacco cultivated field from 40.86 to 52.98% compared to the non-tobacco cultivated field which was in a declining trend (43.66-34.33%). Overall, the soil pollution index depicted that Pb was shown a moderate risk of contamination in 2020. The ecological risk analysis also stated that the tobacco field in Rangpur Sadar was at a moderate risk of soil pollution (RI=126.16), although the non-tobacco field in Mithapukur was at no risk of pollution (RI=45.23). So, it can be recommended that tobacco cultivation harms the soil health, and thus, it should be prohibited from the agricultural field.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are insecticides widely used as seed treatments that appear to have multiple negative effects on birds at a diversity of biological scales. Adult birds exposed to a low dose of imidacloprid, one of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, presented reduced fat stores, delayed migration and potentially altered orientation. However, little is known on the effect of imidacloprid on birds growth rate despite studies that have documented disruptive effects of low imidacloprid doses on thyroid gland communication. We performed a 2x2 factorial design experiment in Zebra finches, in which nestling birds were exposed to a very low dose (0.205 mg kg body mass-1) of imidacloprid combined with food restriction during posthatch development. During the early developmental period, imidacloprid exposure resulted in an improvement of body condition index in treated nestlings relative to controls. Imidacloprid also led to compensatory growth in food restricted nestlings. This early life neonicotinoid exposure also carried over to adult age, with exposed birds showing higher lean mass and basal metabolic rate than controls at ages of 90-800 days. This study presents the first evidence that very low-dose neonicotinoid exposure during early life can permanently alter adult phenotype in birds.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify areas susceptible to drought and under desertification in the Brazilian Northeast, more specifically in the states of Alagoas, Pernambuco, and Sergipe. The study was based on the 2000-2014 time period, relative frequency, Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) dataset derived from MOD13Q1 products (vegetation indices derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor). The areas located within the desertification nucleus of Cabrobo, in the southwestern of Pernambuco and surrounding the Aguas Belas municipality were considered susceptible to drought and desertification. Some municipalities in the countryside of Alagoas showed a very low relative frequency of VCI data (45-50%), and occurrence of areas between 55-60%. Tthe Sergipe state presented a relative frequency VCI data around 50% only in the Poco Verde municipality. Among the areas with low rates of VCI and the most frequently identified in this research, therefore, with greater frequency of droughts, the Southwestern and the Southern Pernambuco hinterlands were not considered as pilot areas by MMA (Brazilian Environment Ministry) in its desertification studies and were included as susceptible for desertification in this study. The results suggest the use of this methodology to subsidize formulations of public policies with application in land use and land cover studies or sustainable development and environmental risk analysis.

AB  - PCBs were determined in wild mussel samples collected in several points from Galician Rias (Rias de Ferrol, A Coruna, Muros, Vigo and Arousa), Spain, during the period 1998-2008. The concentration levels of Sigma PCBs ranged from 0.62 to 107.5 ng g(-1), w.w. The isomer concentrations in the Mytilus galloprovincialis were in the order hexachlorobiphenyls>pentachlorobiphenyls>tetrachlorbiphenyls>trichlorobiphenyls. CBs 153, 138 and 101 congeners were the most abundant in these samples. Two biological parameters, fat content and condition index (Cl), have also been investigated for these mussel samples. Univariate techniques confirm that levels of some compounds. CBs 28, 52, 138, 153, and 180, presented significant relation (p < 0.05) with biological parameters. Multivariate techniques of data exploration such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that spatial trends of PCB levels appeared in the studied samples. Rias de Ferrol and A Coruna presented the highest levels of PCBs and Ria de Arousa the lowest levels of these compounds. In general, temporal trends (linear regressions) showed a decrease of PCB levels along the period 1998-2008. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A qualitative and quantitative study of the gametogenic cycle from natural populations of Perumytilus purpuratus at the localities of Taltal and Huasco was carried out between October 2007 and October 2008. By means of histological analysis a gonadal maturation table was constructed according to the microscopic characteristics. Also the Gametic Volume Fraction (GVF) (% of previtelogenic oocytes, vitelogenic oocytes and mature oocytes), percentaje of interfolicular connective tissue and Gonadic Index (GI) were determined. According to the qualitative analysis, P. purpuratus has a semiannual reproductive cycle starting in January with spawning mainly during spring-summer, even do some winter spawning were detected. However, the quantitative analysis of mature oocytes percentajes found that at Taltal population four spawnings were detected (December, March, July and October) while in Huasco population three spawnings were detected (December, February and September). The relationship between GI with the gametogenic stages and the mature oocyte percentajes were significant at the localities studied. Also significant differences of the condition index between males and females were observed. Along the latitudinal gradient the reproductive cycle of P. purpuratus showed variations according to the timing and synchrony.

AB  - Mile is a region in Yunnan Province, China. The planting-related industry is its pillar industry. Its agricultural population accounts for 59.3% of the total population. Temporal fluctuations of crop price and yield have a significant influence on farmers' revenue. Farmers' selection of crop species, crop planting strategy, and agricultural planting layout according to the market price is important in securing their revenue. In this study, we used a web crawler program to obtain a large amount of data on agricultural product prices from the Internet. Then, the price fluctuation trend of the main economic crops was analyzed by using the K-means clustering method. The net investment yield and the Sharpe ratio were used to compare the economic benefits and investment risks of 10 crops and five cultivation strategies in Mile. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparative advantage index, which integrates the net investment yield, Sharpe ratio, scale advantage index, productivity advantage index, and ecological suitability advantage index, was adopted to comprehensively measure the advantages of crop cultivation. Finally, we propose a spatial-temporal big data analysis model based on the cuckoo search algorithm to optimize the spatial layout of the main crops in Mile in 2017. Based on the comparative analysis of the remote sensing monitoring results and the spatial optimization layout results of the main crops in 2017, several suggestions were given. The results based on agricultural big data analysis, such as crop selection cluster analysis, economic benefit analysis, and crop planting layout optimization, can give suggests to farmers plant suitable crops on right lands, in right time. Thus, it can help farmers stabilize their revenue and minimize the risk by choosing the right crops and planting strategy in accordance with the local conditions.

AB  - Growing interest in zero emission transport modes, such as cycling, is currently generating motivation to construct new cycle paths. However, transportation planners and managers cannot always rely on practical methods for allocating the resources (often limited) needed for inventories and assessing cycling infrastructures. The aim of this study is to develop a method for classifying cycle paths in terms of roughness and general conditions of the pavement surface. Inventory data and information regarding the infrastructure conditions were collected on-site using video recordings taken by an action camera directly mounted on a bicycle. Georeferenced vertical acceleration data were collected using a smartphone. Acceleration data of three different pavement surfaces (asphalt, concrete and concrete bricks) were registered. The results showed the lowest acceleration values for concrete pavement and the highest values for interlocking concrete pavement. The proposed method can be a practical and efficient approach to evaluate cycling infrastructures in terms of pavement condition.

AB  - This study examined the usefulness of soil organic matter (SOM), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total phosphorus (TP) as indicators of resilience in forested wetlands located within southeast Virginia, USA. These data were also examined as standards for reference wetlands before and after timber harvesting and for comparisons of mature and early successional stages. Results indicate that the wetland soils in this study seem to be relatively resilient to perturbation. Soil total phosphorus was significantly greater in the 0- and 0.5-year stages than the 5-, 8-, and 11-year stages (p < 0.05). Although there were no significant differences in SOM, TOC, and TKN levels before and after timber harvest or between early and mature successional stages, there were consistent trends that may prove beneficial in determining reference standards. A Soil Perturbation Index was developed by combining all four parameters for soils collected in the Chowan River watershed to determine extent of deviation from the biogeochemical reference. Using the model developed in this study, biogeochemical functions decrease after harvesting, with the low point reached at approximately 8 to 9 years after human alteration. This index predicts that it would take 16-17 years for SOM, TOC, TKN, and TP to return to pre-harvest conditions. Perturbation indices could be used for assessment of human impacts, restoration projects, and mitigation of wetlands. We maintain that a Soil Perturbation Index can be one useful component of an index of biotic integrity for wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Water ecological civilization is an important component and basic guarantee of ecological civilization. With the comprehensive development of ecological civilization in China, the practice of water ecological civilization village construction has been carried out one after another. The establishment of an evaluation index system of rural water ecological civilization is an important step in the construction of rural water ecological civilization from the theoretical stage to the practical application stage. Based on China's rural water conditions, this study constructed an evaluation index system, including 21 evaluation indicators of seven subsystems: water security, water environment, water ecology, water management, water landscape, water culture, and regional characteristic indicators. The indicator weights are determined by the analytic hierarchy process, a set-pair analysis model is established, and typical rural were selected for instance verification. The results show that the evaluation index system of rural water ecological civilization is reasonable, and the comprehensive evaluation model is also feasible.

AB  - Although riparian buffers established along streams in agricultural landscapes are expected to provide water-quality functions similar to natural ecosystems, few studies have documented specific changes in the condition of aquatic resources resulting from buffer establishment. In 2000 the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, began an extensive cooperative venture under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative to establish riparian buffers on agricultural lands, primarily through United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CPEP). Prior to CREP implementation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) developed a regionally tailored fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for use as a watershed assessment technique in Northern Virginia. Using this regional IBI framework, we evaluated the effects of recently established riparian buffers on aquatic condition. Within the geographic scope of the regional 01, we evaluated all buffer segments planned between 2000 and 2003. Cumulatively during this period, we assessed stream physical condition on 36 buffer sites and 12 reference sites using the NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP); we also assessed the aquatic community at these sites using the IBI. Improvements in stream condition were clearly demonstrated at certain sites within one year of buffer establishment. Although not all buffer projects responded with positive trends, mean SVAP and IBI scores for buffered sites increased over the course of the study, whereas the trend on reference sites was level or slightly downward. We observed positive 01 response at sites with highly disturbed local conditions prior to buffer establishment combined with small, relatively undisturbed watersheds above. Simple solutions such as buffer establishment alone cannot be expected to protect streams from adverse human impacts that occur at a broader scale. Therefore, riparian restoration should be planned and carried out in concert with other conservation practices at a watershed scale in a way that maximizes buffer effectiveness.

AB  - South Africa lacks a commercial oyster hatchery. To inform the sourcing of seed for future hatchery establishments, we compared half-sib Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas cohorts from hatcheries in Namibia and Chile. We measured oyster growth, mortality, condition and feeding organ morphology in Algoa Bay (AB, Eastern Cape) and Saldanha Bay (SB, Western Cape), South Africa, from July 2011 to June 2012. Within SB, 14.3% of mean daily sea temperatures exceeded this species' thermal optimum of 19 degrees C, compared to 50.5% in AB. Food abundance (mean daily chlorophyll a concentration) in SB (7.8 mg m(-3)) was double that in AB (3.9 mg m(-3)) where, presumably to increase particle clearance rates in a relatively phytoplankton-poor environment, oysters had larger gill: palp surface area ratios. Plankton fatty acid profiles (indicators of food quality) differed between locations. In AB, instantaneous growth rates differed between cohorts, and trends varied seasonally. Within both locations, condition index was usually higher in Chilean oysters, whereas shell density was higher in Namibian oysters. In AB only, Chilean seed suffered substantially higher summer mortalities than Namibian seed, suggesting that the latter are more suited to temperatures in AB. AB should also be assessed for culture of the indigenous oyster species that occur there.

AB  - In 2050, which aspects of ecosystem change will we regret not having measured? Long-term monitoring plays a crucial part in managing Australia's natural environment because time is a key factor underpinning changes in ecosystems. It is critical to start measuring key attributes of ecosystems - and the human and natural process affecting them - now, so that we can track the trajectory of change over time. This will facilitate informed choices about how to manage ecological changes (including interventions where they are required) and promote better understanding by 2050 of how particular ecosystems have been shaped over time. There will be considerable value in building on existing long-term monitoring programmes because this can add significantly to the temporal depth of information. The economic and social processes driving change in ecosystems are not identical in all ecosystems, so much of what is monitored (and the means by which it is monitored) will most likely target specific ecosystems or groups of ecosystems. To best understand the effects of ecosystem-specific threats and drivers, monitoring also will need to address the economic and social factors underpinning ecosystem-specific change. Therefore, robust assessments of the state of Australia's environment will be best achieved by reporting on the ecological performance of a representative sample of ecosystems over time. Political, policy and financial support to implement appropriate ecosystem-specific monitoring is a perennial problem. We suggest that the value of ecological monitoring will be demonstrable, when plot-based monitoring data make a unique and crucial contribution to Australia's ability to produce environmental accounts, environmental reports (e.g. the State of the Environment, State of the Forests) and to fulfilling reporting obligations under international agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity. This paper suggests what must be done to meet Australia's ecological information needs by 2050.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of drought stress on 22 chickpea genotypes and one check by analyzing ecophysiological traits in field condition. Field experiments were carried out during 2009-2010 in two separate irrigated and non-irrigated conditions with randomized complete block design in three replications. Yield and yield components (RWC) were measured in each experiment, separately. Drought resistance indices of Relative Water content (RWC) and membrance stability index (MSI) were recorded under rainfed condition. Results indicated that values of studied traits significantly decreased in non-irrigated experiment compared to irrigated one. Correlation analysis revealed that grain yield/plant had significant genotypic and highly significant phenotypic relationship with number of pods/plant, number of seeds/pod, harvest index and biological yield/plant. Therefore, it is suggested that these traits should be used as selection criteria for yield improvement in chickpea.

AB  - The biological integrity of stream ecosystems depends critically on human activities that affect land use/cover along stream margins and possibly throughout the catchment. We evaluated stream condition using an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and a habitat index (HI), and compared these measures to landscape and riparian conditions assessed at different spatial scales in a largely agricultural Midwestern watershed. Our goal was to determine whether land use/cover was an effective predictor of stream integrity, and if so, at what spatial scale. Twenty-three sites in first-through third-order headwater streams were surveyed by electrofishing and site IBIs were calculated based on ten metrics of the fish collection. Habitat features were characterized through field observation, and site HIs calculated from nine instream and bank metrics. Field surveys, aerial photograph interpretation, and geographic information system (GIS) analyses provided assessments of forested land and other vegetation covers at the local, reach, and regional (catchment) scales.
   The range of conditions among the 23 sites varied from poor to very good based on IBI and KI scores, and habitat and fish assemblage measures were highly correlated. Stream biotic integrity and habitat quality were negatively correlated with the extent of agriculture and positively correlated with extent of wetlands and forest. Correlations were strongest at the catchment scale (IBI with % area as agriculture, r(2) = 0.50, HI with agriculture, r(2) = 0.76), and tended to become weak and non-significant at local scales. Local riparian vegetation was a weak secondary predictor of stream integrity. In this watershed, regional land use is the primary determinant of stream conditions, able to overwhelm the ability of local site vegetation to support high-quality habitat and biotic communities.

AB  - Habituation to nonlethal predation stimuli may provide benefits for animals living in areas with frequent encounters with low-risk predators. On the other hand, individuals can be very consistent in their antipredator responses, with shy individuals showing greater degree of responsiveness than bold individuals. However, the link between habituation or boldness and individual benefits has not been thoroughly investigated. We established whether and how two behavioral components associated with antipredator responses (habituation and boldness, and their interaction) would influence body condition, which is a parameter related to fitness. We conducted an outdoor semi-natural experiment with Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica). Individual boldness was consistent across contexts, but we did not find any effect of boldness or the interaction between boldness and habituation on body condition. However, those individuals that habituated more readily to a frequent predatory stimulus were able to increase their body condition more relative to lizards that habituated less. This finding highlights the importance of individual differences in behavioral plasticity, which could influence traits related to fitness. Habituation can provide benefits for individuals exposed to low-risk predators; however, individuals more prone to habituation could also experience mortality costs by wrongly habituating to a dangerous predator.

AB  - This study examined survival, growth rate and biochemical composition of oysters (Ostrea edulis) when transplanted from Aegean Sea to southern Black Sea (Sinop) and maintained offshore in a submerged long-line from December 2008 to December 2009. In December 2009, the mean length and live weight were 92.52 +/- 1.40mm and 109.60 +/- 2.41g respectively. Mean specific growth rate (SGR) was found as 1.29 +/- 0.16%. Meat yield ranged from 7.90 to 11.47%. Mean moisture and ash were 81.40 +/- 0.52% and 9.50 +/- 0.55% respectively. Protein content was between 36.57% and 61.31% with a mean of 50.17 +/- 2.13%, while lipid content was between 4.83% and 10.86% with a mean of 7.74 +/- 0.49%. Carbohydrate content was between 20.88% and 46.89% with a mean of 32.59 +/- 2.38%. The study demonstrated that protein, lipid and carbohydrate were used for different metabolic needs of oysters. Mortality was dependent on physiological stress related to the gonadal activity, temperature and inorganic matter in seawater. Consequently, the low salinity rate has a negative impact on growth rate of oyster. However, there was not a serious adaptation problem in transplanted oysters from Aegean Sea to Black Sea.

AB  - Works in literature proposed the use of the rheological properties of wastewater sludges as an index for conditioner assessment and control. We demonstrated in this work, on the contrary, that one could not justify the consistency of the commonly used rheological characteristics of the sewage sludge samples taken from the same site but at different dates. A physically relevant index was proposed instead for describing the total network strength, which was hypothesized to correlate the dewatering efficiency of flocculated sludge. Based on this index, the network of a sludge was demonstrated to be largely destroyed after shearing, while the relaxation in an unbound environment or mild pouring over action could partially reinstall the structure. Moreover, a uniform shear rate field could produce network of greater strength when compared with that conditioned in a stirred tank. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated whether exposure to low ambient temperature could be used as an alternative to exercise for calibrating heart rate (fH) against rate of oxygen consumption (V) over dot (O2) for subsequent use of fH to estimate (V) over dot (O2) in free-ranging animals. Using the relationship between the oxygen pulse (OP, the amount of oxygen used per heart beat) and an index of body condition (or nutritional index, NI), a relationship between fH and (V) over dot (O2) was established for resting king penguins exposed to a variety of environmental temperatures. Although there was a small but significant increase in the OP above and below the lower critical temperature (-4.9degreesC), there was no difference in the relationship obtained between the OP and body condition (NI) obtained above or below the lower critical temperature. These results were then compared with those obtained in a previous study in which the relationship between fH and (V) over dot (O2) had been established for king penguins during steady-state exercise. The relationship between OP and NI in the present study was not significantly different from the relationship between resting OP and NI in the previous study. However, the relationship was different from that between active OP and NI. We conclude that, at least for king penguins, although thermoregulation does not affect the relationship between resting OP and NI, temperature cannot be used as an alternative to exercise for calibrating fH against (V) over dot (O2) for subsequent use of fH to estimate (V) over dot (O2) in free-ranging animals.

AB  - A comparative study of the reproductive cycle of Ruditapes decussatus under natural (South of Tunisia) and controlled conditions (hatchery). The aim of this study was to describe and compare the gametogenic activity of Ruditapes decussatus in situ and in hatchery. Criteria of maturity were characterized and the positive role of conditioning in the success of artificial reproduction was underlined. Specimens sampled in the South of Tunisia were conditioned at the experimental station of Monastir (Tunisia). The parameters studied were the variation of the condition index and the frequency distribution of oocyte diameters. Results showed that the reproductive cycle was continuous in situ. Gametogenesis started in January and February. Gonadic activity increased from March to November-December. Spawning events occurred irregularly from June to December. In winter conditioning, mature oocytes were produced from March and spawning began in April. The increase in temperature and food abundance shortened the gametogenesis duration; ripe gametes were produced two months earlier compared to natural environment. In summer conditioning, the reproductive cycle was the same as that in the natural site, maturation and spawning occurred simultaneously.

AB  - Bottom sediments are one of the most objective indicators of the ecological state of water body as a whole. Of particular importance is the assessment of bottom sediments quality in the regions subject to intensive anthropogenic load. In the Middle Ob basin, an intensive long-lasting oil production resulting in oil-pollution of bottom sediments takes place. One of the major water bodies used for oil production is Lake Samotlor. In September 2007, the macroinvertebrates were sampled from the Samotlor sediments, which differed in granulometric composition. It is shown that benthos communities of different sediments (sand, silt, mixed sediments) differed significantly in taxonomic composition, abundance and structure of dominant macroinvertebrates. To choose a method for assessing the ecological state of the water body, the correlation of biotic indices with oil concentration in the bottom sediments was determined. It is noted that the Goodnight-Whitley index significantly correlated with oil concentration in all types of bottom sediments except for sands. Indices of diversity correlated with oil only on mixed sediments, the Woodiwiss biotic index - only on sands and silts with detritus. The level of pollution of bottom sediments corresponded to the 3rd class, i.e. "moderately polluted". The decrease in environmental quality (class 4-5) was observed only in the western part of the lake, as well as in some parts of the central sectors. Recommendations on the choice of indices for environmental monitoring of water bodies in the region are given.

AB  - A two-year study was conducted to find how mineral and organic fertilisation and Trichoderma sp. strains influenced the total count of molds, including Fusarium, Alternaria and Trichoderma genera, the biological index of fertility (BIF) and the yield of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). Eleven variants were used in a field experiment conducted on lessive soil: a control sample, mineral fertilisation, organic fertilisation with manure and eight variants with tomato or onion waste composts. Some of them were inoculated with Trichoderma atroviride (T1) and/or T. harzianum (T2 and T3) isolates. The addition of manure resulted in the greatest increase in the total count of moulds in the soil. The highest BIF value was noted in the soil enriched with tomato compost and inoculated with both T1 and T2 strains. The count of Fusarium sp. was reduced the most in the soil fertilised with onion compost with the addition of T1 and T3 isolates. The greatest decrease in the count of Alternaria sp. was observed in the soil fertilised with compost inoculated with the T1 strain. The onion compost inoculated with Trichoderma T1 and T3 resulted in the highest yield of spinach, which was comparable to the one obtained after mineral fertilisation.

AB  - Metacommunity theory is a conceptual framework addressing the interdependence of local interactions and regional processes, especially when it is difficult to relate community structure and the environment at different spatial scales. To test the applicability of this theory to meiobenthos, 27 deep-sea sediment samples from the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed for meiobenthic and nematode community distribution and structure along with a set of environmental variables. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions were found among sampling stations, and some variables, such as depth, inorganic carbon, carbon/nitrogen ratio, bottom-water oxygen, and percentage of sand, proved influential on total community abundance. Nematodes were the dominant meiofaunal group and its abundance highly variable among sites and sampling periods. Nematofauna was dominated by bacterivores, which also possessed the highest maturity index. Environmental characteristics showed a significant relation with community structure, not so the dispersal of nematode genera. In light of our findings, we posit that the deep-sea meiobenthos of the Gulf of Mexico may represent a metacommunity following the "species-sorting model." This inference is based on the different taxonomic structures among sampling stations correlating with environmental differences, in the presence of local niche diversification and limited dispersal.

AB  - Due to their bioaccumulation and biomagnification pathways, inorganic elements can accumulate in high-level aquatic organisms in the food web. Then, this species can be used to monitor the quality of the environment. Blood concentration of nine inorganic elements, including possible toxic metals (An, Cu, Mn, Se, As, Ni, Cd, Pb, and Hg), in 20 males and 20 females from eight different locations with high industry and agriculture activities in Iran were evaluated in this work. Additionally, size, sex, condition index, and locations were also included and analyzed. Among the essential elements, Zn and Se presented very high concentrations (56.14 +/- 2.66 and 8.44 +/- 0.77 mu g/g ww, respectively) in all locations. Regarding possible toxic elements, Pb and Cd presented concerning concentrations as well (0.52 and 0.58 mu g/g ww); this is especially true for Pb, an element found in very high concentrations in tissues of turtles from the same area in a previous study. The sex and the size of the individuals also had significant differences in concentration of Pb, Cd, As, and Hg.

AB  - Pollution in riverine systems, along with its biological effects, may propagate downstream even at considerable distances. We analyzed the organochlorine compound (OC) pollution in a section of the low Ebro River (Northeast Spain) downstream a long-operating chlor-alkali plant. Maximal levels of OCs and of their associated dioxin-like biological activity occurred in residue samples from the plant, and persisted in river sediments some 40 km downstream (Xerta site). Biological analysis at multiple organization levels in local carp (Cyprinus carpio, EROD, Cyp1A mRNA expression in the liver, hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and micronuclei index in peripheral blood) showed a similar pattern, with a maximal impact in Asco, few kilometers downstream the plant, and a clear reduction at Xerta. This combination of chemical, molecular, cellular and physiological data allowed the precise assessment of the negative impact of the chloralkali plant on the quality of river sediments and on fish, and suggests that sediments may be a reservoir for toxic substances even in dynamic environments like rivers.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the water quality of the transboundary Wisznia River (Poland). The environmental state of this transboundary river is described in terms of monthly monitoring data for the main physicochemical and biological parameters. The eight indicators of water quality taken into account included: nutrients (nitrate, phosphorus), salinity, and biological oxygen demand. Long-term water quality data (for 1990-2012), collected from two sample sites was investigated. A substantial decrease in the amount of nutrient substances in the later years can be noticed. This is the result of changes in agriculture and the construction of sewage treatment plants.

AB  - Rodents are small mammals that can be parasitized by various helminths. This study aimed to identify and describe the ecological indicators of infection in rodents captured in fragments of the Atlantic Forest in the western region of Parana State, Brazil. Sixty-eight specimens of five rodent species were collected, necropsied, and inspected in search of helminths. The parasites were stored in 70% ethanol, morphologically identified, and counted for calculation of infection indicators. Fourteen species of helminths and one species of Crustacea were recorded: ten in Akodon montensis, four in Mus musculus, two in Thaptomys nigrita, two in Oligoryzomys nigripes, and one in Euryoryzomys russatus. The registered species of parasites were: Rodentolepis akodontis, Angiostrongylus sp., Protospirura numidica criceticola, Trichuris navonae, Syphacia alata, Syphacia criceti, Syphacia evaginata, Trichofreitasia lenti, Stilestrongylus aculeata, Stilestrongylus eta, Stilestrongylus gracielae, Stilestrongylus franciscanus, Stilestrongylus moreli, Stilestrongylus sp., and Pentastomida gen. sp. A positive correlation between the intensity of infection of T. navonae and T. lenti was observed with the body condition index of the host A. montensis. For all species, this study represents a new register of locality, and for eight of them a new host.

AB  - This purpose of this research was to apply geoprocessing techniques for data acquisition, preparation, georeference, and display for assessing quality standards of forest roads and mapping critical points of the timber transportation, which contribute to support the development of a pavement preventive and ordinary maintenance program. First, the road pavement integrity and condition were assessed by conducting a continuous survey on road defects and estimating the NPRCI (Non-Paved Road Condition Index). The georeferenced dataset, the sampling unit's allocation, and the road network spatial location were conducted using satellite (CBERS-II) and SRTM imagery and GPS field data. The road identification and the assessment of pavement condition were based on a detailed field survey, which revealed the road pavement conditions and derived useful supporting information regarding the most critical parts of the forest road and its defect severity, also pointing out practical measures to fix them, estimating costs for the required road maintenance. The Geoprocessing techniques, GPS, remote sensing dataset, and GIS showed to be efficient tools for identifying, mapping, and quantifying this natural phenomenon in the region being studied and may support the definition of maintenance program of non-paved forest roads. Results showed that the GIS could integrate the dataset containing standards of forest road ordinary operation and maintenance to a geographic database, which subsequently allowed to georeference, manipulate, and display this information on thematic maps.

AB  - Several processes structure the aquatic insect community present in streams at different spatial scales. Local and regional scales drive aquatic communities, given that the water chemistry and river basin status affect species occurrence and population stability. Here, we observed the changes in aquatic insect communities related to environmental drivers, such as anthropic alteration, at different geographical scales. We sampled the insect communities in 110 streams at Brazilian Cerrado, and partitioned the variance explained by spatial and environmental components using a partial redundancy analysis. We used variables related to local and regional environmental conditions. The environment was spatially structured, and only affected the number of genera and community composition. The change in community composition was determined by local environmental conditions, such as pH, electrical conductivity, and conservation of the stream banks. These results suggest that the relationship of number of genera and community composition with environmental conditions is frequently associated with spatial scale. The importance of local environmental conditions in contrast with lack of relationship with regional variables denotes the influence of local determinants for aquatic insects, an emerging pattern of the close selectivity of insect species with their habitat.

AB  - The terrestrial ecosystem productivity (hereafter, TEP) is a key index of global carbon cycles and a fundamental constraint of carbon sequestration capacity, and also an important measure of ecosystem services and food security. However, the TEP has been significantly affected by the long-lasting droughts. Identifying the spatial relationship between droughts and the TEP is crucial for enhancing ecosystem services in China. Here the net primary production (hereafter, NPP) derived from the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model (CASA-NPP) and two drought indices, namely the Standard Precipitation Index (hereafter, SPI) and the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (hereafter, SPEI), are used to examine the spatial relationship between droughts and the NPP in China for the period of 1982-2012. Our main results have shown that: (1) China's annual NPP has increased slowly from 3.82 to 4.35 PgC per year (hereafter, PgC/yr), while droughts have become much severer from 1982 to 2012; (2) on the 3-month timescale, the NPP in arid and semi-arid ecosystems has decreased at a rate of 1.28 TgC per month with per "unit" decrease in the drought index (indicating drier conditions). (3) Overall, the NPP in China has increased 5.71 TgC per month with per "unit" increase in the drought index (indicating wetter conditions); the contribution of this NPP increase is mainly from forests and farmlands; (4) the SPEI is a relatively more effective and sensitive index in representing China's droughts. In southern China, the lagging period for the NPP response to droughts is about 3-month, while a 6-month lagging period is found in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in northern China.

AB  - Evaluating animal body condition is a necessary component of many ecological studies. Although many methods for assessing animal body condition have been developed, relatively few can be used for estimating condition on live animals. Noninvasive body condition scoring techniques have been developed for assessing condition in livestock and more recently such techniques have been applied to wild ungulates. In this study, we examined the reliability of a body condition scoring technique for assessing condition in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). We compared a body condition score (BCS) based on visual assessment and manual palpation of an animal's body to two standard metrics of condition widely used in mammals: kidney fat index (KFI) and haematocrit (HCT). Across all buffalo, BCS was significantly and positively correlated with both KFI and HCT. For HCT, this pattern was observed among adults, juveniles, males and females; and in the wet season but not in the dry season. For KFI, BCS was significantly and positively correlated with KFI among adults, juveniles and males, but not in females. Overall, our results suggest that the BCS technique can serve as a useful method for estimating body condition in buffalo.

AB  - An important issue in the debate about the use and conservation of natural ecosystems is the degree to which these ecosystems and their functions should be considered 'critical'. This paper presents some guidelines to determine the criticality of natural capital, based on two main criteria. The first criterion is the 'importance' of natural ecosystems (ecological, socio-cultural and economic) and the second is the degree of 'threat' based on the quantity and quality of the (remaining) natural areas in a given region. It is argued that the two criteria are complementary and need to be taken into account simultaneously when determining the criticality of natural capital. Finally, the paper presents and discusses some possibilities for the development of a (critical) natural capital index for Europe. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural environments is determined by its molecular composition and reactivity. Redox oscillations are common in the water-level-fluctuation zone (WLFZ) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). As a consequence, the soil DOM released is degraded under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The DOM compounds available for degradation under contrasting redox conditions and the resulting DOM composition still need to be elucidated. By combining laboratory experiments with an in-depth characterization of DOM optical properties, we show that different pathways controlled the depletion and enrichment of the DOM optical components under different oxygen regimes. In particular, 28-day dark biodegradation assays showed that up to 39.5 +/- 4% DOM was degraded under anaerobic conditions, while 55.5 +/- 6% DOM was biodegraded under aerobic conditions. Aerobic biodegradation resulted in a higher aromaticity and degree of humification of the DOM compared to anaerobic degradation. The specific UV absorbance at a wavelength of 254 (SUVA(254)) and biological index (BIX) could be used to track DOM biodegradation under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, the SUVA(254) , BIX and concentration of coloured DOM (CDOM, reflected by a (355)) could track DOM biodegradation, and significant amounts of CDOM could be aerobically biodegraded.

AB  - The physiological significance of biometric body condition indices (bBCI) is poorly understood. We hypothesized that bBCI are composite metrics of nutritional physiology, physical fitness and health. To test this hypothesis, we first compared the performance of eight bBCI, using 434 Southern European carnivores from six species as a model system; and then identified, by non-destructive methods, the hematology and serum biochemistry correlates of three selected bBCI. Fulton's K Index, Major Axis Regression Residuals and Scaled Mass Index were the only bBCI insensitive to the effect of sex and age. The most informative physiological parameters in explaining the variation of these bBCI were the albumin (Effect Size (ES)=- 1.66 to - 1.76), urea (ES=1.61 to 1.85) and total bilirubin (ES=- 1.62 to - 1.79). Hemoglobin and globulins (positive) and cholesterol (negative) were moderately informative (0.9<|ES|<1.5). This study shows that most bBCI do not control for the effect of age and sex in Southern European carnivores. Our results support that bBCI are composite measures of physiologic processes, reflecting a positive gradient from protein-poor to protein-rich diets, accompanied by increased physical fitness. Biometric body condition indices allow the integration of ecologically relevant physiological aspects in an easily obtained metric.

AB  - Human activities have altered the regions natural attributes to a certain extent, leading to the competition of resources. As a result of the contradiction between water use inside and outside the river, the river ecosystems are under increasing pressure. Ecological flow has been proposed to ensure the health of the river ecosystem and habitat integrity. However, there are few special studies on its guarantee rate and lack of systematic analysis. To scientifically evaluate the ecological flow guarantee rate, this study proposed an ecological flow guarantee index for long-time by frequency analysis and an ecological flow guarantee index for short-time by Satisfaction Rate. Taking four typical sections of the mainstream of the Huai River as the research objects, we evaluated the ecological flow guarantee rate at different time scales based on the runoff sequence from 1956 to 2018. It was found that over the mid-long term scale (multi-year series), the guarantee rate of each section during the non-flood period reached 87%, while the guarantee rate during the flood period was about 83%. Over a short time scale (day series within the year), taking typical years of wet, normal, dry, and withered years to calculate the guarantee rate within the year, the average ecological flow guarantee rate reached about 70%. In practice, the joint application of the mid-long term and short-term ecological flow guarantee rate can take into account both long-term planning and short-term regulation, ensuring the sustainable development of river ecosystems in all aspects.

AB  - BACKGROUND The continuous increase of global consumer's dietary behaviors towards reducing meat consumption due to health benefits, ecological, ethical, and social aspects. Texturized vegetable protein (TVP) transformed from plant protein-based ingredient can impart fibrous structure like muscle meat. However, there is limited information on a comparison of product properties of TVP and meats. In this study, the comparison of physicochemical properties, texture, and structure of TVP and different types of meats (beef, pork, and chicken) were investigated.
   RESULTS The nitrogen solubility and integrity index, chewiness and cutting strength of TVP were similar to that of the chicken sample compared to other meats. However, water absorption capacity of TVP (2173.84 g kg(-1)) was significantly higher than all meat samples (1095.37 to 1653.52 g kg(-1)). The color and amino acids of TVP were different from meat samples due to the difference in protein types. TVP showed a fibrous structure with non-uniform air cells.
   CONCLUSION The study demonstrated that some textural and chemical characteristics of texturized vegetable protein under intermediate moisture extrusion exhibited the most similarity to chicken meat. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Industrial and domestic discharge into the coastal environment has driven us to propose an integrated approach to delineate stations contaminated with metals on the Parangipettai coast by collecting sediment and seawater samples monthly at 18 stations from 2015 to 2017. Descriptive statistics revealed that the concentrations of some metals in the sediment and seawater samples were beyond the permissible level. Further, factor analysis showed a sampling adequacy of 0.90 with high positive loading for Ni (0.94), Cd (0.91), Co (0.90), Pb (0.89), and Zn (0.87) in sediment samples. The degree of contamination by metals was evaluated using pollution indices. The results of the contamination index revealed that some stations in the study area were moderately polluted, and those of the ecological index showed that open sea was under low risk while other stations were in the moderate-to-high-risk category. The results obtained are essential to establish the reference condition for a comparative study in similar environments in the tropical regions.

AB  - This study examines the relationship of the reproductive and reserve storage cycles and spat settlement of the Queen scallop (Aequipecten opercularis) to environmental factors. The possibility of farming this species from spat settled on collectors is considered. The gonad condition index shows maximum values between mid-May and early August. Another peak occurs in mid-November. In spring and summer, the energy needed for gametogenesis is derived from food, although it is possible that direct transfer may occur from the digestive gland to the gonad. The glycogen and lipid content of the reserve organs reaches maximum values between late summer and early autumn. The energy requirements related to gametogenesis, which begins in autumn, involve the consumption of accumulated reserves with the resulting reduction in the condition indices. There is a positive correlation between temperature and the condition indices of the digestive gland, the adductor muscle and their lipid and glycogen content, respectively. Two settlement periods were recorded, one in winter, which could not be associated with the spawning of the experimental animals, and another in summer, which coincided with the spawning that took place in spring. The reduced gonad indices recorded at the end of the summer and in winter did not lead to settlement.

AB  - Partial migration occurs in many taxa and ecosystems and may confer survival benefits. Here, we use otolith chemistry data to determine whether fish from a large estuarine system were resident or migratory, and then examine whether contingents display differences in modelled growth based on changes in width of otolith growth increments. Sixty-three per cent of fish were resident based on Ba:Ca of otoliths, with the remainder categorized as migratory, with both contingents distributed across most age/size classes and both sexes, suggesting population-level bet hedging. Migrant fish were in slightly better condition than resident fish based on Fulton's K condition index. Migration type (resident versus migratory) was 56 times more likely to explain variation in growth than a model just incorporating year-and age-related growth trends. While average growth only varied slightly between resident and migratory fish, year-to-year variation was significant. Such dynamism in growth rates likely drives persistence of both life-history types. The complex relationships in growth between contingents suggest that management of species exhibiting partial migration is challenging, especially in a world subject to a changing climate.

AB  - On the south coast of South Africa, the invasive alien mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis shows partial habitat segregation with the indigenous mussel Perna perna. P. perna predominates in the lower mussel zone and M. galloprovincialis in the upper zone, with mixed beds where the two overlap. We examined competitive interactions between these species by translocating mussels into small plots at high densities. Treatments involved different combinations of species and densities placed in each zone. Mortality was monitored regularly and at the end of each experiment, growth and condition index were measured. The experiment was attempted three times. The first two attempts were disrupted by wave action, especially winter storms, but provided information on species-specific effects of wave action. In experiment one, wave induced mortality decreased from a mean for both species of approximately 90% on the low shore to ca. 50% on the high shore, and was 15-30% lower for P. perna than M. galloprovincialis in each zone. In experiment two, M. galloprovincialis mortality was not affected by zone (Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.05), but was higher than P. perna mortality in the low zone (P < 0.05). P. perna survival was significantly (P < 0.05) lower on the high than mid and low zones, apparently due to the effects of greater emersion. Condition index showed a similar pattern, being lowest in the low zone for M. galloprovincialis and in the high zone for P. perna (3-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Growth rates were fastest for both species in the low zone (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05 in both cases). The third experiment was run for 12 months in the low zone only and provided evidence of intraspecific competition for P. perna and of interspecific competition. Condition was significantly greater for P. perna in all treatments (2-way ANOVA), as was growth (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.05). Significant treatment effects indicated that P. perna had a negative effect on M. galloprovincialis survival (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05). Again wave action was important; by the end of the experiment all mussels had been removed from plots stocked only with M. galloprovincialis. Thus P. perna improves survival of M. galloprovincialis on the low shore in the short term, by providing protection against wave action, but excludes it competitively in the longer term. The results show that partial habitat segregation is likely to be a permanent feature on the south coast, with M. galloprovincialis unable to dominate the low shore due to the effects of waves and competitive exclusion by P. perna. This study is the first attempt to examine the mechanisms of interaction between invasive and indigenous marine mussel species and provides evidence of the importance of environmental conditions in the mediation of this interaction.

AB  - Introduction: The exploitation of the sea cucumber (Holothuria (Panningothuria) forskali) in Ria de Vigo (NW Spain) is recent (2015) and it has been done until now with scarce or no information about some key biological aspects as reproduction, recruitment or growth. Objective: To describe the reproductive cycle of H. forskali in Ria de Vigo. Methods: We sampled fortnightly throughout 2018. We calculated gonadal condition indices (GCI) and gametogenic stages by classic histological methods. Results: The reproductive cycle of H. forskali in the Ria de Vigo is characterized by a sexual resting stage during spring, when temperature and daylight hours are lower, the beginning of gametogenesis during swnmer, when temperature is higher, daylight hours longer and the sea bottom is rich in nutrients; then, a period of spawns interspersed with a gonadal restoration during autumn and winter, when temperature is lower and food is scarce. Sex ratio is 1:1, however, the studied population is not synchronized, because females initiate maturation earlier. The comparison of the histological results with GCI indices suggest that GCI is a good indicator for gonadal stage. Fishery management strategies, such as a closure period, must be adapted to the reproductive stage. We recommend avoiding fishing between November and February to increase spawning potential ratio and. consequently, recruitment.

AB  - Genetic architecture of variation underlying male sex comb bristle number, a rapidly evolving secondary sexual character of Drosophila, was examined. First, in order to test for condition dependence, diet was manipulated in a set of ten Drosophila melanogaster full-sib families. We confirmed heightened condition dependent expression of sex comb bristle number and its female homologue (distal transverse row bristles) as compared to non-sex sternopleural bristles. Significant genotype by environment effects were detected for the sex traits indicating a genetic basis for condition dependence. Next we measured sex comb bristle number and sternopleural bristle number, as well as residual mass, a commonly used condition index, in a set of thirty half-sib families. Sire effect was not significant for sex comb and sternopleural bristle number, and we detected a strong dominance and/or maternal effect or X chromosome effect for both traits. A strong sire effect was detected for condition and its heritability was the highest as compared to sex comb and sternopleural bristles. We discuss our results in light of the rapid response to divergent artificial selection for sex comb bristle number reported previously. The nature of genetic variation for male sex traits continues to be an important unresolved issue in evolutionary biology.

AB  - Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) migrations in the eastern Bering Sea have long been ignored. Based on preliminary information, we hypothesized that females undergo an extensive ontogenetic migration, tracking down environmental gradients. We analyzed a 25-year time series of survey data and defined ontogenetic stages in terms of a "shell condition index" calibrated with radiochemical methods. "Pseudo-cohorts" of mature females (groups of females that undergo puberty molt in a given year) "recruit" to the mature female pool in the Middle Domain (50-100 m) of the intermediate shelf. Females undergo puberty molt and primiparous mating in winter. Over the next year, they migrate an average net distance of 73.5 nautical miles towards the shelf edge following a predominantly northeast-southwest direction. Maximum post-terminal molt life span is 6-7 years. Results support the hypothesis that the variable tracked is near-bottom temperature. Although near-bottom temperature fields vary from year to year, the corresponding vector field is a conservative template, which explains the consistency observed in the pattern of migration. Elucidation of the life history schedule of mature female snow crabs in the eastern Bering Sea revealed that it is very similar to that reported for eastern Canada, although patterns of migration may differ substantially between the two systems.

AB  - Despite the growing interest in recreational boating and the increasing number of marinas along the world's coastlines, environmental knowledge of these ecosystems is still very scarce. Detailed data of pollutants in marinas are necessary to provide a global approach of environmental risks in the context of international management strategies. In the present study, a set of 64 variables (30 in seawater and 34 in sediments) were measured to compare marinas from the Southern Iberian Peninsula (SIP). Uni and multivariate analyses showed significant differences among marinas, evidencing the importance of management on a local scale. The most relevant variables determining these differences were turbidity and the biocide Irgarol 1051 in seawater, and granulometry, hydrocarbons and faecal coliforms in sediment. The use of normalization techniques with Al or Fe, and the suitability of different methodologies to measure Total Organic Matter in marinas were also discussed. Additionally, we perform a comprehensive literature review of worldwide marina stressors and develop a simple and straightforward method for assessing environmental quality. The method was tested using SIP marinas and was based on the comparison of 15 selected sediment stressors with background values, concentrations of worldwide sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), and reference conditions/security thresholds established by the programme of coastal waters in port areas (ROM 5.1). A global score was assigned using a new proposed index, Marinas Environmental Pollution Index (MEPI), ranging from 0 to 150 points according to the environmental quality (<90: bad, 90-120: moderate, >120: good). MEPI of marinas from SIP ranged from 60 to 110 points indicating bad or moderate levels of pollution. Environmental quality is one of the decisive factors for awarding eco-labels or eco-certifications, such as Blue Flags in marinas. Therefore, pollution baseline information and environmental tools are mandatory for correct assignation of these awards and necessary for assessing the efficiency of management actions.

AB  - Thirty-nine varieties of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) have been tested from 1981 to 1987 in several locations of the Po valley, Northern Italy. The evaluation of their yield potential and adaptability was based on the following traits:  stalk yield, dry matter percentage and yield, total fermentable sugar percentage and yield.  Emerging varieties were Dale, Keller, M 81 E, Mn 1500, Theis and Rio.  As a mean of several years their stalk yield ranged from 55.5 to 69.7 t/ha corresponding to a dry matter yield from 16.7 to 19.4 t/ha.  Yield of fermentable sugars was from 6 to 8.1 t/ha.  The yield aptitude of the emerging varieties revealed, however, unstable as pointed out by their environmental stability indexes.  The paper also contributes correlation data useful to the definition of a plant ideotype adapted to local conditions of growth and cultivation.

AB  - Prey reconfigure their physiology to avoid costs of prolonged predator pressure. However, these changes might not occur under periodic predation risk, with repeating acute phases. To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.

AB  - The objective of this study is to provide a legal basis for the indicators that make up the Updated Waste Management Condition Index (ICGRA), aiming at mandatory compliance by the public manager in the management of municipal solid waste. The methodology of this study was performed through documentary research with analysis of positive norms and legal principles that could be interrelated to constitute for each indicator the legal basis for their compliance. Since the indicators developed in most studies are not concerned with the legal basis, and since the public administration must be primarily submitted to such legal basis, this becomes relevant, as it provides the indicators with the basis for the requirement of compliance. Of the 62 indicators proposed by ICGRA, 89% were legally based, especially those related to urban cleaning services and solid waste treatment. The work serves the dissemination of the theme in academia, aiming at the importance of the legal basis for indicators of public management evaluation. This, in turn, can be used for environmental and control audits. The study shows an excellent adequacy of the indicators that compose the ICGRA to demand compliance, thus the management indicators can assess the adequacy of municipal solid waste management to the legal commandments.

AB  - A new statistical-dynamical model is developed for estimating the long-term hazard of rare, high impact tropical cyclones events globally. There are three components representing the complete storm lifetime: an environmental index-based genesis model, a beta-advection track model, and an autoregressive intensity model. All three components depend upon the local environmental conditions, including potential intensity, relative sea surface temperature, 850 and 250 hPa steering flow, deep-layer mean vertical shear, 850 hPa vorticity, and midlevel relative humidity. The hazard model, using 400 realizations of a 32 year period (approximately 3,000 storms per realization), captures many aspects of tropical cyclone statistics, such as genesis and track density distribution. Of particular note, it simulates the observed number of rapidly intensifying storms, a challenging issue in tropical cyclone modeling and prediction. Using the return period curve of landfall intensity as a measure of local tropical cyclone hazard, the model reasonably simulates the hazard in the western north Pacific (coastal regions of the Philippines, China, Taiwan, and Japan) and the Caribbean islands. In other regions, the observed return period curve can be captured after a local landfall frequency adjustment that forces the total number of landfalls to be the same as that observed while allowing the model to freely simulate the distribution of intensities at landfall.

AB  - The red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans, is an invasive species, that may potentially induce negative impacts on native turtle communities and freshwater ecosystems. Effective control of invasive species requires knowledge of the process of invasion and the long-term dynamics of an introduced population. However, such studies are scarce. We investigated temporal changes in the species composition of a freshwater turtle assemblage including density and age structure of the red-eared slider turtle at the Kahokugata lagoon of Ishikawa Prefecture in central Japan over 15 years (2001-2003, 2013 and 2015). The number of red-eared sliders increased over time, whereas that of Reeves' pond turtle, Mauremys reevesii, remained flat for 15 years from 2001 to 2015. Data on morphological measurements in the red-eared slider population showed that the proportion of old individuals increased whereas juveniles decreased. Moreover, the body condition index decreased in all age classes. These results suggest that juvenile recruitment was limited in the recent years and thus breeding efficiency was lowered in the red-eared slider population at this lagoon perhaps due to high population density.

AB  - With the general decline of the life support systemon earth, it is of great value to carry out ecological sustainability research. This study used the improved ecological footprint (EF) model to calculate the EF of Tibet and its cities (prefecture-level administrative regions) from2005 to 2017, quantified its ecological sustainability, and analyzed its driving factors using the logarithmic mean divisia index method. The study found that: (1) The EF of Tibet is steadily increasing, yet its distribution among cities is extremely uneven. The size of the internal sub-footprints is different and the distribution is extremely uneven in each city; (2) The ecology of Tibet and other cities is in a safe state, except for Lhasa that is in a completely unsafe state. The ecological footprint diversity index of Tibet, Lhasa, Qamdo, and Shannan showed a downward trend, while the other cities are the opposite. The coordination is deteriorating between the ecological and economic systems of Lhasa and Ngari, while the opposite is for Tibet and other cities; (3) The EF growth of Tibet and its cities ismainly driven by per unit of GDP, population size and footprint structure. The footprint intensity is a decisive factor in slowing downthe growth of EF. This research is helpful for actors at all levels to identify the appropriate strength and type of policies to achieve ecologically sustainable development. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Industrial activities, dam construction, and mining are three human activities important for societal and economic development. However, the effects of these activities on phytoplankton communities have been less quantitatively assessed than those on other groups, such as macroinvertebrates, fish, and periphytic algae. In the present study, we selected the Ganjiang River basin, a tributary of the Yangtze River as the representative area to develop a feasible phytoplankton index of biotic integrity (Phyto-IBI) to evaluate the effects of industrial activities, dam construction, and mining on the biotic integrity of riverine ecosystems. The results showed that the three activities greatly altered the abundance and composition of phytoplankton, with a reduction in phytoplankton species quantity and diversity and an increase in abundance. The health status of the Ganjiang River was fair, and the health statuses of industrial areas, dam areas, mining areas, and reference points were poor, poor, fair, and good, respectively. The three activities damaged the biotic integrity of the aquatic system. Moreover, compared to industrial activities and mining, dam construction is more harmful to aquatic systems in the Ganjiang River. The locally weighted regression scatter plot smoother (LOWESS) method showed that an ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration of 0.65 mg L-1 is the environmental protection threshold for planktonic biotic integrity in the Ganjiang River. This study not only quantitatively assesses phytoplankton responses to industrial activities, dam construction, and mining but also provides guidance regarding the ecological monitoring, assessment and protection of riverine ecosystems.

AB  - The composition and the structure of the ectomycorrhizal (EM) community were investigated in seven European beech coppices, and differing for the year of the lost cut (2-48 years), in Northern Italy. The research was conducted on the spatial and temporal distribution of the ectomycorrhizal species, to study if possible changes in the community could be correlated to the application year of these human practices, together with site variables (site slope, pH, C/N, C-org, N-org, soil moisture, exposure, altitude, and bedrock type). The preliminary results indicated that ectomycorrhization degree significantly changes between the organic and mineral horizons. The ecological indexes of richness and evenness showed significant variations in the sampled sites but were not correlated with either coppicing age or slope. EM species composition revealed a significant correlation with slope and soil moisture but not with shoot age. The coppice treatment seems to he not dangerous for the EM community structure, but additional studies are necessary to understand the possible application of the "short rotation" practices in this ecological context, as a sustainable activity, according to the new trends in European Union energetic policies. An EM resilient condition is supposed.

AB  - The renewable energy emerged as a solution to the environmental problems caused by the conventional sources of energy. Small hydropower (SHP) is claimed to cause negligible effects on the ecosystem, although some environmental values are threatened and maintenance of an adequate water quality should be ensured. This work provides a characterization of the water quality status in a river stretch around a SHP plant on river Lerez, northwest Spain, for four years after its construction. The ecological and chemical status of the water as well as the ecological quality of the riparian habitat, were used as measures of quality. Data were compared with the water quality requirements. The variations in the quality parameters were analyzed over time and over the river sections with respect to the SHP plant elements. Two years after construction, the temperature and dissolved oxygen values achieved conditions for salmonid water and close to the reference condition, while pH values were low. The Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party (IBMWP) index showed a positive trend from two years after the construction and stabilized at "unpolluted or not considerably altered water". Quality parameters did not present significant differences between sampling points. The SHP plant construction momentarily altered the quality characteristics of the water.

AB  - Despite great interest in sexual selection, relatively little is known in detail about the genetic and environmental determinants of secondary sexual characters in natural populations. Such information is important for determining the way in which populations may respond to sexual selection. We report analyses of genetic and large-scale environmental components of phenotypic variation of two secondary sexual plumage characters (forehead and wing patch size) in the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis over a 22-year period. We found significant heritability for both characters but little genetic covariance between the two. We found a positive association between forehead patch size and a large-scale climatic index, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, but not for wing patch. This pattern was observed in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggesting that the population response to NAO index can be explained as the result of phenotypic plasticity. Heritability of forehead patch size for old males, calculated under favorable conditions (NAO index greater than or equal to median), was greater than that under unfavorable conditions (NAO index < median). These changes occurred because there were opposing changes in additive genetic variance (V-A) and residual variance (V-R) under favorable and unfavorable conditions, with V-A increasing and V-R decreasing in good environments. However, no such effect was detected for young birds, or for wing patch size in either age class. In addition to these environmental effects on both phenotypic and genetic variances, we found evidence for a significant decrease of forehead patch size over time in older birds. This change appears to be caused by a change in the sign of viability selection on forehead patch size, which is associated with a decline in the breeding value of multiple breeders. Our data thus reveal complex patterns of environmental influence on the expression of secondary sexual characters, which may have important implications for understanding selection and evolution of these characters.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach is increasingly applied in the context of environmental resources management and impact assessment. Assessments often involve analysis of alternative scenarios for which potential changes in ecosystem services are quantified. For such assessments to be effective there is a requirement to represent changes in ecosystem services supply in a clear and informative manner. Here we compute Ecosystem Services Ratio (ESR), a simple index that quantifies the relative change in ecosystem service provision under altered conditions given the baseline, and the Modified Ecosystem Services State Index, which averages the ESR scores obtained for each ecosystem service assessed, to provide an overall measure of the change. Given that modelling approaches to quantification of ecosystem services often result in production of maps of ecosystem supply, the proposed metrics can be visualized as maps in support to decision making processes. We use these indices to investigate potential changes in the supply of seven modelled ecosystem services resulting from the introduction of a major road development - a highway with associated green infrastructure-into a predominantly agricultural landscape in the UK. We find that the planted woodland, scrubland and grassland can increase the supply of multiple ecosystem services not accounted for in previous green infrastructure studies, although the magnitude of change differs with the type of vegetation, initial conditions and timeframes of the assessment.

AB  - Behavioral ecologists might often benefit by the ability to directly measure an animal's body condition as an estimate of foraging success, and ultimately fitness. Here we compare the reliability and effectiveness of three indices of body condition that have been heavily used in the morphometrics literature. We examined the ratio index (body mass/body size), the slope-adjusted ratio index (based on regression slopes generated from a reference population), and the residual index (the residuals of a regression of body mass on body size). We present the results of tests performed in the field and laboratory on two ecologically and evolutionarily divergent spider species: the vagrant wolf spider Pardosa milvina (Araneae, Lycosidae), and the colonial orb-weaver Metepeira incrassata (Araneae, Araneidae). The ratio index correlated with body size, which weakened the strength of conclusions that could be drawn. The slope-adjusted ratio index requires an independent and large data set with which to generate the expected values, and was likewise sensitive to body size. The residual index, with appropriate transformations to achieve homoscedasticity, was the most reliable index because it did not vary with body size, and we recommend its general use in behavioral studies that require a condition estimate.

AB  - Pelagic fish are key elements in marine foodwebs and thus comprise an important part of overall ecosystem health. We develop a suite of ecological indicators that track pelagic fish community state and evaluate state of specific objectives against Good Environmental Status (GES) criteria. Indicator time-series are calculated for the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive "Celtic Seas" (CS) and "Greater North Sea" subregions. Precautionary reference points are proposed for each indicator and a simple decision process is then used to aggregate indicators into a GES assessment for each subregion. The pelagic fish communities of both subregions currently appear to be close to GES, but each remains vulnerable. In the CS subregion, fishing mortality is close to the precautionary reference point, although the unknown dynamics of sandeel, sprat, and sardine in the subregion may reduce the robustness of this evaluation. In the North Sea, sandeel stocks have been in poor state until very recently. Pelagic fish community biomass is slightly below the precautionary reference point in both subregions.

AB  - The advantages of quantitative ultramorphological (QUM) sperm analysis in the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility are presented. The QUM methodology is based on three elements: complementary scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations of 7 sperm cell subcellular organelles (acrosome, postacrosomal lamina, nucleus, neck, axoneme, mitochondrial sheath, and outer dense fibers); systematic classification of the specific ultramorphological malformations into 4 pathological and the normal categories, indicating the morphological stale of each subcellular organelle; and comparison between well-defined reference groups with opposite fertility status or treatment conditions. QUM has established 2 indices for the in vivo and in vitro male fertility potential: (1) Natural Fertility Index (NFI), with accurate prediction (97% sensitivity and 90% specificity) of 80% of the male patients; and (2) IVF score, with prediction of 76% of the nonfertilizing and 90% of fertilizing IVF groups. QUM has enabled assessment of ultramorphological indications for varicocele and radiation exposure. Varicocele causes defects in sperm head organelles related to early spermatid development, whereas ionizing radiation causes amorphous head shape. QUM established criteria for specific non-in-vitro therapeutic interventions, including varicocelectomy, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) administration, and acupuncture. The varicocele index enabled correct classification of 79 and 89% of patients with and without varicocele. Males with idiopathic impairment of sperm acrosome and nucleus are potential responders to FSH treatment, whereas patients exhibiting low sperm activity are candidates for acupuncture treatment. Patients with a low Natural Fertility Index are recommended for an assisted reproduction technique (ART), based on the ultramorphology of the tail axoneme. Patients who achieved pregnancy following intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization and those whose wives conceived only following intracytoplasmic sperm injection were classified with accuracy of 78 and 74%, respectively. QUM sperm analysis is clinically informative, nontraumatic, and cost-effective, and is recommended when the male infertility factor cannot be clearly diagnosed by routine tests prior to first ART trial.

AB  - Food limitation and exploitative competition were implicated in two experiments on lotic grazers in eastern Tennessee. In a laboratory feeding experiment, grazing snails (Elimia clavaeformis) and caddisfly larvae (Neophylax etnieri) from upper White Oak Creek (WOC) grew 7 and 2 times faster, respectively, on a diet of high-biomass periphyton than they did on a diet of WOC periphyton. When fed on the high-biomass periphyton, both grazers accumulated disproportionately more neutral lipid, and snails increased their mean condition index 50% (ash-free dry mass per unit wet mass). Growth and condition of grazers fed WOC periphyton in the laboratory were quite similar to growth and condition in situ, indicating that laboratory conditions were realistic. Analysis of gut contents demonstrated considerable dietary overlap between the two taxa regardless of periphyton diet and suggested that quantity rather than quality of periphyton limited grazer growth and condition in WOC. In a natural experiment, periphyton and Neophylax from six streams containing Elimia were compared with periphyton and Neophylax from six streams that lacked Elimia. Periphyton biomass, Neophylax diapause mass, and Neophylax lipid content were substantially greater in streams lacking Elimia, implying that the snail created or exacerbated food-limiting conditions for Neophylax.

AB  - The effects of environmental parameters (temperature, feed, stocking density and light levels) on juvenile growth of White's seahorse, Hippocampus whitei, were examined over 107 days. Growth rates in animals stocked at about 3 months old increased with increasing temperature from 0.14 mm day(-1) at 17 degreesC to 0.26 mm day(-1) at 26 degreesC. Several body condition indices fell with increasing temperature, possibly as a result of increased metabolic rates at higher temperatures. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) fell from 4.44 at 17 degreesC to 2.67 at 26 degreesC. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) peaked at 20 degreesC, indicating that the optimal temperature for reproduction was 20 degreesC. The seahorses became mature at 6-7 months old. The use of Artemia enriched with DC Selco(R) improved growth rates over non-enriched Artemia, but did not affect the condition indices. There were no major effects of stocking densities (range 0.5-1 seahorse l(-1)) and light levels (range 24-136 muE m(-2) s(-1)) on growth over the limited range tested, but there was an indication that reproduction might be inhibited at stocking densities greater than 1 seahorse l(-1).

AB  - The Ayuquila-Armeria river basin is within the priority basins classification in Mexico, given its high diversity, and due to its high degree of functional dynamics alteration and levels of social pressure it presents; therefore, it is necessary to carry out an analysis of water quality within the basin. The objective was to evaluate organic contamination, carrying sampling campaigns in two seasons, one in the rainy (2015) and the other in the dry (2016) season, at 18 sites in the basin, through the implementation of a comprehensive analysis of physicochemical and biological variables. According to PTotal concentrations, 90% of the sites presented eutrophication, exceeding 77% of them the permissible limit for NTotal concentrations. The IIB showed that 19% of the sites present a high degree of organic contamination, with highest CFU concentrations (18 to 190 CFU / mL) found in the rainy season and 50% of the sites exceeding the permissible limit (10 CFU / mL). The influence of tributary influents to the main channel increases drastically in the rainy season, increasing flows and impoverishes the surface water quality by pollutants carryover from rural and urban areas.

AB  - In order to evaluate the environmental condition of the Barra Bonita Reservoir, we adapted the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). We chose 24 sampling sites in which three types of habitats were sampled: the mouths of tributaries, the central reservoir and the lateral reservoir. Fish were caught in two seasons (dry and rainy) using 10 gillnet gangs, with meshes ranging from 3 to 12 cm between opposite knots, and funnel traps. Abiotic and biotic variables were measured. Due to the artificial nature of the reservoir, the term biotic integrity was considered inappropriate and the term RFAI (Reservoir Fish Assemblage Index) was adopted. Twelve metrics from sixteen possibles were selected using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The reference conditions were set up based on the criteria of the best condition observed. For each metric, a score of 1, 3 or 5 was assigned as it strongly departs (1), slightly departs (3) or approaches (5) the reference condition. The index value is the sum of the metrics partial scores and ranges from 12 to 60. To evaluate the importance of the unit of measurement of the metric, the index was calculated in fish number (RFAI(N)) and in weight (RFAI(w)). The correlation between RFAIN and RFAIw was very high (r = 0.90, n = 46) indicating that the unit of measurement does not influence the final result of the index. Most of the sampling sites were classified in the 'reasonable' RFAI category. Only the central sites were classified as 'poor'. To validate the RFAI, another index, the Habitat Quality Index (HQI), was built starting from the physiochemical and habitat variables collected. The correlation of the RFAI with the HQI was highly significant (RFAIN, r = 0.37; RFAI(w), r = 0.47; n = 46), indicating that they respond in the same way to environmental degradation. The HQI metrics which most affect RFAI were depth, surrounding landscape and macrophyte presence/absence. Copyright C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents the investigations of exhaust emissions under actual operation of two rail vehicles: a track geometry vehicle and a clearance vehicle. The environmental assessment of this type of objects is difficult due to the necessity of adapting the measurement equipment and meeting the safety requirements during the tests (particularly regarding the distance from the overhead electrical lines). The authors have proposed and developed a unique research methodology, based on which a detailed exhaust emissions analysis (CO, HC, NOx, and PM) was carried out. The complex assessment included the unit and on-track exhaust emissions. In the analyses, the authors also included the operating conditions of the powertrains of the tested machinery. The obtained environmental indexes were referred to the homologation standards, according to which the vehicles were approved for operation. Due to the nature of operation of the tested vehicles, the authors carried out a comprehensive environmental assessment in the daily and annual approach as well as in the aspect of their operation as combined vehicles, which is a novel approach to the assessment of the environmental performance of this type of objects.

AB  - 1. The effects of natural and human-induced variability on the composition of macroinvertebrate communities of 28 ponds located in the North Iberian Plateau (Spain) were studied to determine the best predictors of community structure.
   2. Constrained ordination was used to identify the main factors explaining the among-pond variance in abundance (as catch per unit effort) of total macroinvertebrate and Chironomidae assemblages and trophic structure (functional feeding groups).
   3. Variance partitioning showed that human disturbance (represented by a pond condition index, total phosphorus concentration and pesticides) was the best predictor of macroinvertebrate community structure, whereas factors, such as habitat and biotic variables were of secondary importance. Factors controlling the chironomid community were broadly similar to those acting on the whole community of macroinvertebrates. In contrast, trophic structure was mainly determined by habitat and biotic variables.
   4. Our results show that macroinvertebrates may be used as effective indicators of the ecological status of Mediterranean ponds. The Chironomidae deserve special attention because they were the dominant group in the study ponds and the strongest explanatory variable for their distribution was degradation.

AB  - Bioaccumulation and biological effects of pollution were assessed in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) caged for one month at three sites in the Oiartzun estuary (south-eastern Bay of Biscay, Spain) with the aim of evaluating their usefulness within the investigative monitoring defined in the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). The highest concentrations of organic contaminants determined in mussels' tissue were detected towards the inner part of the estuary but no gradient pattern was found for metal bioaccumulation. Population fitness responses measured as condition index, stress on stress and gonad index were similar in all caged mussels and did not follow the organic pollution gradient. However, biomarkers determined at tissue, cell and protein level (histopathology, micronuclei frequency, malondialdehyde levels and vitellogenin-like protein levels) revealed a higher stress syndrome at the inner part of the estuary showing signs of genotoxicity, oxidative stress and endocrine disruption. Overall, the integrated chemical-biological approach in connection with mussel caging technique proved to be a useful tool to assess environmental pollution, allowing a better understanding of the cause-effect relationship within the investigative monitoring defined in the WFD.

AB  - P>Chestnut blight caused by Cryphonectria parasitica has recently been reported from Guilan province, the only region with natural chestnut (Castanea sativa) stands in Iran. During the past few years, chestnut stands in Iran have been seriously threatened by the fungus, incidence of the disease is increasing and vast canopies are reduced to sprouts. As yet, there is no report on the disease distribution and severity in this region. Six sites from three main growing regions of chestnut in Guilan province were selected for investigation. We report occurrence and evaluation of the damage of the disease caused by C. parasitica. To evaluate the scale of damage, the investigated trees were classified into six categories based on the degree of crown damage, the number of canker wounds and the presence of the fungus. Index of health condition was calculated for all sites. During this study, a total of 250 isolates of Cryphonectria species were obtained, of which 232 isolates were C. parasitica and 18 were Cryphonectria radicalis. Castanea parasitica was observed in all regions. Index of health condition was scored from 0 to 6 with 0 being disease free and six being the most severe infection. Index results in the investigated sites varied between 0.69-5.45 and 0.93-5.55 for years 2006 and 2007, respectively. The highest damage was found in Doran (I-H = 5.55), which is located some 100 km away from Shahbalutmahalleh, the site with lowest damage (I-H = 0.93). This is the first extended report on aspects of chestnut blight in Iran.

AB  - The lack of data relating to basic life-history and population dynamics is one of the gaps to be filled in order to develop a proper strategy for the conservation of the Sicilian Pond Turtle (Emys trinacris). In this study, we present the results of the first year of a multi-annual monitoring program focusing on a specific wetland area, located within the "Lago Preola e Gorghi Tondi" Nature Reserve (Sicily, Italy). The sub population size was estimated with capture-recapture method at 719 +/- 47 turtles, with a mean density of 239.7 +/- 15.7 ind./ha. The overall sex ratio of the captured individuals was males-biased (2.9 : 1) but also a significant differences between spring and summer was found. We discuss this finding in relation to differential reproductive strategies of the sexes, with the support of data on movements and on body condition. The importance of a multi-year monitoring approach is underlined in order to get a better understanding of the factors that affect the population ecology.

AB  - Hydro-climatic changes and the increasing release of pollutants into rivers by human activities tend to affect the quality of watercourses, to alter aquatic ecosystems and to reduce the amount of useable water. The ecological and chemical states of rivers and their evolution is thus of growing concern. In Europe and Switzerland, water policies are progressively shifting towards a holistic approach of river systems. The European Commission notably established a framework to highlight rivers' ecological deficits and to enhance regional or local water management plans. In Switzerland, a similar framework is currently under development. In this paper, both procedures are compared and implemented in a Swiss catchment dominated by agricultural activities. The aim is to define the challenges that still need to be addressed to assess and sustain river health. The hydromorphological, ecological, and ecotoxicological quality of the river was evaluated. Both frameworks highlighted the fact that no section of the river can currently be classified as being in a good environmental state and that the state deteriorates as tributaries and wastewater discharge flow into the main riverbed. Chemical issues and water quality changes due to hydro-climatic variations and management strategies were also pinpointed. Both frameworks are thus useful tools to survey changes in rivers quality in space and over time. However, challenges remain regarding the appropriate strategies to monitor and analyze chemicals, the definition of target values and conditions, the evaluation and integration of human-induced pressures, and the overall evaluation of the state of a river. The development of integrated indicators or of ecosystem services approaches is considered as a potential solution to explore river health and to define efficient restoration measures by water managers.

AB  - Nonperennial streams are often excluded from biomonitoring programs because of inadequate knowledge about their biological and hydrological characteristics and variability. The ability to apply bioassessment indices to nonperennial streams would greatly expand the reach of biomonitoring programs. We sampled 12 nonperennial streams (3 of which were minimally stressed) in the San Diego hydrologic region multiple times to assess whether a benthic macroinvertebrate assessment index (the Southern California Index of Biotic Integrity [IBI]) developed for perennial streams could be used in nonperennial streams. We also sampled 3 minimally stressed perennial streams. Continuous water-level loggers and repeated site visits revealed that hydrologic regimes varied considerably among streams. Gradual drying was evident at some streams, and multiple drying/rewetting events were evident at others. Moreover, streams that were nonperennial in one year were perennial in another. IBI scores from low-stress nonperennial streams were similar to those for low-stress perennial streams, and false indications of impairment (i.e., low IBI scores) were never observed. Furthermore, IBI scores declined as stress increased, suggesting that the IBI responded as expected in nonperennial streams. IBI scores were stable at most sites within and between years, but midsummer declines were observed at high-stress sites. These declines were associated with declines in discharge, fast-water habitat, and increases in sands and fines and macroalgae cover. These findings suggest that an assessment tool developed for perennial streams can be used to assess condition at certain nonperennial streams, and that biomonitoring programs can provide more comprehensive watershed assessments by including nonperennial streams in their surveys.

AB  - Semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands are unique ecosystems sheltering high biodiversity. In the last decades, the expansion of irrigated lands has led to hydrological imbalances in Mediterranean catchments, causing wetland degradation. Vegetation composition assessment is considered an important tool for evaluating wetland ecological condition and can be mapped using remote sensing. This study aims to develop a condition index based on plant community composition suitable for semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands, as well as to test the applicability of airborne multispectral remote sensors for discriminating plant communities. Characteristic plant communities of 12 wetlands were identified by means of ordination and classification analysis of plant taxa cover percentages obtained through fieldwork sampling. An index for assessing wetland ecological condition was developed based on the relationship between wetland plant community composition and watershed hydrological condition. Selected wetland plant communities were then mapped by means of remote sensing techniques using random forest algorithm for supervised classification of airborne images. Following this methodology, remote sensing served as a tool for wetland condition assessment at a regional scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, particularly in deserts where resources and biodiversity are limited, may affect the delicate balance that enables an organism to exist in its environment. In this study, we investigated the impacts of human disturbance and the resulting changes in vegetation composition on activity, thermal biology, and body condition index of the Egyptian spiny-tailed burrowing lizard, Uromastyx aegyptia. Thirty-six adult U. aegyptia, were radio-tracked twice per week inside and outside protected habitats in the Kuwaiti desert. Vegetation composition, richness, abundance and density were surveyed in 115 plots randomly selected close to the active burrows and in the interspace areas. The high percentage of browsing on certain species such as Cyperus conglomeratus, Moltkiopsis ciliata, Rhanterium epapposum, and Convolvulus oxyphyllus may indicate that these species are characterized by high palatability and nutritional values for livestock and wild animals including dhubs. Dhub burrows were closer to each other inside the protected sites than outside of the protected sites. While habitat protection provided more vegetation and refuge to the dhubs and greater body mass at the beginning of the active season, it had little effect on seasonal changes in body mass and surface activity times of dhubs.

AB  - The environmental relative moldiness index (ERMI) metric was previously developed to quantify mold contamination in U.S. homes. This study determined the applicability of the ERMI for quantifying mold and moisture damage in Finnish residences. Homes of the LUKAS2 birth cohort in Finland were visually inspected for moisture damage and mold, and vacuumed floor dust samples were collected. An ERMI analysis including 36 mold-specific quantitative PCR assays was performed on the dust samples (n = 144), and the ERMI metric was analyzed against inspection-based observations of moisture damage and mold. Our results show that the ERMI was significantly associated with certain observations of visible mold in Finnish homes but not with moisture damage. Several mold species occurred more frequently and at higher levels in Finnish than in U.S. homes. Modification of the ERMI toward Finnish conditions, using a subsample of LUKAS2 homes with and without moisture damage, resulted in a simplified metric based on 10 mold species. The Finnish ERMI (FERMI) performed substantially better in quantifying moisture and mold damage in Finnish homes, showing significant associations with various observations of visible mold, strongest when the damage was located in the child's main living area, as well as with mold odor and moisture damage. As shown in Finland, the ERMI as such is not equally well usable in different climates and geographic regions but may be remodeled to account for local outdoor and indoor fungal conditions as well as for moisture damage characteristics in a given country.

AB  - In the present study we compared meat yield, proximate chemical composition and fatty acid profile of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis from rocky shores and long line cultures in San Jorge Gulf, Argentina. Moisture, ash, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates were quantified. The fatty acid profile was analyzed by gas chromatography. Mussels from rocky shores had lower meat yield than cultured mussels. The proximate chemical composition was different between the mussels of the two environments. Mussel meat was characterized by high moisture content, with higher moisture in mussels from rocky shores. Proteins were the main biochemical component, followed by carbohydrates and lipids. Regardless of the origin of the mussels, meat mussel was characterized by higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids than that of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Atherogenic index was lower in cultured mussels, while thrombogenic index was similar in both groups of mussels. Differences in proximate chemical composition between mussels from rocky shores and cultures are related to the habitat in which they grow, which determines differences in the amount and quality of food and in maintenance costs.

AB  - The growth and survival of 5, 7, 9, and 11-mm juvenile blood cockle (Anadara inaequivalvis) cultured in suspended nets in Sufa Lagoon, Izmir, Turkey, were investigated. Shell length, width, and thickness and total weight were measured monthly during May 2007-May 2008. Temperature was measured every 6 h. Salinity, chlorophyll a, particulate organic matter, particulate inorganic matter, and total particulate matter were followed every two weeks. Mean increases were 16.68 and 13.46 mm and 3.62 and 5.74 g for small and large spat, respectively. Length increased significantly faster in small cockle than in large cockle (p < 0.05). Survival was 65% and 100% in small and large cockles, respectively (p < 0.05). Von Bertalanffy growth parameters L infinity (27 mm) and k (0.28/month) showed that growth performance (phi' = 3.22) was greater than for other species in the natural population. Slope b from the length-weight relationship was 3.098 +/- 0.115, indicating significantly better allometric growth (p <= 0.05). Results indicate that A. inaequivalvis is a good candidate for suspended aquaculture in the Sufa Lagoon, Turkey.

AB  - The enzymatic antioxidant defences of mammalian cells include copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Cu Zn-SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) which catalyses the dismutation of superoxide anions (O-2(.-);-) to hydrogen peroxide ((HO2)-O-2) and a seleno-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) (GSH-px; EC 1.11.1.9) which catalyses the degradation of (HO2)-O-2 to (HO)-O-2 and O-2, The measurement of these enzyme activities is often used as a possible biological index of oxidative stress in various clinical conditions, Complete understanding of such information requires knowledge of the random biological fluctuation of the enzyme activity which occurs in each individual, In the present investigation we examined this normal variability in 12 healthy volunteers (four women and eight men) aged 23-45 years, over 6 months, The intra-individual coefficients of variation (estimated using analysis of variance techniques) were 15% (SOD) and 13% (GSH-px). The analytical goal for imprecision was achieved for both enzymes, i.e. it was less than one half of the measured intra-individual variation, Both enzymes showed marked individuality, indicating that an individual's reference values are more useful than population-based data, The critical difference required for significant changes in serial results is 45% for SOD and 40% for GSH-px.

AB  - Fossil planktic foraminifera is a useful indicator of the paleoenvironment of the surface ocean. Because of its susceptibility to dissolution, various indices for preservation state of planktic foraminifera have been used to determine better the degree of bias introduced by the species-dependent resistance to dissolution. This study aims to evaluate six dissolution indices of foraminifera from four Pacific sites, each representing different surface and deep ocean condition. Compared to the fragmentation rate (F-LS), demanding and time-consuming but one of the most reliable dissolution indices regardless of the ambient environment, each index has different sensitivity on preservation state owing to the environmental factors. Carbonate fraction (CaCO3) and coarse sized fraction (CSF) are fairly well correlated with F-LS in the foraminifera-dominated tropical ocean where the influx of other sedimentary components is insignificant. The assemblage dissolution index (FDX) and percentage of resistant species (Res) based on the relative enrichment of dissolution-resistant species are best applicable at the central equatorial Pacific site without any significant changes in the primary faunal assemblage. The benthic/planktic ratio (B) varies with F-LS similarly at a productive Northwestern Pacific site, but should be carefully applied in many cases owing to the strong dependence of benthic foraminifera on food availability. The results of this study suggest the importance of rigorous application criteria of the foraminifera dissolution index in various depositional environments.

AB  - An environmental evaluation was performed at 16 subdivision sites within four communities in east-central Michigan. The primary objective was to evaluate the fit between environmental ordinances and the physical/environmental conditions to which they were applied. An environmental response index was developed with indicators to assess water, soil, slope, development density, roads, vegetation, and ecology. Water-related indicators achieved the highest scores, while soil-related indicators scored the poorest, with generally poor performance across all indicators, The poor performance indicates there are problems in the ability of environmental ordinances developed at broader jurisdictional scales (e.g., the state) to address the existing environmental conditions at smaller geographic scales (subdivisions within communities). Two key problems include the lack of scientific specificity in the broader state-level ordinances and the lack of local expertise and/or resources to monitor the environment.

AB  - The determination of a sustainable level of extraction is a challenge to water reform and planning, especially where information on environmental assets is sparse, and where future flow regime is threatened by irrigation and climate change. Hamstead (2009) considered a catchment to be over-allocated and/or overused if projected changes in freshwater flow posed a medium or higher level of risk to key ecological assets. The present paper investigates Hamstead's (2009) two-step risk analysis process by using the Coal Pitt Water Catchment in Tasmania, Australia, where the Ramsar-listed Pittwater-Orielton Lagoon was identified as the key ecological asset. Although Hamstead's (2009) approach revealed over-allocation and/or overuse, several limitations emerged. In particular, setting the current condition as the baseline ecosystem condition, rather than that at the time of Ramsar listing, permits over-allocation and/or overuse to continue and contravenes international, national and state obligations. Projections could be improved by inclusion of a river condition index and hydrological indicators such as proportion of total natural flow retained, frequency of estuary flushing, and percentage of median annual flow impounded. Available ecological information and projected hydrological change should be included in determining the threat to environmental assets because statutory obligations require strategies to manage processes that threaten species and communities.

AB  - The aim of the article. The paper describes the particularities of construction of scientific and methodical approach to the environmental risk assessment for different types of economic activity in Ukraine.
   The result of the analysis. It was roved that the environmental risk assessment in the current economic conditions must be taken into account at the same time not only the probability of occurrence of adverse events and the possible level of damage caused by their implementation, but also the degree of deviation from the desired outcome and costs of economic agents aimed at environmental protection. The integrated consideration of the above aspects provides an assessment of all quantitative characteristics by which it is possible to describe environmental risk, namely: environmental pollution indicators, the volume of losses that occur in case of disturbance of the requirements of environmental legislation and indicators of the characteristics of nature protection measures.
   It was found that the modern methodological basis for assessing environmental risk should be based on a comprehensive description of aspects, namely: the volume of environmental pollution (from stationary and mobile objects) within each type of economic activity; the extent of damage to the ecosystem of the country or region, as well as to its citizens; levels of non-attainment of environmental risk to the maximum value, as well as tools that minimize this risk within the limits of the magnitude of preventive measures.
   It was proposed the qualitative grading of the levels of environmental risk in terms of types of economic activity that allows to determine the existing degree of danger and to form the most priority measures to minimize environmental risk. It was determined that the formalization of environmental risk must include three components: the probability of adverse events, the monetary evaluation of losses, the degree of deviation from the desired result, and it should be adjusted to the level of environmental protection measures. Mathematical formalization of the proposed complex index evaluating the environmental risk for different types of economic activities consists of five stages: 1) forming the input array of relevant indicators of environmental risk characteristics; 2) bringing the test indicators of environmental risk assessment of comparable type using the normalization of Harrington; 3) the formation of normalized integral index of environmental risk evaluation in the region in terms of characteristics of contamination volumes; 4) calculating the environmental risk assessment as a quantitative estimation of the measure of deviation from the desired result and their normalization by the Harrington method; 5) adjustment of integral index of environmental risk assessment for capital investments and operating costs in the line of environmental protection measures. A practical level of identification of environmental risk for different types of economic activity in Sumy region was performed.
   Conclusions. It was established that such production facilities as JSC Sumykhimprom (chemical industry), JSC SNVO (engineering), subsidiaries of JSC Ukrnafta (oil refining industry) and numerous farm enterprises execute a basic destructive impact on the ecology of the region. In turn, public utilities of electrical and water supply also contaminate the environment a lot, which is a common problem for Ukraine and is unacceptable for state-owned enterprises.
   The implementation of the proposed scientific and methodological approach showed that the highest level of environmental risk in the Sumy region is for mining industries, the development of quarries, as well as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, while the least dangerous are public administration and defense, and social insurance.

AB  - Multi-year results of research of Miscanthus x giganteus cultivation in several parts of Ukrainian Forest-Steppe zone: western, central, and left parts are presented. The weather conditions at four research sites, based on the meteorological data for years 2011-2015 were analysed. Two subzones of unstable and insufficient rainfall distribution were selected. The influence of climatic conditions to Miscanthus x giganteus production was evaluated. The equation of the regression of yield dependence on hydrothermal coefficient and planting density was calculated. It was established that the indexes of environmental conditions in observed climate zones of Ukraine varied from - 0.41 to 0.29 conventional units. The proposed approach provided the opportunity to predict the yield and energy output of Miscanthus x giganteus when the data of planting density are known.

AB  - Condition indices are widely used in the evaluation of fish populations, but most research on the relationship of condition indices to body composition has taken place in laboratory environments. Our objectives were to assess the relative ability of measures of size and three versions of condition index to predict the lipid content of fingerling walleyes Sander vitreus from aquacultural or natural environments. Fingerlings were either intensively cultured through the fall of 1994, were stocked and spent 3-4 months at large in four lakes, or were intensively cultured and maintained overwinter in hatchery ponds. Variation in condition indices accounted for less than 35% of the variation in lipid. No index performed substantially better than the others. The relationship of condition to lipid content was not consistent between environments or seasons (ANCOVA: F = 403.4, P < 0.0005). Relationships were also different among the four lake populations (ANCOVA: F = 33.9 P < 0.0005). Inconsistencies seem to be the result of differences in seasonal and environmental stress. The utility of condition indices as surrogates for body composition should be verified with each use. Furthermore, comparisons of fingerlings from aquacultural environments with fingerlings from natural environments are unlikely to be physiologically meaningful.

KW  - USA
AB  - The Ohio River fish community was sampled three times (June, August, and October) in 2005 by electrofishing near 17 power plants encompassing nearly the entire length of the Ohio River (river kilometer 82-1,527). Six 500-m zones were electrofished at each plant. Using a generalized additive model, we examined this data set of 306 electrofishing samples to determine how the abundance of 31 taxa varied over the length of the river. We also looked for trends in several measures of community health (catch rate, species richness, index of biotic integrity, and modified index of well-being). Of the 31 taxa examined, all but three showed longitudinal differences over the course of the river. Based on the patterns for the 31 taxa and 5 community measures, we assigned each taxon or measure to one of seven classes. The largest class included 10 taxa that declined steadily in abundance from upriver to downriver. All community measures followed a similar pattern except that each measure increased near the downstream-most plant. Conversely, only two taxa (Striped Bass Morone saxatilis and River Carpsucker Carpiodes carpio) showed the opposite trend (i.e., increasing in a downstream direction). Some taxa were restricted to the upper or lower end of the river or to certain reaches along the river. Species that were restricted to the upper river were primarily stream fishes (certain minnows Notropis spp. and several darters Etheostoma spp.). Conversely, fish species that were restricted to the lower river were primarily large-river fishes as well as species that were typical of the Mississippi River fauna. Site-specific differences in water temperature, Secchi depth, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen were generally unimportant in explaining the observed patterns. Substrate type (percent cobble/boulder and percent silt) occasionally was important. The observed longitudinal trends appeared to be primarily in response to natural temperature and habitat differences between the upper and lower sections of the Ohio River.

AB  - The index of biotic integrity (IBI) is a commonly used measure of relative aquatic ecosystem condition; however, its application to coldwater rivers over large geographic areas has been limited. A seven-step process was used to construct and test an IBI applicable to fish assemblages in coldwater rivers throughout the U.S. portion of the Pacific Northwest. First, fish data from the region were compiled from previous studies and candidate metrics were selected. Second, reference conditions were estimated from historical reports and minimally disturbed reference sites in the region. Third, data from the upper Snake River basin were used to test metrics and develop the initial index. Fourth, candidate metrics were evaluated for their redundancy, variability, precision, and ability to reflect a wide range of conditions while distinguishing reference sites from disturbed sites. Fifth, the selected metrics were standardized by being scored continuously from 0 to 1 and then weighted as necessary to produce an IBI ranging from 0 to 100. The resulting index included 10 metrics: number of native coldwater species, number of age-classes of sculpins Cottus spp., percentage of sensitive native individuals, percentage of coldwater individuals, percentage of tolerant individuals, number of alien species, percentage of common carp Cyprinus carpio individuals, number of selected salmonid age-classes, catch per unit effort of coldwater individuals, and percentage of individuals with selected anomalies. Sixth, the IBI responses were tested with additional data sets from throughout the Pacific Northwest. Last, scores from two minimally disturbed reference rivers were evaluated for longitudinal gradients along the river continuum. The IBI responded to environmental disturbances and was spatially and temporally stable at over 150 sites in the Pacific Northwest. The results support its use across a large geographic area to describe the relative biological condition of coolwater and coldwater rivers with low species richness.

AB  - `Preparation of European environmental policy needs detailed and consistent assessments. All possible and available means have to be applied to get the optimal solution for current and upcoming problems in the environment. As there will be a recognition of the increasing importance of linkages between the various aspects in the environment, a sound and appropriate method for tackling the integration problem is needed. One of the main features of Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA) deals with the linkage between societal activities and the relevant environmental issues. The European Environment Agency (EEA) uses a chain of linkages between the driving forces within society (D), the pressure on the environment (P), the state of the environment itself(S), the impact on people and nature (I) and the desirable response (R). This approach is called the DPSIR chain. For each environmental issue a chain, including the linkages, could be developed by combining available knowledge and data. In fact it is a complex multi-dimensional system of relations between the chains belonging to the various aspects. Modelling the integration of all available scientific knowledge and data is the only way to deliver adequate information for the policy preparation process. The EEA made use of this approach for its assessments of Europe's enviromnent. Every three years the EEA will publish an "Assessment" and a "State of the Environment". The latest publication was "Europe's Environment: The Second Assessment", in June 1998 (EEA, 1998). The next will be the "State of the Environment 1995" (EEA, 1998), to be published in 1999. A prospective analysis forms part of the preparation of this report, in which modelling, based on the same DPSIR-approach is essential. The above-mentioned publications contribute to the preparation of new policy lines within the European Community. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Brazil, mussel seed are not a plentiful natural resource, and so the efficient use of seeds by reducing stocking densities should be considered. There are very few studies addressing the relationship between seeding density and growth of mussels in tropical conditions. This work aimed to determine the influence of low seeding densities on the productive performance of Perna perna (Linnaeus) mussels cultivated on ropes in Caraguatatuba, Brazil. In October 2014, 12 ropes, one metre in length each, were seeded at the densities of 200, 300 and 400 mussels/m (four ropes for each density) and suspended on a long line. After 226 days of growing, mussels were harvested and their performance at each density was evaluated in terms of mean weight and length, production, culture efficiency, condition index, survival, amount of recruited seed, amount of fouling on the ropes and morphometric relationships. We observed no significant differences (p > .05) for these indicators among the densities tested, except for mussel biomass, which was significantly higher (p < .05) at the greater densities. A partial budget analysis showed that the density of 400 m(-1) showed better profitability and should be recommended, even in case of seed shortage.

AB  - We experimented with caging the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) at various depths for 69 d to measure basic physiological parameters, histological response and bio-accumulation of contaminants in a deep-sea contaminated area. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated, under artificial pressure conditions, the ability of mussels Mytilits galloprovincialis to tolerate rapid iminersion (at a speed of up to 120 m min(-1)). In sinu experiments were performed using submerged lines enabling mussels to be maintained at depths ranging of 40-1550 m with Survival rates ranging from 80 to 38%, respectively. No significant differences in condition indexes were observed between treated and control specimens. However, histological observations demonstrated a clear reduction in thickness of the digestive epithelium with increasing depth exposure. By determining the contaminants in caged mussels, we found the following values for chromium accumulation: 27.4 mu gg-1 dry weight at 580 m depth and 9.8 mu gg(-1) dry weight at 1550 m. Selected stations were located down stream of all industrial effluent at 420 m. The biological and environmental consequences of deep-sea contamination demonstrate the suitability of caged mussels for monitoring contaminant accumulation.

AB  - Satellite observations of the spectral properties of vegetation can provide insights on crop conditions and yield, and, furthermore, can monitor the impact of droughts. In the case of rainfed crops grown for self-sufficiency, a drought can result in significant human suffering, highlighting the need to understand how droughts affect the landscape in such regions. This paper uses remote sensing to assess the phenomenological impacts of two isolated droughts, distinguishing the response of different vegetation covers in semiarid developing regions where rainfed agriculture is common. Using the standardized precipitation index, one normal and two dry years were selected (2000, 2005, and 2011, respectively). An original protocol for land use land cover (LULC) classification that combines climatic, topographic, and reflectance information from 18 Landsat ETM+ images was applied to subsequently distinguish drought effects in different classes through the selected years. Finally, two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI)) were calculated to detect drought severity impacts over the different LULC classes. This approach was tested in Central Mexico and provided accurate information on the location and extent of areas affected by drought. The proposed approach can be used as a system for drought risk management in semi-arid developing regions.

AB  - Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) have been introduced into the Wadden Sea (North Sea, Germany) in the mid of the 1980s and have invaded native blue mussel Mytilus edulis (L) beds. The latter turned into oyster reefs where mussels seem to be relegated to the bottom in between the much larger oysters. By combining field and laboratory experiments, we reveal how mussels react to cohabitation with the invasive oysters. Mussels subjected to direct contact with crabs Carcinus maenas migrate from top to bottom positions between oysters in both field and laboratory experiments within 22 days. Shell growth was significantly reduced for mussels placed on the bottom compared to mussels at the top of an oyster reef. Condition index was lower for mussels on the bottom of the reef irrespective of whether placed between dead or living oysters. We conclude that mussels experience a trade-off between survival and food supply and prefer to take refuge from predation even when this decreases growth and condition. This mechanism may have facilitated the take-over of C. gigas on M. edulis beds in the European Wadden Sea. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aimed at investigating the nesting and body parameters of neonates of Podocnemis unifilis in the Araguari River basin, State of Amapa, Brazil. The spawning sites of this turtle were monitored along the Falsino River (a region with two reserves) and in the urban area of the Porto Grande city along the Araguari River, from August to December 2011. A total of 180 nests were found and the nesting occurred from September to November, with prevalence in October. Eggs hatching occurred in December. The mean incubation period was 63.5 +/- 5.2 days and the eggs hatching success was 25%. However, approximately 80% of the nests had suffered predation mainly by humans, which occurred in both the protected areas of the reserves and the urban area. The pattern of nesting site choice was discussed. Egg size was larger than that previously described for the same turtle species in the other regions. The body condition index of neonates indicated a good use of vitelline reserves. The results indicate the urgent need for strategic actions to conserve and maintain the natural stocks of this relatively vulnerable turtle in the region.

AB  - The 2010-2011 La Nina (positive phase of El Nino) phenomenon affected four million Colombians, similar to 9% of the total population, and caused economic losses of approximately US $7.8 billion, related to destruction of infrastructure, flooding of agricultural lands and payment of government subsidies. We analyzed the spatial patterns of effects on the population, measured as the number of affected persons in each municipality normalized to the total municipal population for 2011, using global (Moran's I index) and local (LISA) spatial autocorrelation indicators, and multiple regression analyses (OLS and ML spatial error model). The spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed two regional clusters or "hotspots" with high autocorrelation values, in the lower Magdalena River Valley (Caribbean plains) and lower Atrato Valley (Pacific lowlands). The regression analyses emphasized the importance of the spatial component as well as the variables related to hazard exposure and social vulnerability. Municipalities in "hotspots" show: (1) a high degree of flooding, as they are located on the Magdalena and Atrato River floodplains, and (2) high social vulnerability, suggested by low values of the ICV (national living conditions index).

AB  - Secretion of mucus by epidermal goblet cells protects fish against many biological, physical, and chemical insults encountered in the environment. This study monitored changes in hemoglobin concentration in epidermal mucus and in the density, diameter, and mucus quality of epidermal goblet cells in the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, following exposure to creosote-contaminated sediment from the Elizabeth River, Virginia, USA. Fish were exposed for 13 d in flow-through aquaria to either uncontaminated (US) or contaminated (CS) sediments and were sampled periodically. The condition index was lower and the mortality rate and the occurrence of epidermal lesions were higher in CS-exposed fish than in US-exposed fish. Hemoglobin contents in epidermal mucus from the former group were significantly higher than from the latter. Significant reductions in both size and density of goblet cells in CS-exposed fish suggested a mucus secretion rate exceeding its production rate. Significant changes in mucin types between treatments did not occur until day 13 and are not believed to be directly related to the creosote present in the contaminated sediment. These results all indicate that exposure to creosote-contaminated sediment had a profound and deleterious effect on fish health.

AB  - Assessing and quantifying ecosystem vulnerability is a key issue in site-specific ecotoxicological risk assessment. In this paper, the concept of vulnerability, particularly referred to aquatic ecosystems is defined. Sensitivity to stressors, susceptibility for exposure and recovery capability are described as component of vulnerability of biological communities. The potential for habitat changes must also be considered in ecosystem vulnerability assessment. A procedure based on the application of an ecosystem vulnerability index is proposed. The method allows the assessment of vulnerability of riverine ecosystems to multiple stressors. The procedure is applied to two river systems in northern Italy: River Serio, subject to strong human pressure, and River Trebbia, in semi-natural conditions, as reference system. Macrozoobenthos is chosen as the indicator community. The actual quality of River Serio was evaluated as the result of the multiple stressor pressure on the reference system. Values and limitations of the approach are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pagellus erythrinus is a commercial fish in Lebanese marine waters. This species has been exploited by artisanal fisheries using gill or trammel nets, longlines and beach seines. Therefore, monthly biological P. erythrinus data have been collected since 2015 by the National Center for Marine Sciences - National Council for Scientific Research. Data from 2015, 2016, and 2017 were used to assess the growth and biology of this species along the Lebanese coast. A total of 1315 females and 446 males were collected and the sex ratio showed significant bias from 1:1. The weight-length relationship showed a negative allometry (b = 2.912 and R-2 = 0.97), and the length +/- SD at which 50% of the individuals were sexually mature was 16.38 +/- 0.16 cm for both sexes. The average gonado-somatic index and condition factor demonstrated that the spawning period of the common pandora population is spring and revealed the well-being of the population.

AB  - This paper represents an index model developed for the assessment of risk caused by river floods. The main purpose of this model is to evaluate the flood risk in the western coastal region of Mazandaran Province/Iran. The model assesses the risk at triple components, i.e. the flood occurrence probability, vulnerability and consequences, through identification and evaluation of effective criteria categorized into seven indexes (environmental, technical, economic, social, depth, population and sensitivity ones) that are involved in all stages of flooding (source, pathway and receptor). The flood risk in the developed model is defined by a dimensionless magnitude called as risk score between 0 and 100 for each zone of the area under assessment by calculating and combining of two newly defined factors: occurrence and vulnerability factor and impact factor. The model was applied in a case study, the Nowshahr flood in 2012. The results showed that: (i) the flood risk zoning was compared with observed data for aspect of the damages, and general agreement between them was obtained; (ii) for urban zones, which surrounded by two rivers, would easily be in critical condition and rescue operations face difficulties; and (iii) it is necessary to review the location of the emergency services, according the flood risk zoning.

AB  - The article is devoted to the pollution problems and the identification of the main sources of pollution of Boyuk Shor lake of the Absheron Peninsula under the ever-increasing rate of industrial development and urbanization. The purpose of the research was to determine the current ecological state of Boyuk Shor lake and adjacent territories. For this purpose, in June-August 2018, 36 samples were taken for analysis from water, bottom sediments of the lake, and soils of adjacent territories. The laboratory analysis revealed a high content of total hydrocarbons, toxic metals (Cd, Co, Hg, Cu), suspended solids, and other pollutants in the lake water samples. Quantitative and qualitative indicators of the lake are presented. The number of suspended particles in water samples was found to be more than 27-250 times higher than the maximum permissible concentration, and the amount of Hg is 180-286 times, Cd is 1-3.3 times, Cu is 1.7-4.8 times, and Co is 1.5-2.4 times higher than MPC. The heavy metal pollution of the soil and the taxonomic composition of the mesofauna of the surrounding area of Boyuk Shor lake were also studied. It was found that the composition of the group of soil invertebrates is very scarce, consisting only of insects (Arthropoda) (85.7%) and mollusks (Mollusca) (14.3%). The research results showed that the long-term negative impact has led to a violation of the ecological balance of the lake; it has lost its natural qualities, has become unsuitable for the flora and fauna of the lake and the surrounding area, and needs thorough cleaning and restoration.

AB  - In literature, an effective method enabling the classification, based on a single indicator, of habitats that need a priority protection intervention has not been identified yet. Moreover, the excessive number of landscape metrics, used to quantify integrity of habitats, can cause confusion, often providing redundant and inconsistent results.
   The aim of this work is to develop a method for evaluating the ecological vulnerability of the habitats in sites of high biodiversity conservation interest. In the first phase, we selected and analyzed, by using principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy logic, the landscape metrics, in order to obtain the map of the intrinsic ecological vulnerability index. In the second step, the result of this intrinsic vulnerability was connected, through another fuzzy model, to anthropogenic impacts, obtaining the integrated ecological vulnerability index. We developed specific spatial indicators (landscape metrics), which can examine the mutual position and morphology of the habitats present, along with indicators of human pressure, related to the type and intensity of use of the anthropic territory, with reference to the habitat itself as well as to the areas immediately adjacent. The developed fuzzy models are innovative, compared to the current ecological studies, and examine landscape metrics as well as the impact of human activities.
   The case study is the "Val Basento-Ferrandina Scalo" Site of Community Importance, Ferrandina-SCI (Basilicata Region, Southern Italy). The results allowed us to build a rank of the habitats based on their intrinsic and integrated ecological vulnerability. Moreover, the results show that, in the Ferrandina-SCI, the most important source of concern is not human activities, but rather the inherent risk of ecological fragility caused by geographical and landscape features of the different patches of habitats themselves.
   This model aims to be a tool for decision support in sustainable landscape management. It is easy to use and to apply on other regions, although it should always be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis to reduce the subjectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To examine the drought affected area is highly challenging because the drought is a natural disaster that starts and expands slowly. The severity of the drought is different when the rainfall is imbalance in the area. The objective of this study was to analyze the drought around Chi watershed with total area of 49,131.920 km(2) by using data from Terra/MODIS satellite during 10 years (2007-2016). On part of method operation, the NDVI data was obtained from Terra/MODIS satellite, and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) analysis was performed to examine the condition of plants which could identify the condition of drought in the area. According to the study, it was found that in 2015, it was the time when the drought affected area was at most which was equal to 91.54 percent, or 44975.23 km(2). When the analysis results of these ten years were brought to find relationship with rainfall, it was found that the decision coefficient was R-2 = 0.913. It can be concluded from the results of this study that VCI could be used as indicator and could identify the drought in Chi watershed in terms of area and time reasonably.

AB  - The effect of asynchronous hatching on nestling health and condition in ardeids is still in need of empirical evidence from populations living in different environmental conditions. Using morphometric and hematologic data from Little Egret Egretta garzetta nestlings in a Tunisian breeding colony, we assessed the relationship between hatching order and nestling condition, while accounting for the effects of brood size, age and hatching date. Our results showed that the youngest nestlings had lower values of hematocrit and body condition index but higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry compared with their older siblings. These trends seem to stem from increased nutritional stress experienced by younger nestlings who would have received less food from their parents than their siblings due to their less competitive nature. Additional constraints during the rearing period, such as possible injuries resulting from conflicts with siblings and the energy cost of thermoregulation, may also have contributed to the deterioration of the condition of last nestlings. Overall, our findings provide empirical evidence of the short-term repercussions of asynchronous hatching in a North African population of Little Egrets. They also highlight the great complexity of mechanisms by which asynchronous hatching may affect body condition and health of bird nestlings.

AB  - A classification system of macroalgae and angiosperms for the inner coastal waters of the Baltic coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Germany) was developed according to the guidelines of the European Water Framework Directive. These guidelines ask for a five-step classification scheme (high, good, moderate, poor, bad) of the ecological state based on submerged macrophytes.
   The approach is based on the comparison of the occurrence and distribution of plant communities in 1999-2003 with historical data of submerged macrophytes and their community structure. Due to the lack of appropriate data, historical depth distribution limits of plant communities were calculated based on modelled historical underwater light climate.
   Despite the fact of very heterogeneous salinities (0.5-20.0 practical salinity units, psu) and substrate types (silty-sandy) in the study area, two general main criteria were identified as appropriate indicators of eutrophic degradation of the inner coastal waters: (1) the lower distribution depth of plant communities and (2) the loss of charophyte-dominated plant communities. Based on these two criteria, a five-step classification scheme is proposed for the characterisation of the ecological state. The depth limit boundaries between the ecological classes were calculated by 5, 25, 50 and 75% reduction of the water transparency. Based on this calculation, the ecological status is described by the gradual upward shift of the vegetation depth limit. Complementary to the decrease of depth limits the loss of charophyte-dominated plant communities characterises the border between moderate and poor ecological conditions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Piscifaunal health depends upon the state and quality of the aquatic environment. Variations in physical condition of fish may therefore be attributed to changes in environmental quality. Based on time series of up to 20 years of biometric data of bream from multiple sampling sites of the German environmental specimen bank (ESB), this study assessed whether changes in biometric parameters are able to indicate long-term alterations in fish health and environmental quality. Evaluated biometric parameters of fish health comprised length and weight of individuals of a defined age class, the condition factor, lipid content and hepatosomatic index (HSI). Although there are negative trends of the HSI, the overall development of health parameters can be interpreted as positive. This seems to suggest that health parameters conclusively mirror the long-term improvement of water quality in the selected rivers. However, the applicability of the condition factor as well as lipid content as indicators for fish health remained subject to restrictions. Altogether, the results from the ESB confirmed the high value of biometric parameters for monitoring of long-term changes in state and quality of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Previous assessments on rivers in SE China with highly developed economy and enormous population indicate diverse and relatively low particulate heavy metal pollution levels. However, the controlling mechanisms for heavy metal enrichment and transport remain enigmatic. Here, we target a mesoscale mountainous river, the Minjiang River, and obtain grain size, mineralogical and heavy metal concentration (Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Mo, Zn, V, Co, Ni, Cu) data from seasonal suspended particulate matter (SPM) near the river mouth, riverbed sediments and SPM samples from mainstream and major tributaries of the river. The results indicate that SPM samples have higher particulate heavy metal concentrations than riverbed sediments collected in pairs. Heavy metal concentrations of Cd, Zn, Cr, V, Co, Ni and Cu are higher in upstream SPM samples than those in downstream regions, whereas Pb, Mn and Mo concentrations don't show this spatial variation. Most heavy metals (e.g., Pb and Zn) show high concentrations in flood seasons and relatively low concentrations in dry seasons, revealing a hydrologic control. However, Cr and Mn show high concentrations in some dry season samples, suggesting incidental anthropogenic input events. The SPM-based pollution assessments using enrichment factor, geoaccumulation index and potential ecological risk index demonstrate that the Minjiang River ismoderately to strongly polluted by particulate Pb, Cd, Mo and Zn contaminations and most particulate heavy metals havemoderate to considerable potential ecological risks. We contend that transport and discharge of particulate heavy metals by the Minjiang River are controlled by both natural and anthropogenic forcings and the pollution levels are worse than previously known. Our findings suggest that particulate heavymetal discharge by subtropical mountainous rivers is related to sediment types and hydrologic characteristics. Therefore, high-spatiotemporal-resolution investigations on river SPM samples are highly recommended to better evaluate particulate heavymetal pollution levels and aquatic environmental conditions.

AB  - Translocation of plants and animal populations between environments is one of the major forms of anthropogenic perturbation experienced by pristine populations, and consequently, human-mediated hybridization by stocking practices between wild and exogenous conspecifics is of increasing concern. In this study, we compared the expression of seven candidate genes involved in multifactorial traits and regulatory pathways for growth as a function of level of introgressive hybridization between wild and domestic brook charr to test the null hypothesis of no effect of introgression on wild fish. Our analyses revealed that the expression of two of the genes tested, cytochrome c oxidase VIIa and the growth hormone receptor isoform I, was positively correlated with the level of introgression. We also observed a positive relationship between the extent of introgression and physiological status quantified by the Fulton's condition index. The expression of other genes was influenced by other variables, including year of sampling (reflecting different thermal conditions), sampling method and lake of origin. This is the first demonstration in nature that introgression from stocked populations has an impact on the expression of genes playing a role in important biological functions that may be related with fitness in wild introgressed populations.

AB  - Effects of high pressure treatment on the Mg-enhanced ATPase activity of myofibrils were studied to investigate the pressure-induced modification of actin-myosin interaction.
   In the myofibrils prepared from muscles, similarities in the changes in the Mg-enhanced ATPase activity and its sensitivity to ionic strength were observed between muscles pressurized up to 200 MPa and muscles conditioned for 7 days. The BIMA (Biological index of Myofibrillar Ageing) value of the pressurized myofibrils reached the same level as that of the conditioned myofibrils.
   When the isolated myofibrils were pressurized, slight increases of ATPase activity below 0.2 M KCI and of BIMA value were observed in the myofibrils pressurized at 30 MPa, which then decreased with increasing pressure. The release of soluble materials from the myofibrils was markedly accelerated by pressurization above 150 MPa. The SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the release of the constituents of thin filaments seemed to proceed prior to the release of the constituents of thick filaments.
   The pressure-induced changes in Mg-ATPase activity and BIMA value are explained in terms of the structural change of thin filaments resulting from briefly exposing muscles to high pressure. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Recently, there has been substantial interest in the enhancement of refuse decomposition in landfills, which results in increased settlement. In this paper, changes in waste compressibility as a function of the state of decomposition are reported. Samples representative of residential refuse were decomposed under conditions designed to simulate decomposition in both control and bioreactor landfills. Twenty four one-dimensional oedometer tests (63.5 mm cell) were performed on refuse prepared in laboratory-scale reactors for measurement of primary (Cc) and secondary (C-alphai, representing creep, and C-betai, representing biological) compression indices. The state of decomposition was quantified by the methane yield and the cellulose (C) plus hemicellulose (H) to lignin (L) ratio. The magnitude of compressibility was shown to increase as refuse decomposed and compressibility parameters were correlated with the state of decomposition. Initial settlement increased with decreasing (C+H)/L ratio while the creep index was fairly independent of the state of decomposition. The coefficients of primary compression (Cc) for bioreactor samples showed an increasing trend with decreasing (C+H)/L ratios. Cc increased from 0.16 to 0.36 as (C+H)/L decreased from 1.29 to 0.25, and similar values of Cc were obtained with control samples at similar (C+H)/L ratios. The creep index range was estimated at 0.02-0.03 for control and bioreactor samples in various states of decomposition. The magnitude of the biological degradation index (C-betai) depended on the degradation phase with the highest value of 0.19 obtained during the phase of accelerated methane production. Proposing a single Cc for landfill settlement calculations may lead to inaccurate predictions. Properties of each waste sublayer will change as a function of the decomposition stage, and dominating processes with appropriate compressibility parameters should be applied to individual sublayers.

AB  - We developed a preliminary macroinvertebrate-based multi-metric index to assess streams biotic condition in the Upper Isiboro-Secure basin (Bolivia). To do so we used eight local habitat descriptors and twelve metrics describing the structure and function of macroinvertebrate assemblages from 38 reference and 29 disturbed sites. Stepwise multiple linear regression procedures were first applied using the reference data to elaborate models describing metrics response to natural environmental in the absence of any significant disturbance. In a second step we used residuals distribution of each of the twelve models to select the most effective metrics in discriminating between reference and disturbed sites. These metrics were: number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa (EPT), abundance of EPT, relative abundance of EPT, abundance of Chironomidae and relative abundance of Chironomidae. Finally, after converting residual values of these 5 remaining metrics into probabilities, we added values to obtain a final index score and interpreted this score as excellent, good, moderate, poor or very poor. Our final multi-metric index distinguished well between natural and human-induced variation in biological condition and showed a significant negative response to a gradient of disturbances. This type of approach could be used in the near future to develop a nation wide index by increasing regional-scale monitoring.

AB  - Driven by the EU 2019 low-carbon emission standard for automobile industry, gasoline car brands such as Fiat have considered either to (1) pay penalty or (2) cooperate with E-vehicle brands such as Tesla to "pool" their carbon emissions. These two strategies result in corresponding supply chain structures where the latter has cooperation relationship between automobile brands because the gasoline car brand has to purchase and resell E-vehicles. In this paper, we study under what conditions the gasoline car brand will choose the "Pooling Strategy", which promotes low-carbon transformation. We show that the gasoline car brand's profit will always be hurt by the "EU 2019 Standard", but a sufficiently high excess emission premium can successfully induce the gasoline car brand to choose the "Pooling Strategy". We then develop a lifetime environmental performance index and find that, interestingly, a tighter carbon emissions standard may result in worse environmental performance.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedent negative impacts on our society, however, evidences show a reduction of anthropogenic pressures on the environment. Due to the high importance of environmental conditions on human life quality, it is crucial to model the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on environmental conditions. Consequently, the objective of this study was to model the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the urban surface ecological status (USES). To this end, the Landsat-8 images of Milan for three pre-lockdown dates (Feb 13, 2018 (MD1), April 18, 2018 (MD2) and Feb 3, 2020 (MD3)) and one date over the lockdown (April 14, 2020 (MD4)), and Wuhan for three pre-lockdown dates (Dec 17, 2017 (WD1), March 23, 2018 (WD2) and Dec 7, 2019 (WD3)) and one lockdown date (Feb 9, 2020 (WD4)) were used. First, pressure-state-response (PSR) framework parameters including index-based built-up index (IBI), vegetation cover (VC), vegetation health index (VHI), land surface temperature (LST) and Wetness were calculated. Second, by combining the PSR framework parameters based on comprehensive ecological evaluation index (CEEI), the USES were modeled on different dates. Thirdly, the USES during the COVID-19 lockdown was compared with the USES for pre-lockdown. The mean (standard deviation) of CEEI for Milan on MD1, MD2, MD3 and MD4 were 0.52 (0.12), 0.60 (0.19), 0.57 (0.13) and 0.45 (0.16), respectively. Also, these values for Wuhan on WD1, WD2, WD3 and WD4 were 0.63 (0.14), 0.67 (0.15), 0.60 (0.13) and 0.57 (0.13), respectively. Due to the lockdowns, the mean CEEI of built-up, bare soil and green spaces for Milan and Wuhan decreased by [0.18, 0.02, 0.08], [0.13, 0.06, 0.05], respectively. During the lock down period, the USES improved substantially due to the reduction of anthropogenic activities in the urban environment.

AB  - The relations of different characteristics of soil nematode communities with the type of natural (forest and meadow) biocenoses and the main parameters of assessment of the state of soil ecosystems were determined in the course of monitoring. It was found that the number of nematodes and number of taxa in the fauna are highly variable. It was noted that meadow biocenoses stand apart by the diversity of nematodes and the proportion of plant parasites in the community structure. A significant functional contribution in the distinguishing of the main types of biocenoses was determined only for the index reflecting the organic matter decomposition in the soil using discriminant analysis. It was shown that the complex analysis of the parameters of nematode communities most informatively characterizes the state of the soil ecosystem.

AB  - Guadalupe fur seals are a threatened species with few breeding locations, which potentially makes them sensitive to environmental or anthropogenic stressors. We present the first study to quantify adrenal and thyroid function in this species in an effort to measure their stress response to capture. We analyzed a suite of corticosteroid hormones released over time during capture in both adult females (n=10) and weanling pups (n=26) during March 2016. Multiple corticosteroids were released during capture, and aldosterone was associated with the response to stress in adults only. These results suggest the regulation of aldosterone secretion in association with the HPA axis in otariids as reported in other marine mammals. Individuals varied markedly in the magnitude of their endocrine response to capture. A lower total integrated stress response to capture for both cortisol and corticosterone was associated with decreased concentrations of thyroid hormone T3 and elevated concentrations of reverse T3 (rT3), suggesting parallel downregulation of adrenal and thyroid endocrine axes in some individuals. A scaled body condition index was negatively associated with T3 and positively associated with rT3 in adults. Together these findings suggest utility in using endocrine responses to capture stress to evaluate individual and population health.

AB  - Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed over 21 days to polyethylene (PE) particles (0.01 mg ml(-1); 50-570 mu m) isolated from toothpaste. PE was deployed in the Outer Oslofjord (Norway) for 21 days, before exposing the mussels to both virgin (PE-V) and weathered PE (PE-W) particles. The mussels ingested both types of particles, but significantly more weathered particles were ingested than virgin (p = .0317), based on PE dosed by weight (mg ml(-1)) but not when considering particle number (PE-V: 1.18 +/- 0.16 particles ml(-1); PE-W 1.86 +/- 0.66 particles ml(-1)). PE particle ingestion resulted in structural changes to the gills and digestive gland, as well as necrosis in other tissues such as the mantle. No differences were found regarding the degree of tissue alteration between PE-virgin and PE-weathered exposures. This current study illustrates the importance of using weathered particles in microplastic exposure studies to reflect the behaviour of plastic particles after entering the marine environment. The observed tissue alterations demonstrate the potential adverse effects to mussels exposed to microplastic particles. (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Critical transitions of complex systems can often be predicted by so-called early-warning signals (EWS). In some cases, however, such signals cannot be detected although a critical transition is imminent. Observing a relation of EWS-detectability and the network topology in which the system is implemented, we simulate and investigate scale-free networks and identify which networks show, and which do not show EWS in the framework of a two state system that exhibits critical transitions. Additionally, we adapt our approach by examining the effective state of the system, rather than its natural state, and conclude that this transformation can reveal hidden EWS in networks where those signals are otherwise obscured by a complex topology.

AB  - The stone crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium is one of three indigenous crayfish species in Romania. Extensive research to assess the conservation status of this highly protected species is overdue in this country. Presently, the populations are concentrated in two distinct regions, the southwest and northwest of the country. Most populations were found living in habitats with little anthropic impact. Using logistic and negative binomial regression models, we determined the ecological preferences of the species. The most favourable conditions suggest an equilibrium between the availability of dissolved oxygen, moderate river velocity, and low concentration of organic pollutants. Due to these ecological requirements, the species is generally restricted to sub-montane areas (around 500 m a.s.l.) leading to a high degree of population fragmentation. The spectrum of limitations is completed by invasive species and the crayfish plague agent Aphanomyces astaci. Contact with non-indigenous Orconectes limosus and the crayfish plague is a real threat, especially to the populations inhabiting the order I tributaries of the Danube, in southwestern Romania. We recommend that the Romanian stone crayfish A. torrentium be taken into consideration as an "endangered species". (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bivalve shellfish play an important role in top-down control of primary symptoms of eutrophication. This short-circuits the process of organic decomposition and promotes an enhancement of underwater light climate, improved oxygenation of bottom water, and restoration of submerged aquatic vegetation. This review analyses this ecosystem service as a potential actor in watershed-level nutrient credit trading programmes and explores the possibilities of implementation of such programmes in Europe. We examine the different components of the issue, including the eutrophication status of European coastal waters, legal and management instruments, and the use of mathematical models at both the ecosystem and farm scales to evaluate the potential removal of nitrogen by cultivated shellfish such as oysters, mussels, and clams. The annual European bivalve shellfish production of over 700,000 metric tons is estimated to generate a nitrogen removal of 46,800 t year(-1), equivalent to 14 x 10(6) population equivalent, and a minimum value of 507 x 10(6) a,not sign. We discuss future directions for this topic in Europe, drawing from ongoing research in the USA and elsewhere, in the light of the twin challenges of European aquaculture expansion and implementation of EU directives.

AB  - In recent decades, rapid urbanization and intensified global climate change have resulted in a significant difference of environment and resources distribution on space, which would cause trouble for accurate assessment of regional ecological sustainable development, especially in the large urban agglomerations. The parameters used in previous assessment methods have normally ignored spatial heterogeneity, leading to deviations in the evaluation accuracies against the context above. By incorporating remote sensing technology, this study pro-posed an improved emergy ecological footprint (EEF) method and a novel ecological sustainability index to comprehensively analyze the variability of ecological security states (ESS) from 1994 to 2018 in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and to predict its sustainable growth potential based on a combined factorial decomposition and scenario analysis. Results showed that the pixel-based emergy analysis revealed significant heterogeneity over time and space under the impact of climate change and intense land use activities during the study period. The emergy carrying capacity per capita (ecc) and the emergy ecological footprint per capita (eef) also showed a significant difference between the nine cities in the GBA. In addition, the traditional EEF method, which does not consider the spatiotemporal variation, has indeed overestimated the GBA's ecc by 15% compared with our results. The ESS of the GBA gradually worsened from slight insecurity in the 1990s to moderate insecurity in 2018. If the current trends in socio-economic activities and climate change continue according to the RCP8.5 scenario in the IPCC, the ESS of the GBA will reach the extreme insecurity state in 2050. However, our scenarios show that industrial structure adjustment, energy structure optimization, and especially biological resource conservation can reduce the EFI by approximately 6.52%, 23.4%, and 30.6%, respectively. Consequently, effective implementation of the above measures can limit the increase both in emergy ecological deficit and emergy ecological footprint intensity (EFI) and, together, contribute to a higher security status in the GBA in 2050.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of environmental variation on assemblages of dragonfly larvae (Odonata). We hypothesize that there is a significant correlation between species richness, species composition, and abundance of Odonata individuals, and habitat integrity and abiotic variables. To test this hypothesis, we sampled odonate larvae at 12 streams in the Suia-Mi double dagger A River basin in Mato Grosso, Brazil, during three different periods of the year. Local physical and chemical variables (temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), and oxidation reduction potential (ORP)) were measured at each site using a multi-parameter probe, and integrity was assessed using the Habitat Integrity Index (HII). The variation in richness, abundance, and composition of Odonata species was related to the environmental variables analyzed, primarily by the abiotic factors pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and oxidation reduction potential. Our hypothesis was corroborated for the suborder Anisoptera, which showed a significant relationship with these variables, whereas Zygoptera was only related to pH. Our results show the importance of physical and chemical conditions in ecological studies using Odonata larvae as tools for the management and conservation of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Body condition (defined as the relative amount of energy reserves in the body) is an animal trait with strong ecological implications. In some animal taxa (e.g. arthropods), the external volume of the body part in which most nutrients are stored (e.g. abdomen) is used interchangeably with body mass to estimate body condition, making the implicit assumption that abdomen residual volume is a good surrogate of residual mass. However, the degree of correlation between these two measures should largely depend on the density of the nutrients stored.
   2. We simulated two food-supplemented experimental groups of animals, each storing a slightly different amount of lipids either in their abdomens or in their entire bodies, and explored (i) how different estimates of condition were able to detect fixed differences between the groups; and (ii) how the amount of lipids stored could affect the outcome of non-intrusive measures of condition on a dichotomous variable (e.g. survival, mating success). We found that density body condition (body mass statistically controlled for structural body size and body volume) has much greater power to detect differences between experimental groups or effects on binary response variables than do classic mass/size or volume/size condition indices.
   3. Using data on Lycosa tarantula (L.), a burrowing wolf spider, we report dramatic differences among these three indices in their ability to detect sex differences in the effect of feeding treatment on body condition at maturity. In particular, a plot of residual mass against residual volume reflecting nutrient density suggests that poorly fed spiders are nutritionally unbalanced, since well-fed spiders invest in nutrients of very different density.
   4. Furthermore, using data on Scathophaga stercoraria (L.), the yellow dung fly, we found that an index of density condition was better at distinguishing condition differences among three populations than were mass or volume condition estimates alone.
   5. We propose that including these three surrogates of condition (mass, volume and density) will substantially improve the accuracy of non-intrusive estimates of body condition, thus providing more powerful tools with direct application in a wide range of disciplines.

AB  - An estuarine multi-metric fish index (EMFI) was developed and applied to Irish transitional waters. The index comprised a balanced and complimentary set of 14 metrics that represent four fish community attributes: species diversity and composition, species abundance, estuarine utilisation, and trophic composition. Reference conditions and metric scoring thresholds were developed using a combination of historical records, best available data, and expert judgement. The index was applied using representative and robust fish monitoring data collected using a suite of methods designed to cover a range of habitats and conditions. To ensure consistency and comparability, all systems were considered at the whole estuary level. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the response of the EMFI under various scenarios of metric change; five metrics were consistently among the most influential on the EMFI in all scenarios of metric manipulation. The overall EMFI was significantly correlated with environmental condition as measured by two separate indicators of ecological state. Ecological status classes were also established based on the relationship between the EMFI and an index of human pressure. The EMFI provides a robust, sensitive, and integrated measure of the ecological status of fishes in transitional waters and meets the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB  - The research refers to the physical, chemical and microbiological parameters of the Bilecko Jezero Lake water quality. The monitoring of physical and chemical parameters and their interaction with other parameters helps estimate the water quality and any possible changes. Some parameter values and their alteration directly affect the water life. The research was performed at three sites: the Grancarevo watergate, the Trebisnjica River fountain and Orah in the period 2006-2009, and the results of conducted physical and chemical analyses indicate that the water quality was satisfactory, albeit with certain deviations. Bacteriological analyses showed that the water of Bileca accumulation, especially at the Izvor site, was burdened with fecal material.

AB  - Most plant-based indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) developed for wetlands have focused on emergent wetlands. A Vegetation Index of Biotic Integrity (VIBI-Forest) was developed for forested wetlands in the four large ecoregions of the Ohio. Assessing the effect of human disturbance on the ecological condition of wetland forests is complicated by several factors. First, forest canopies can remain largely intact even after significant degradation of the herb and shrub stratum. Second, increases in total diversity may not be good. In forested wetlands, a major artifact of disturbance is the addition of non-wetland or wetland native or adventive plant species adapted to full sun conditions to their floras. Initial versions of the VIBI-Forest metrics were very sensitive to disturbance-induced increases in diversity. Correcting this problem required modifying or replacing metrics so that only forest dependent species were included in metric calculations. The final VIBI-Forest included metrics which evaluated each forest stratum including the ground layer (% bryophyte), herb layer (shade or seed-less vascular plant species), shrub layer (subcanopy importance value (IV), relative density of young trees), canopy (canopy IV), and composite metrics for all vertical strata (Floristic Quality Assessment Index score, % hydrophytes, % sensitive, % tolerant). Assessing wetland forest condition is further complicated by the fact that some successional communities after canopy death or destruction (shrub swamp, marsh, wet meadow) may have intrinsic value as wetland community types. The solution is not to attempt to derive a one-size-fits-all assessment method but to derive separate protocols for other successional phases that are of value or interest.

AB  - Sex-biased parasitism highlights potentially divergent approaches to parasite resistance resulting in differing energetic trade-offs for males and females; however, trade-offs between immunity and self-maintenance could also depend on host body condition. We investigated these relationships in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to determine if host sex or body condition better predicted parasite resistance, if testosterone levels predicted male parasite burdens, and if immune parameters could predict male testosterone levels. We found that male and female hosts had similar parasite burdens and female bats scored higher than males in only one immunological measure. Top models of helminth burden revealed interactions between body condition index and agglutination score as well as between agglutination score and host sex. Additionally, the strength of the relationships between sex, agglutination, and helminth burden is affected by body condition. Models of male parasite burden provided no support for testosterone predicting helminthiasis. Models that best predicted testosterone levels did not include parasite burden but instead consistently included month of capture and agglutination score. Thus, in our system, body condition was a more important predictor of immunity and worm burden than host sex.

AB  - Diversity of the gut bacterial community is of prime importance for optimal food digestion and, therefore, for nutritional condition of avian nestlings. Consequently, bacterial community should be considered as a predictor of the future survival and recruitment of young birds. To explore this hypothesis, we studied the cloacal microbiota, by using RISA procedure, in two avian species sharing environmental conditions during growth, the avian brood parasitic great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius, and their main host in Europe, the magpie Pica pica. As estimates of phenotypic condition of nestlings we studied two nutrition-dependent traits, the immune response to an innocuous antigen (phytohemagglutinin), and the residuals of body mass on tarsus and wing length of nestlings. According to the hypothesis, we found significant relationships between microbial diversity and nestling phenotypic traits related to probability of recruitment. Briefly, both magpie and cuckoo nestlings having more similar microbial diversity were also those with similar immune response and body condition index respectively. Our results show a possible association between bacterial communities and variables related to the probability of post-fledging survival and recruitment of birds, as well as possible reasons explaining magpie-cuckoo differences in the nutritionally conditioned variables better associated with their bacterial diversity.

AB  - Understanding how terrestrial ecosystems respond to climate change can help achieve regional sustainability. The normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI), which is an important vegetation parameter and ecological index, can directly reflect changes in the ecological environment. Based on meteorological observation data and NDVI monitoring data from 2000 to 2018, we explore the impact of climate change on vegetation on Hainan Island. Firstly, by using Mann-Kendall trend detection together with correlation and partial correlation analysis, we analyze the spatial patterns and trends of the NDVI, annual average temperature, and annual precipitation at grid level and also investigate the spatial relationship between the climatic factors and vegetation. The results show that (1) the ecological conditions on Hainan Island are good and the vegetation trends are positive; (2) the air temperature of Hainan Island has a strong positive effect on the NDVI; and (3) precipitation prevents vegetation growth in the rainy season especially in the central parts of the island. This study focuses on the spatiotemporal characteristics and evolution of vegetation and the influence of climate change on vegetation. Our study provides a scientific basis for achieving regional ecologically sustainable development and valuable evidence related to the impact of climate change on vegetation in tropical island regions.

AB  - On the basis of legislative norms concerning land and nature management in Russia and scientific concepts of soil and land, new definitions of these basic concepts are suggested. Soils and lands are considered as separate components of the environment, each performing their own ecological functions. The definitions for land degradation and soil degradation are given. It is argued that the indicators of the ecological functions of soils and lands can be used for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of soil and land resources, ecological norming, and control of their ecological state, including degradation processes.

Methods: Using the Washington Environmental Health Disparities Map, we quantified the level of disproportionate burdens on communities with greater populations of people of color, people in poverty, children younger than 5, and people older than 65 using 3 cumulative environmental indices and 10 individual environmental indicators. Results: Census tracts with a higher proportion of people of color and those with people living below 185% federal poverty levels were found to be disproportionately burdened by environmental threats (II = - 0.175 and II = - 0.167, respectively, p < 0.001). Individual environmental indicators were found to disproportionately burden communities of color and low-income communities. Children younger than 5 were also disproportionately burdened by cumulative environmental indices (II = - 0.076, p < 0.001) and individual indicators. Our analysis did not show disproportionate burden of environmental health threats based on the proportion of people older than 65 (II = 0.124, p < 0.001). Discussion: The disproportionate burden of the cumulative environmental threats on communities of color and low-income communities in this study corroborates similar analyses. These findings can be applied in policy and regulatory actions to correct the distributive environmental disparities. Conclusion: We found much higher burdens among historically marginalized communities and children who are more susceptible to environmental threats and hazards.

AB  - Ecological impacts caused by invasive alien species can be severe but may vary depending upon environmental conditions. Many European populations of the native mussel, Mytilus edulis, have been invaded by the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas. Although widespread invasions have occurred, interactions between M. edulis and C. gigas have largely been investigated with regards to competition for space and food as well as effects on species assemblages. Experimental investigation of competitive interactions on physiological responses of the two species requires further exploration. To this end, we used a 12-month field manipulation experiment to examine growth rates, mortality and condition indices of the two species occurring in monospecific and heterospecific groups. Growth rates and mortality of both species were similar in monospecific and heterospecific groups, whereas condition indices were significantly reduced for both species in heterospecific groups. Growth rates and condition indices also differed amongst experimental sites, potentially due to differing water motion. Shell weight-length relationships did not explain the observed differences in condition for either species. We show that coexistence between the two species may occur but could be detrimental for both species. We also provide a preliminary viewpoint that water motion can mediate competitive interactions between these species.

AB  - A bioenergetics model of the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) was built to simulate growth, reproduction and spawning in culture and fishery field sites in Marennes-Oleron Bay (French Atlantic coast). The model is driven by two environmental variables: temperature and food supply. Food supply and the clam's filtration rate determine soft tissue condition index, which in turn drives clam growth and reproduction.
   The model was calibrated and then validated using two independent data sets. This paper discusses the difficulty of comparing experimental data and individual model outputs when asynchronous spawning events occur in the studied population. In spite of this difficulty, the simulations reproduce the typical pattern of growth and reproduction of the Manila clam.
   Simulations showed that water column chlorophyll a concentration is not a perfect estimator of food resources for a near bottom suspension feeder such as the Manila clam and emphasize the lack of knowledge about Ruditapes philippinarum nutrition.
   The individual growth model presented in this paper will be integrated into a numerical population model describing the host-parasite-environment relationship in Brown Ring Disease, caused by the bacterium Vibrio tapetis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. In this study we relate variation in lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of male and female house sparrows Passer domesticus to morphological characteristics.
   2. Our analyses demonstrated no sex-specific difference in the distribution of LRS. The variance in LRS was influenced mainly by variation in individual annual reproductive success, and to a lesser extent by variation in individual lifespan.
   3. Phenotypic traits explained a significant proportion of the variation in LRS in males, but not in females. The effect of male morphology on LRS operated mainly through an effect on the number of recruiting daughters.
   4. The size of the patch of black feathers on the chest of males (badge size) and male bill length were both positively associated with LRS. Lifespan and bill length were positively related and reproductive success increased with badge size. In females, number of recruiting daughters was positively related to bill length, body mass and body condition index due to the positive effect of these traits on annual production of daughters.
   5. These results indicate that identifying factors causing the large individual variation in LRS, which is likely to be closely related to fitness, will be important to understand microevolutionary processes in this metapopulation, and hence their demographic feedbacks.

AB  - Long-term variability of bioassessments has not been well evaluated. We analyzed a 20-year data set (1984-2003) from four sites in two northern California streams to examine the variability of bioassessment indices (two multivariate RIVPACS-type O/E scores and one multimetric index of biotic integrity, IBI), as well as eight metrics. All sites were sampled in spring; one site was also sampled in summer. Variability among years was high for most metrics (coefficients of variation, CVs ranging from 16% to 246% in spring) but lower for indices (CVs of 22-26% for the IBI and 21-32% for O/E scores in spring), which resulted in inconsistent assessments of biological condition. Variance components analysis showed that the time component explained variability in all metrics and indices, ranging from 5% to 35% of total variance explained. The site component was large (i.e., > 40%) for some metrics (e.g., EPT richness), but nearly absent from others (e.g., Diptera richness). Seasonal analysis at one site showed that variability among seasons was small for some metrics or indices (e.g., Coleoptera richness), but large for others (e.g., EPT richness, O/E scores). Climatic variables did not show consistent trends across all metrics, although several were related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation Index at some sites. Bioassessments should incorporate temporal variability during index calibration or include climatic variability as predictive variables to improve accuracy and precision. In addition, these approaches may help managers anticipate alterations in reference streams caused by global climate change and high climatic variability.

TI  - Truss optimization considering homologous deformation under multiple loadings
T2  - STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION
LA  - English
AB  - The deformation of a structure shall be called homologous, if a given geometrical relation holds for a given number of structural points before, during, and after the deformation. Some researchers have utilized the idea of structural design with the finite element method. The approaches use the decomposition of the FEM equation or equality equations to obtain homologous deformation. However, weight reduction and response constraints such as stress, displacement or natural frequency cannot be considered by those theories. An optimization method solving the above problems is suggested for obtaining homologous deformation. Homology constraints can be considered under multiple loading conditions as well as a single loading condition. A homology index is defined for multiple loading conditions. Examples are solved to demonstrate the performance of the method.

AB  - Bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) are an economically valuable species whose populations have declined in recent decades due in part to harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms. Nantucket, Massachusetts hosts one of the last remaining bay scallop fisheries in the U.S., but recently documented the occurrence of a non-native cyanobacterium (Hydrocoleum sp.). Hydrocoleum can form dense mats in seagrass beds, the primary habitat of scallops, but is also diazotrophic, potentially augmenting bioavailable nitrogen to primary producers and fueling secondary production. We conducted surveys to explore the relationships between Hydrocoleum and scallop condition, reproductive potential, and density in eelgrass beds in Nantucket Harbor as well as effects of other habitat characteristics (e.g., eelgrass cover) on these same scallop traits. We found low Hydrocoleum cover during our sampling, but found fewer large scallops in plots with Hydrocoleum, suggesting that this size class may be especially vulnerable to negative effects of Hydrocoleum. Contrary to expectation, we found a positive correlation between Hydrocoleum cover and scallop condition. These patterns suggest that Hydrocoleum may enhance scallop condition, but also affect habitat use, highlighting the need for manipulative experiments to clarify mechanisms driving these relationships. Understanding how non-native species such as Hydrocoleum impact fishery species will help advance conservation and resource management efforts.

AB  - The results of spectroscopic analysis of the leaves of common reed in the coastal zone of the Neva Bay and in the east part of the Gulf of Finland are discussed. It is shown that the optical properties of the coastal-aqueous vegetation depend on the chemical composition of soils; particularly, on the presence of heavy metals in them. It is suggested that the established regularities can be used for revealing and mapping contaminated regions of the bottom of water areas by proceeding from the data of multiple-zone remote surveys.

AB  - The length-length and length-weight relationships and condition factor for Macrobrachium vollenhovenii are described using samples collected from the rivers of Cote d'Ivoire. The maximum carapace lengths (CLs) registered for males and females were 63.00 and 53.60 mm, respectively. All relationships between body length and CL and weight and CL were found to be highly significant, with r(2) > 0.76 (P < 0.001). In the length-length relation, the allometry coefficient (b) ranged from 0.75 to 1.46 and varied according to the considered length and groups. The value of b of the length-weight relationship varied from 2.55 to 3.30. Although the three allometry types were observed, overall, M. vollenhovenii exhibited negative allometry. The condition factor (K) did not significantly vary among males and females. The K value decreased from the eastern to western Cote d'Ivoire. The present study presents, for the first time, results on the allometric growth and condition factors of M. vollenhovenii from the rivers of Cote d'Ivoire. Further, a biological database is established for use by fishery managers and in further research on the ecology, reproductive biology and aquaculture potentialities of this species.

AB  - The precise role that deforestation for agricultural settlements and commercial forest products plays in promoting or inhibiting malaria incidence in Amazonian Brazil is controversial. Using publically available databases, we analyzed temporal malaria incidence (2009-2015) in municipalities of nine Amazonian states in relation to ecologically defined variables: (i) deforestation (rate of forest clearing over time); (ii) degraded forest (degree of human disturbance and openness of forest canopy for logging) and (iii) impacted forest (sum of deforested and degraded forest patches). We found that areas affected by one kilometer square of deforestation produced 27 new malaria cases (r(2) = 0.78; F1,10 = 35.81; P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, we found both a highly significant positive correlation between number of impacted forest patches less than 5 km(2) and malaria cases, and that these patch sizes accounted for greater than similar to 95% of all patches in the study area. There was a significantly negative correlation between extraction forestry economic indices and malaria cases. Our results emphasize not only that deforestation promotes malaria incidence, but also that it directly or indirectly results in a low Human Development Index, and favors environmental conditions that promote malaria vector proliferation.

AB  - The feeding habit of lane snapper Lutjanus synagris was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, related to seasonality, its ontogenetic development, and the relationship between food and biotic and abiotic conditions on the Amazon Coast of Maranhao, between June 2018 and May 2019. Numerical, gravimetric, and ecological index methods were used to show the relative importance or preference of a category or food item in the diet. The food composition was studied related to the sex, size of the predator and seasonality. Of 359 stomachs sampled, 54 were empty due to regurgitation and presented a vacuity coefficient (Cv%) of 15.04%. In the analysis of diets between the sexes, it was possible to identify a greater participation of fish (30.43%) and Crabs (26.10%) for females, Shrimp (36.23%) and Organic Matter Not Identified (OMNI) (18.84%) in males. The diet showed spatial differences in length distributions. The analysis of stomach contents showed the presence synthetic materials (mesoplastics ranging from 5.0 mm to 2.5 cm) in 5.52% of the samples. The main food items found were from the Brachyura and Caridea species. The results clearly demonstrate that lane snapper prefers benthic prey, presenting a carnivorous and generalist-opportunistic habit. Its diet is also composed of demersal-pelagic species, such as Cephalopods and Teleost fish.

AB  - Extant practice in international management is to measure cultural distance as a nation-to-nation comparison of country means on cultural values, thereby ignoring the cultural variation that exists within countries. We argue that these traditional mean-based measures of cultural distance should take within-country cultural variation into account. Therefore, we propose the use of variance-based measures of cultural distance. To illustrate our argument, we examine total US foreign affiliate sales in more than 40 host countries over the 1983-2008 period, complemented with data from the World Values Survey. We analyze the effects of three cultural distance measures: the Kogut and Singh (1988) mean-based index of cultural distance, the Kogut and Singh (1988) index conditioned by host-country cultural variation and a variance-based measure that takes into account both home- and host-country cultural variation. Our findings indicate that, when within-country cultural variation is taken into account, the explanatory power of the Kogut and Singh (1988) index is substantially decreased. In addition, our variance-based measure of cultural distance outperforms the Kogut and Singh (1988) measure in the explanation of foreign US sales. We therefore suggest to move from mean-based to variance-based measures of cultural distance, thereby taking the cultural variation within countries into account.

AB  - Fatty acids are a valuable tool in ecological studies because of the large number of unique structures synthesized. They provide versatile signatures that are being increasingly employed to delineate the transfer of dietary material through marine and terrestrial food webs. The standard procedure for determining fatty acids generally involves lipid extraction followed by methanolysis to produce methyl esters for analysis by gas chromatography. By directly transmethylating similar to 50 mg wet samples and adding an internal standard it was possible to greatly simplify the analytical methodology to enable rapid throughput of 20-40 fish tissue fatty acid analyses a day including instrumental analysis. This method was verified against the more traditional lipid methods using albacore tuna and great white shark muscle and liver samples, and it was shown to provide an estimate of sample dry mass, total lipid content, and a condition index. When large fatty acid data sets are generated in this way, multidimensional scaling, analysis of similarities, and similarity of percentages analysis can be used to define trophic connections among samples and to quantify them. These routines were used on albacore and skipjack tuna fatty acid data obtained by direct methylation coupled with literature values for krill. There were clear differences in fatty acid profiles among the species as well as spatial differences among albacore tuna sampled from different locations.

AB  - Traditionally, barley in Argentina has been cultivated in low-yielding environments. A study was conducted to test whether breeding for improved performance under these conditions would have also improved the responsiveness to nitrogen availability. Four cultivars of two-rowed malting barley (released in 1944, 1960, 1982 and 1998) were grown under 4 rates of nitrogen fertilizer at sowing (20, 50, 110 and 160 kgN ha(-1)). All cultivars increased their yield with the increase in soil nitrogen. But yield of modern cultivars responded more strongly than yield of old ones. For modern cultivars, increase in grain yield was of 12 +/- 0.6 kg ha(-1) for each 10 kg ha(-1) of increase in the mean yield (environmental index). Absolute values of genetic gain were related to nitrogen availability: 1.59, 2.58, 4.52 and 4.29 g m(-2) year(-1) for the N-20, N-50, N-110 and N-160 treatments, respectively. Grain yield was associated with grain number m(-2), which was dependent on spikes m(-2) and grains spike(-1). Total biomass at maturity also explained the changes in yield. It is concluded that selection under stress conditions was, in this case, beneficial to identify cultivars with high yields under a wide range of nitrogen availabilities.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are key forces governing the structure and functioning of aquatic communities. Understanding how these factors shape organism performance can help to identify the most vulnerable species and develop effective management strategies. This is particularly important for ichthyofaunas with high endemicity and low diversity, such as those of the Iberian Peninsula.
   We explored the suitability of a novel and simple condition index, the scaled mass index (SMI), based on mass-length relationships, for analysis of the effects that abiotic and biotic pressures have on the body condition of four fish taxa widely distributed in Mediterranean rivers in north-eastern Spain: brown trout (Salmo trutta), Iberian redfin barbel (Barbus haasi), Ebro barbel (Luciobarbus graellsii) and minnows (Phoxinus spp.). The SMI performed better in explaining spatial variation in body condition than the Fulton Index, a traditional method for fish studies.
   For all taxa, anthropogenic stressors influencing water quality and physical habitat explained more variance in SMI than other factors. Variation partitioning and GLM approaches consistently showed that SMI increased with altitude, reduced concentrations of toxic nitrogenous compounds, and well-preserved riparian canopy and natural channel morphology, despite the fact that three of the study taxa are in expansion and generally considered 'tolerant'. In addition, the application of SMI to an independent fish data set showed that SMI provides a novel indicator of ecosystem health, which performs better than the current index of biotic integrity developed in this region.
   We discuss the likely mechanisms behind the strong effects of habitat quality on SMI and the implications for our understanding of tolerance. Incorporating SMI into studies of fish monitoring is likely to improve the value of fish studies as indicators of river quality and ecological change. Further studies should compare the response of SMI to specific fish health indicators such as parasite load, haematological assays and pollutant bioaccumulation to improve our understanding of the value of SMI as a non-lethal diagnostic procedure.

AB  - Sandy beaches are challenging ecosystems, in which biota experience extreme physical conditions. We sampled meiofauna in conjunction with environmental factors that are well-known to affect faunal associations to describe the ecological state of sandy beaches that experience natural and human-made disturbances. We applied a random stratified sampling design with monthly collections (1800 cores) at three beaches on the Alexandria, Egypt, coast during two sampling periods over 1 year from November to April and May to September. We used multivariate analyses to compare beaches for water quality, particle size, and meiofaunal assemblages. The environmental analysis explained 60% of the total variation of physical factors among beaches and grouped beaches that moderately sorted fine-grained sand and high water salinity vs. the beach with well-sorted, coarse-grain, and low salinity. Meiofaunal analyses revealed unexpected results. The abundance and temporal variation were low, and the explained proportion of natural variation by the putative environmental factors was small. The natural variation was an indicator of long-term beach ruin and oligotrophic conditions. Our results suggest that a large fraction of natural variation in beach meiofauna is stochastic or that other, non-measured, the natural forces (e.g., storm events) or human-made forces (e.g., tourism activities) are essential contributors to variation. Our best models indicate that meiofauna is more resilient to natural disturbances than to human-made stressors, and the higher the beach exposure to the synergetic effects of natural forces and anthropogenic stressors, the lower the ecological state is.

AB  - There is rising concern over the future states of marine ecosystems, with multiple drivers interacting and putting pressure on resources. Understanding the future of these systems is becoming increasingly important in the drive to safeguard marine resources for future generations. Despite the increasing complexity of predictive models, their reliability in predicting the future of marine ecosystems remains restricted. Scenarios can be used as a tool to provide plausible narratives of how the future might look, potentially allowing fisheries managers to mitigate some impacts before it is too late. In this study an indicator-based framework has been used, which has previously proven successful in assessing states and trends in marine ecosystems. The Southern Benguela ecosystem was assessed under increased primary production (PP) conditions that are considered plausible in the future of the ecosystem. Based on modeled increases in biomass of species within the ecosystem under these conditions, scenarios were tested to see whether it may be possible to increase fishing pressure while maintaining ecosystem wellbeing. Three model scenarios were assessed: increasing fishing on selected prey species, predatory species and both predators and prey. Decision trees were used to assess ecosystem trends, while ANOVAs were conducted to assess the end state of the ecosystem under each scenario. The results suggest that under increased PP conditions it may be possible to increase fishing pressure on prey species while maintaining, or possibly even improving, ecosystem state. In terms of the prey, and the predator and prey scenarios, some contrasting results were observed. While an increased number of declining indicator trends were observed in these scenarios, the end state analysis did not paint such a negative picture. However, declining trends in indicators cannot be ignored, and caution would need to be taken if fishing pressure was to be increased as in these scenarios.

AB  - The red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is one of the most invasive alien species in Europe and included in the list of invasive species of Union concern. We describe for the first time some life-history traits of a red swamp crayfish population in the Nature Reserve of the Lago di Candia (Italy). We investigated (1) preferences of this species for specific environmental features on the banks of the lake, and (2) differences in size, sex ratio, and condition index between individuals caught in lake and marsh. Moreover, we compared sampling effort and the features of individuals caught in the lake, for two sampling seasons in 2014 and 2015. Findings indicated that the population was well established, and the marsh seemed to have better conditions for growth of individuals than the lake. Accordingly, continuity of riparian vegetation, opportunity to dig burrows, and trophic resource availability seems to facilitate the proliferation of the crayfish in the lake. Our study demonstrated that massive removal efforts over the whole active period of the species and more than one year of trapping are necessary to increase the controlling activities' success. This study could have important implications for further population management projects directed at biodiversity conservation in the area.

AB  - Variation in environmental or genetic quality leads to phenotypic variation in condition, but how much variation in fitness is created by this variation in condition? Using Drosophila melanogaster, we manipulated condition via alternative larval diets and then tested several key factors predicted to influence how much variation in fitness results from differences in condition. Specifically, we were interested in whether male and female fitness are affected equally by condition and whether the strength of selection on condition depends on the abundance of key resources limiting the reproductive output of each sex. We measured selection on condition in alternative assay contexts that varied in the abundance of adult food (a key resource for females) or in the abundance of females (a key resource for males). Overall, selection tended to be stronger on males than females. However, selection on males was weakened when the abundance of their key resource (females) was elevated. Increasing the abundance of the key resource for females (live yeast) elevated their reproductive output as expected but did not change the strength of selection in this sex. Instead, this manipulation increased selection on males, suggesting that this environmental factor indirectly affects selection on males via their interaction with females.

AB  - Prescribed or natural drawdowns occur frequently in reservoirs but their effects on fish populations have been barely studied. As a consequence of a severe drought and the need to optimize water quality, a partial drawdown was prescribed in autumn 2005 to a eutrophic reservoir that provides water supply to a large metropolitan area (Barcelona, Spain). In order to avoid a potential massive fish kill given the reduced oxygen availability and high fish abundance, preventive purse seine fisheries were performed to reduce the fish stock. The fisheries had little effect on the fish assemblage because final population size structure and species composition did not change significantly. The species composition of the purse seine catches varied significantly during the drawdown with higher proportion of bleak (Alburnus alburnus) in pelagic water during the days of worst water quality, confirming that bleak is more tolerant than roach (Rutilus rutilus) to poor water quality and a potential good indicator of water pollution. The weight-length relationship (i.e. condition) of roach and bleak also varied significantly during the drawdown following the same tendency in both species, losing and recovering their weight (4.99% in roach and 5.96% in bleak) in only 16 days. The close relationship found between water quality and fish condition demonstrates that fish condition can be a good metric of the well being of fish, even for extreme short-term changes.

AB  - Hydrological and sediment connectivity can help us to understand better how physical and process-based linkages govern ecogeomorphic feedbacks and identify locations where degradation is likely to be pronounced. In this study we investigate how hydrological and sediment connectivity affect ecogeomorphic feedbacks in transitional landscapes. We propose a novel approach, the Relative Connectivity Index (RCI), to quantify landscape connectivity which explicitly integrates structural measures of landscape connectivity (SC) with functional measures of hydrological and sediment connectivity (FC) that are derived from runoff and sediment-transport modelling. We use the RCI calculated for runoff (RCIH) and sediment (RCIs) to identify locations and times when functional connectivity exceeds structural connectivity thresholds where land degradation is likely to be pronounced and explore how these thresholds are affected by rainfall-event size and antecedent soil-moisture content. We find that there are non-linear increases in RCIH values with an increase in shrub cover, which suggest that ecogeomorphic feedbacks become more important in modifying system structure and function during late stages of shrub encroachment. Thresholds of sediment connectivity appear to be directly related to thresholds of hydrological connectivity, although rainsplash appears to be an important mechanism in creating connected sediment transport where there is no connected runoff. High RCIH values are most widely distributed for the largest (45 mm) rainfall event, whilst high RCIS values are observed to some extent across all stages of the grass to shrub transition for rainfall events as small as 10 mm. Whilst particularly large events have a low return period, they appear to be particularly instrumental in shaping ecogeomorphic feedbacks that are likely to drive catastrophic shifts in ecosystem state. The strength of the indicator approach used here is that it enables identification of regions with pronounced ecogeomorphic feedbacks, which act as potential trigger points for catastrophic shifts in ecosystem state, and thus, we demonstrate how the static limitations of existing approaches to developing connectivity indices may be overcome. The dynamic RCI allows the evaluation of the vulnerability or resilience of a particular system to variable driving mechanisms. The RCI can therefore be used to guide management interventions aimed at reducing or mitigating undesirable ecosystem state change, by focussing on specific locations/regions with high RCI values, to prevent further chances in system structure and function and to maximise the provision of ecosystem services.

AB  - Mussel commercial production depends on wild populations to obtain the seed. Therefore, any new farming initiative needs deep knowledge on reproductive cycle of native mussel populations. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from five sites, three estuarine and two coastal, along the coast of the Basque Country were assessed using gonad index and stereology over 2 consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Sex ratios, developmental stages of gonads , as well as reserve tissue cycle were analyzed. The onset of gametogenesis was observed from winter to spring, with spawning occurring from spring till summer. A resting phase followed with an increase in reserve tissues (adipogranular cells) was observed in fall. Mussels stayed ripe during winter until favorable environmental conditions were met in spring. Differences in reproductive cycles were found among populations, and also, year-to-year variability was observed within each population. In two of the studied sites asynchrony in the timing of spawning was observed between genders. These timing differences, however, did not prevent mussels at those sites from reproducing successfully. The Bidasoa estuary points to the potential of such studied sites for becoming the main source of wild mussel spats for future expected commercial mussel farming in the Basque Country. To ensure year-to-year maximum reproductive output, however, wild mussels harvest should be avoided from spring to the end of summer in this region.

AB  - In the present study, an additional combination of end-points was used to evaluate the effects of industrial development on the natural population of the black-striped mouse (Apodemus agrarius), previously estimated using cytogenetic and morphometric assays. Developmental stability was assessed by determining the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and the total amount of phenotypic variability (PV). Body weight (BW) and body length (BL) were also used as indices of body size, while the quotient between observed and expected values of body weight presented an index of body condition (BCl). The experimental design employed in this study is unique because only a few studies have been conducted with A. agrarius and because no investigator has previously used this combination of end-points in an environmental quality monitoring study. FA was increased in the polluted area for foramen parietalis, foramen dentale, foramen palatinum and foramen angularis. Males from the polluted site had significantly higher FA for foramen parietalis compared with male mice from the reference area. Juvenile animals from the polluted area had significantly higher FAs for foramen dentale and foramen palatinum compared to adults. However, when all the foramina were considered together, a three-way analysis of variance revealed that there was no significant interaction between the factors (sex x age category x site) on the FA (average value). A comparison of PVs indicated higher values in the polluted area for all analyzed characters. For foramen parietalis and foramen dentale, PVs were significantly greater in the polluted site than in the control area. Within the same sex, PVs were significantly greater in mice from the polluted site compared with mice from the control area. The results also indicated that mice trapped at the contaminated site had a reduced body size and poorer body condition. Adult mice exhibited better body condition than juveniles, as revealed by the significantly higher BCI values. Finally, to investigate the relative importance of the three potential biomarkers, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA procedure) was performed. The MANOVA's results revealed the significant effects of age category, site and interaction for sex x site on FA (average value), size and body condition. In conclusion, the results indicated that despite A. agrarius's high tolerance to contaminants it may be an important species for environmental quality evaluation studies.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) contamination is a global issue due to its anthropogenic release, long-range transport, and deposition in remote areas. In Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, Nova Scotia, Canada, high concentrations of total mercury (THg) were found in tissues of yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible relationship between THg concentrations and the morphology of perch liver as a main site of metal storage and toxicity. Yellow perch were sampled from five lakes known to contain fish representing a wide range in Hg concentrations in fall 2013. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes and the distribution of Hg within the liver parenchyma were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS). The relative area of macrophage aggregates (MAs) in the liver was determined using image analysis software and fluorescence microscopy. No relation between general health indicators (Fulton's condition index) and THg was observed. In line with this, TEM examination of the liver ultrastructure revealed no prominent pathologies related to THg accumulation. However, a morphological parameter that appeared to increase with muscle THg was the relative area of MAs in the liver. The hepatic lysosomes appeared to be enlarged in samples with the highest THg concentrations. Interestingly, EELS analysis revealed that the MAs and hepatic lysosomes contained Hg.

AB  - The associations of resident fish communities with environmental variables and stream condition were evaluated at representative sites within the Sacramento River Basin, California between 1996 and 1998 using multivariate ordination techniques and by calculating six fish community metrics. In addition, the results of the current study were compared with recent studies in the San Joaquin River drainage to provide a wider perspective of the condition of resident fish communities in the Central Valley of California as a whole. Within the Sacramento drainage, species distributions were correlated with elevational and substrate size gradients; however, the elevation of a sampling site was correlated with a suite of water-quality and habitat variables that are indicative of land use effects on physio-chemical stream parameters. Four fish community metrics - percentage of native fish, percentage of intolerant fish, number of tolerant species, and percentage of fish with external anomalies - were responsive to environmental quality. Comparisons between the current study and recent studies in the San Joaquin River drainage suggested that differences in water-management practices may have significant effects on native species fish community structure. Additionally, the results of the current study suggest that index of biotic integrity-type indices can be developed for the Sacramento River Basin and possibly the entire Central Valley, California. The protection of native fish communities in the Central Valley and other arid environments continues to be a conflict between human needs for water resources and the requirements of aquatic ecosystems; preservation of these ecosystems will require innovative management strategies.

AB  - Data for loin and backfat depth, as well as carcass growth of 126,051 three-way crossbred pigs raised between 2015 and 2019, were combined with climate records of air temperature, relative humidity, and temperature-humidity index. Environmental covariates with the largest impact on the studied traits were incorporated in a random regression model that also included genomic information. Genetic control of tolerance to heat stress and the presence of genotype by environment interaction were detected. Its magnitude was more substantial for loin depth and carcass growth, but all the traits studied showed a different impact of heat stress and different magnitude of genotype by environment interaction. For backfat depth, heritability was larger under comfortable conditions (no heat stress), as compared to heat stress conditions. Genetic correlations between extreme values of environmental conditions were lower (similar to 0.5 to negative) for growth and loin depth. Based on the solutions obtained from the model, sires were ranked on their breeding value for general performance and tolerance to heat stress. Antagonism between overall performance and tolerance to heat stress was moderate. Still, the models tested can provide valuable information to identify genetic material that is resilient and can perform equally when environmental conditions change. Overall, the results obtained from this study suggest the existence of genotype by environment interaction for carcass traits, as a possible genetic contributor to heat tolerance in swine.

AB  - Structure-building, autogenic ecosystem engineers are recognized worldwide as potential tools for coastal protection, which depends on long-term sustainability and persistence of their structures. For reef-building oysters, reefs are maintained through accumulation of shell material, which depends on recruitment and growth and which provides substrate for new generations. Knowledge of the fundamental niche of oysters in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions helps define the area where ecosystem engineers grow and survive well and where their structures are likely to persist and be effective for coastal protection. Response curves of different life-history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated along a tidal emersion gradient in a manipulative field study. Density of juvenile oysters was maximal around 36% tidal emersion. Shell growth of juveniles and adults, condition index (CI) of adults and mortality of adults were negatively related to tidal emersion, whereas mortality of juveniles was positively related to tidal emersion. Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40% tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40% tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plays a critical role in regulating proliferation, differentiation, growth, and survival in fish as well as in humans. Few studies have investigated the involvement of IGFs in bivalves. In Korea, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is an important aquaculture species, and its growth is dependent on environmental conditions. Intrinsic factors that can be used as indicators to assess oyster growth based on individual size are limited. This study analyzed IGF-I, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) in adductor muscle of C. gigas in winter using immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Levels of IGF-I and the IGF-IR beta subunit, and expression of C. gigas insulin receptor-related receptor and IGFBP messenger RNA were significantly higher in large individuals (LI) than small individuals (SI). The IGF-IR beta subunit was detected in the adductor muscle of both groups; however, phosphorylation of the IGF-IR beta subunit and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was greater in LI than SI. The condition index of C. gigas showed a similar pattern. The results of this study suggest that the IGF system is associated with growth rate differences in C. gigas during winter in Korea.

AB  - The diet and feeding ecology of pollock Pollachius virens from the Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy in the north-west Atlantic changed over the last few decades, which was associated with decreases in euphausiid abundance. Stomach contents data for 2078 pollock collected during the 1958-1967 period and for 1230 pollock collected during the 1996-2002 period indicated that pollock diet contained fewer euphausiids and feeding activity decreased. During the early period. euphausiids were present in 65% of the pollock stomachs that contained food and only 9% of these stomachs in the recent period. The decrease of euphausiids was not wholly offset by an increase in piscivory, since there was little increase in the frequency of fish prey in the diet or in the fullness index for this prey type. Empty stomachs were significantly more common in the recent period during both the winter and summer. The decreased occurrence of euphausiids in stomach samples coincided with a significantly decreased abundance of this prey, suggesting that the near-absence of euphausiids in recently collected pollock stomachs reflected prey abundance. Concurrent with changes in diet and feeding intensity, the condition or 'plumpness' of pollock significantly declined from the early to the late sampling periods. (C) 2005 Crown copyright.

AB  - Ecosystem goods and services in streams are impaired when their biotic communities are degraded by anthropogenic stressors. An index of biotic integrity (IBI) translates community structure into a standardized ecoregion-specific stream health score. Documenting stream health is especially important in the Northern Glaciated Plains (NGP) Ecoregion, which is undergoing rapid landscape alterations through increased agriculture production. Our objectives were to develop a fish IBI and validate candidate reference sites for NGP wadeable perennial streams. Fish were sampled from 54 sites (consisting of reference sites, known-condition least and most disturbed sites, and random sites) during summers 2006-2011. Candidate metrics were sorted into nine metric classes based on attributes of fish assemblage form and function. Metric values were screened using metric range, signal-to-noise ratios, responsiveness to disturbance, and redundancy tests until each metric class contained only those metrics most responsive to anthropogenic stressors. The final IBI consisted of six metrics that were reflective of prairie stream fish assemblages, and differentiated between known-condition least and most disturbed sites. The mean reference sampling site IBI scores were found to be similar to both least and most disturbed sites (Mann Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). Twelve reference site scores were below the NGP's median (69), whereas the other 11 sites were above the median and were representative of least disturbed conditions. We now have developed a standardized bioassessment tool for evaluating stream health, as well as a baseline for long-term monitoring in a dynamic ecoregion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A 30-day sublethal bioassay was carried out to investigate the relative sensitivity of saggital otolith and somatic growth indices in juvenile Oreochromis niloticus to textile factory effluents. Somatic indices (body weight, standard length, and condition index) were measured and saggital otoliths were extracted for morphometric (length, breadth and weight) examinations. Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA which showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) between the weight (7.00x10(-3)+/- 4.05x10(-3)g, 6.44x10(-3)+/- 9.3x10(-3) g) of the right saggita of the control fish and that of the exposed fish respectively. There were no significant differences in somatic indices and left saggita measurements for all experimental groups. Allometry as indicated by correlation analysis showed a stronger (p<0.05) coupling of the right saggital growth with increase in standard length unlike the left saggita. The observed differences in otolith weight have probable implications on the choice of saggital otolith that may be suitable for daily growth-ring analysis. Also implied is the fact that otolith weight show earlier sensitivity to environmental stressors than somatic indices. Otolith morphometry holds the potential for an objective and more sensitive physiological indicator of stress in O. niloticus than somatic indices.

AB  - The first fish-based index to assess the ecological quality of lowland rivers in Flanders (Belgium) is based on data obtained from different fishing techniques without considering the gear specificity. As a consequence, this index could not be intercalibrated with other European indices which concentrate on one gear type only. In order to comply with the European Water Framework Directive, we developed a new fish-based index using data obtained from surveys in rivers with electric gear only. All 293 selected rivers belonged to the bream or barbel zone. An updated reference list of fish species was compiled based on previous work and recent data. Abiotic data were collected according to standard methods and habitat quality of all surveyed sites was pre-classified using pressure indicators. To develop the new index candidate metrics were selected from the literature and metric values were calculated. Linear mixed regression models selected metrics based on their response to the pre-classified habitat status. Correlation tests were performed to avoid redundancy among responsive metrics. Boundaries for metric scores were defined based on the calculated metric values. The new index of biotic integrity (IBI) was calculated by summation of the metric scores, and transformed to an ecological quality ratio (EQR), ranging between 0 and 1. Five integrity classes, ranging from bad to maximal ecological potential, were attributed and compared to the pre-classified habitat status of the site. In addition, the new index was also validated with an independent set of data. The new IBI proved to successfully assess the ecological status of the rivers.

AB  - Plasma corticosterone (B) concentrations and certain haematological and morphological parameters were measured in an age cohort of velvet-furred rats, Rattus lutreolus velutinus, in Tasmanian wet sclerophyll forest. Individuals were trapped repeatedly and sampled sequentially for 14 months, offering an opportunity to derive morpho-physiological profiles for free-living individuals. Throughout the study, 130 blood samples were obtained from 29 individuals from the cohort. Gender differences were detected, with total plasma B concentration in females exceeding that in males significantly during the breeding season. By partitioning the total B concentration into biologically active and inactive fractions, it is demonstrated that whilst female rats had higher B levels in the breeding season, most of it was protein bound and inactive. In males, mean total B declined at the onset of breeding but the proportion of biologically active steroid actually increased. These data confirm the breeding season as a stressful period for males. Gender differences also were detected for mean white blood cell counts, being higher in males at all times. No gender-linked differences were detected for plasma protein concentration, red blood cell counts, haematocrif haemoglobin concentration or derived parameters. Physiological data are related to a body condition index and combined with observations made throughout the study of tail wounding and excessive ectoparasite burdens to present a morpho-physiological profile for R.l. velutinus active in wet sclerophyll forest.

AB  - Effective ecosystem management in the face of human alterations depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among impact levels and types We reviewed the literature on biological responses of freshwater biota to human disturbances over the last century. Many of the main methods for assessing ecological integrity originated in Europe [e g, Saprobien Index, Trent Biotic Index, Biological Monitoring Working Party, River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System, multiple traits] or in North America [e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity, leaf-litter breakdown, functional feeding groups] We used bibliometric data to detail the contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in J-NABS from 1986 to 2007 This total was similar to 1/2 of the number of bioassessment articles published over the same period in Freshwater Biology (FWB, another leading freshwater journal used for comparison), but the proportion of bioassessment articles in the 2 journals was similar (similar to 20%). The proportion of bioassessment articles in J-NABS has increased over the last 25 y. This trend indicates the growing interest in the topic and the delay (similar to 30 y since the Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, multimetric indices, lotic systems, macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas First, bioassessments done at large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new environmental policies Second, bioassessment should shift from consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions Third, statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem functions However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for routine bioassessments applied by managers must be tested.

AB  - A rapid and direct fluorogenic assay was used to detect Escherichia coli in urine. Most clinical isolates of E. coli produce beta-glucuronidase, whereas almost all other enterobacteria lack the enzyme. Spectrofluorimetric assay of beta-glucuronidase, without previous induction, was performed on growing and starved uropathogenic E. coli in artificial urine. The presence of 10(3) cfu ml(-1) of E. coli in urine was detected by beta-glucuronidase activity in less than 1 h. These results indicate that beta-glucuronidase is a rapid, specific and sensitive indicator of the presence of E. coli in urine, and provide additional information on the biological state of the infecting bacterial population.

AB  - Indices of biotic integrity (IBI) were computed for two annual fish collections from 27 locations along the bluffline bordering the Mississippi River alluvial plain in northwestern Mississippi. Study sites exhibited varying degrees of physical habitat degradation due to accelerated channel erosion. Objectives of index application were to quantify existing environmental quality and to test the IBI as a tool for relating fish population characteristics to physical degradation. Physical habitat data were collected concurrently with fish at all sites, and physical habitat descriptors were compared with the IBI scores and component metrics.
   Three to 23 fish species were captured from each site, and species richness explained 64-70% of the variance in IBI scores. Fish collections were dominated by insectivores tolerant of habitat and water quality degradation. Suckers and piscivores were relatively uncommon.
   The IBI scores were generally not reflective of physical habitat conditions. Variation in IBI scores was indicative of only the grossest differences in physical habitat quality. Weak relationships between physical habitat quality and IBI scores may have been due to large temporal variations in biotic integrity typical of degraded habitats. Alternatively, water quality degradation, which we did not measure, may have confounded relationships between physical habitat and fish metrics.
   Regional application of the IBI as a habitat assessment tool in landscapes with widespread physical degradation must overcome lack of suitable reference sites, large temporal variation in IBI scores, and small numbers of fish per collection, leading to lower confidence levels for IBI scores. The scarcity of lightly impacted sites may hinder detection of biotic integrity response along gradients of physical habitat quality.

AB  - To assess the potential for rearing in smooth scallops (Flexopecten glaber) from the North Western Adriatic Sea, various biological traits were studied in both fished and reared individuals. Condition and gonadosomatic indices, gonadic cycle, biochemical components and histopathological conditions were investigated in adults from commercial fishing. Throughout two consecutive years, juvenile scallops were collected by means of artificial collectors and maintained in an experimental rearing facility. Growth, onset of sexual maturity, size/age at first maturity were investigated in reared individuals. In fished scallops, spawning and resting periods occurred mostly between July and September and from October to December, respectively. Gonadosomatic index and condition index increased from January to June and decreased from July to October; these main variations corresponded to gametogenesis and spawning, respectively. In both somatic and gonadic tissues, proteins were the major biochemical component (about 80%), with no evident seasonal variation. In somatic tissues, total carbohydrates were always higher than lipids; in gonads, lipids exceeded total carbohydrates for most of the year, peaking at maximum values when only mature or spawning animals were found. Observation and quantification of abnormal features of gonadic tissues, like oocyte atresia, haemocytic infiltration, neoplasia, and presence of parasites, suggest the overall good health conditions of scallops in the study area, no serious threat due to diseases being evident. In reared scallops, sexual maturity was attained within the first year, thus indicating F. glaber as a fairly early maturation species compared with other scallop species. The first maturity event occurred in about 330 days from the immersion of the collectors, at mean shell height values ranging from 22.4 to 25.1 mm, well below the minimum landing size (40mm) established by the EU for queen scallop fishery in Atlantic waters. Appreciable growth rates and a relatively short grow-out period, precociousness in maturation, high availability of wild spat, easily and inexpensively collected, absence of diseases and other mortality factors are promising elements to introduce the cultivation of F. glaber in the North Western Adriatic coastal waters.
   Statement of relevance: To assess the potential for rearing in smooth scallops (F. glaber) from the North Western Adriatic Sea, various biological traits in both fished and reared individuals were studied for the first time. The overall results indicate this species as a potential candidate to diversify Italian marine bivalve aquaculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land use influences the biodiversity of stream systems by changing the chemical composi-tion of the water and the physical structure of the habitat. The present study evaluated the influence of these processes on the diversity metrics of Odonata at regional and local scales, testing the hypoth-esis that the two odonate suborders Anisoptera and Zygoptera will respond differently to habitat and landscape variables. The study focused on 13 sites in the municipality of Barcarena, Para, Brazil. We found no significant impact from regional factors, although anisopterans were more affected by water temperature and Habitat Integrity Index (HII). The HII indicated that the local forest was stable, but anisopteran richness was negatively correlated with HII. It was indicating that these species favoured open areas with less riparian cover. Even though zygopterans did not exhibit a similar systematic pattern, the reduced abundance of Chalcopteryx rutilans, a species associated with better-preserved habitats, may indicate that some sites lack the habitat integrity necessary to establish populations of this species. These findings highlight the importance of preserving the riparian forest to maintain the health of the stream systems. We recommend more studies that focus on the broader geographic and temporal scales to account for factors such as the anthropogenic gradient and historical land use pat-terns.

AB  - Previously, standardized snap-shot models of the Southern Benguela (1980-1989), Southern Humboldt (1992) and Southern Catalan Sea (1994) ecosystems were examined and found to facilitate assessment of ecosystem characteristics related to the gradient in exploitation status of the ecosystems; highest level of exploitation in the South Catalan Sea (North-western Mediterranean), high in the Southern Humboldt and lower in the Southern Benguela. Subsequently. these models were calibrated and fitted using available catch, fishing effort/mortality, and abundance data series and incorporated environmental and internal drivers. This study furthers the previous comparative analyses by comparing changes in ecosystem structure using a selection of ecosystem indicators from the calibrated models and assessing how these indicators change over time in these three contrasting ecosystems. Indicators examined include community turnover rates (production/biomass), trophic level of landings and the community, biodiversity indicators, ratios of predatory/forage fish and pelagic/demersal fish biomass, catch ratios, and network analysis indicators. Using the set of model-derived indicators, the three ecosystems were ranked in terms of exploitation level. This ranking was performed using the values of these indicators in recent years (ecosystem state) as well as their trends over time (ecosystem trend). The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Median tests were used to test for significance of the difference between indicators from the three ecosystems in the last 5 years of the Simulation to compare present ecosystem states. We compared the slope of the lineal trend and its significance between ecosystems using the generalized least-squares regression taking auto-correlation into consideration to analyse ecosystem trends. The indicators that capture better the high impacts of fishing prevalent in the Mediterranean and Humboldt ecosystems, and the more conservative exploitation of the Southern Benguela, are the fish/invertebrates biomass and catch ratio, the demersal/pelagic fish biomass and catch ratio (depending on the ecosystem and the fishery being developed), flows to detritus, and the mean trophic level of the community (when large, poorly quantified groups such as zooplankton and detritus are excluded). This study suggests that the best option for classifying ecosystems according to the impact of fishing is to consider a broad range of indicators to understand how and why an ecosystem is responding to particular environmental or fishing drivers (or more likely a combination of these). Our results highlight the importance of including indicators capturing trends over time as well as recent ecosystem states. We also identified 23 pairs of indicators that correlated similarly in the three ecosystems (they showed a significant correlation with same sign). Further comparisons may contribute towards generalization of this list, progressing towards a better understanding of the behaviour of ecological indicators. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Humus is the fraction of the topsoil strongly influenced by organic matter, corresponding to the sequence of organic and the related underlying organomineral horizons. It is functional both for carbon storage and for the plant recruitment process (including seed storage, germination, roots development and seedling survival). In the years 2011-2012, 32 plots were established in Castelporziano State Natural Reserve as part of a pilot study on the relationships between soil and plants. Following standard methods, vegetation, humus forms and several soil parameters were surveyed/measured simultaneously in all the plots. The main aim of the study was to explore for the first time the application of the humus functionality index (RxN), derived from the Ellenberg flora-based eco-indication model, in a Mediterranean forest. In the Reserve three main humus forms were detected: Mull, Moder and Amphi. The distribution frequency of Ellenberg soil ecological indicator values such as R-soil reaction and N-soil nutrients, and to a lesser extent F-soil moisture, varied among plots with different humus forms. The index RxN was most powerful in emphasizing significant differences among the humus forms. Moreover, species were also differently distributed among the three humus forms: Ranunculus lanuginosus, Stellaria media and Tanacetum parthenium were exclusive to the Mull, while Moder and Amphi forms had a set of preferential species, respectively: Erica arborea, Carex flacca, Cyclamen repandum, Arbutus unedo; and Leontodon tuberosus and Festuca heterophylla. Overall the study confirms the relationship among humus forms, soil parameters (such as organic carbon % and total nitrogen % in the OH horizon), and Ellenberg indicators.

AB  - Pacific walruses may be unable to meet caloric requirements in the changing Arctic ecosystem, which could affect body condition and have population-level consequences. Body condition has historically been monitored by measuring blubber thickness over the xiphoid process (sternum). This may be an unreliable condition index because blubber at other sites along the body may be preferentially targeted to balance energetic demands. Animals in aquaria provided an opportunity for controlled study of how blubber topography is altered by caloric intake. Morphology, body mass, blubber thickness (21 sites), and caloric intake of five mature, nonpregnant, nonlactating female walruses were measured monthly (12 month minimum). Body condition (mass x standard length(-1)) was described by a model that included caloric intake and a seasonal effect, and scaled positively with estimates of total blubber mass. Blubber thicknesses (1.91-10.69 cm) varied topographically and were similar to values reported for free-ranging female walruses. Body condition was most closely related to blubber thickness measured dorsomedially in the region of the anterior insertion of the pectoral flippers (shoulders); sternum blubber thickness was a relatively poor indicator of condition. This study demonstrates the importance of validating condition metrics before using them to monitor free-ranging populations.

AB  - This study explores the assessments made by the inhabitants of eight Latin American countries regarding the current state of the environment, at a local, national and global scale, and how it is perceived looking ahead to the future. It also examines the assignment of responsibility in the future management of the environment. A total of 944 people took part in the study from the eight participating countries, men and women over the age of 18 with different levels of education. The study uses the Environmental Futures Scale to which two relevant items have been added to assess the environment in the region, as well as the Assignment of Environmental Responsibility Scale. The results show differences between the countries, although in general they are pessimistic regarding the current and future state of the environment at the local, national and global level, with the exception of Brazil. In general, and with the exception of Brazil, in the countries surveyed, people assign a high level of responsibility to external social agents at the different levels, increasing their judgement of external responsibility at the national and global levels of analysis. The implications of these findings for environmental policy and education in the countries of this region are also discussed.

AB  - The occurrence of regime shifts in marine ecosystems has important implications for environmental legislation that requires setting reference levels and targets of quantitative restoration outcomes. The Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone large changes in the 20(th) century related to anthropogenic pressures and climate variability, which have caused ecosystem reorganization. Here, we compiled historical information and identified relationships in our dataset using multivariate statistics and modeling across 31 biotic and abiotic variables from 1925 to 2005 in the Central Baltic Sea. We identified a series of ecosystem regime shifts in the 1930s, 1970s, and at the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s. In the long term, the Central Baltic Sea showed a regime shift from a benthic to pelagic-dominated state. Historically, benthic components played a significant role in trophic transfer, while in the more recent productive system pelagic-benthic coupling was weak and pelagic components dominated. Our analysis shows that for the entire time period, productivity, climate, and hydrography mainly affected the functioning of the food web, whereas fishing became important more recently. Eutrophication had far-reaching direct and indirect impacts from a long-term perspective and changed not only the trophic state of the system but also affected higher trophic levels. Our study also suggests a switch in regulatory drivers from salinity to oxygen. The "reference ecosystem" identified in our analysis may guide the establishment of an ecosystem state baseline and threshold values for ecosystem state indicators of the Central Baltic Sea.

AB  - As the first pilot city of water ecological civilization construction, Jinan suffers from a poor state of water ecological sustainability (WES). Based on generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and a 10-year record of relevant data (from 2006 to 2015), this study proposes a prediction and evaluation model aiming to simulate the future WES of Jinan in the following 5 years. To develop such data driven models efficiently, a water ecological footprint (WEF) basic model is adopted to analyze the dynamic evolvement rules of WEF during 2006-2015. Two integrated indicators which named coupling index and coupling coordinative index of water ecological sustainability (CIWES and CCIWES) are then independently integrated from water resources, society, economy and ecological environment systems to further construct WES evaluation model. Results indicate that water pollution footprints contributed 85.5% to Jinan's WEF and it led to a poor WES in the process of water ecological civilization construction. More seriously, despite the future WES on rise, it was still in a relatively poor state and has not return to the higher state in its history. The study demonstrates that the coupling coordination and mutual benefit of each subsystem in the nature should be paid equivalent attention.

AB  - Our study developed an approach to biological assessment that would document effects of pollution on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in Florida streams. The primary objectives were: (1) to classify streams for assessment of benthic assemblages and (2) to develop biological metrics and aggregated indices for biocriteria and assessment. Reference sites were selected throughout Florida (with the exception of the southernmost area, known as the Southern Florida Coastal Plain ecoregion) and sampled by biologists from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. These sites were sampled during a summer index period (1 July through 30 September) from 1992 through 1994. Streams were classified using invertebrate species composition. Three geographic stream classes (bioregions) that were based on aggregations of subecoregions were determined from this analysis: the panhandle, peninsular Florida, and the northeastern portion of Florida. Stream types based on water source (i.e., calcareous or non-calcareous) were not useful as stream classes. From an initial suite of 32 macroinvertebrate metrics, 8 metrics were useful in composing the Stream Condition Index (SCI) for Florida for all 3 bioregions. Scores (5, 3, or 1) were developed for these metrics to allow for aggregation into an index. Aggregating the metrics into the SCT provided a biocriterion that improved discrimination between impaired and unimpaired sites over use of individual metrics.

AB  - Ecohydrological models are frequently used to assess the biological integrity,of unsampled streams. These models vary in complexity and scale, and their utility depends on their final application. Tradeoffs are usually made in model scale, where large-scale models are useful for determining broad impacts of human activities on biological conditions, and regional-scale (e.g. watershed or ecoregion) models provide stakeholders greater detail at the individual stream reach level. Given these tradeoffs, the objective of this study was to develop large-scale stream health models with reach level accuracy similar to regional-scale models thereby allowing for impacts assessments and improved decision-making capabilities. To accomplish this, four measures of biological integrity (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT), Family Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)) were modeled based on four thermal classes (cold, cold-transitional, cool, and warm) of streams that broadly dictate the distribution of aquatic biota in Michigan. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate streamflow and water quality in seven watersheds and the Hydrologic Index Tool was used to calculate 171 ecologically relevant flow regime variables. Unique variables were selected for each thermal class using a Bayesian variable selection method. The variables were then used in development of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) models of EPT, FIBI, HBI, and IBI. ANFIS model accuracy improved when accounting for stream thermal class rather than developing a global model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Ulan Buh Desert (UBD), in southwestern Inner Mongolia, is one of the main dune fields and dust source areas in northern China. The formation of the desert and associated environmental changes since the middle Pleistocene are still unclear due to a lack of depositional records and environmental proxy index analyses. In this study, quartz and K-feldspar optical dating, environmental proxy indexes of grain size, loss on ignition, pollen, and ostracod analysis were employed to supplement the sediment record of a 120.5 m drill core, WL12ZK-1, from the southern UBD. In combination with previous stratigraphic records obtained from drill cores WL10ZK-1 (35 m deep) and WL10ZK-2 (32 m deep) from the northern UBD, and drill core WL12ZK-2 (80 m deep) from the northeastern UBD, these proxies indicate there has been essentially an arid environment in the UBD, with desert or steppe vegetation, since the middle Pleistocene, and that sand dunes were widely distributed in the UBD beginning at least similar to 230 ka ago. The Yellow River filled a freshwater paleolake beginning similar to 15 ka ago that covered both the UBD and the adjacent Hetao Plain. The paleolake lasted until similar to 87 ka, and was associated with wetlands along its margins. Steppe vegetation was present in the surrounding region. An arid environment appeared again after 87 ka, and there is no evidence of a large stable lake in the UBD at any time thereafter. Sand dune deposition and a very arid desert environment were present throughout the last glacial period and lasted into the early Holocene. During the Holocene these arid conditions were interrupted by minor wetland intervals. Deserts in southern Inner Mongolia formed at least since the middle Pleistocene, expanded during the last glaciation and into the early Holocene and again after similar to 2 ka. We suggest that a combination of tectonic activity and climate change may be responsible for desert formation and environmental changes in southern Inner Mongolia since the middle Pleistocene, with additional human influence exacerbating these conditions in the late Holocene.

AB  - Larval and early juvenile fish living in temperate environments with limited resources face conflicting metabolic demands. To optimise their survival probability, fish must balance the need to out-grow predators by maximising their growth, while also accumulating sufficient energy reserves to sustain them through winter. We tested the hypothesis that resource allocation in Chrysophrys auratus changed from maximising growth to maximising energy storage over their first summer-autumn by measuring recent growth rates from otolith increments, and lipid, protein and carbohydrate concentrations in fish. Lipid concentrations showed the greatest change over the growing season, increasing three-fold between summer and mid-autumn. Growth rates showed the opposite trend, being significantly lower in mid-autumn than in summer. The relationships between growth rate and lipid or protein concentrations were consistent with a shift in resource allocation from growth to storage. During summer and early autumn, growth rates were independent of protein or lipid concentrations, but during mid-autumn there were significant positive correlations between the variables. Biochemical concentrations were independent of fish size, indicating that the accumulation of sufficient energy reserves for winter is determined by the timing of settlement and subsequent feeding conditions, which are likely to affect interannual recruitment variability of this important species.

AB  - Wedge clams Donax trunculus inhabit high-energy environments along sandy coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Two sites were sampled monthly, one in Morocco (Mehdia), where the density was normal, and one in France (Biscarosse), where the density was very low. We tested the hypothesis that the difference in density between the sites was related to infection by the trematode parasite Bacciger bacciger. Identity of both the parasite and the host were verified using anatomical and molecular criteria. Parasite prevalence (i. e. the percentage of parasitized clams) was almost 3 times higher at Biscarosse. At this site, overall prevalence reached 32% in July and was correlated with the migration of several individuals (with a prevalence of 88%) to the sediment surface. After this peak, prevalence decreased rapidly, suggesting death of parasitized clams. The deleterious effect of B. bacciger on wedge clams was also supported by our calculations indicating that the weight of the parasite made up to 56% of the total weight of the parasitized clams. However, condition indices of trematode-free clams were also lower in Biscarosse than in Mehdia or other sites, suggesting that other factors such as pollutants or microparasites (Microcytos sp.) may alter wedge clam population fitness in Biscarosse.

AB  - The vegetation of dolomite grasslands used as sheep pastures in the Transdanubian part of Hungary was investigated. Besides grazing, the sampling sites were loaded with some anthropogenic influences (trampling, artillary activity, abandonment) as well. Parallel with the grazed pastures, some abandoned grassland areas were also investigated. 2x2 m sampling quadrats were used in open and closed grasslands alike. In addition to the phytosociological records, including the abundances of the species present, coenotaxa and nature conservation values, which are all good indicators of the state of naturalness of the grasslands, the soil characteristics of the areas were also evaluated. Our results suggest that the vegetation of open grasslands resists better to the strong anthropogenic impacts (grazing, artillary activity). As a result of similar influences, closed grasslands get completely degraded: several weed and poisonous species increase their abundances, the dominant graminoid species get exchanged, the nature conservation value of the area decreases, and, at last, the grassland almost disappears. In these areas grazing has to be diminished. Although with decreased abundances, the constituent plant species of the open grasslands survive even the impacts of intensive grazing and artillary activity. Overgrazing of grasslands results in more significant degradation in the natural state of the area than its regular burning down as a result of artillary activity. The total abandonment of the area results in strong shrubification and homogenization of the species composition.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of straws with manures has been found effective to mitigate heavy metal risks in manure-derived biochars. This study further investigated co-pyrolysis strategy on the levels, species and risks of metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Cd) carried by manure-based biochars through co-pyrolyzing swine manure (SM) and corn straw (CS) with different mixture ratios (1:0, 0:1, 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3, w/w) at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C. The total heavy metals in SM biochars were significantly reduced by CS addition except when SM/CS ratio was 3:1 at 300 degrees C. Notably, CS addition increased stable Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd, but simultaneously mobilized part of Ni, Zn, Cu and Pb in SM biochars, especially at higher CS ratio and higher temperature. Co-pyrolysis converted less stable Cd to more stable Cd at all pyrolysis conditions, with higher CS ratio and higher temperature more effective. Overall, higher temperature (700 degrees C) and higher addition ratio of CS (SM/CS 1:3) were more favorable for mitigating the potential ecological index of biochar-bearing Cd, Cu and Zn, the dominating risky contributor to SM biochars, hence more effective to mitigate the overall environmental risks of heavy metals in the derived SM biochars.

AB  - The participation of local governments is one of the determining factors for achieving the objectives of sustainable development, whereby municipalities must have planning, assessment, control instruments, and indicators which will lead to proper environmental management and sustainable development. In this respect the existing models of sustainability indicators reflect, mainly, the state of the environment. However, these indicators do not allow the identification of the state of the environment's direct responsible actors and do not contribute towards the formulation of specific objectives and goals for each of the responsible actors. Furthermore, the sustainable development indicators are elaborated and measured by higher level entities, and are aimed towards a regional and national level, using a top-down approach. In this context, this paper proposes a model of environmental management indicators that lets us observe the state of the environment and identifies those responsible for that state. The set of indicators was developed in the municipalities of the department of Narino, Colombia, through a participatory bottom-up approach which includes: the vision and needs of the stakeholders, who are responsible for the information, and the vision of the regional control organisms. Thus, a set of 40 environmental management indicators was formulated, and a framework to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the local environmental management was proposed. Their application indicates that a majority of the municipalities are in a weak environmental management situation and it lets the stakeholders critically analyze their performance through the set of indicators and also identify areas for improvement.

AB  - PCBs were analyzed in raft mussels cultured in several polygons from Galician Rias (Rias of Ares-Betanzos, Muros-Noia, Arousa, Pontevedra and Vigo) during the period 1998-2013. The main aim of this work is study the quality of culture marine environment in relation to PCBs compounds. We report the results of a monitoring. The mean levels of Sigma PCBs (ten congeners) ranged from 7.41 to 59.50 ng g(-1) dw. The isomer concentrations in the Mytilus galloprovincialis cultured in raft were in the order hexachlorobiphenyls > pentachlorobiphenyls > tetrachlorbiphenyls > trichlorobiphenyls. Some biological parameters of mussel were also investigated (shell length, lipid content and condition index) in order to know their influence on ability of PCBs accumulation. ANOVA analysis confirms that levels of most of congeners had a significant relation (p < 0.05) with shell length. The geographical patterns and temporal variations of PCBs were also investigated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed differences between geographic areas (Rias) in the distribution of PCBs levels. Samples coming from Rias of Vigo and Ares-Betanzos presented the highest levels of PCBs and samples from Rias of Arousa and Muros-Noia had the lowest levels of these compounds. Time trends (linear regressions) showed a decline of levels of PCB congeners along the period 1998-2013. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Refining best management practices (BMPs) for future highway construction depends on a comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts from current construction methods. Based on a before-after-control impact (BACI) experimental design, long-term stream monitoring (1997-2006) was conducted at upstream (as control, n = 3) and downstream (as impact, n = 6) sites in the Lost River watershed of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region, West Virginia. Monitoring data were analyzed to assess impacts of during and after highway construction on 15 water quality parameters and macroinvertebrate condition using the West Virginia stream condition index (WVSCI). Principal components analysis (PCA) identified regional primary water quality variances, and paired t tests and time series analysis detected seven highway construction-impacted water quality parameters which were mainly associated with the second principal component. In particular, impacts on turbidity, total suspended solids, and total iron during construction, impacts on chloride and sulfate during and after construction, and impacts on acidity and nitrate after construction were observed at the downstream sites. The construction had statistically significant impacts on macroinvertebrate index scores (i.e., WVSCI) after construction, but did not change the overall good biological condition. Implementing BMPs that address those construction-impacted water quality parameters can be an effective mitigation strategy for future highway construction in this highlands region.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), the increased variation of bilateral symmetry in a sample of individuals, can indicate disturbance in developmental stability caused by environmental and/or genomic stress. This developmental instability was analyzed in Drosophila subobscura maintained for seven generations on two different concentrations of lead in laboratory conditions. The FA4 index showed that the genotypes reared on the higher lead concentration were in developmental homeostasis, except for males in the F7 generation, for both wing size parameters. The results show that different degrees of lead pollution cause different responses to selection of the exposed population in laboratory conditions.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the hydrochemical composition and geoecological features and to assess the level and nature of anthropogenic pollution in the Yesil river basin.
   Methodology : Field studies are an integral part of observation and analysis of landscape components. Sample analysis of chemical composition of the Yesil river basin water was conducted in July-August 2016 to ascertain the current state of geo-environmental pollution of the basin water.
   Results: Reduction of river water causes sharp deterioration in the sanitary condition of river. Great harm is caused by pollution by industrial, agricultural, municipal and domestic sewage. However, there is an increased content of SO4, NO, and NO2, Fe and total salinity of water.
   Interpretation: Systematic analysis of water quality in the Yesil indicates that the river copes with pollution mainly by the self-cleaning processes. Comparative analysis of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the Yesil river basin water surface indicates the presence of some of their relationship. The solution to the problem of stabilization and improvement of the ecological state of the Yesil river basin geosystems, under intensive anthropogenic impact, requires maximum consideration of the specific nature condition and the analysis of key factors and processes that affect its condition.

AB  - We applied an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) used on Wisconsin/Minnesota waters of the upper Mississippi River (UMR) to compare data from two systemic sampling programmes. Ability to use data from multiple sampling programmes could extend spatial and temporal coverage of river assessment and monitoring efforts. We normalized for effort and tested fish community data collected by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program-Great Rivers Ecosystems (EMAP-GRE) 20042006 and the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP) 19932006. Each programme used daytime electrofishing along main channel borders but with some methodological and design differences. EMAP-GRE, designed for baseline and, eventually, compliance monitoring, used a probabilistic, continuous design. LTRMP, designed primarily for baseline and trend monitoring, used a stratified random design in five discrete study reaches. Analysis of similarity indicated no significant difference between EMAP-GRE and LTRMP IBI scores (n?=?238; Global R?=?-0.052; significance level?=?0.972). Both datasets distinguished clear differences only between Fair and Poor condition categories, potentially supporting a passfail assessment strategy. Thirteen years of LTRMP data demonstrated stable IBI scores through time in four of five reaches sampled. LTRMP and EMAP-GRE IBI scores correlated along the UMR's upstream to downstream gradient (df [3, 25]; F?=?1.61; p?=?0.22). A decline in IBI scores from upstream to downstream was consistent with UMR fish community studies and a previous, empirically modelled human disturbance gradient. Comparability between EMAP-GRE (best upstream to downstream coverage) and LTRMP data (best coverage over time and across the floodplain) supports a next step of developing and testing a systemic, multi-metric fish index on the UMR that both approaches could inform.

AB  - The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) has proven to be an important assessment tool for evaluating the resource quality of aquatic ecosystems. We used a modified IBI for Great Rivers based on collections from the Wabash River in west-central Indiana. We evaluated natural, inherent variation in natural phenomena, gear effects and land use modification over a 20-year period. Sixty-three stations distributed through 260 km of river were sampled 2-3 times per year to evaluate fish community structure and function. Natural changes in variation included temporal variation, hydrologic cycle and recruitment. Our results suggest that removing gizzard shad, whose population levels fluctuate widely, from percentage metrics enhanced assessment and exposed subtle affects. IBI scores consistently declined in a downstream direction. IBI profiles based on numbers were almost always higher than those using biomass, but patterns corresponded well for both metric systems. Combining biomass catches by seining and electrofishing did not substantially change the observed patterns compared to numeric electrofishing catches. The large number of small species taken by seining overwhelmed the subtle patterns observed at least impacted stations, but greater departures in quality were evident at impaired downstream locations. Floods decimated fish communities throughout the river. Fish moved out of stressed areas during severe droughts and into areas near clean tributaries. Certain structured attributes of Great River fish communities showed statistically significant changes based on ecoregion scales. Total number of species, number of sensitive species, number of centrarchid species and percentage of simple lithophils declined between the Corn Belt Plain and Interior River Lowland ecoregions, but water quality factors might also be influential. These changes in metric attributes lowered IBI scores by 6-10 cumulative points.

AB  - The data on distribution of small mammals based on the materials of multiyear (1966-1998) investigations in Yaroslavl region are analyzed. Biotopic distinctions in the species composition and its dynamics are revealed. The most significant differences are found between native forest cenoses and biotopes of anthropogenic origin. The state of small mammals in native forests is stipulated by the environmental conditions and the degree of transforming their habitats under influence of human activity. For the last 30 years, a trend of increasing the share of hemisynanthropic species among rodents is noted. These species are considered as indicators of the environmental state in central Russia.

AB  - Cascade dams have exerted significant effects on river ecosystems. To quantitatively assess dam-induced effects on river ecological status, a novel multi-species interaction-based index of biotic integrity (Mt-IBI) was developed. Benthic microbiota was selected as a bio-indicator for its sensitivity to the environmental disturbance. An environmental DNA metabarcoding tool was used to identify microbiota (bacteria, protozoan, and metazoan). The Mt-IBI was applied to assess the ecological status of the Hanjiang River, a representative dam-affected river in China. Fifteen sampling sites along the Hanjiang River were sampled in June 2018. Seven core metrics were screened from a total of 364 candidate metrics to calculate the value of the Mt-IBI. The Mt-IBI of the Hanjiang River ranged from 1.90 to 6.39, with a mean value of 4.02. The mean values of Mt-IBI at the reservoir and riverine side of dams were 2.11 and 3.81, respectively. The downstream reach without dam constructions had the highest mean Mt-IBI (5.79). Thus, the continuity of the river was strongly related to the Mt-IBI. Structural equation models (SEMs) were further established to identify the dominant environmental variables in the damaffected river. The SEMs indicated that flow velocity (coefficient 0.749) was the most important determinant of ecological status in the Hanjiang River. Water organic matter also played a vital role in determining the ecological status of the Hanjiang River, and exerted the strongest direct effect (P < 0.001, r = 0.712). The reliability of SEMs was verified by building a support vector regression model (R2 = 0.8141). This study can provide new tools for ecological assessment and diagnosis, and provide a new perspective for the management of cascade dams.

AB  - This paper presents the results of cost effectiveness (CE) analysis of vegetative filter strips (VFS) and instrearn half-logs as tools for recovering scores on a fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) in the upper Wabash River watershed (UW) in Indiana. Three assumptions were made about recovery time for IBI scores (5, 15, and 30 years) and social discount rates (1, 3, and 5 percent), which were tested for sensitivity of the estimated CE ratios. Effectiveness of VFS was estimated using fish IBIs and riparian forest cover from 49 first-order to fifth-order stream reaches. Half-log structures had been installed for approximately two years in the UW prior to the study and provided a basis for estimates of cost and maintenance. Cost effectiveness ratios for VFS decreased from $387 to $277 per 100 m for a 1 percent increase in IBI scores from first- to fifth-order streams with 3 percent discount and 30-year recovery. This cost weighted by proportion of stream orders was $360. The ratio decreased with decreasing time of recovery and discount rate. Based on installation costs and an assumption of equal recovery rates, half-logs were two-thirds to one-half as cost-effective as VFS. Half-logs would be a cost-effective supplement to VFS in low order streams if they can be proven to recover IBI scores faster than VFS do. This study provides baseline data and a framework for planning and determining the cost of stream restoration.

AB  - Biodiversity is an increasingly important aspect of wine production. The assessment of agro-ecosystem biodiversity is highly complex due to the heterogeneity of the elements involved in the evaluation. For this reason, wine companies have expressed a need for a decision support system (DSS) capable of dealing with this complexity, integrating assessments referring to the whole production system within a single tool. In this study a DSS developed for wine sector biodiversity management assessment is introduced. The DSS, called BIOPASS (R), is made up of different sections relating to three compartments in the winemaking process (the soil, the vine and wine). Assessment of the physical, chemical and biological components of soil is a key element of the DSS. We investigate the relationship between biological soil quality (represented by the QBS-ar index), environmental conditions and the type of farming (organic or conventional). 70 soil samples were analysed in different Italian viticultural contexts. The model highlighted the relationships between QBS-ar and meteorological variables (air temperature and precipitation) as well as a positive relationship with organic farming systems. These results provide useful information for understanding agroecosystem biodiversity and will be integrated within the DSS for assessment of soil quality.

AB  - The ability of the invasive mussel Xenostrobus securis to activate defence mechanisms in response to the novel predatory dogwhelk Nucella lapillus was explored using field-and laboratory-based approaches. The importance of the origin of mussels was investigated in relation to different environmental conditions and levels of predation pressure (high and low). In the field, the responses of mussels were clearly asymmetrical: only individuals caged with dogwhelks at the site of high predation risk underwent phenotypical changes (stronger attachment, thicker shells and heavier adductor muscle). In contrast, shell growth was faster in mussels held in cages without dogwhelks at the high predation-risk site, suggesting trade-off patterns between growth and other energy-demanding actions. Nevertheless, X. securis activated inducible morphological defences without any detrimental effect on soft tissue growth (i.e. condition index). In the laboratory, the role of temperature on phenotypic responses of mussels exposed to dogwhelk was also evaluated. Mussels originally from the site of low predation risk showed a weaker response to the predator N. lapillus, probably because of difficulties in correctly identifying predator cues. At higher temperatures, mussels secreted stronger byssal threads regardless of their origin, while condition was poorer, shells thinner and gametogenesis activated more rapidly, particularly in the presence of dogwhelks. In summary, X. securis appears to be highly capable of activating protective mechanisms in marine environments within its geographical range of expansion through improved fitness.

AB  - For decades, global climate change has directly and indirectly affected the structure and function of ecosystems. Abrupt changes in biodiversity have been observed in response to linear or sudden modifications to the environment. These abrupt shifts can cause long-term reorganizations within ecosystems, with communities exhibiting new functional responses to environmental factors. Over the last 3 decades, the Gironde estuary in southwest France has experienced 2 abrupt shifts in both the physical and chemical environments and the pelagic community. Rather than describing these shifts and their origins, we focused on the 3 inter-shift periods, describing the structure of the fish community and its relationship with the environment during these periods. We described fish biodiversity using a limited set of descriptors, taking into account both species composition and relative species abundances. Inter-shift ecosystem states were defined based on the relationship between this description and the hydro-physico-chemical variables and climatic indices defining the main features of the environment. This relationship was described using generalized linear mixed models on the entire time series and for each inter-shift period. Our results indicate that (1) the fish community structure has been significantly modified, (2) environmental drivers influencing fish diversity have changed during these 3 periods, and (3) the fish-environment relationships have been modified over time. From this, we conclude a regime shift has occurred in the Gironde estuary. We also highlight that anthropogenic influences have increased, which re-emphasizes the importance of local management in maintaining fish diversity and associated goods and services within the context of climate change.

AB  - Ocean acidification and warming may threaten future seafood production, safety and quality by negatively impacting the fitness of marine species. Identifying changes in nutritional quality, as well as species most at risk, is crucial if societies are to secure food production. Here, changes in the biochemical composition and nutritional properties of the commercially valuable oysters, Magallana gigas and Ostrea edulis, were evaluated following a 12-week exposure to six ocean acidification and warming scenarios that were designed to reflect the temperature (+ 3 degrees C above ambient) and atmospheric pCO(2) conditions (increase of 350-600 ppm) predicted for the mid-to end-of-century. Results suggest that O. edulis, and especially M. gigas, are likely to become less nutritious (i.e. containing lower levels of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), and have reduced caloric content under ocean acidification and warming. Important changes to essential mineral composition under ocean acidification and warming were evident in both species; enhanced accumulation of copper in M. gigas may be of concern regarding consumption safety. In light of these findings, the aquaculture industry may wish to consider a shift in focus toward species that are most robust to climate change and less prone to deterioration in quality, in order to secure future food provision and socio-economic benefits of aquaculture.

AB  - Ocean acidification and hypoxia are concurrent in some coastal waters due to anthropogenic activities in the past decades. In the natural environment, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) may fluctuate and follow diel-cycling patterns, but such effects on marine animals have not been comprehensively studied compared to their constant effects. In order to study the effects of diel-cycling seawater acidification and hypoxia on the fitness of marine bivalves, the thick shell mussels Mytilus coruscus were exposed to two constant levels of dissolved oxygen (2 mg/L, 8 mg/L) under two pH treatments (7.3, 8.1), as well as single diel fluctuating pH or DO, and the combined diel fluctuating of pH and DO for three weeks. The experimental results showed that constant acidification and hypoxia significantly reduced the extracellular pH (pH(e)) and condition index (CI) of mussels, and significantly increased HCO3, pCO(2) and standard metabolic rate (SMR). Diel fluctuating hypoxia and acidification also significantly reduced the pHe and CI, and significantly increased pCO(2) and SMR, but had no significant effects on HCO3. However, the diel-cycling acidification and hypoxia resulted in a higher CI compared to continuous exposure. In general, continuous and intermittent stress negatively impact the hemolymph and growth performance of mussels. However, mussels possess a little stronger resistance to diel-cycling seawater acidification and hypoxia than sustained stress. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The detectability of grapevine-leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the domestic grapevine cultivar Sakasly, grown over two successive years in the Sahara, at Rjim-Maatoug in Tunisia. Self-rooted cuttings, infected with GLRaV-3 were cultivated and the presence of the virus was checked over 2 years and compared with controls. During the first year, 80% of the originally infected vines were negative for GLRaV-3 using ELISA. After the second year, 93% and 95% of these plants were negative for GLRaV-3 using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, rooted cuttings derived from GLRaV-3-negative plants and grown under controlled conditions in a greenhouse (at 16-20 degrees C) were ELISA-negative in most cases (84%). In addition, biological indexing on Vitis vinifera cv. Gamay Rouge de la Loire showed no leafroll symptoms on this indicator in 92% of the grafted vines. These results suggest a naturally occurring heat therapy in the Tunisian Sahara, which could be of practical importance for the production of GLRaV-3-free grapevine cuttings, especially as scale insect and mealybug vectors have not been observed in this area.

AB  - Many important geomorphic and ecological attributes center on soil water content, especially over long timescales. In this paper we present an ordinally based index, intended to generally reflect the amount of water that a soil supplies to plants under natural conditions, over long timescales. The Natural Soil Drainage Index (DI) ranges from 0 for the driest soils (e. g., those shallow to bedrock in a desert) to 99 (open water). The DI is primarily derived from a soil's taxonomic subgroup classification, which is a reflection of its long-term wetness. Because the DI assumes that soils in drier climates and with deeper water tables have less plant-useable water, taxonomic indicators such as soil moisture regime and natural drainage class figure prominently in the "base" DI formulation. Additional factors that can impact soil water content, quality, and/or availability (e. g., texture), when also reflected in taxonomy, are quantified and added to or subtracted from the base DI to arrive at a final DI value. In GIS applications, map unit slope gradient can be added as an additional variable. The index has myriad applications in forestry, ecology, geomorphology, and environmental modeling, especially when examined spatially; we provide some examples in this paper. The DI has great potential for many landscape-scale modeling and GIS applications where soil water content is an important variable. DI values for all soils currently classified by the NRCS can be accessed from pull-down menus on the DI web site: http://www.drainageindex.msu.edu/

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - MISUSE
AB  - The precise nature of the allometric relationships between body size and body mass, water content and solid matter was derived from a sample of over 700 lizards of the agamid species Amphibolurus nuchalis (= Ctenophorus inermis), collected during 1969-82 at Shark Bay in Western Australia. Three condition indices relating each variable to body size, as expressed by snout-vent length, were derived from these allometric relationships for male, female and juvenile lizards. The formation of condition indices was compared to analysis of covariance as a method of analysis of such data. Variation in these indices with weather and season over the period of the study were investigated by means of regression models. Variation between days within trips was relatively small, suggesting a time scale for physiological change of greater than 3-4 days. Ascribing cause to specific weather and seasonal factors was difficult, due to the high colinearity of the explanatory variables. The influence of temperature and rainfall on the condition indices was evident in the model, however, and accords well with physiological data for this species. The extent to which the condition indices could be predicted by a combination of weather and seasonal variables was encouraging, and suggests that the method may have general utility in the study of changes in body composition and condition of free-ranging animals.

AB  - The broad-scale assessment of natural resource conditions (e.g., rangeland health, restoration needs) requires knowledge of their spatial distribution. We argue that creating a database that links state-and-transition models (STMs) to spatial units is a valuable management tool for structuring ground-based observations, management planning for landscapes, and for housing information on the responses of land areas to management actions. To address this need, we introduce a multifactor classification system based on ecological sites and STMs that is directly linked to recent concepts of vegetation dynamics in rangelands. We describe how this classification was used as a basis for creating a spatial database and maps of ecological states. We provide an example of how the classification and mapping has been applied in over 1.2 million ha of public rangelands in southern New Mexico using aerial photo interpretation supplemented with existing inventory data and rapid field assessments. The resulting state map has been used by the Bureau of Land Management: 1) to design landscape-level shrub control efforts, 2) to structure and report district-wide rangeland health assessments, and 3) to evaluate locations for energy development. We conclude by discussing options for the development of state maps and their current limitations, including the use of satellite imagery and concepts for defining states. We argue that cataloging ecological states in a spatial context has clear benefits for rangeland managers because it connects STM concepts to specific land areas. State mapping provides a means to generate and store spatially explicit data resulting from tests of the propositions in STMs and conservation practices.

AB  - Nanostructures such as nanotubes and nanosheets are widely used in the medical industry for drug delivery, prevention, and treatment. These nanostructures are used as sensors or carriers by adsorbing functional groups. In this study, the adsorption rates of the bromochlorodifluoromethane (CBrClF2) molecule, which is used as an effective gaseous fire suppression agent, onto the outer surfaces of pristine, Al, Ga, P, and As-doped boron nitride nanotubes are investigated. A periodic boundary condition density functional theory method using both Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof exchange-correlation (PBEPBE) and B3LYP-D3 functionals together with the 6-311G (d) basis set were used. Subsequently, the B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, omega B97XD, and M06-2X functionals with the 6-311G (d) basis set were used to consider the single-point energies. Natural bond orbital analysis and the quantum theory of atoms in molecule were considered using the PBEPBE/6-311G (d) method, and the results were compatible with the expected electronic properties, namely the Wiberg bond index, natural charge, natural electron configuration, donor-acceptor natural bond orbital interactions, and second-order perturbation energies. All the calculations and analyses denoted that the adsorption of the CBrClF2 molecule onto the surfaces of pristine boron nitride nanotubes occurred due to physical adsorption and van der Waals interactions. Among the doped nanotubes, the Al nanotube exhibited the highest adsorption energy compared to the other doped nanotubes.

AB  - This study examined an offshore submerged mussel longline system, in the Black Sea, from May 2009 to May 2010. The system was allowed 1year for spat collection. After a 1-year spat collection period, some spat collectors were left untouched (NS), and some spat collectors were grazed and socked (S) for a grow-out study in May 2009. The effects of stocking density on the growth and survival of the S and NS mussels were examined. The biochemical composition of the mussels was also determined. Environmental factors including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, total suspended matter, inorganic matter and organic matter were monitored monthly during the experimental period. In May 2010, the mean length and live weight of the S and NS mussels were 60.46 +/- 0.60mm and 53.34 +/- 0.37mm, respectively, and 20.50 +/- 0.50g and 13.11 +/- 0.26g respectively. Mean moisture and ash were 82.35 +/- 0.47% and 6.67 +/- 0.44% respectively. Mean carbohydrate, protein and lipid were 27.74 +/- 2.40%, 57.68 +/- 2.15% and 7.91 +/- 0.68% respectively. These results indicate that a submerged offshore mussel culture system in the Black Sea can be commercially convenient. In addition, stock management via thinning out of the spat can considerably increase the marketable size of mussels, reduce harvest time and produce better growth.

AB  - Contaminants of emerging concern, particularly endocrine active compounds (EACs), have been identified as a threat to aquatic wildlife. However, little is known about the impact of EACs on lakes through groundwater from onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). This study aims to identify specific contributions of OWTS to Sullivan Lake, Minnesota, USA. Lake hydrology, water chemistry, caged bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), and larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) exposures were used to assess whether EACs entered the lake through OWTS inflow and the resultant biological impact on fish. Study areas included two OWTS-influenced near-shore sites with native bluegill spawning habitats and two in-lake control sites without nearby EAC sources. Caged bluegill sunfish were analyzed for plasma vitellogenin concentrations, organosomatic indices, and histological pathologies. Surface and porewater was collected from each site and analyzed for EACs. Porewater was also collected for laboratory exposure of larval fathead minnow, before analysis of predator escape performance and gene expression profiles. Chemical analysis showed EACs present at low concentrations at each study site, whereas discrete variations were reported between sites and between summer and fall samplings. Body condition index and liver vacuolization of sunfish were found to differ among study sites as did gene expression in exposed larval fathead minnows. Interestingly, biological exposure data and water chemistry did not match. Therefore, although results highlight the potential impacts of seepage from OWTS, further investigation of mixture effects and life history factor as well as chemical fate is warranted.

AB  - Fish otolith increment biochronologies can reveal factors contributing to growth. These annually resolved, multidecadal biochronologies have been used to identify temporal and spatial patterns in growth variability. Here, we used a linear mixed modeling approach to determine the relative importance of intrinsic factors (e.g., sex, age) and extrinsic factors (e.g., temperature, abundance of con-specifics and competitors) to growth of Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), a commercially important groundfish dominant in the Aleutian Islands ecosystem. A yearly alternating pattern of wide and narrow increments was observed, and was negatively correlated with abundance of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), suggesting possible competition over shared food resources such as large copepods (which were positively correlated with the otolith biochronology). There was no detectable effect of temperature on otolith growth, which could be a result of relative stability in water temperatures at the study site. We also contrast the otolith biochronology with a body condition index to examine the relationship between otolith and somatic growth. This represents the first otolith biochronology developed in the Aleutian Islands and provides insight into potential species interactions and their impacts on growth within this highly dynamic and productive ecosystem.

AB  - Observed phenotypic variation in living organisms is shaped by genomes, environment, and their interactions. Flowering time under natural conditions can showcase the diverse outcome of the gene-environment interplay. However, identifying hidden patterns and specific factors underlying phenotypic plasticity under natural field conditions remains challenging. With a genetic population showing dynamic changes in flowering time, here we show that the integrated analyses of genomic responses to diverse environments is powerful to reveal the underlying genetic architecture. Specifically, the effect continuum of individual genes (Ma(l), Ma(6), FT, and ELF3) was found to vary in size and in direction along an environmental gradient that was quantified by photothermal time, a combination of two environmental factors (photoperiod and temperature). Gene-gene interaction was also contributing to the observed phenotypic plasticity. With the identified environmental index to quantitatively connect environments, a systematic genome-wide performance prediction framework was established through either genotype-specific reaction-norm parameters or genome-wide marker-effect continua. These parallel genome-wide approaches were demonstrated for in-season and on-target performance prediction by simultaneously exploiting genomics, environment profiling, and performance information. Improved understanding of mechanisms for phenotypic plasticity enables a concerted exploration that turns challenge into opportunity.

AB  - The existence of glass ceilings and sticky floors suggests that disadvantaged workers will be under-represented in some parts of the income distribution, and over-represented in others. We present a representation index that measures the prevalence of population subgroups in different regions of the income (or any other) distribution. Our representation index is easily generalized to condition on characteristics (such as age, education, etc). Further, it generalizes naturally to an index of the severity (or cost) of under-representation to group members, which is based on dollar-weighted representation. Both representation and severity indices are easily calculated via existing regression techniques. We illustrate the approach using Canadian Census data on the earnings of ethnic minorities.

AB  - The index of biotic integrity (IBI) is a commonly used bioassessment tool that integrates abundance and richness measures to assess water quality. In developing IBIs that are both responsive to human disturbance and resistant to natural variability and sampling error, water managers must decide how to weigh information about rare and abundant taxa, which in turn requires an understanding of the sensitivity of indices to rare taxa. Herein, we investigated the influence of rare fish taxa (within the lower 5% of rank abundance curves) on IBI metric and total scores for stream sites in two of Minnesota's major river basins, the St. Croix (n = 293 site visits) and Upper Mississippi (a = 210 site visits). We artificially removed rare taxa from biological samples by (1) separately excluding each individual taxon that fell within the lower 5% of rank abundance curves: (2) simultaneously excluding all taxa that had an abundance of one (singletons) or two (doubletons): and (3) simultaneously excluding all taxa that fell within the lower 5% of rank abundance curves. We then compared IBI metric and total scores before and after removal of rare taxa using the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) and regression analysis. The difference in 161 metric and total scores increased as more taxa were removed. Moreover, when multiple rare taxa were removed, the nRMSE was related to sample abundance and to total taxa richness, with greater nRMSE observed in samples with a larger number of taxa or sample abundance. Metrics based on relative abundance of fish taxa were less sensitive to the loss of rare taxa, whereas those based on taxa richness were more sensitive, because taxa richness metrics give more weight to rare taxa compared to the relative abundance metrics.

AB  - We describe a process for developing an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for resident fish communities in an ecoregion that exhibits low natural species richness. From 1990 to 2006, fish community samples were collected by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality (NCDWQ) at 36 sample sites in the Cape Fear, Lumber, and Yadkin river basins within the Sandhills region of North Carolina. The NCDWQ does not currently have an IBI capable of distinguishing significant differences between reference and non-reference streams. To develop a more robust method of measuring responses to anthropogenic disturbance, we delineated contributing watersheds for each of the 36 sample sites using a geographic information system, hydrologic modeling, and 20-foot-resolution digital elevation models derived from light-detection and ranging data. The 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and in situ habitat data were used to determine various land-use/land-cover and hydrologic variables within each watershed. These variables were then used to select the sites with absolute minimal anthropogenic impacts. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to identify 11 fish-community metrics, 2 chemical metrics, and 9 individual species that were significantly different between reference and non-reference sites. Of the final 15 metrics, only 3 exhibited higher values in reference streams. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and richness of the Sandhills fish fauna are greater in areas more highly impacted by anthropogenic activities. By automating the process by which reference sites are chosen, we were able to produce a multi-metric IBI that reflects the varying levels of anthropogenic impacts on wadeable streams in the Sandhills.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of environmental integrity and the potential as bioindicator of larval stages of species of Trichoptera in 20 streams of first to fourth order in the Pindaiba river basin, Mato Grosso, Central Brazil. We measured stream integrity with the habitat integrity index (HII), establishing three levels of conservation: preserved, altered and impacted environments. We used (i) simple regression to assess the effect of habitat integrity on species abundance of Trichoptera and (ii) the indicator species analysis (IndVal) to assess the potential as bioindicator of each species. We found that 12 morphospecies showed relationship with HII: six species were bioindicators of preserved and two species of altered environments. Morphospecies that showed relationship in the two analyses (i and ii) were considered strong bioindicators, considering that the other species supported higher environmental variation, becoming evident that loss of physical structure reduces the abundance of organisms specialized in preserved environments. The results showed that the distribution and abundance of trichopterans can be an indicator of habitat integrity. Trichopteran species have bioindicator potential, corroborating the hypotheses of this work that abundance of organisms will be smaller in environments with low integrity, and that many species are specific to preserved environments, disappearing from impacted environments, and also characteristic species of altered environments.

A casein supplemented surimi diet produced significant growth (instantaneous growth rate 0.4-0.8% body weight). The digestive gland-to-body weight ratio increased and the cuttlebone-to-body weight ratio decreased significantly in relation to instantaneous growth rate. The RNA content of mantle muscle increased significantly, while the DNA content of mantle muscle did not change in relation to instantaneous growth rate. Mantle muscle protein content was depleted in cuttlefish with instantaneous growth rate less than or equal to 0. No compensatory food consumption, food conversion or growth was observed for cuttlefish fed surimi;diets after refeeding them with a natural diet (thawed raw shrimp). Digestive gland and cuttlebone-to-body weight ratios, and RNA content in mantle muscle could be used as short-term indicators of instantaneous growth rate and condition of cuttlefish. Mantle muscle protein content could be used as a long-term indicator.

AB  - Despite the economic importance of sand bass, Paralabrax maculatofasciatus, little information regarding its reproductive aspects is known. In this study, gonadal maturity stage, biological indexes, proximate gonad composition and sex ratio proportion were determined. A total of 30 wild spotted sand bass were monthly obtained from March 2017 to February 2018. Organisms were measured, weighted and dissected in order to obtain the condition factor (K), hepatosomatic index (IHS) and gonadosomatic index (IGS). A small portion of gonad was preserved to perform the histological procedure, and stained with Harris' hematoxilineosin technique. The results indicate that somatic indexes were significantly affected (P<0.05) in terms of IHS and IGS. Histological analysis showed the presence of ripe males in April and from October to November, and for females, the presence of developed organisms was observed in April and from October to December. Additionally, the presence of transitional organisms from female to male was observed. The proximate analysis showed the maximum crude fat value in April, which coincides with the lowest moisture value. Sex proportion showed a significant male dominance. These data provide valuable information for the development of protection programs to encourage a sustainable fishery of the species.

AB  - The present work provides the first results in heavy metal bioaccumulation in the autochthonous mussel Brachidontes rodriguezii from the Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina), one of the most important coastal environments of South America, subjected to different anthropogenic pressure. The study is based on the detection of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe in mussels' soft tissue and sediments' fine fraction by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), in order to analyze the potential relationship between both components of the aquatic system. Additionally, different indices are calculated with the purpose of obtaining detailed data. The heavy metal burden in mussels varied seasonally, showing a clearer pattern for the stations located in the internal area of the estuary. Metals exhibited maximum values in summer and to a lesser extent in winter, followed by a decrease during spring. Multiple international guideline assessment allowed classifying the area as moderately polluted, including a low range for Cd and medium for Cu and Pb. Moreover, the average detected levels were within the measured ranges in other coastal areas. Regarding human health, trace metal content in mussels met the national and international standards for safe consumption.

AB  - The present study evaluated the replacement of fishmeal (FM) by blends of alternative protein sources in diets for juvenile (8.0 +/- 0.5 g) Totoaba macdonaldi. Using a FM-based control diet containing 53% crude protein and 13% crude fat, a 3 x 3 factorial experiment was conducted replacing FM, at levels of 33, 66 and 100% by weight, with three blends of the test ingredients, as follows: 1) Arthrospira meal blend: 70% Arthrospira sp. meal, 15% blood meal, 15% soy protein concentrate (SPC); 2) blood meal blend: 70% blood meal, 15% Arthrospira sp. meal, 15% SPC; and 3) SPC blend: 70% SPC, 15% blood meal, 15% Arthrospira sp. meal. At the end of the 6-week feeding trial, significant effects of the alternative protein blends were detected, in which fish fed the Arthrospira meal and SPC blends had significantly (P < .05) better performance than fish fed the blood meal blend across all growth parameters (percent weight gain and thermal growth coefficient) and feed utilization indices (feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio). Also, fish fed the former two blends deposited more crude protein and fat in whole body and muscle tissues, concurring with the growth response observed. However, the effects of protein blend on body condition indices (hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and muscle ratio) and on the concentrations of trypsin and chymotrypsin in anterior intestine and pyloric caeca, did not depict clear trends. A correspondence between levels of dietary amino acids (AA) in blends and accumulated AA in muscle, was not observed. However, significant effects of the level of FM replacement were also detected, in which the responses in growth, feed utilization, most body condition indices, and proximate composition of fish whole body, deteriorated as the level of FM replaced increased. All things considered, results indicate that the Arthrospira meal and SPC blends, but not the blood meal blend, can be used to replace at least 33% FM in the diet for totoaba, without adversely affecting growth and survival. The possible reasons for the decreased performance of fish fed the blood meal blend, or when fed any of the blends at levels higher than 33%, are discussed.

AB  - Competition among males can be a decisive factor for successful mating in anuran explosive breeders with a male-biased population sex ratio. The Yungas Red-belly Toad (Melanophryniscus rubriventris (Vellard, 1947)) is an explosive breeder where males exhibit a classic scramble competition. We studied the body size, body condition, and stress-induced leukocyte response of M. rubriventris males under natural scenarios of scramble competition. We hand-captured adult males (categorised as single, in pairs, or in mating balls) and determined their body mass and length, body condition, and their leukocyte profile. We found that males in pairs had significantly higher body mass than single males and those in mating balls. We found the highest percentage of individuals with better body condition within the paired males who showed significantly higher body condition index value than singles or those in mating balls. Amplectant males (those collected in pairs or in mating balls) had a significantly lower proportion of lymphocytes and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios than singles. Amplectant males showed significantly higher proportions of neutrophils or eosinophils than singles. Our results suggest that M. rubriventris males with better body condition can be more successful in acquiring mates, although scramble competition among males can trigger a stress response.

AB  - Condition of overwintering European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, was studied in salt marshes along the French Atlantic coast. The somatic and liver condition indices (K and LSI, respectively) and RNA:DNA ratio were determined over a period of 5 months (October '89-February '90). K, LSI and RNA:DNA were high in October and this was attributed to the fish's physiological preparation in autumn for the overwintering phase. In the age-I teleost studied here this preparatory growth was linked to anticipated inclement temperature and not to gonad maturation. Decline in K and LSI started in November and continued till January but improvement was noticed in February. RNA:DNA ratio decreased till December, rose in January and remained stable in February. Magnitude of change was greater in LSI than in K. RNA:DNA was more sensitive compared to K and LSI. Low temperature in winter resulted in decrease in K, LSI and RNA:DNA through decline of food intake and slowing of metabolism. Discordancy in the pattern of change in the midst of winter demonstrated a more prompt response of RNA:DNA to environment. Recovery of the three parameters in the second half of winter was attributed to sea bass undergoing compensatory growth with a favourable turn in the thermal regime and, of course, after developing adaptation to cold.

AB  - In a pilot field study the proteome response of Mytilus sp. was analyzed in relation to the concentration of different trace metal contaminants. Over a period of eight month test organisms have been exposed at a near-shore station in the anthropogenic impacted estuary of the river Elbe and at an off-shore station in the vicinity of the Island of Helgoland in the German Bight (North Sea). The stations differ in their hydrological as well as chemical characteristics. The physiological biomarkers, such as condition index which have been continuously monitored during the experiment clearly indicate the effects of the different environmental conditions. Multiple protein abundance changes were detected utilizing the techniques of two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2dGE) and consequently proteins arising as potential candidates for ecotoxicological monitoring have been identified by MALDI-ToF and ToF/ToF mass spectrometry. Different cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes of energy metabolism, stress proteins and one protein relevant for metal detoxification have been pointed out. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliability and reproducibility of transcriptomics-based studies are dependent on RNA integrity. In microbial ecology, microfluidics-based techniques, such as the Ribosomal Integrity Number (RIN), targeting rRNA are currently the only approaches to evaluate RNA integrity. However, the relationship between rRNA and mRNA integrity is unknown. Here, we present an integrity index, the Ratio Amplicon, R-amp, adapted from human clinical studies, to directly monitor mRNA integrity from complex environmental samples. We show, in a suite of experimental degradations of RNA extracted from sediment, that while the RIN generally reflected the degradation status of RNA the R-amp mapped mRNA degradation better. Furthermore, we examined the effect of degradation on transcript community structure by amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA, amoA and glnA transcripts. We successfully sequenced transcripts for all three targets even from highly-degraded RNA samples. While RNA degradation changed the community structure of the mRNA profiles, no changes were observed for the 16S rRNA transcript profiles. Since both RT-Q-PCR and sequencing results were obtained, even from highly degraded samples, we strongly recommend evaluating RNA integrity prior to downstream processing to ensure meaningful results. For this, both the RIN and R-amp are useful, with the R-amp better evaluating mRNA integrity in this study.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems of the Western Ghats (comprised primarily of rivers, lakes, and wetlands; less than 0.01% of the total water on Earth) harbor diverse communities of flora and fauna which are among the most threatened in the world. It is projected that habitat loss will lead to significant decline in freshwater fish diversity. Many rivers that are expected to lose fish species are located in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The freshwater diversity of the Western Ghats (one of the global biodiversity hotspots) is particularly vulnerable to recent expansion of human population and development in the region. The present study is an example of how baseline data on fish assemblages in disturbed and undisturbed river systems of the Western Ghats can be employed in developing conservation prioritization plans for tropical river systems. Analyses of beta diversity patterns along river gradients indicated the sensitivity of species turnover to altered habitats and polluting industries near study sites. Null model analyses was used to investigate assemblage structure across disturbed and undisturbed sites on the rivers, which revealed that structure of species co-occurrences depended on the extent of human disturbance in the rivers. A method of ranking based on the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was used to categorize disturbance levels of different sites. A combination of approaches of assemblage structure together with ranking of the IBI will help in developing conservation strategies for the region and prioritization plans for management at local and regional scales.

AB  - The non-diagnostic nature of most coral reef monitoring programs limits the ability of scientists, managers, and agency staff to communicate trends in the condition of coral reef systems to the public or politicians. Moreover, monitoring programs have neither been designed to identify the specific causes of coral reef decline nor to formulate or evaluate the effectiveness of conservation or remediation plans. Efforts to protect and restore coral reef resources should explicitly track the biological condition of these ecosystems the way we track local and national economies or diagnose personal health through the application of appropriately defined indicators. The use of calibrated metrics that integrate the influence of all forms of degradation caused by human actions can improve diagnostic, curative, restorative and preventive actions. To improve this situation, we propose a framework for the definition of coral reef multimetric indexes of biotic integrity (IBI), including a discussion of how existing research advances this framework. Our research strategy recognizes the value of looking at six components of regional biotas: sessile epibenthos, benthic macroinvertebrates, fish, macrophytes, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. Understanding the tolerance and intolerance of coral reef taxa to chemical contaminants or other human influences (habitat destruction, overharvest), singly or in combination, is crucial to creation of an effective IBI. The research strategy outlined here provides a starting point based on successful efforts in other environments (e.g., streams, wetlands). The biological attributes selected as metrics in an IBI as well as their specific responses to the many effects of human actions must be specified by pilot program research. Additional steps to be accomplished include development of a coral reef classification system, definition of reference condition (regional ecological expectations), and documentation of sample effort and analytical procedures needed for handling coral reef data.

AB  - We developed a fish-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) for a set of Minnesota lakes having similar geophysical and chemical features. Fish data were collected by means of trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seines, and backpack electrofishing. Of 30 evaluated metrics, we identified 16 metrics of three types: species richness, community assemblage, and trophic composition. In contrast to lotic IBIs, where a single sampling gear is usually used, data from all four sampling gears were necessary for IBI development. We selected metrics based on responses to measures of human-induced stress based on watershed land use patterns and human population density. Species richness and community composition metrics describing intolerant or habitat specialist species were most sensitive to differences in human-induced stress. Because these species were found in the nearshore zone of lakes, effective sampling of the nearshore fish community was essential to the development and performance of the IBI. Trap-net- and gill-net-based metrics, however, were essential to the development of trophic composition metrics, the trap nets providing the best insectivore and omnivore metric and the gill nets providing the best top carnivore metrics. Lake IBI scores reflected differences in land use patterns, trophic state, and aquatic vegetation. Sensitivity analysis indicated that selected metrics contributed to IBI performance, but the relative contribution of individual metrics varied among human-induced stress categories. Additional work is needed to test the performance of this IBI on an independent group of lakes, to set the range of applicability, and to determine the effectiveness of the IBI as an assessment tool for lakes.

AB  - Despite measures to mitigate drought, study on the extent of agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability is still neglected in the savanna ecological zone of Nigeria. This study assessed agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability in Kaduna River Basin (KRB). To achieve this, monthly rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture data were downloaded from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data (CHIRPS) and ERA5 Copernicus data archive. Streamflow data were obtained from ten hydrometeorological stations (1990-2018) while Landsat imageries 4, 5, 7, and 8 of 30 m resolutions were used to generate vegetation condition index (VCI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and landuse/landcover (LULC). The two drought types were assessed for 1990, 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018. The result of high and moderate severity of VCI revealed upward trends of r(2) = 0.3026 and r(2) = 0.3779, respectively. Analysis showed that within ranges of 50 to 80% and 58 to 82% of the basin area were, respectively, mapped as moderate agricultural and hydrological drought hazards zones. The study reveals that most parts of the basin are moderately vulnerable to both agricultural and hydrological drought events at 62.15 and 72.44%, respectively, while high agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability areas accounted for 18.29 and 17.42%, respectively.

AB  - This study examined factors affecting juvenile recruitment in the tuatua Paphies donacina on an exposed surf beach in Pegasus Bay, South Island New Zealand between October 1994 and April 1997. Tuatua recruitment followed female gonad maturation with a delay of approximately 2 months. Juveniles (1-10 mm shell length) occurred throughout the study except during June and July 1995 (winter). Average densities (m(-2)) were 28 in winter, 230 in spring, 174 in summer and 108 in autumn. There was high juvenile mortality and/or emigration and the maximum average density of (741 m(-2)) was recorded in November 1996. Recruit densities were similar between years except during winter. Adult tuatua populations were dominated by modal shell lengths greater than 70 mm. There was no significant relationship between adult and juvenile recruit length. Recruit length decreased with recruit density suggesting density dependent competition for space or food resources. Juvenile density increased following increases in food availability (chlorophyll a concentration) but average length of juveniles did not correlate directly with any of the environmental variables. Recruit density decreased as the modal adult length increased and recruit length reduced when adult populations had a high condition index. Because larvae, juveniles and adult are mobile the beach population is characteristic of an open system with adults and juveniles from the resident population affecting post-settlement density-dependent processes.

AB  - A rapid index for the quality status assessment of Mediterranean transitional environments is proposed. It is based on the study of macrophyte associations (macroalgae and seagrasses) and the gross determination of some environmental parameters. The index was set up in 19 sampling sites of the Venice lagoon monitored during one year on a monthly basis taking into account the flora, the main contaminants and some other variables indicating the presence of gradients of stress conditions. Results were compared and intercalibrated with measurements carried out in Sacca di Goro, placed in Po delta, and in Lesina and Orbetello lagoons.

AB  - Biological invasions by non-indigenous species are causing widespread environmental changes and can threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services. Biotic interactions can play a key role in promoting or inhibiting spread of non-indigenous species. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg, 1793) is commonly found on intertidal shores with hard substrata, but is negatively associated with macroalgae and may be influenced by the macroalgae itself or by predators associated with it. The influence of macroalgae and predation on growth, condition and survival of juvenile Pacific oysters were tested in a field experiment at two intertidal boulder shores using hatchery-reared juvenile oysters deployed on ceramic tiles. After 10 months, condition of oysters was not significantly decreased in the presence of macroalgal canopy. At one site growth was reduced by macroalgae and at the other, it tended to be enhanced, but the effect was not significant. An effect of predation could not be detected. Although spatial variation in survival and growth of juvenile oysters was found, the results suggest that pre-settlement processes and/or post-settlement processes acting upon juvenile oysters at sizes not tested in this study might better explain variation in abundance of Pacific oysters in intertidal habitats.

AB  - Industrial pollution is a significant global threat to biodiversity, but its consequences on rainforest ecosystems remain poorly understood. Amphibians are especially susceptible to pollutants released on natural environments due to their aquatic-terrestrial life cycle. Here, we explored the association of severe historical air, water, and soil pollution with physiological and morphological alterations on Rhinella ornata individuals, an endemic toad species of Atlantic Forest, a world biodiversity hotspot. We hypothesized that individuals sampled in sites closer to the pollution source will present worse indicators of health. As predicted, toads at decreasing distances from the pollution source presented enlargement of organs related to detoxification function (liver and kidneys) and compensatory immunological function (spleen). Contrary to our predictions, however, we do not found significant effects of proximity to the pollution source on individuals' body condition index, on the indicative of fertility (testicles masses) or on macroparasite infection's response (eosinophil counts). Surprisingly, proximity to the pollution source was associated with lower chronic stress levels (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) on individuals. We discuss which processes could promote the alterations found on the toads. We also discuss the possible acquirement of local resistance to contamination on toads populations closer from pollution source, giving the more than 60 years of exposure to chemical contaminants in the area.

AB  - Adaptive bias in sex allocation is traditionally proposed to be related to the condition of mothers as well as to the unequal fitness values of produced sexes. A positive relationship between mother condition and investment into male offspring is often predicted. This relationship was also recently found to depend on environmental conditions. We studied these causalities experimentally using a design where winter food supply was manipulated in eight outdoor-enclosed populations of field voles Microtus agrestis. At the beginning of the breeding season in spring, food-supplemented mothers seemed to be in a similar condition, measured as body mass, head width, body condition index and parasite load (blood parasite Trypanosoma), to non-supplemented mothers. Food supplements affected neither the litter size, the reproductive effort of mothers, nor the litter sex ratios at birth. However, food supplementation significantly increased the birth size of male offspring and improved their condition, as indicated by reduced parasite loads (intestinal Eimeria). Interestingly, mothers in good body condition produced larger male offspring only when environmental conditions were improved by food supplements. Although the adaptiveness of variation in mammalian sex ratios is still questionable, our study indicates that mothers in good condition bias their investment towards male offspring, but only when environmental conditions are favourable.

AB  - The extent of degradation of benthic communities of the Chesapeake Bay was determined by applying a previously developed benthic index of biotic integrity at three spatial scales. Allocation of sampling was probability-based allowing areal estimates of degradation with known confidence intervals. The three spatial scales were: ( 1) the tidal Chesapeake Bay; ( 2) the Elizabeth River watershed; and ( 3) two small tidal creeks within the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River that are part of a sediment contaminant remediation effort. The areas covered varied from 10(-1) to 10(4) km(2) and all were sampled in 1999. The Chesapeake Bay was divided into ten strata, the Elizabeth River into five strata and each of the two tidal creeks was a single stratum. The determination of the number and size of strata was based upon consideration of both managerially useful units for restoration and limitations of funding. Within each stratum 25 random locations were sampled for benthic community condition. In 1999 the percent of the benthos with poor benthic community condition for the entire Chesapeake Bay was 47% and varied from 20% at the mouth of the Bay to 72% in the Potomac River. The estimated area of benthos with poor benthic community condition for the Elizabeth River was 64% and varied from 52-92%. Both small tidal creeks had estimates of 76% of poor benthic community condition. These kinds of estimates allow environmental managers to better direct restoration efforts and evaluate progress towards restoration. Patterns of benthic community condition at smaller spatial scales may not be correctly inferred from larger spatial scales. Comparisons of patterns in benthic community condition across spatial scales, and between combinations of strata, must be cautiously interpreted.

AB  - Responses of the Wyoming Stream Integrity Index (WSII), a regionally calibrated multimetric index, were investigated in relation to background elevational changes in water quality and habitat conditions versus accelerated anthropogenic degradation at the watershed scale. Assessments were conducted for three rivers in southeast Wyoming: the Little Medicine Bow River, the Medicine Bow River, and Rock Creek. Pearson correlation coefficients and regression models related "core metrics" and index scores to elevational gradients of physicochemical variables. Velocity, substrate, and weighted habitat values were positively correlated to index scores, while suspended solids was negatively correlated. The exclusive dependence of index scores on physical variables specifies the type of environmental gradients the WSII is most robust in detecting. The individual "core metrics" Plecoptera taxa, Trichoptera taxa, percent Trichoptera without Hydropsychidae, and percent noninsects appeared most sensitive to physical changes and were thus driving associations between index scores and physical variables. Despite strong correlations with physical variables, anomalies existed where habitat conditions were good, unknown stressors existed, or gradients were naturally occurring despite "Poor" index scores (i.e., degraded stream conditions). Such findings illustrate the influence of regional variability on biotic indices and the importance of identifying sufficient reference and impaired stream reaches used to develop and calibrate multimetric indices relying on reference conditions.

AB  - Increasing rates of freshwater habitat loss in the Chesapeake Bay (and elsewhere) have renewed interest in the role of freshwater in population integrity for euryhaline fishes. Freshwater habitats may be important nurseries for juveniles of anadromous species. Using length-weight residuals and scales, we determined if body condition and growth of juvenile (< 120 mm total length) white perch Morone americana (a semi-anadromous species) differed between brackish and freshwater tributaries within the Blackwater River drainage (Chesapeake Bay Watershed, U.S.A.). We then examined how monthly variation in body condition varied with monthly variation in selected environmental factors. Body condition differed between tributaries and was greater in freshwater (specific conductivity < 0.45 mS) than brackish water when water temperature was greater than 9.6A degrees C. White perch growth rates did not differ between tributaries, except for a short time during summer or early fall. Some anadromous fishes may spawn in freshwater to promote greater body condition, thereby ensuring a quality contingent of individuals for the population. With continued loss or impairment of freshwater habitat, the availability of nurseries for juvenile white perch will be reduced and reduce the number of quality juveniles recruiting to the adult population.

AB  - The "condition" is used as an indicator of fish health and is generally equated with the quantity of energy reserves. Biometric condition factors have been widely used and preferred over costly and time-consuming biochemical condition. Here, we investigated the relevance of four common condition factors based on biometric measurements (Le Cren's index, girth -length index, gonado-somatic index and hepato-somatic index) and of size- and weight -based empirical models to describe the physiological condition of tropical tunas. Biometric condition factors of bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas sampled throughout 2013 in the western Indian Ocean region were assessed against benchmark biochemical indices (lipid content, protein content, triacylglycerol:sterol ratio and energy density) estimated in tissues with different physiological functions, i.e. red muscle, white muscle, liver, and gonads. Our findings suggest that tropical tunas do not store lipids in white muscle and that protein content is less variable than lipid content, which largely varies with ontogeny and the seasons according to tissue and species. This variability induced inconsistency between biometric factors, including the empirically adjusted ones, and biochemical indices, with the exception of the gonado-somatic index that fitted well to the composition of the gonads in the three species, and especially in females.

AB  - Marine protected areas have been established as essential components for managing and protecting coral reefs to mitigate natural and anthropogenic stressors. One noteworthy example within the Mexican Caribbean is the Arrecife de Puerto Morelos National Park (APMNP), where several studies on the coral communities have been carried out since 2006. In June 2019, we conducted a study in eight sites of the APMNP applying a coral reef assessment method based on biological indicators of both the benthos and the fish communities. In this paper, we present the quantitative results of our study and provide a qualitative criterion assessing seven condition indexes through a scoring system. We also present a statistical comparison with a previous study carried out in 2016. The general status of coral reefs was classified as regular due to the low values of coral recruitment rate and biomass of key commercial fish species. However, living coral cover average was above 20%, with a slight dominance of framework building coral species and the presence of low values of fleshy algae cover, these being positive indicators. Our study found a higher proportion of reef promoter elements and a lower proportion of detractors, compared to a previous study carried out in 2016.

AB  - We compared the post-fledging dependence period, dispersal patterns and resighting rates of captive-raised and hacked Montagu's Harriers Circus pygargus with those of wild reared and naturally fledged Montagu's Harriers, in order to assess the validity of hacking as a release technique for this species. Among hacked birds, we found significant relationships between the length of the dependence period and both hatching date and body condition (birds hatched later in the season had shorter periods of dependence; birds in poorer condition had longer periods of dependence). The condition index increased with the amount of time spent in captivity. The length of the dependence period did not differ significantly between released and naturally fledged birds, when hatching dates were accounted for. Observation rates of wing-tagged fledglings in years after marking were higher for released birds (15.5-20.9%) than for naturally fledged birds (9.4-9.9%). Released birds also tended to be resighted closer to their released location than did the naturally fledged birds. We suggest that the differences in resighting data are related to the better condition of the released birds, compared with their wild counterparts. We conclude that hacking is apparently a good release technique for captive-reared Montagu's Harriers, and that comparisons of behaviour at the post-fledging period may be a valid method for evaluating the success of release techniques.

AB  - Many ecotoxicological studies have addressed the effects of contaminant exposure at various levels of biological organization. However, little information exists on the effects of toxicants on wildlife populations. Here we examined exposure of populations of the greater white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula (Soricomorpha, Soricidae) occupying two protected Mediterranean sites (a polluted area, the Ebro Delta, and a control site, Garraf Massif). Bioaccumulation of selected elements (Pb, Hg, Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Cr, Mo, Sr, Ba, and B), a body condition index (BCI) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) were used to assess the chronic exposure to environmental pollution. BCI was correlated neither to metal concentrations nor to FA, suggesting that this fitness measure only reflects environmental disturbances at a local level. However, shrews from the polluted area showed higher concentrations of metals and metalloids (Pb, Hg, B, and Sr) and greater shape FA than specimens from the reference area. A correlation between FA was found for both first and second principal component vectors suggesting that developmental instability increases as a result of exposure to multiple pollutants. Our results corroborate the suitability of C russula as a bioindicator of environmental quality and show that FA is an appropriate index to examine impact of developmental stressors in populations inhabiting disturbed areas.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are monitored worldwide using a range of biological quality elements that are morphologically identified. The environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approach has unprecedented advantages (e.g., high throughput, high efficiency and low cost) for biodiversity surveys in both freshwater and marine ecosystems compared with traditional sampling and image recognition. The use of eDNA has been mostly limited to biodiversity estimation, how to apply the eDNA approach in assessing the ecological health status is largely unexplored. Here, using zooplankton as an example, we examined the application of eDNA monitoring for ecological status assessment in an aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that eDNA monitoring reflected the spatial and temporal variations in zooplankton structure. Both species composition and bio-interactions varied significantly between sampling seasons (dry, normal and wet). A total of 60 different zooplankton indices were calculated based on eDNA monitoring and most of these indices were highly correlated with the level of water pollution, which was indicated by the water quality index in one or all three seasons. Both qualitative and quantitative eDNA-based biological indices were correlated with water quality. The season-dependent eDNA zooplankton integrity index (IZI) reflected the ecological status, and this method improves the timeliness of bioassessment.

AB  - The starvation is a common and severe stress for animal survival and development. In aquatic environment, many fish suffer starvation stress in different extent because of the natural migration or feed limitation. When subjected to starved conditions, organisms will employ various adaptive physiological, biochemical, and behavioral changes to regulate metabolism and maintain homeostasis. In the present study, adult female zebrafish were deprived of feed for 1 to 3 weeks to detect the starved effects on adults and larvae. The results showed that biological indexes, RNA/DNA ratios, and nutritional indexes significantly decreased in the female fish after starvation. The number of mature follicles reduced while the average spawning diameter of oocytes increased. For the larvae, the maternal starvation stress distinctly delayed embryonic hatching, decreased larval body length, disrupted larval swimming ability, and reduced survival rate at early-life stages. Furthermore, we found that DNA methylation might conduce to the downregulated mRNA expression of anti-Mullerian hormone and cytochrome P450 aromatase in retarded ovaries under starved conditions. Significant effects on autophagic transcription were shown in maternal ovary and larvae responded to starvation stress. Taken together, our study systematically revealed the reproductive impairments of starvation stress and would facilitate the investigation of environmental stress in teleost fish.

AB  - The drainages of the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo of Venezuela are subjected to strong disturbances, especially the loss of riparian forests and transformation of riverbeds, with detrimental effect on river ecosystems, but their conservation status is unknown, limiting appropriate management of regional hydrobiological resources. In the tributary rivers Machango and Misoa, 16 drainage sites were evaluated by characterizing the channel dimensions, the substrate composition and the water physicochemical variables. Aquatic insects were also collected using standardized sampling. The conservation status of the sites was estimated using environmental indices (IHF: fluvial habitat index; QBR-And: index of quality of Andean riparian forest; HIP habitat integrity index). Relationships between habitat gradient and the indices were explored by multivariate classification and ordination analysis. The synthetic variables generated were related environmental indices and biotas. The aquatic habitat showed a heterogeneity gradient directly and significantly associated with the variables that determine the structure of the channel and riparian zones. All indices scored higher where there was more vegetation cover in riparian zones and heterogeneous substrates; also, the indices had significant correlations with the gradient of fluvial habitat and number of insect families. A gradient in the conservation status was detected, where a class of low conservation was associated with homogeneous and impacted habitats and the lowest richness of insect families. The indices used are suitable to estimate conservation classes of rivers and their biotas, and may be employed for monitoring drainages.

AB  - Prey-predator interactions are considered one of the primary drivers of the ecology and evolution of several vertebrate taxa, but particularly, it has played a significant role in the evolutionary biology of snakes. However, feeding ecology of semifossorial tropical snakes has been poorly studied. We employed a multivariate approach to explore the effects of sexual dimorphism, prey-predator interaction, and climatic variability due to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the abundance and feeding ecology of the semifossorial snake Ninia atrata. Climatic variability analysis revealed conspicuous temporal variation in the prey availability at microhabitat, as well as in the snake abundance and food intake. Multivariate approach provided strong support for links between Ninia atrata abundance, microhabitat quality and snails abundance (more than other prey). Conspicuous intersexual dietary divergence was observed supporting the hypothesis of the sex-specific targets for maximum food intake. ENSO phenomenon promoted a notable decline in Ninia atrata abundances and its food intake, which was related to prey availability and abundance, as well as a strong variability on their body condition index (BCI). Finally, given the high sensitivity of Ninia atrata to the environmental variability, it could consider an indicator species of the environmental changes in the Neotropical oil palm agroecosystems.

AB  - Seasonal variations in the condition index and biochemical composition of the clam Mactra chinensis were studied from April 2008 to March 2009 on the eastern coast of China in relation to the reproductive cycle and environmental factors. Histological analysis indicated that the gametogenesis of M. chinensis comprised two phases: a resting phase (November-February) and gametogenesis, including ripeness and spawning, during the rest of the year. Gametogenesis began in March and was completed during June-July. Spawning occurred in August when water temperature was higher and food availability was high. A significant decrease in the glycogen content of all tissues in both males and females during sexual maturation suggests that carbohydrates play the most important role in reproduction of this species. Lipid biosynthesis during gametogenesis was associated with glycogen breakdown. The protein content in the female gonads showed a synchronous increase with the oocyte diameter and lipid content, suggesting that the female gonads could accumulate protein and lipid as vitellin. The RNA/DNA ratio is a valuable indicator of maturation both in males and females. The information obtained in this study provides a basis for fisheries resource administrators to design biologically sound management measures for this species, and is crucial for initiating its aquaculture.

AB  - Structure and composition of Trichoptera (Insecta) community in streams and wetlands of Suia-Micu River Basin, Mato Grosso, Brazil. The composition, abundance and species diversity of Trichoptera immatures was studied in 12 tributaries of Suia-Micu River Basin, a mosaic of wetlands, streams and rivers tributary of the Xingu River in the Cerrado-Amazonian Forest transition zone in Mato Grosso, Brazil. The varying sizes, flow types and conservation levels of the tributaries were sampled through three periods between 2007 and 2008 by the use of fixed transects along the environments margins. A total of 867 larvae was collected (divided in seven families, 17 genera, 49 species/morphospecies) with the most abundant and rich families being Hydropsychidae and Leptoceridae and the most abundant species Leptonema sparsum (n = 370). There has been loss of species richness in impacted, large and lentic environments. Composition variations related to the flow, the vegetation type and the interaction between conservation levels and flow was detected. Conservation levels, width and the quantitative habitat integrity index (HII) did not influence the Trichoptera composition. These results may encourage further investigation of impact effects on aquatic insect compositions and pattern of distribution in the transition area between the Cerrado and the Amazonian Forest.

AB  - Amphibian breeding-migrations are strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Furthermore, an individual's breeding-migration pattern might be influenced by their sex, size, physiological state, and/or fecundity. From 2012 to 2014, we collected mark-recapture data for two syntopic alpine (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and smooth (Lissotriton vulgaris) newt populations in southern Greece (the southern limit of their distribution), as well as morphometric data for individuals, and data on environmental factors. Using these data, we studied the reproductive dynamics of these populations and assessed whether individual traits and environmental covariates influence their breeding-migration patterns. Both species followed a similar temporal migration pattern, regardless of individual traits. Migration to the breeding site was influenced by water availability, but not by ground temperature, rainfall or photoperiod. Migration from the breeding site was not influenced by water availability, but was triggered by increasing water temperatures. Our findings corroborate the few available studies of European newt populations occurring near the southern edge of their distribution. However, compared to numerous studies of northern European newt populations, our results suggest distinct breeding-migration patterns, as well as contrasting effects of environmental factors on these migration patterns. Based on current climate change projections, the breeding period of southern newt populations breeding in temporary ponds could be severely reduced.

AB  - The performance of Haliotis asinina Linnaeus fed four commercially available diets formulated for temperate Australian species was assessed relative to a natural diet of Gracilaria edulis. parameters measured included growth in terms of total wet body weight (TWBW) and shell length (SL), survival, food conversion ratio (FCR), condition index (CI), and sexual maturation, The results of these measurements indicated that two of the formulated diets could be used for commercial culture of H. asinina. Nutritional and physical parameters of these diets were used in a multivariate regression analysis to identify variables that explained the most variation in growth between diets. Parameters that were selected by this analysis were the ratio of crude protein (CP) to gross energy (GE) and the rate that protein leached from the formulated diets. The resulting regression equation was highly significant in its explanation of the variation in growth (P = 2.2 x 10(-6)). To determine the quality of the dietary CP in each diet, the essential amino acid profile of each diet was compared to that of whole soft body tissue in H. asinina. Methionine seemed to be deficient in all of the diets. Animals fed G. edulis did not seem to suffer from a lack of n-3 PUFAs.

AB  - The largest population of endangered humpback chub Gila cypha inhabits the lower Little Colorado River (LCR) and the main-stem Colorado River near its confluence with the LCR in Grand Canyon, Arizona. At present, fish in both rivers spawn almost exclusively in the LCR. Flows in the main-stem Colorado River are regulated by Glen Canyon Dam, and water temperature approximates predam winter temperatures year-round. The LCR continues to provide a relatively natural hydrograph and seasonal warming patterns. Length-weight relationships among adult humpback chub from the lower Colorado River basin showed a seasonal pattern of declining condition during spring spawning season followed by recovery of condition during summer through early winter. Fish from the main stem recovered condition more rapidly after reproduction than did fish from the LCR and may have benefited from dam-mediated environmental changes. Grand Canyon Colorado River fish had the greatest weight at length of eight locations sampled in the upper and lower basins. Records since 1978 indicate a decline in condition of lower basin humpback chub coincident with a reported decline in population size in Grand Canyon. We recommend increased monitoring of all populations, including mark-recapture studies to provide population estimates during the spawning season and condition monitoring during October-November to determine more subtle changes in fish health.

AB  - The increasing spread of invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea determines several alterations in local food webs, changing the feeding habits of native organisms. The whelk Stramonita haemastoma is a widespread Mediterranean gastropod that consumes bivalves, barnacles and limpets. Previous studies showed a shift in its diet from the bivalve Mytilaster minimus to the invasive mussel Brachidontes pharaonis, presumably due to a higher energy gain. Here we tested whelks' preference among natives and a novel prey, calculating the profitability ratio, and integrating those results with biochemical analysis on prey tissues and the routine metabolism of the whelks. Further, we used the scaled functional response as a theoretical tool to describe whelk ability to obtain energy from their environment by using four different prey species: B. pharaonis, Mytilus galloprovincialis, M. minimus and Patella caerulea. Whelks evidenced a Type II functional response for all prey, while Brachidontes displayed a lower attack rate and a higher handling time. Stramonita showed a greater preference for Brachidontes, that resulted as the prey with the higher energetic content, and the second most profitable after Patella. This suggests that the higher energy gain is behind the change in the predator's diet, with possible effects on its energy budget.

AB  - In recent years, Qatar has witnessed exponential growth in the human population, urbanization, and increased anthropogenic activities, including agriculture. Potentially toxic environmental contaminants, including metals and metalloids, are commonly found in emerging economies. At high concentrations, elements such as As, Cr, and Ni can be hazardous and may lead to various health problems in humans, including cancer. The current study measured As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn concentrations in agricultural soils. Pollution levels and potential negative impacts on human and environmental health were determined using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standard methodologies. According to the study's findings, the studied element concentrations descended in the following order: Zn > Cr > V > Ni > As > Cu > Pb > Cd. Of these, As (27.6 mg/kg), Cr (85.7 mg/kg), Ni (61.9 mg/kg), and Zn (92.3 mg/kg) concentrations were higher than average world background levels. Each of these elements also had an enrichment factor (EF > 1), indicating their anthropogenic origin. The combined pollution load index (PLI > 1) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo) range values of -0.2-2.5 further indicated that the soil was up to 58% polluted. However, the ecological risk factor (Er <= 40.6) and potential ecological risk index (PERI = 79.6) suggested low ecological risk. A human health risk evaluation showed that only As, with a hazard index (HI) of 1.3, posed a noncarcinogenic risk to infants. Additionally, As, Cr, and Ni, with total carcinogenic risk (TCR) values of 1.18 x 10(-4) and 2.06 x 10(-4) for adults and children, respectively, proved carcinogenic to both age groups. The elements' carcinogenic risk (CR) potential descended in the following order: Ni > As > Cr. Additionally, for both adults and children, oral ingestion is the most likely exposure pathway. Our findings support the need for closer monitoring of potentially toxic metals and metalloids levels in cultivated soils and farm produce in Qatar. Reducing the elements' bioavailability in soil and developing innovative remediation technologies is needed to limit potential risks to human health. Further studies on As, Cr, and Ni gastrointestinal bioaccessibilities are needed to fully understand the effects after long-term exposure and the cancer-causing potential of these elements over a lifetime.

AB  - Eighteen different genotypes of bread wheat were evaluated for: heat and water stress conditions. These genotypes reprented some families of early generations, i.e. F3 and F5 as well as some of parental varieties. Heat stress was represented by two delayed planting dates, November 27th and December 27th. Water stressed included irrigation each 5, 10 and 15 days starting at booting stage. The experiment was carried out at the Agricultural Research Station in Deirab (24 degrees, 42 N and 46 degrees, 44 E, Alt 600 m), King Saud University, near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   Results indicated that planting dates had significant effects on yield characters, biological yield, harvest index, and spike length. However, it showed highly significant effects on Kernel weight (1000 seed), flowering date, days to maturity, and filling period. Yield was reduced from 5.28 Ton/H to 3.19 Ton/H as wheat was planted late in November and late in December, respectively. The reduction of yield associated with December 27th planting was due to heat effect of high temperature during seed filling period.
   Water stress (irrigation intervals) exhibited significant effects on yield, biological yield, and kernel weight (1000 seed). While it had significant effects on days to maturity and filling period. Yield was reduced about 15% when wheat was irrigated every 15 days as compared with irrigation every 5 days. Two genotypes out of 18 tolerated both heat and water stress conditions. These genotypes were number 17 and 18 (L.19 - 3 - Y.R. 179 - 2 - 16 - 17 and L. 13 - 9 - Y.R. - 189 -2 - 19 - 18) which produced high yield under both stress conditions.
   Significant positive correlations were found between grain yield and each of biological yield, harvest index, kernel weight, days to maturity, anti length of filling period.

Nests of secondary cavity nesters provide a convenient habitat for an assemblage of parasites exploiting nestlings. In this study, natural blue tit Parus caeruleus nests (26) were replaced with clean artificial nests, twice during the nestling stage. This treatment caused an increase of 7-10.5 g/l in hemoglobin level of 12-day-old nestlings in comparison with control nestlings. Nestlings that developed in parasite-pathogen-free nests improved their health status. The experimental sterilization did not affect a morphometric index of condition. Potential effects on condition indices might be masked by trophic conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems has been in the spotlight for the past three decades. Climate change is generally considered to be a threat to ecosystem health in mountain regions. Vegetation indices can be used to detect shifts in ecosystem phenology and climate change in mountain regions while satellite imagery can play an important role in this process. However, what has remained problematic is determining the extent to which ecosystem phenology is affected by climate change under increasingly warming conditions. In this paper, we use climate and vegetation indices that were derived from satellite data to investigate the link between ecosystem phenology and climate change in the Namahadi Catchment Area of the Drakensberg Mountain Region of South Africa. The time series for climate indices as well as those for gridded precipitation and temperature data were analyzed in order to determine climate shifts, and concomitant changes in vegetation health were assessed in the resultant epochs using vegetation indices. The results indicate that vegetation indices should only be used to assess trends in climate change under relatively pristine conditions, where human influence is limited. This knowledge is important for designing climate change monitoring strategies that are based on ecosystem phenology and vegetation health.

AB  - DNA damage was evaluated by comet assay in the haemolymph of two bivalve species Ruditapes decussatus and Mytilus galloprovincialis from the Ria Formosa lagoon (south Coast of Portugal). Clams and mussels were sampled from sites close to each other to determine interspecific responses to similar environmental conditions, considering also seasonal and gender differences. Coupled with genotoxic effect, another damage biomarker (lipid peroxidation) was analysed to verify if the conditions that instigate DNA damage can be related with injury to cell membranes. For both species, DNA damage was low, reflecting the low levels of genotoxic contaminants in the lagoon, and no interspecific differences were found. However, seasonal differences were established for both bivalve species, reflecting higher environmental stress in summer. Regarding gender susceptibility, only clams showed differences in percentage of Tail DNA, with females more sensitive to DNA damage than males. Additionally, results for clams point out that factors responsible for LPO may not be the same as those causing genotoxicity. This study demonstrated that DNA damage is a sensitive biomarker to discriminate spatial, temporal and gender differences, being an appropriate biomarker for genotoxicity evaluation even in places of low contamination, such as the Ria Formosa lagoon.

AB  - The present paper investigated the short-term colonization by plants of a highly degraded soil in field conditions. The objectives were to identify, through phytosociological analysis, the plant species able to grow on such polluted areas and to characterize pollutant effects at different biological levels through analyses of plant oxidative status, plant growth or Community indexes of richness and biodiversity. Our results showed that among the plants present in the uncontaminated surrounding area, only few species were able to colonize the polluted soil. These species were typical of the first years of grassland successions. Ecological indexes proved that the polluted soil vegetation presented a lower degree of species richness and biodiversity than the control area. These discrepancies were partly explained by pollutant phytotoxicity. Indeed, for several species including Erigeron canadensis and Oenothera biennis, we observed toxic effects of the polluted soil oil plant height and biomass, Moreover, at the cellular level, changes in antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, APX, GPX and GRD) and lipid peroxidation level (MDA) were observed. Such biochemical changes seemed to play an important role on plant sensitivity/tolerance to pollutants and thus to render them more or less competitive for colonization of such disturbed areas.

AB  - We briefly review and expand upon classic conceptual models describing the succession of benthic communities along a gradient of organic matter (OM) enrichment developed for freshwater (the Saprobity System), coastal marine (the Pearson-Rosenberg [P-R] model) and lagoon (the Gu,lorget-Perthuisot [G-P] model) ecosystems. Differences and similarities between various approaches and models are highlighted and the P-R and G-P models are unified under a single conceptual framework of habitat saprobity in coastal lagoons. We refer to saprobity as the state of an aquatic ecosystem resulting from the input and decomposition of OM and the removal of its catabolites. In addition to other factors, such as salinity, saprobity is viewed as a selection factor for species diversity. The higher the saprobity is, the more impaired the system is, with progressively poorer benthic communities characterized by species that are increasingly tolerant of reducing conditions and toxicity. In coastal lagoons, these processes are strongly driven by hydrodynamics, which govern the land-sea gradient. Based on our review and analysis, we find that saprobity can be a useful descriptor of ecosystem state as determined by OM metabolism, suitable for characterizing the natural conditions of coastal lagoons and assessing their quality.

AB  - The present study describes the reproductive biology including sex-ratio, ovarian maturation, size at sexual maturity and spawning season of the speckled shrimp Metapenaeus monoceros (Decapoda: Penaeidae) in the Gulf of Gabes (Southern Tunisia, Eastern Mediterranean). Samples for biological investigations were collected from the commercial catches of trawlers and tramel nets from January 2007 to January 2008. A total of 4226 specimens ranging from 46 to 170 mm TL (total length) and 0.656 to 39.554 g BW (body weight) were analysed in the present Study. Females outnumbered males by 1.5 to 1 (2533 vs. 1693 individuals). Sexual maturity stages were classified into five categories for females and four categories for males based on the visual observation of gonad's coulour and shape. The spawning season was estimated based oil monthly changes of gonadosomatic index, condition factors and gonadal Maturity stages. The spawning occurred twice a year, with the first peak in May-June and the second more intensive one in October-November. The size at sexual maturity (TL50) was 76.5 mm TL for males and 122.3 mm TL for females. The data presented in this study would be useful for the sustainable management of the speckled shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Gabes.

AB  - The kinematic changes associated with the manipulation and transport components during a prehensile movement were examined using an experimental paradigm that required alterations in only the manipulation component. Instead of starting with the thumb and index finger naturally together (control condition), subjects began the reach-to-grasp movement with their thumb and fingers fully extended (experimental condition). In contrast to the control condition, in the experimental conditions the thumb and index finger started to close during wrist transport, then opened again prior to object grasp. In addition, there was a brief inflection in the ascending portion of the velocity profile of the wrist in over half the trials. However, all the primary features of the transport component profile remained unaltered. The results suggest that there can be substantial reorganization of the grip aperture during the first part of the reach without altering the temporal and spatial relationships between grip aperture and transport as the object to be grasped is approached.

AB  - Comparison of the resource accumulation patterns exhibited by related species inhabiting disparate hydrological conditions can provide insight into how they are affected by and respond to different environments. We compared the seasonal body condition of the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) in the Mojave Desert with that of the gopher tortoise ( Gopherus polyphemus) in central Florida. We assessed body condition indirectly, with indices derived from the relationship between body mass and size. In turtles, variation in body mass largely reflects tissue hydration, water stored in the bladder, and food stored in the gut. Mean body condition was lower and seasonal fluctuations were of lesser amplitude in the gopher tortoise than in the desert tortoise. Over the short term, body condition of the desert tortoise is correlated strongly with rainfall, but body condition of the gopher tortoise is not. These differences between the two species are consistent with what is known about their physiology and behavior under current climatic conditions. Changing rainfall patterns may severely affect the desert tortoise. The physiological reaction of the gopher tortoise to drought conditions also may put it at substantial potential risk from climate change.

AB  - Animals living in urban areas experience additional stress compared to those inhabiting more natural habitats. This could influence their physical state and ability to cope with parasites. Here, effects of environmental disturbances on body condition and prevalence and load of blood parasites in the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) were investigated by comparing these indices between five urban and five rural populations. The physical condition index was lower in urban areas, and females were the most affected sex. This suggests significant fitness costs, as survival and reproductive output are often tightly linked to body condition. Prevalence of blood parasites was more variable in urban (2.5-100%) compared to rural (50.0-75.6%) populations, with no statistically significant differences between the two habitats. Prevalence of blood parasites increased with body size. Parasite load was significantly higher in urban lizards, suggesting strong effects of urbanisation on host-parasite interaction. An increased concentration of blood parasites should affect fitness since various aspects of physiology are compromised in parasitised animals. Larger animals were more frequently and more severely infected, most likely due to their being longer and more frequently exposed to parasites. No differences between sexes in both prevalence and intensity were found, suggesting equal susceptibility or exposure to parasites.

AB  - The structure of sessile epibiotic assemblages fouling the shells of farmed populations of the common Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, a species known to be involved in ecosystem engineering processes, was investigated in the north Aegean Sea. Mussel samples were collected from three aquaculture installations and all sessile organisms were examined. Fifteen species were recorded, one macroalga and 14 macro-invertebrates. Four colonial species covered up to 20% of the mussel shell. Among solitary organisms, polychaetes dominated followed by barnacles. The diversity of sessile epibionts associated with farmed mussel populations was comparable to that observed on natural mussel beds in contrast to their abundance/cover, which was higher in the former, possibly due to the higher trophic status in the farming areas. The structure of epibiotic assemblages exhibited limited variability at the spatial scale, in general. On the contrary, strong temporal variability with decreased diversity and abundance/cover values during the cold period of the year was assessed, in accordance with the life cycles of species involved and prevailing environmental conditions. Mussel epibionts appeared to have a negative impact on their basibiont since a reduced condition index was detected; however this impact was rather weak and further data are required to generalize the consequences of epibiosis on farmed mussels.

AB  - Ecological associations where one species enhances habitat for another nearby species (facilitations) shape fundamental community dynamics and can promote niche expansion, thereby influencing how and where species persist and coexist. For the many breeding birds facing high nest-predation pressure, enemy-free space can be gained by nesting near more formidable animals for physical protection. While the benefits to protected species seem well documented, very few studies have explored whether and how protector species are affected by nest protection associations. Long-legged wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) actively choose nesting sites above resident American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), apparently to take advantage of the protection from mammalian nest predators that alligator presence offers. Previous research has shown that wading bird nesting colonies could provide substantial food for alligators in the form of dropped chicks. We compared alligator body condition in similar habitat with and without wading bird nesting colonies present. Alligator morphometric body condition indices were significantly higher in colony than in non-colony locations, an effect that was statistically independent of a range of environmental variables. Since colonially nesting birds and crocodilians co-occur in many tropical and subtropical wetlands, our results highlight a potentially widespread keystone process between two ecologically important species-groups. These findings suggest the interaction is highly beneficial for both groups of actors, and illustrate how selective pressures may have acted to form and reinforce a strongly positive ecological interaction.

AB  - During the last century, soils have been over-exploited by humans through agriculture and industrial development. The need to assess different aspects of soil degradation has become a priority in the soil protection management. Among several indices developed in the last years, QBS-ar (Soil Biological Quality-arthropod) index joins the biodiversity of soil microarthropods community with the degree of soil vulnerability. Up to now, numerous publications have reported the results of the QBS-ar application. This paper starts a review process for QBS-ar assessment by taking into account its potential in highlighting the relationship between soil quality and different land uses.
   In order to clarify the relationship between QBS-ar values and land use, we collected 41 published papers that reported of QBS-ar applications. In this framework, another aim of this paper is to make a critical review of the QBS-ar in respect to applications in different environmental contexts, and to obtain critical indication about problem and potential of QBS-ar for monitoring activities.
   We collected published data on QBS-ar and we individualized eight groupages in relation to soil uses: 1) Agriculture lands (A, several crops, till and no-tillage, organic, conventional), 2) Woods (W, forests, maquis and bushes), 3) Restored (R, plant remediation, restored pit mine, peri-urban uncultivated areas), 4) Natural degradation (ND, soils in natural degraded conditions, e.g. serpentine soils, soil in the briple), 5) Permanent grasslands, pastures and meadows (G), 6) Orchards (0), 7) Urban parks, residual urban woods, public gardens, botanical gardens, home gardens (UP), 8) Soils involved in human degradation (D).
   The results confirmed that land use significantly affects QBS-ar values. The overall mean of QBS-ar = 93.7 can be considered a tentative threshold that separates high quality soils and values which are typical for poor soils. In the end, we would like to affirm the validity of this index, which, allows to evaluate the suffering state of soils and its potentiality for an expeditious use to evaluate soil biological quality in recovery areas.

AB  - The aristeids Aristaeomorpha foliacea and Aristeus antennatus arc two species of great economic importance in the Mediterranean Sea, where they are exploited almost exclusively by bottom trawlers. We analysed their geographical and inter-annual patterns using data collected, following a standardized protocol. during the MEDITS international experimental bottom trawl surveys. The data used consisted of standardized abundance and biomass indices, size structure and individual biological information collected in the northern Mediterranean for more than two decades. Several univariate and multivariate methodologies were used to analyse the data. The current study confirms previous findings, such as the longitudinal gradient in the relative presence of the aristeids, but also offers additional information for a better understanding of the intrinsic variability of the data over the years and between areas. Moreover, geographical variability in the somatic condition index is discussed, taking into account the role of environmental conditions and fishing pressure. The large geographical variability found for both species in this regional approach reflects the importance of additional studies at a small-scale geographical level. Such studies could be particularly important for managing and ensuring the stability of these species, for which large regional approaches may be inadequate.

AB  - Abundance and biomass estimates are metrics usually taken for phytoplankton assays. Biomass is a proxy measure today in phytoplankton assays, while relative abundance is broadly used in diatoms investigations and application of ecological indexes. The question is how the two metrics respond to environmental conditions, based on diatoms species composition, in the plankton of lotic system, using the same statistical approach. The investigation was carried out based on monthly plankton sampling in four rivers during an annual cycle in southern Brazil. Relative abundance and relative biomass of diatoms showed distinct responses for each river, and the dominant species according to each metric were different. Relative abundance significantly correlated with seven of the eight physical and chemical variables, while relative biomass did not. Both metrics were appointed to the major diatom species of each river, but biomass showed low statistic robustness. The analysis with higher taxonomic rank (families) yielded more coherent outcomes between the metrics. The results showed that diatom relative abundance is effective to relate the composition to environmental conditions; therefore, the abundance should not be neglected in studies of phytoplankton structure and dynamics, mainly when the diatoms are dominant in the community, and the low taxonomic rank ecological indication is regarded.

AB  - Land use and land Cover are important determinants of the state of the natural environment. As a result, measures of land use and land cover change have been widely used as indicators of environmental condition and quality. This review explores the range of measures that have been applied in the UK at national, regional and local scales, and their sensitivity to particular drivers of change. The extent to which these indicators are important Properties in themselves or are surrogates for wider environmental qualities is considered.
   The discussion focuses on the evolving frameworks used to analyse the relationships between land use and the,,rate of the natural environment. The limitations and strengths of the DPSIR reporting and analytical framework are explored. Recent approaches to the assessment of the impacts of future land use change on the natural environment using model-based scenario methods are examined, and the need to develop new types of aggregate measure of land use function is identified. There is also a pressing need to link assessments of trends to the analysis of sustainability thresholds or limits. It is concluded that the concept of a socio-ecological system offers a more fruitful approach to the analysis of the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment than the simplistic cause-effect models that have been used in the past.

AB  - This study investigates conditions under which differentiating port fees based on vessels' environmental performance could be an additional driver for cruise-ship owners to invest in green technologies. Our case study on liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel for a cruise ship shows that port-based incentives could help reduce emissions to air and drive uptake of green technologies.
   Assuming an average rebate of EUR 1500 per port visit, the accumulated rebates globally for our case study ship exceed EUR 400,000 per year. Applying a rebate of nearly EUR 4800 per visit as currently offered in Norwegian ports, and assuming 50% of ports globally adopt the scheme, gives a cost benefit of EUR 700,000 per year, reducing the LNG technology payback time up to one year.
   Our case study also shows that significantly reducing ship emissions in ports will bring social benefits through reduced risks of loss of life, health and wellbeing.

AB  - Habitat use of introduced pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus in small European streams has received little study despite the species' potential associations to native fauna of conservation and angling amenity, e.g. brook lamprey Lampetra planeri, European bullhead Cottus gobio, brown trout Salmo trutta. We examined body size, relative body condition, habitat use and species-species associations of pumpkinseed with accompanying fishes in two small streams in southern England during August 2001. Pumpkinseed body condition decreased with pumpkinseed density; the latter correlated with % clay and % riparian grasses in fish < 63 mm FL, with % riparian shrubs in fish 83-92 mm FL and with water depth in fish > 92 mm FL. Most pumpkinseed size classes occurred more often than expected in stretches with conspecifics and with brown trout >300 mm FL; densities of the latter did not correlate with any habitat variables. Indeed, correlations between trout densities and habitat variables were observed mainly in smaller size classes. Habitat associations in other species corresponded to known levels of rheophily; substratum, channel slope, channel width and riparian trees were also important habitat variables. Pumpkinseed dispersal and establishment under conditions of climatic change, which could have ecological and management ramifications, are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the seasonal environmental characteristics for tropical cyclone genesis (TCG) over the Indian Ocean during the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability in the Year 2011 and the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) (CINDY2011/DYNAMO) field experiment and compare them with long-term climatological features. It was found that the spatial pattern of an empirical environmental index for TCG over the tropical Indian Ocean in 2011 is very similar to the feature composited over the years with high activity of MJO. The analyses of the contributions from each environmental factor indicated that relative humidity, absolute vorticity, and vertical velocity contribute to generate positive influences on the conditions for TCG in 2011. The influences of La Nina appear only through a shear effect over the Indian Ocean in 2011. Under the influences of active MJO events during the CINDY2011/DYNAMO period, the environmental conditions for TCG over the Indian Ocean are determined more strongly by MJO than by La Nina, through modifications of some environmental properties favorable for TCG. The environmental characteristics during CINDY2011/DYNAMO seem to be quite typical of the MJO active years; in such a case, the influences of El Nino/La Nina would not appear in determining the environmental conditions for TCG over the Indian Ocean.

AB  - In the ice-covered southeastern Hudson Bay (northern Quebec, Canada), marine fish exhibited 2 distinct reproduction strategies. Sand lance Ammodytes sp, and Arctic cod Boreogadus saida produced large numbers of small larvae that hatched before the ice break-up when the abundance of prey (copepod eggs and nauplii) was low, Feeding incidence was low and the larvae fed on relatively small prey. A morphometric index of condition suggested that the 2 species suffered from starvation at first feeding. This critical period was approximately synchronized with peak abundance of prey, possibly an adaptation to minimize starvation mortality, Stichaeidae and Cottidae produced small numbers of large larvae that fed efficiently on relatively large prey before yolk resorption. These larvae emerged after the ice break-up, when phytoplankton production was well under way and prey were abundant. Interannual variations in the timing between first feeding and the production of prey could influence recruitment in sand lance and Arctic cod but are unlikely to affect the early survival of Stichaeidae and Cottidae.
